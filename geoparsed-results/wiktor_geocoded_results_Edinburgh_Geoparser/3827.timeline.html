  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Valladolid</span> (/ˌvælədəˈliːdˌ -ˈlɪd/ or /ˌbɑːjədəˈliːd/, Spanish: [baʎaðoˈlið]) is a city in <span class="loc">Spain</span> and the de facto capital of the autonomous region of <span class="per">Castile</span> and <span class="per">Leon</span>. It has a population of 309,714 people (<span class="date">2013</span> est.), making it <span class="loc">Spain</span>'s 13th most populous municipality and northwestern <span class="loc">Spain</span>'s biggest city. <span class="loc">Its metropolitan</span> area ranks 20th in <span class="loc">Spain</span> with a population of 414,244 people in 23 municipalities.

It remained a small settlement until being re-established by <span class="per">King Alfonso VI</span> of <span class="per">Castile</span> as a <span class="org">Lordship for the Count</span> Pedro Ansúrez in <span class="date">1072</span>. It grew to prominence in the Middle Ages as the seat of the <span class="org">Court of Castile</span> and being endowed with fairs and different institutions as a collegiate church, University (<span class="date">1241</span>), <span class="loc">Royal Court</span> and Chancery and the Royal Mint. The Catholic Monarchs, <span class="per">Isabel I</span> of <span class="per">Castile</span> and <span class="per">Ferdinand II</span> of <span class="loc">Aragon</span>, married in <span class="loc">Valladolid</span> in <span class="date">1469</span> and established it as the capital of the Kingdom of <span class="per">Castile</span> and later of united <span class="loc">Spain</span>. <span class="per">Christopher Columbus</span> died in <span class="loc">Valladolid</span> in <span class="date">1506</span>, while authors <span class="per">Francisco de Quevedo</span> and <span class="per">Miguel de Cervantes</span> lived and worked in the city. The city was briefly the capital of <span class="loc">Habsburg</span> <span class="loc">Spain</span> under <span class="per">Phillip III</span> between <span class="date">1601</span> and <span class="date">1606</span>, before returning indefinitely to <span class="loc">Madrid</span>. The city then declined until the arrival of the railway in the 19th century, and with its industrialisation into the 20th century.</p><br><br>
