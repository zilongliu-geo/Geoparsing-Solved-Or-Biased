<p><span class="loc">Fullerton</span> is a city located in <span class="loc">northern Orange County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 135,161. <span class="loc">Fullerton</span> was founded in 1887. It secured the land on behalf of the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway. Historically it was a center of agriculture, notably groves of Valencia oranges and other citrus crops; petroleum extraction; transportation; and manufacturing. It is home to several higher educational institutions, notably <span class="loc">California</span> State University, <span class="loc">Fullerton</span> and <span class="loc">Fullerton</span> College. Evidence of prehistoric animal habitation, such as saber-toothed cats and mammoths, is present in Ralph B. Clark Regional Park in the northwest of the city. Europeans first passed through the area in 1769 when Gaspar de Portolà led a Spanish expedition north to <span class="loc">Monterey</span>. From the description recorded in the diary of Father Juan Crespi, it seems likely that the party camped on July 29 near present-day <span class="loc">Laguna Lake</span>, in the <span class="loc">Sunny Hills</span> area. After establishment of <span class="loc">Mission San Gabriel Arcangel</span> in 1771, the local Tongva people were dubbed "Gabrieliños" by the Spanish. In 1837, the <span class="loc">Fullerton</span> area became part of Rancho San Juan Cajón de <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span>, granted to Juan Pacifico Ontiveros, a Spanish soldier.</p>
