  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> is a city near the Southern <span class="loc">California</span> coast in Santa <span class="loc">Barbara County</span>. It is approximately 120 miles (190 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> (city limits). Its estimated <span class="date">2014</span> population was 103,410, making it the most populous city in the county and the Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, <span class="org">CA</span> Metro Area. The city is notable for its wine industry and Santa Maria-style barbecue. Sunset magazine called <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> "The West’s Best BBQ Town”. The <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> Valley, stretching from the <span class="loc">Santa Lucia Mountains</span> toward the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>, was the homeland of the Chumash people for several thousand <span class="date">years</span>. The Native Americans made their homes on the slopes of the surrounding hills among the oaks, on the banks of the <span class="loc">Santa Maria River</span> among the sycamores, and along the coast. They had unique plank-built boats, called <span class="loc">Tomol</span>, which they used for ocean fishing. In <span class="date">1769</span>, the Portolá Expedition passed through the <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> Valley during the first Spanish land exploration up the coast of <span class="loc">Las Californias</span> Province. <span class="loc">Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa</span> was established just north of the valley in <span class="date">1772</span>, and Mission La Purísima Concepción was established near present-day <span class="loc">Lompoc</span> in <span class="date">1787</span>. Rather than rich soil, white settlers were attracted here by the possibility of free land. In <span class="date">1821</span>, after the <span class="org">Mexican War of Independence</span>, the mission lands in <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> Valley were made available for private ownership under a Mexican land grant called <span class="per">Rancho Punta de Laguna</span>. At the end of the <span class="org">Mexican War</span> in <span class="date">1848</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> was ceded to the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p><br><br>
