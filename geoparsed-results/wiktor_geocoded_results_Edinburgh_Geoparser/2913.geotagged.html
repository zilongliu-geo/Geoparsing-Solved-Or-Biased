<p><span class="loc">Berlin</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Green Lake</span> and <span class="loc">Waushara counties</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. The population was 5,524 at the 2010 census. Of this, 5,435 were in Green <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, and only 89 were in <span class="loc">Waushara County</span>. The city is located mostly within the Town of <span class="loc">Berlin</span> in Green <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, with a small portion extending into the Town of Aurora in <span class="loc">Waushara County</span>. In 1845, Nathan H. Strong (1813–1852) became the first resident of what is today <span class="loc">Berlin</span>. He was joined by Hugh G. Martin, Hiram Barnes, and William Dickey. Their settlement was known as Strong's Landing. In 1848 a post office was established. It was named <span class="loc">Berlin</span> after the capital of <span class="loc">Prussia</span>, now the capital of <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The first school house was built in 1850 and the first church in 1851. <span class="loc">Berlin</span> was incorporated as a city in 1857. Area residents put the accent on the first syllable of Berlin /ˈbɜːrlɪn/ rather than on the second. It has been said that this was in reaction to the anti-German sentiment that swept across the <span class="loc">United States</span> during World War I, and that the accent was previously on the second syllable.</p>
