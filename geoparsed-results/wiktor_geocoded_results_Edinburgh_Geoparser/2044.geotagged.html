<p>Coronado, also known as <span class="loc">Coronado</span> Island (Spanish for "crowned one"), is a resort city located in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, across and around <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego Bay</span> from downtown <span class="loc">San Diego</span>. Its population was 24,697 at the 2010 census, up from 24,100 at the 2000 census. It is part of the San Diego-Carlsbad, <span class="loc">CA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Coronado lies on the geographic combination of an island and a tombolo connected to the mainland called the <span class="loc">Silver Strand</span>. Coronado is a tied island, connected by a tombolo. In 2012, Dr. Stephen Leatherman, Director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research, ranked Coronado Beach as the best beach in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Coronado is Spanish for "the crowned one", and thus it is nicknamed The <span class="loc">Crown City</span>. There have been three ships of the <span class="loc">United States</span> Navy named after the city, including the USS Coronado (LCS-4). The town of Coronado was incorporated on December 11, 1890. The land was purchased by Elisha Spurr <span class="loc">Babcock</span>, along with Hampton L. Story and Jacob Gruendike. Their intention was to create a resort community, and in 1886 the Coronado Beach Company was organized. By 1888 they had built the Hotel del Coronado and the city became a major resort destination. They also built a schoolhouse, and formed athletic, boating, and baseball clubs.</p>
