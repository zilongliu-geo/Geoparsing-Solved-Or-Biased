  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Thoroughbred horse racing has been cancelled indefinitely in <span class="org">the Australian</span> states of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> and <span class="loc">Queensland</span> due to an outbreak of Equine Influenza. An Australia-wide ban on the movement of horses, donkeys and mules which was due to expire on <span class="date">Wednesday</span> has been extended until <span class="date">Friday</span>. NSW and <span class="loc">Queensland</span> have extended their bans indefinitely. So far the virus only appears to have infected horses in NSW and <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, with 51 confirmed cases and another 400 suspected. So far all those infected appear to be horses used for recreational purposes and not thoroughbred race horses. Despite the bans on racing and horse movements, track work will recommence in NSW and <span class="loc">Queensland</span> <span class="date">today</span>. It had been feared <span class="date">yesterday</span> that four race horses at <span class="loc">Randwick Racecourse</span> in <span class="loc">Sydney</span> had been struck down by the virus, but the horses later tested negative to the virus. If an outbreak were to occur at <span class="loc">Randwick</span> it could affect up to 700 race horses stabled there. The outbreak comes at a bad time for the industry, as it prepares for the lucrative spring racing season in <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. The AUD$1 million <span class="per">Golden Rose</span> event at <span class="loc">Rosehill</span> has been cancelled, although it is expected that <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>'s spring racing carnival will resume on <span class="date">Saturday</span> as no cases of the flu have been seen in Victoria. Racing Victoria has also said the <span class="date">Melbourne Cup</span> will go ahead as planned despite the outbreak, even if no interstate or international horses can attend. Despite fines of up to $44,000 and <span class="date">12 months</span> imprisonment in NSW there have been reports that more than 100 horse owners have been caught moving their horses. The NSW Primary Industries Minister <span class="per">Ian Macdonald</span>, said it was "absolutely vital that no-one moves a horse in this state". "We will be working with police to ensure horses are at a standstill," he said. The racing bans have cost gaming companies <span class="per">Tabcorp</span> and <span class="per">Tattersall</span>'s millions, with <span class="per">Tabcorp</span> losing $65 million in revenue on <span class="date">the weekend</span>. <span class="per">Tabcorp</span> expects to lose around $150 million in turnover <span class="date">this week</span>. <span class="per">Tattersall</span>'s has also said it expects to lose around $2 million in revenue per week due to the outbreak. Investors reacted to the news, slashing 3 percent of the price of <span class="per">Tattersall</span>'s shares and over 4 percent of those of <span class="per">Tabcorp</span>.</p><br><br>
