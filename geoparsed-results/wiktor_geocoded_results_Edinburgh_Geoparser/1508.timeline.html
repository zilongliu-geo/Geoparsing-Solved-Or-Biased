  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Livingston</span> is an unincorporated community located in <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Once a thriving commercial center, <span class="loc">Livingston</span> was nearly deserted by the Civil War. Recent commercial and residential development has revived the lost community. In <span class="date">1829</span>, the county seat was moved from <span class="loc">Beatties Bluff</span> to <span class="loc">Livingston</span>. A courthouse and jail were built by <span class="date">1833</span>, and the town was incorporated in <span class="date">1836</span>. That same year, the county seat was officially moved to <span class="org">Canton</span>, though <span class="loc">Livingston</span> "unofficially" remained the county seat until <span class="date">1858</span>, because its courthouse continued to be used until <span class="date">that year</span>. <span class="loc">Livingston</span> became an important trading center for nearby plantations. <span class="per">A Methodist</span> church was established in <span class="loc">Livingston</span> around <span class="date">1830</span>, and there was a Masonic Lodge from <span class="date">1854</span> to <span class="date">1866</span>, when Union forces ransacked and destroyed it. By the 1850s, railways had been established across the county, and <span class="loc">Livingston</span> had been bypassed. Most of the town's residents moved and businesses shut down, though the post office remained until at least <span class="date">1902</span>. The only remains of the original town are a cemetery, and the foundation of the court square.</p><br><br>
