  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> (Arabic: بيت لحم‎  Bayt Laḥm ; "House of Meat", Bēt Laḥm; Hebrew: בֵּית לֶחֶם Bēṯ Leḥem, Modern: Bet Leḥem [bet ˈleχem], lit. "House of Bread"; Ancient Greek: Βηθλεέμ [bɛːtʰle.ém]; Latin: <span class="loc">Bethleem</span>) is a Palestinian city located in the central <span class="loc">West Bank</span>, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, about 10 km (6.2 miles) south of <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>. Its population is approximately 25,000 people. It is the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. The economy is primarily tourist-driven. The earliest known mention of the city was in the Amarna correspondence of 1350-1330 BCE during its habitation by the Canaanites. The Hebrew Bible, which says that the <span class="loc">city of Bethlehem</span> was built up as a fortified city by Rehoboam, identifies it as the city David was from and where he was crowned as the king of <span class="loc">Israel</span>. The New Testament identifies <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> as the birthplace of Jesus. <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> was destroyed by the Emperor Hadrian during the second-century Bar Kokhba revolt; its rebuilding was promoted by <span class="per">Empress Helena</span>, mother of Constantine the Great, who commissioned the building of its great <span class="org">Church of the Nativity</span> in 327 CE. The church was badly damaged by the Samaritans, who sacked it during a revolt in 529, but was rebuilt <span class="date">a century later</span> by Emperor Justinian I.</p><br><br>
