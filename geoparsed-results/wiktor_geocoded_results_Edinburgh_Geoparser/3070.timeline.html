  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Trenton is an unincorporated community in Jackson Township, <span class="loc">Blackford County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. Nearly all of the community's businesses have been closed for <span class="date">many years</span>. Although the <span class="org">Blackford County Historical Society</span> lists this community as a ghost town, homes are still maintained in the area, and it is still listed as a populated place by the <span class="per">U.S. Geological</span> Survey. Trenton is located east of <span class="loc">Hartford City</span> on <span class="loc">Indiana</span> State Road 26. Platted in <span class="date">1845</span>, it is one of the older communities in <span class="loc">Blackford County</span>. The community had its own Post Office from <span class="date">1856</span> until <span class="date">1907</span>. Because there was another Trenton in <span class="loc">Randolph County</span> during the 19th century, <span class="loc">Blackford County</span>’s Trenton post office used the name <span class="loc">Priam</span>. Therefore, many older maps show the community as "Priam" instead of Trenton. Trenton participated in the <span class="loc">Indiana</span> Gas Boom, and had two of <span class="loc">Blackford County</span>'s many gas companies (Marion Creek Natural Gas Company and <span class="org">Trenton Natural Gas Company</span>) that existed during the 1890s. The Gas Boom gradually ended during the beginning of the 20th century, and many small communities never recovered. During <span class="date">the next few decades</span>, the quality of automobiles and roads improved — indirectly contributing to the decline of many small communities as consumers drove to larger cities.</p><br><br>
