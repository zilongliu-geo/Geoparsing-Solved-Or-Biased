It is located on a bend in the <span class="loc">Wern</span>, a tributary of the Main, on the edge of the plateau above the river. Its highest point is at 337.20 m of elevation, its lowest at 212.50 m. The total area of the municipality is 73.65 km², of which approximately 9 km² are wooded. <span class="loc">Werneck</span> includes the following divisions: <span class="loc">Eckartshausen</span> <span class="loc">Egenhausen</span> <span class="loc">Ettleben</span> Eßleben Mühlhausen <span class="loc">Rundelshausen</span> <span class="loc">Schleerieth</span> <span class="loc">Schnackenwerth</span> <span class="loc">Schraudenbach</span> <span class="loc">Stettbach</span> Vasbühl Werneck Zeuzleben The first written record of <span class="loc">Werneck</span> is dated 10 August 1223, as a fief granted by <span class="loc">Bodo</span> of <span class="loc">Ravensburg</span>, confirmed by the Pope on 9 April 1223. Between 1224 and 1250, possession of the fief was shared between first the Teutonic Knights and later Conrad of Reichenberg and Conrad of <span class="loc">Schmiedefeld</span>, until it finally passed to the Bishopric of Würzburg. A fort located there was sacked in the Peasants' War in 1525 and then seized and burnt down by Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach in 1553. It was rebuilt in 1601 under Prince Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, but was again destroyed by fire in 1723 and merely patched up in 1724.</p>
