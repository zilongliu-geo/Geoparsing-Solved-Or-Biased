<p><span class="loc">City of Toledo</span> (Cebuano: Dakbayan sa <span class="loc">Toledo</span>; Filipino: Lungsod ng <span class="loc">Toledo</span>), formerly known as Pueblo Hinulawan is a third income class component city in the <span class="loc">province of Cebu</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 157,078. In the 2013 election, it had 98,557 registered voters. <span class="loc">Toledo</span> became a chartered city on 18 June 1960 under Republic Act No. 2688. <span class="loc">Toledo</span> is about 50 kilometres (31 mi) away from <span class="loc">Cebu City</span> and is widely known for its huge mining industry owned by Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation, which is the umbrella of Carmen Copper Corporation and its Toledo Mine. <span class="loc">Toledo City</span> comprises 38 barangays: <span class="loc">Toledo City</span> came from Old Hinulawan (now called <span class="loc">Daanglungsod</span>) and New Hinulawan. On June 3, 1863 a series of earthquakes shook Hinulawan. The first tremor toppled the newly built school, leveled several houses to the ground, and caused the church fa√ßade to collapse. It caused injuries and fatalities. The quake that followed brought greater damage: complete destruction of the church and the convent; cracking of the lowlands in all directions; crumbling of the stone walls along the Hinulawan river bank; and sagging of the ground, causing water from the sea and the river to flood the settlement to waist level.</p>
