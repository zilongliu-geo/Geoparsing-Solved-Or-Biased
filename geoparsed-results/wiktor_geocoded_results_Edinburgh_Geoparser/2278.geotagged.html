<p><span class="loc">Grant County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 7,445. The county seat is <span class="loc">Canyon City</span>. It is named for President Ulysses S. Grant, who served as an army officer in the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Territory, and at the time of the county's creation was a Union general in the American Civil War. <span class="loc">Grant County</span> is included in the 8 county definition of Eastern <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. <span class="loc">Grant County</span> was established on October 14, 1864, from parts of old <span class="loc">Wasco</span> and old <span class="loc">Umatilla counties</span>. Prior to its creation, cases brought to court were tried in The <span class="loc">Dalles</span>, county seat of the vast <span class="loc">Wasco County</span>. The great distance to The <span class="loc">Dalles</span> made law enforcement a difficult problem, and imposed a heavy burden on citizens who had a need to transact business at the courthouse. In 1889, more than half of the southern part of the original <span class="loc">Grant County</span> was taken to form <span class="loc">Harney County</span>. Also in 1899, a small part of northwestern <span class="loc">Grant County</span> was taken (along with parts of Crook and Gilliam counties) to form <span class="loc">Wheeler County</span>.</p>
