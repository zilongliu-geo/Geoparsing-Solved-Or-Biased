According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, <span class="loc">Elgin</span> has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated "BSk" on climate maps. The train station sequence in the <span class="date">1955</span> film classic Oklahoma!, with <span class="per">Gene Nelson</span> singing and dancing the song "<span class="loc">Kansas City</span>" partly atop a moving train, was filmed in <span class="loc">Elgin</span>, and the railroad scenes in the <span class="date">1957</span> western 3:10 to <span class="loc">Yuma</span>, with <span class="per">Glenn Ford</span> and <span class="per">Van Heflin</span>, were filmed in <span class="loc">Elgin</span>. <span class="loc">Elgin</span> is the first location in <span class="loc">Arizona</span> to engage in commercial scale winemaking. In <span class="date">the 1970s</span>, <span class="per">Gordon Dutt</span>, Ph.D., a soil scientist from the <span class="org">University of Arizona</span>, was intrigued with the similarity between the soil of the Elgin-Sonoita area and that of <span class="loc">Burgundy</span>, <span class="loc">France</span>. In partnership with <span class="per">A. Blake Brophy</span>, he developed an experimental winery that later developed into the Sonoita Vineyards and that encouraged other vineyards in the area. Presently, growers in the area produce <span class="loc">Chardonnay</span>, Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Mission, and Syrah grapes. There are presently (<span class="date">2009</span>) nine vineyards in the region, producing about 50,000 gallons of wine yearly.</p><br><br>
