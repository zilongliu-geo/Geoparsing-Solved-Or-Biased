<p>Alma is a city in <span class="loc">Harlan County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,133 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Harlan County</span>. Alma was founded in the spring of 1871 by a group of Union Pacific railroad laborers originally from Cheyenne, <span class="loc">Wyoming</span>. <span class="loc">Harlan County</span> was created by the <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> Legislature on June 3, 1871, and Alma was made the county seat on July 3, 1871. A dispute among the original settlers led to a dissolution of the town, but it was re-organized in 1874. Alma's status as county seat was challenged by residents of <span class="loc">Orleans</span>, but an 1884 <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> decision affirmed Alma's status as seat of <span class="loc">Harlan County</span>. Alma officially incorporated in July 1881. The town was named after a daughter of one of the early settlers. On January 13, 1880, the Burlington Railroad reached Alma, providing a significant boost for local commerce and industry. In 1887, the <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> and <span class="loc">Omaha Railroad</span> also reached Alma. Telephone service reached Alma in June 1899. Electricity arrived with a steam power plant in 1906 and water service followed in 1907.</p>
