<p>Salina is an island in the <span class="loc">Aeolian</span> Islands (Italian: <span class="loc">Isole Eolie</span>, Sicilian: ÃŒsuli Eoli) north of <span class="loc">Sicily</span>, southern <span class="loc">Italy</span>. It is the second largest island in the archipelago. Salina is divided between three comuni: Santa Marina on the eastern coast, <span class="loc">Malfa</span> to the north, and <span class="loc">Leni</span> to the south-west. From <span class="loc">Leni</span> down towards the sea is the village of <span class="loc">Rinella</span>, <span class="loc">Sicily</span>. Above the village of <span class="loc">Leni</span> is Valdichiesa in the center of the island. The other smaller villages are <span class="loc">Capo Faro</span>, <span class="loc">Pollara</span> and <span class="loc">Lingua</span>. There are currently approximately 4,000 residents living on the island. Salina has a total surface area of 27 km2 (10 sq mi). It is included on the World Heritage List especially because of its worth for vulcanology. It is composed of six volcanoes: the oldest ones are at Pizzo di <span class="loc">Corvo</span>, Monte Rivi and close to <span class="loc">Capo Faro</span>, although these are barely recognisable from a morphological point of view, while the volcano-layer of Monte Fossa delle Felci at 968 m (3,176 ft) is the highest peak in the archipelago and Monte dei Porri 886 m (2,907 ft) are both almost perfectly preserved. A lower crater lies just above sea level near the small village of <span class="loc">Pollara</span>,on the north west corner of the island, half of which has fallen into the sea.</p>
