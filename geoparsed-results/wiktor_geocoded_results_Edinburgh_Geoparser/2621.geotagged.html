<p><span class="loc">La Junta</span> is the Home Rule Municipality that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of <span class="loc">Otero County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city population was 7,077 at the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. <span class="loc">La Junta</span> is located on the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River in southeastern <span class="loc">Colorado</span> east of Pueblo. <span class="loc">La Junta</span> (Spanish for "the junction") rests at the intersection of the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail with the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River. The town developed near Bent's Post, a fur trading post of the 19th century. During World War II, <span class="loc">La Junta</span> had an Army Air Force Training Base outside town. An Air Force detachment of the Strategic Air Command remained there until modern flight simulators developed in the 1980s rendered live flight unnecessary for pilot training maneuvers. At least one military aircraft crashed close by during such training maneuvers. The airport, located 5 miles (8.0 km) north of <span class="loc">La Junta</span>, has 77 acres (31 ha) of tarmac and two runways which are still in use. One runway (east-west) is 6,851 feet (2,088 m) long and the other is 5,800 feet (1,800 m). [2].</p>
