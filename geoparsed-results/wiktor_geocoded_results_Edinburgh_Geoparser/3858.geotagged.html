<p><span class="loc">Sion</span> (French pronunciation: ​[sjɔ̃]; German: Sitten pronounced [zɪtən]; Italian: Seduno; Latin Sedunum) is the capital of the Swiss canton of Valais. As of December 2014 it had a population of 33,296. On 17 January 1968 the former municipality of <span class="loc">Bramois</span> merged into the municipality of <span class="loc">Sion</span>. On 1 January 2013 the former municipality of <span class="loc">Salins</span> merged into the municipality of <span class="loc">Sion</span>. Landmarks include the Basilique de Valère and Château de Tourbillon. <span class="loc">Sion</span> has an airfield for civilian and military use which serves as a base for countless life-saving air rescue missions. <span class="loc">Sion</span> is one of the most important pre-historic sites in <span class="loc">Europe</span>. The alluvial fan of <span class="loc">Sionne</span>, the rocky slopes above the river and, to a lesser extent, Valeria and Tourbillon hills have been settled nearly continuously since antiquity. The oldest trace of human settlement comes from 6200 BC during the late Mesolithic. Around 5800 BC early Neolithic farmers from the Mediterranean settled in <span class="loc">Sion</span>. The settlements remained small until about 4500 BC, during the middle Neolithic, when the number of settlements increased sharply. To support the population increase, farming and grazing spread throughout the valley. They also began burying their dead in Chablandes-type stone burial cists with engraved anthropomorphic stelae. The individual graves changed at the beginning of the third Millennium BC in large, dry stone wall communal tombs (such as the Dolmen of Le Petit-Chasseur). During the Beaker culture period in the second half of the third Millennium, dolmens were built once again, but they were smaller and had no podium. Stelae continued to be carved, though these were rich with geometric patterns and sometimes built out of old dolmen. At the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (around 2300 BC) the last stelae were erected.</p>
