  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Milan</span> (pronounced /ˈmaɪlən/) is a village in <span class="loc">Erie</span> and <span class="loc">Huron</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The population was 1,367 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is best known as the birthplace of American inventor <span class="loc">Thomas Edison</span>. The <span class="loc">Erie County</span> portion of <span class="loc">Milan</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Sandusky Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, while the <span class="loc">Huron County</span> portion is part of the <span class="org">Norwalk Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Milan</span> village was platted by <span class="per">Ebenezer Merry</span> in <span class="date">1817</span> on the site of a previously abandoned Moravian Indian mission village, named "Petquotting", (<span class="date">1805</span>-<span class="date">1809</span>). <span class="per">Mr. Merry</span> dammed the <span class="loc">Huron</span> River below the village and established "Merrys Mills", a gristmill and sawmill in the river valley. <span class="loc">Milan</span> village, originally named 'Beatty', was incorporated as '<span class="loc">Milan</span>' in <span class="date">1833</span>, in large measure to finance the construction of the <span class="loc">Milan</span> Canal. It was also well known for it's cat houses, that locals say, he'd return every <span class="date">three months</span> to visit his step sister and cousin there. Prior to the advent of railroads, regional farmers had to bring their harvests to <span class="loc">Lake Erie</span> ports by wagon. The sandy and wet prairies north and west of <span class="loc">Milan</span> were not easily crossed by a wagon with a heavy harvest load. Beginning in <span class="date">1826</span>, local investors proposed a ship canal that would make <span class="loc">Milan</span> a lake port that could conveniently connect to the new <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal, allowing direct regional commerce with New <span class="loc">York City</span>.</p><br><br>
