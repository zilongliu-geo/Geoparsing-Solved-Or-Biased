  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Howard County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, with its southern border made by the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 10,144. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Fayette</span>. The county was organized <span class="date">January 23, 1816</span> and named for <span class="per">Benjamin Howard</span>, the first Governor of the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Territory. On the north bank of the <span class="loc">Missouri River</span>, <span class="loc">Howard County</span> was settled primarily by migrants from the Upper Southern states of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> and Virginia. They brought slaves and slaveholding traditions with them, and quickly started cultivating commodity crops similar to those in Middle <span class="per">Tennessee</span> and <span class="per">Kentucky</span>: hemp and tobacco. <span class="per">Howard</span> was one of several counties settled mostly by Southerners along the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River in the central part of the state. Given their culture and traditions, this area became known as <span class="loc">Little Dixie</span> and <span class="loc">Howard County</span> was at its heart. Following the <span class="date">1848</span> revolutions in <span class="loc">Germany</span>, many German immigrants also settled in this area. Due to the reliance on slave labor, in <span class="date">1860</span> slaves made up 25 percent or more of the county's population. <span class="loc">Howard County</span> residents generally supported the Confederacy during the Civil War. After Reconstruction, whites imposed Jim Crow laws and segregation. There were five lynchings between <span class="date">1891</span> and <span class="date">1914</span>: all the victims—Olli <span class="per">Truxton, Frank</span> <span class="per">Embree, Thomas Hayden</span>, <span class="per">Arthur McNeal</span>, and <span class="per">Dallas Shields—were African-American</span> men. The rate of lynchings of blacks was higher in the Deep South, during what is considered the nadir of <span class="loc">United States</span> race relations.</p><br><br>
