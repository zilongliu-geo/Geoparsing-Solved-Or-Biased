<p><span class="loc">Perekop</span> (Ukrainian: Перекоп; Russian: Перекоп; Crimean Tatar: Or Qapı; Greek: Τάφρος ) is an urban-type settlement located on the <span class="loc">Perekop Isthmus</span> connecting the Crimean peninsula to the Ukrainian mainland. It is known for the Fortress Or <span class="loc">Qapi</span> that served as the gateway to <span class="loc">Crimea</span>. The village currently is part of Armyansk Municipality. Population: 919 (2014 Census). The original name was of the Greek settlement of Taphros which means a dug-out locality. Thereafter was the equivalent name of Or Qapı in the Crimean Tatar language meaning Or - trench and Qapı - gate, and subsequently the name <span class="loc">Perekop</span> in the <span class="loc">Slavic</span> languages which literally means an over-dug locality. Due to its key position, over the history <span class="loc">Perekop</span> was under many sieges. During the Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739), Russian Field Marshal Burkhard Christoph von Munnich successfully stormed the fortifications on June 17, 1736 and left the Tatar fortress in ruins. This was a serious, if not mortal, blow to the independence of the Crimean Khanate. The town was virtually wiped out during the Siege of <span class="loc">Perekop</span> by the Red Army in 1920. The siege was a key episode of the Russian Civil War. The success of the Bolsheviks allowed them to oust Pyotr Wrangel's White Army from the <span class="loc">Crimea</span>. Twelve years later, the Soviets founded the new town of Krasnoperekopsk 32 km (20 mi) to the south.</p>
