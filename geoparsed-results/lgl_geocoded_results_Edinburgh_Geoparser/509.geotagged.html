<p>Councilwoman arrested after incident at mayor's home. Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. <span class="loc">NEW MIAMI</span> â€” After a year of relative order, the village of <span class="loc">New Miami</span> is reeling again after a recently-resigned council member was arrested following an incident at the mayor's residence. Patricia Moore, 62, of the 100 block of Howman Avenue, was arrested at her home Wednesday afternoon, March, 25, and charged with criminal trespass and aggravated menacing, according to the Butler County Sheriff's Office. Moore allegedly tried to push her way into the home of <span class="loc">New Miami</span> Mayor Patti Hanes, according to police records. <span class="loc">Hanes</span>, 41, also of Howman Avenue, provided a statement to <span class="loc">Butler County</span> deputies indicating Moore was trying to gain entry to cause her physical harm. Moore was taken to the <span class="loc">Butler County</span> Jail where she was later released on her own recognizance. According to the narrative of her arrest, when deputies arrived at her home Moore held out her hands and said, "I did it all and let it be noted when I get out I will find her and kick her ..." Moore was among those who took the oath of office in January 2008 to fill several vacant positions on the village council. Moore said she resigned from her position a few weeks ago because of "personal problems with the mayor." Moore said her family is intertwined with that of <span class="loc">Hanes</span>, but declined to comment further about the situation. <span class="loc">Hanes</span> also declined to comment about the incident. She said council is reviewing candidates to fill the seat vacated by Moore. Moore is scheduled to appear April 9 in Hamilton Municipal Court.</p>
