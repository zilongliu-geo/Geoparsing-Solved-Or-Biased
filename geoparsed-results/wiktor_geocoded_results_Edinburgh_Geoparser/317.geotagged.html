<p>Wellington is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Collingsworth County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,189 at the 2010 census. Sometime in 1889 or 1890, as smaller ranches and farmlands were being purchased, Ernest Theodore O'Neil, his brother-in-law John Simon McConnell, and John W. Swearingen, together had purchased the land upon which the town currently sits, for $5.00 per acre. Subsequently, O'Neil, who originally owned a fourth of the section of the township, purchased the interests of <span class="loc">McConnell</span> and <span class="loc">Swearingen</span>, and retained sole ownership of the land. The 1890 census showed 357 inhabitants across the county, with 89 ranches and farms and 335 acres (1.36 km2) of land in cultivation. In August 1890, a petition was circulated to organize the county, choose a county seat, and elect county officers. Two potential townships were proposed: Wellington and Pearl. The proposed town of Wellington was located on the land owned by Ernest T. O'Neil who was promoting this location, and had been given its proposed name by his wife, Matilda Anna Elisabeth "Lizzie" O'Neil, who greatly admired the Duke of Wellington, hero of the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. The alternate and proposed town of Pearl was located several miles north of Wellington.</p>
