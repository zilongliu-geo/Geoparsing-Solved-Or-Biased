  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="date">11 Years</span> for 1 Life. The verdict is in and the jurors have had their say. All that’s left is the actual sentencing of <span class="per">Ethan Parrish</span>, the man who stands convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of <span class="org">Powhatan High School</span> student Tahliek Taliaferro. What do you think of the 11-year sentencing recommendation? What about the involuntary manslaughter charge, which was reduced from first-degree murder (and a life-imprisonment sentence)? Do you think <span class="date">last summer</span>’s shooting death of 18-year-old Taliaferro was cold-blooded murder or simply the scare tactics of a couple of young men gone terribly wrong? Was justice served in <span class="loc">Powhatan County</span> <span class="date">today</span>? Leave your reaction in the comments section below.</p><br><br>
