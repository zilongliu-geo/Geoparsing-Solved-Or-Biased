  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kelso</span> is located in the uMdoni Coast region of <span class="loc">South Africa</span> facing the <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span>. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> is located 65 kilometers south of <span class="loc">Durban</span>, the largest city in KwaZulu-Natal. <span class="per">Henry Cooke</span>, one of the original mid-nineteenth century Byrne settlers, named the South African coastal village after the town of <span class="loc">Kelso</span> on the <span class="loc">Tweed River</span> in <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. Before modern transportation, the village of <span class="loc">Kelso</span> served as an important link in the transportation of sugar. Vessels launched on the <span class="loc">Umzinto River</span> could take their cargo out to the larger ships anchored at sea, off the river mouth. The <span class="loc">Umzinto River</span>, which borders its southern side was the site of a mini gold rush during the 1860s. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> is known for its excellent golden beaches and waves that provide great conditions for kitesurfing and surfing. Several competitions take place here annually, including hosting part of the South Coast Surf Carnival. Fishing at sea is also a popular activity. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> is served by the railway from <span class="loc">Port Shepstone</span> to <span class="loc">Durban</span> and had a branch to <span class="loc">Umzinto</span>, connecting to the <span class="loc">Umzinto</span> - <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> narrow gauge railway until its closure in <span class="date">1987</span>.</p><br><br>
