<p>Paul (Cornish: Breweni) is a village in <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. It is in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Penzance</span>. The village is two miles (3 km) south of <span class="loc">Penzance</span> and one mile (1.6 km) south of <span class="loc">Newlyn</span>. The village of Paul should not be confused with the civil <span class="loc">parish of Paul</span>, which lies west of the village and does not include the village of Paul. Like many Cornish communities Paul has its own community celebration. Paul Feast is held on the Sunday nearest 10 October every year when the village is decorated and a civic service takes place on the Sunday of the feast itself led by the Mayor of <span class="loc">Penzance</span>. Much of the history of Paul is connected with its parish church. The church itself is said to have been founded in 490, a very uncertain date and not documented, by Paul Aurelian, a Welsh saint known in Brittany as Paol Aurelian in <span class="loc">Breton</span>. There is no historical evidence to support his ever coming to West Penwith. He was founder of the cathedral at Saint-Pol-de-LÃ©on, the city named after him. However this church could have been dedicated to Paul the Apostle, or Paulinus of <span class="loc">York</span>, there is no documentary evidence to prove any of these three <span class="loc">Saint Pauls</span> was the original dedicatee of the church. It was only named 'St. Pol-de-Leon' in 1907 and is probably connected with Henry Jenner who (with W C Borlase) opposed alleged 'Englishness' and stamp consistent spelling of Cornish place names on OS maps.</p>
