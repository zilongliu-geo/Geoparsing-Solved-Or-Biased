  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Limbe</span> (<span class="date">1858</span>–<span class="date">1982</span>: Victoria; also spelled Limbé) is a seaside city in the South-West Region of <span class="loc">Cameroon</span>. <span class="loc">Limbe</span> was founded in <span class="date">1858</span> on the southern slopes of Mount <span class="loc">Cameroon</span> by the British missionary <span class="per">Alfred Saker</span>. At the <span class="date">2005</span> Census, the population was 84,223. Victoria was founded by the British missionary <span class="per">Alfred Saker</span> of the Baptist Missionary Society of <span class="loc">London</span> in <span class="date">June 1858</span>. Due to this treaty, initially Victoria and its vicinity was not part of the new German colony <span class="loc">Kamerun</span> and remained under British administration. On <span class="date">May 7, 1886</span> <span class="loc">Great Britain</span> and <span class="loc">Germany</span> agreed to exchange Victoria and its vicinity for German rights at the <span class="loc">Forcados River</span> in <span class="loc">Nigeria</span> and <span class="date">St. Lucia</span> in <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. On <span class="date">March 28, 1887</span> Victoria and its vicinity were handed over to the German administration. At the same time Swiss Presbyterian missionaries bought the land from the Baptist Missionary Society in <span class="date">1887</span>. Victoria became British again in <span class="date">1915</span>. In <span class="date">1982</span> Victoria was renamed and is since then known as <span class="loc">Limbe</span>. <span class="loc">Limbe</span> is located on a beautiful bay against the backdrop of a major mountain range. Black sand beaches make <span class="loc">Limbe</span> one of two coastal towns (Kribi being the other) that are popular among Western tourists. The <span class="org">Limbe Wildlife Centre and Limbe Botanical Gardens</span> are notable attractions. The Germans left a Bismarck tower in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Limbe</span>. <span class="loc">Limbe</span> is considered a good region in the country in terms of night life, and is considered a good tourist city in the country to visit. It is the home to the Bakweri people.</p><br><br>
