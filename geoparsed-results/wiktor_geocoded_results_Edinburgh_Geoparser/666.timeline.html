  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Dallas County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 36,361 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Founded in <span class="date">1852</span> as a frontier post, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is one of <span class="loc">Dallas County</span>'s earliest settlements. <span class="date">Today</span>, it is a suburban community located in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, approximately 15 miles (24 km) south of Downtown Dallas. <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is part of the Best Southwest area, which includes <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, <span class="loc">Cedar Hill</span>, <span class="loc">DeSoto</span>, and <span class="loc">Duncanville</span>. In <span class="date">1841</span>, an act of the Republic of <span class="loc">Texas</span> Congress authorized President <span class="per">Mirabeau Lamar</span> to enter into a contract with <span class="per">William S. Peters</span> and nineteen associates to promote settlement in <span class="loc">North Texas</span> and paid the company with free land in exchange for recruiting new settlers. Around 600 families would settle in what became known as <span class="per">Peters</span> Colony from <span class="date">1841</span> through <span class="date">1844</span>. The <span class="per">Peters</span>' group advertised heavily in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, and <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, and for that reason, many of the earliest settlers were from those states. The first group to settle in the <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> area was <span class="per">Roderick Rawlins</span> and his family from <span class="loc">Greene County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. They left for <span class="loc">Texas</span> in <span class="date">September 1844</span>. <span class="per">Rawlins</span> and two of his sons-in-law came ahead to select the general area where they would settle. They chose an uninhabited area south of Dallas along the north bank of <span class="loc">Ten Mile Creek</span> as the site of their new settlement. In <span class="date">December 1844</span>, the three men went back to <span class="loc">Lamar County</span> near the <span class="loc">Red River</span> to bring the rest of their wagon train. All of the settlers had arrived by <span class="date">January 2, 1845</span> and they formed a community known as <span class="loc">Hardscrabble</span>. It consisted of two rows of log cabins with a street running north and south. In total, 30 men, women, and children lived in <span class="loc">Hardscrabble</span>.</p><br><br>
