<p><span class="loc">Caldera</span> is a port city and commune in the <span class="loc">Copiap贸 Province</span> of the <span class="loc">Atacama Region</span> in northern <span class="loc">Chile</span>. It has an excellent harbor, protected by breakwaters, being the port city for the productive mining district centering on Copiap贸 to which it is connected by the first railroad constructed in <span class="loc">Chile</span>. <span class="loc">Caldera</span> lies about 75 km (47 mi) west of Copiap贸 at the Pacific. The climate is mostly warm and extremely dry, because of its location on the Atacama desert's coast. But the temperatures are moderated by the cooling sea currents. However, lately the climate has become colder due to the climatic change. The commune spans an area of 4,666.6 km2 (1,802 sq mi). In 1687, Englishman Edward Davis reached the <span class="loc">Playa</span> <span class="loc">Bahia Inglesa</span> 6 km (4 mi) south of <span class="loc">Caldera</span>. In 1840, William Wheelwright of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company visited the region of <span class="loc">Caldera</span>. On his proposal the first railway was created in the year of 1851 from <span class="loc">Caldera</span> to Copiap贸. Its inauguration was on Christmas Day in 1851. <span class="loc">Caldera</span> became an important port for the exportation of minerals. The city itself was officially founded on 23 September 1850.</p>
