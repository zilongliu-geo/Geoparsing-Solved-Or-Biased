<p><span class="loc">Dover</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Loudoun County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. <span class="loc">Dover</span> is located east of <span class="loc">Middleburg</span> at the intersection of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 50, Champe Ford Road (SR 629 south), and Cobb House Road (SR 629 north). The <span class="loc">Little River</span> begins following Route 50 at this point. <span class="loc">Dover</span> as a geographical entity is somewhat exaggerated, seeing as the bend in Route 50 it refers to consists of only few houses, but it has a long pedigree as a named area, appearing on state and national maps. Most likely, it understanding as a geographical entity stems from the fact that the <span class="loc">Little River</span> Turnpike (first toll road in <span class="loc">America</span>) and Aldie-Ashby's Gap Turnpike terminated approximately together here, 1.3 miles west of <span class="loc">Aldie</span>. There are four <span class="loc">Virginia</span> historical markers at the site, commemorating John Champe, Revolutionary War Hero, and three Civil War markers, including one mentioning the Battle of <span class="loc">Aldie</span>. Its two distinguishing features are Stoke (a prominent house where Teddy Roosevelt was a frequent guest) and the Champe Ford Memorial (an obelisk commemorating John Champe, handpicked by <span class="loc">George Washington</span> to re-capture Benedict Arnold after his defection to the British side. He came very close to succeeding, but at the last moment, Arnold changed plans and the whole endeavor had to be called off. His house was at the crossing of the <span class="loc">Little River</span> where the monument stands today, but the house itself had collapsed (according to Col. Harris of Stoke) "sometime in the [19]20s." He only realized when reading an old journal that one of his old buildings had to have been Champe's residence.</p>
