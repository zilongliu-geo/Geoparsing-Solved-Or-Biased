  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Miranda is a suburb in southern <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Miranda is 24 kilometres south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district, in the <span class="loc">Sutherland Shire</span>. Miranda has a mixture of low, medium and high density residential and is known as a commercial centre for the southern suburbs. The Westfield Miranda shopping centre attracts many shoppers from the <span class="loc">Sutherland Shire</span>, the <span class="loc">St George</span> area and as far away as <span class="loc">Wollongong</span>. <span class="per">Thomas Holt</span> (<span class="date">1811</span>–88) owned the land that stretched from <span class="loc">Sutherland</span> to <span class="loc">Cronulla</span>. <span class="per">James Murphy</span>, the manager of the Holt estate named the area after Miranda, a character in the <span class="per">William Shakespeare</span> play The Tempest. In a <span class="date">1921</span> letter, <span class="per">James Murphy</span> said "the name Miranda was given to the locality by me as manager of the <span class="org">Holt Sutherland Company</span> which I formed in <span class="date">1881</span>. I thought it a soft, euphonious, musical and appropriate name for a beautiful place." It is believed that the character in the play was named after <span class="loc">Miranda de Ebro</span>, a town in <span class="loc">Spain</span>. Early Australian explorer <span class="per">Gregory Blaxland</span> was promised a significant parcel of land in the area as a reward for discovering a passage through the <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span>. He had not selected his parcel by <span class="date">1816</span>, when he chose to sell that promise to <span class="per">John Connell</span> for £250. However, in <span class="date">1831</span> he also selected a parcel of land and claimed it under the original promise of reward, at which <span class="per">Connell</span> stepped forward to claim the land. The matter was taken to court, where <span class="per">Connell</span> was recognised as the owner.</p><br><br>
