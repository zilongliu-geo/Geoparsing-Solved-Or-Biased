<p><span class="loc">Ensenada</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [enseˈnaða]) is a coastal city in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, the third-largest in <span class="loc">Baja California</span>. Lying 125 kilometres (78 mi) south of <span class="loc">San Diego</span> on the <span class="loc">Baja California</span> Peninsula, it is locally referred to as La Cenicienta del Pacífico, "The <span class="loc">Cinderella</span> of the Pacific." One of the first settlements founded in the Californias, <span class="loc">Ensenada</span> has emerged as a cruise ship destination, aerospace center, and there is a nearby region to the north east where wine grapes are grown. It is said that the first Vitis vinifera made it to the region's San Ignacio Mission in 1703, when Jesuit Padre Juan de Ugarte planted the first vineyards there. Situated on the coastline of Bahía de Todos Santos—an inlet of the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> on the peninsula's Gold Coast—the Port of <span class="loc">Ensenada</span> is an important commercial, fishing, and tourist port. The city is home to a navy base, army base, and Ensenada Airport, a military airfield which doubles as an airport of entry into <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. <span class="loc">Ensenada</span> is the municipal seat and cultural and commercial center of Ensenada Municipality, one of five into which the state is divided. As of 2015, the <span class="loc">city of Ensenada</span> had a population of 519,813.</p>
