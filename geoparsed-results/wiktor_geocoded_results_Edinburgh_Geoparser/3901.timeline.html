  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Samar</span> (/ˈsɑːmɑːr/ SAH-mar) is an island in the <span class="loc">Visayas</span>, within central <span class="loc">Philippines</span> and the third largest island in the country. The island is divided into three provinces: <span class="loc">Samar province</span> (the western two-fifths of the island of <span class="loc">Samar</span>), <span class="loc">Northern Samar</span> province, and <span class="loc">Eastern Samar</span> province. These three provinces, along with the provinces on the nearby islands of <span class="loc">Leyte</span> and <span class="loc">Biliran</span> are part of the <span class="loc">Eastern Visayas region</span>. <span class="loc">Samar</span> is the easternmost island in the <span class="loc">Visayas</span>. The island is separated from <span class="loc">Leyte</span> by the <span class="loc">San Juanico Strait</span>, which at its narrowest point is only about two kilometers across. This strait is crossed by the <span class="loc">San Juanico</span> Bridge. <span class="loc">Samar</span> lies southeast of the <span class="loc">Bicol Peninsula</span> on <span class="loc">Luzon</span>, the country's largest island; the <span class="loc">San Bernardino Strait</span> separates the two. To the south of <span class="loc">Samar</span> is the <span class="loc">Leyte Gulf</span>, the site of the Battle of <span class="loc">Leyte Gulf</span>, one of the most decisive naval battles during the Second World War. The gulf opens out into the <span class="loc">Philippine Sea</span>, found to the east of <span class="loc">Samar</span> and is part of the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. <span class="loc">Samar</span> was the first island of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> sighted by the Spanish expedition of <span class="per">Ferdinand Magellan</span> on <span class="date">16 March 1521</span> after having left the <span class="loc">Mariana Islands</span>. Realizing he had arrived at an archipelago he charted the islands as <span class="loc">San Lazaro</span> (<span class="per">Saint Lazarus</span> in Spanish) because they were sighted on <span class="per">Lazarus</span> <span class="date">Saturday</span>. Even if <span class="loc">Samar</span> was the first island of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> sighted by Magellan, he did not land and continued sailing south till, after anchoring at <span class="loc">Suluan Island</span>, he finally landed on <span class="loc">Homonhon Island</span> on <span class="date">17 March 1521</span>.</p><br><br>
