<p><span class="loc">Dore</span> is a large village in <span class="loc">South Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The village lies on a hill above the <span class="loc">River Sheaf</span> which gave <span class="loc">Sheffield</span> its name, and until 1934 was part of <span class="loc">Derbyshire</span>, but it is now a suburb of the city. <span class="loc">Dore</span> is served by <span class="loc">Dore</span> and <span class="loc">Totley</span> railway station on the Hope Valley Line between <span class="loc">Sheffield</span> and <span class="loc">Manchester</span>. The railway tunnel between <span class="loc">Dore</span> and <span class="loc">Totley</span> under a limb of the <span class="loc">Pennines</span> to <span class="loc">Hathersage</span> in <span class="loc">Derbyshire</span> is the longest such in <span class="loc">England</span>, second only to the Severn Tunnel between <span class="loc">England</span> and <span class="loc">South Wales</span>. They are the longest main line railway tunnels anywhere in <span class="loc">Great Britain</span> - the <span class="loc">London</span> Underground and Channel Tunnel to <span class="loc">France</span> excepted, of course. <span class="loc">Dore</span> has long enjoyed a reputation of being <span class="loc">Sheffield</span>'s wealthiest suburb, and <span class="loc">Dore</span> and <span class="loc">Totley</span> was the only ward of the city which regularly elected a Conservative councillor. However, as of May 2008 all three councillors were Liberal Democrats. The Member of Parliament for <span class="loc">Sheffield</span> <span class="loc">Hallam</span> constituency, of which <span class="loc">Dore</span> is part, is Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, who from 2010 until 2015 served as <span class="loc">Britain</span>'s deputy prime minister in the Coalition government.</p>
