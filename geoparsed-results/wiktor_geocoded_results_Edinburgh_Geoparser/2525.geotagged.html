<p>Dingle is a third Class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Iloilo</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. Dingle started as a pre-colonial settlement of <span class="loc">Sumandig</span>, which was under the jurisdiction of <span class="loc">Simsiman</span>, a pueblo of <span class="loc">Laglag</span>. The settlement was also known as <span class="loc">Sibucao</span>, <span class="loc">Ba-ong</span> and Orvat. The Augustinian priest, Fr. Francisco Manuel Blanco, first founded Dingle as a visita of <span class="loc">Pototan</span> in 1593. Dingle became independent on April 23, 1611. In 1629 however, it was annexed to <span class="loc">Dumangas</span>, <span class="loc">Iloilo</span> and to Dueñas, <span class="loc">Iloilo</span> in 1641 (until 1825). On August 16, 1850, by order of Governor General of the Philippines Antonio de Urbiztondo, Dingle again became independent and was officially named the town of Dingle. The first town head was Julio Dator (1823–1827). In 1865, Fr. Fernando Llorente ordered the construction of the Dingle Catholic Church which was completed in 1886. During the second phase Philippine Revolution against <span class="loc">Spain</span>, during the Spanish–American War, Dingle staged the first armed uprising in the <span class="loc">Province of Iloilo</span>. Now known as the "Cry of <span class="loc">Lincud</span>", the revolt occurred in Barrio Lincud on October 28, 1898. Today the event is commemorated as a special non-working holiday. The leaders of the uprising were Adriano Hernandez, Julio Hernandez, and Nicolas Roces. Adriano Hernandez later became a brigadier general in the Philippine Revolutionary Army. He then represented the province at the Malolos Congress. Later, he was appointed Director of the <span class="loc">Bureau of Agriculture</span>. Today, his statue stands inside the Philippine Army's Camp General Adriano Hernandez in Dingle, which is named in his honor.</p>
