  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Bedford</span> is a town in the centre of the Eastern Cape province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It was established in the mid-19th century when <span class="per">Sir Andries Stockenstroom</span> sold portions of land from his farm <span class="loc">Maastroom</span> to raise funds for the restoration of his library, which had been burnt by British soldiers mistrustful of his attempts to broker peace in one of the Cape Frontier Wars. The farm is still there and open for visitors. It is located on the southern edge of the Winterberg mountain range, in the smaldeel (a narrow strip of grass land running laterally from <span class="loc">Fort Beaufort</span> to <span class="loc">Somerset East</span>, renowned for its sweet grass). The town suffered a major decline in fortunes in the latter half of the 20th century before reviving itself around the turn of the millennium. It is regarded <span class="date">today</span> as an artist's haven and retirement village. The lack of industry in the town, while a boon to those hoping to escape the rat race, means that the town has a large unemployment rate. The woes of the poor are exacerbated by a high HIV-AIDS infection rate. The <span class="org">Bedford Provincial Hospital</span> is situated in <span class="loc">Maitland</span> street, only 3 blocks northwest of the small CBD.</p><br><br>
