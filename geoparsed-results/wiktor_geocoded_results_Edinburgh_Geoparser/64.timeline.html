  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Aurora</span> is a housing estate in <span class="per">Melbourne, Victoria</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> designed to provide homes with higher levels of energy and water efficiency. The plan is to build it over <span class="date">15 years</span> and to have 8500 residences. <span class="org">Aurora</span> is <span class="date">now</span> located partly within the suburb of <span class="loc">Epping</span> (an outer northern suburb of <span class="per">Melbourne</span>) and partly within the rural locality of <span class="loc">Wollert</span>. <span class="org">Aurora</span> is in the <span class="loc">City of Whittlesea</span> council area. It is about 20 km from the <span class="per">Melbourne</span> CBD and is approximately 668 ha in area. It is bound by the Hume Freeway (to <span class="loc">Sydney</span>), <span class="loc">Epping Road</span>, <span class="loc">Craigieburn Road</span> and O'Herns Road on the west, east, north and south sides respectively. It is north of the ring road and west of Plenty Road. Homes in <span class="org">Aurora</span> will be expected to have an energy efficiency rating of at least 6 stars, achieved by using efficient appliances, solar-heating of water where possible, insulation of buildings and houses designed with good ventilation and orientation of windows. Streets are designed for optimal capturing of solar power. <span class="org">Aurora</span>'s water efficiency measures aim to have 54% less potable water consumed per person than normal houses, and are expected to discharge 90% less water into the sea. Water efficient appliances will be used to minimise consumption.</p><br><br>
