  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Mason is the seat of <span class="loc">Mason County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town is an agricultural community on <span class="loc">Comanche Creek</span> southwest of <span class="loc">Mason Mountain</span>, on the <span class="loc">Edwards Plateau</span> and part of the Llano Uplift. The population was 2,114 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The first settler is thought to have been <span class="per">William S. Gamel</span> in <span class="date">1846</span>. The settlement of Mason grew up around <span class="loc">Fort Mason</span> which was established by the <span class="loc">United States</span> War Department as a front-line defense against <span class="loc">Kiowa</span>, <span class="loc">Lipan Apache</span> and <span class="loc">Comanche</span>, on <span class="date">July 6, 1851</span>. <span class="per">George W. Todd</span> established a <span class="loc">Fort Mason</span> post office <span class="date">March 8, 1858</span>, which became consigned to the civilian settlement on <span class="date">June 26, 1858</span>. The protection and commercial possibilities of the fort drew settlers. <span class="per">W. C. Lewis</span> opened a general store that served soldiers and settlers. In <span class="date">1860</span>, <span class="per">James E. Ranck</span> opened a second store and later became known as "The Father of Mason". He and <span class="per">Ben F. Gooch</span> began leasing 5,000 acres (20 km2) of land to cotton sharecroppers. Mason was elected the county seat in <span class="date">1861</span> After the <span class="org">U.S. Civil War</span>, returning Confederate veterans and German ranchers clashed in <span class="date">1875</span> over cattle rustling and other crimes. The resulting killings were known as "The HooDoo Wars," In the midst of the war, Loyal Valley home owner <span class="per">Tim Williamson</span> was murdered by a dozen masked vigilantes who accused him of cattle theft. <span class="per">Williamson</span>â€™s adopted son <span class="per">Texas Ranger</span> <span class="per">Scott Cooley</span> sought revenge. <span class="per">Cooley</span> and his desperadoes, which included <span class="per">Johnny Ringo</span>, created a reign of terror over the area. It was during this episode that <span class="per">Ringo</span> committed his first murder, that of <span class="per">James Cheyney</span>.</p><br><br>
