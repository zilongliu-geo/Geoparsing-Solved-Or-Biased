<p>Saint-Louis, or <span class="loc">Ndar</span> as it is called in Wolof, is the capital of <span class="loc">Senegal</span>'s <span class="loc">Saint-Louis Region</span>. Located in the northwest of <span class="loc">Senegal</span>, near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Senegal</span> River, and 320 km north of <span class="loc">Senegal</span>'s capital city <span class="loc">Dakar</span>, it has a population officially estimated at 176,000 in 2005. Saint-Louis was the capital of the French colony of <span class="loc">Senegal</span> from 1673 until 1902 and French <span class="loc">West Africa</span> from 1895 until 1902, when the capital was moved to <span class="loc">Dakar</span>. From 1920 to 1957 it also served as the capital of the neighboring colony of <span class="loc">Mauritania</span>. The heart of the old colonial city is located on a narrow island (just over 2 km long and about 400 m wide) in the <span class="loc">Senegal</span> River, 25 km from its mouth. At this point the river is separated from the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> to the west by a narrow sand spit, the <span class="loc">Langue de Barbarie</span> (300 m wide), which has also been urbanized (the seaside neighborhoods of <span class="loc">Ndar Tout</span> and <span class="loc">Guet</span> <span class="loc">Ndar</span>). Yet a third part of the city, <span class="loc">Sor</span>, lies on the eastern mainland and is nearly surrounded by tidal marshes. Saint-Louis is situated on the Mauritanian border, though the border crossing is at <span class="loc">Rosso</span>, 100 km upstream.</p>
