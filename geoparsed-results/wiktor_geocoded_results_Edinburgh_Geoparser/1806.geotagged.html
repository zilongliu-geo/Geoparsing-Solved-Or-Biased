<p><span class="loc">Holbrook</span> is a small town in <span class="loc">Southern New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is on the Hume Highway, 356 kilometres (221 mi) North-East of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> and 491 kilometres (305 mi) south-west of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> between <span class="loc">Tarcutta</span> and <span class="loc">Albury</span>. The town is in the Greater Hume Shire Council area which was established in May 2004 from the merger of Culcairn Shire with the majority of Holbrook Shire and part of the Hume Shire. At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> had a population of 1,263 people. The district around <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> is renowned for local produce including merino wool, wheat and other grains, lucerne, fat cattle and lamb. The area was originally inhabited by the Wiradjuri people. The explorers Hume and Hovell were the first-known Europeans in the area. They travelled through in 1824 looking for new grazing country in the south of the colony of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>. The town was originally called <span class="loc">Ten Mile Creek</span> and the first buildings were erected in 1836. A German immigrant, John Christopher Pabst, became the publican of the Woolpack Hotel on 29 July 1840 and the area became known as "the Germans". By 1858 the name had evolved into the official name of <span class="loc">Germanton</span>, though the postal area retained the name <span class="loc">Ten Mile Creek</span>. In 1876 the name <span class="loc">Germanton</span> was gazetted and the old name <span class="loc">Ten Mile Creek</span> consigned to history.</p>
