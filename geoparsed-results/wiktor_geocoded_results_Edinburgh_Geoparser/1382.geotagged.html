<p><span class="loc">Gladstone</span> /ˈɡlædstən/ is a city in the <span class="loc">Gladstone Region</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is approximately 550 kilometres (340 mi) by road north of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> and 100 kilometres (62 mi) south-east of <span class="loc">Rockhampton</span>. Situated between the Calliope and Boyne Rivers, <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> is home to <span class="loc">Queensland</span>'s largest multi-commodity shipping port. The city's population at the 2011 Census was 31,778 of whom 4.1 percent are of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin. The <span class="loc">City of Gladstone</span> contains a land area of 128 square kilometres (49 sq mi). In addition to the mainland area, the Local Authority Area contains fourteen islands. The Gladstone Regional Council, formed in 2008, amalgamates multiple previous local government areas. Prior to European settlement, the <span class="loc">Gladstone region</span> was home of the <span class="loc">Toolooa</span> (or <span class="loc">Tulua</span>), Meerooni and Baiali (or Byellee) Aboriginal tribes. In May 1770, the HM Bark Endeavour, under the command of James Cook, sailed by the entrance to <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> Harbour under the cover of darkness. Matthew Flinders, during his 1801–1803 circumnavigation of <span class="loc">Australia</span>, became the first recorded European to sight the harbour in August 1802. He named the harbour <span class="loc">Port Curtis</span>, after Admiral Roger Curtis, a man who was of assistance to Flinders years earlier at the <span class="loc">Cape of Good Hope</span>. John Oxley conducted further exploration of the harbour and surrounding countryside in November 1823. Oxley was dismissive of the region, noting the harbour was difficult to enter, the countryside was too dry, and the timber useless for construction purposes.</p>
