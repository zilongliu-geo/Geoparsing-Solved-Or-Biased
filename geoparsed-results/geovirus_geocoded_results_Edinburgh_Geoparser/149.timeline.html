  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The source of a recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in <span class="loc">Surrey</span>, <span class="loc">UK</span> has been discovered by investigators at the <span class="loc">Pirbright</span> laboratory where investigations began in <span class="date">August</span>. The Health and Safety Executive informed the <span class="org">BBC</span> that they had pinpointed the source to possible biosecurity lapses in a pipe near the laboratory. It is thought that the pipe, which runs between the site and a government-run laboratory, may have been damaged by tree roots. Recent flooding in the area may have brought the virus to the surface, but it is not yet known how the virus arrived on nearby farmland. The Health and Safety Executive, however, confirmed that vehicles from the <span class="loc">Pirbright</span> laboratory had used a road adjoining to the farmland where the outbreak was found. Neither <span class="loc">Merial</span>, the pharmaceutical company who own the <span class="loc">Pirbright</span> laboratory, or the government have claimed ownership of the pipe, but <span class="loc">Merial</span> have refused to comment before a full report has been published.</p><br><br>
