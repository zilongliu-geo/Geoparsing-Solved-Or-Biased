  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The <span class="loc">city of Lawton</span> (Pawnee: Raaríhtaaruʾ) is the county seat of <span class="loc">Comanche County</span>, in the State of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. Located in southwestern <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, about 87 mi (140 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Oklahoma City</span>, it is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Lawton</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="per">Lawton</span>'s population was 96,867, making it the fifth-largest city in the state. Built on former reservation lands of <span class="loc">Kiowa</span>, <span class="loc">Comanche</span>, and <span class="org">Apache</span> Indians, <span class="per">Lawton</span> was founded on <span class="date">August 6, 1901</span>, and was named after Major General <span class="per">Henry Ware Lawton</span>, a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient killed in action in the Philippine–American War. <span class="per">Lawton</span>'s landscape is typical of the <span class="loc">Great Plains</span>, with flat topography and gently rolling hills, while the area north of the city is marked by the <span class="loc">Wichita Mountains</span>. The city's proximity to Fort Sill Military Reservation gave <span class="per">Lawton</span> economic and population stability throughout the 20th century. Although <span class="per">Lawton</span>'s economy is still largely dependent on Fort Sill, it has also grown to encompass manufacturing, higher education, health care, and retail. The city's government is run by a council-manager government consisting of a city manager and a city council headed by a mayor. Interstate 44 and three major <span class="loc">United States</span> highways serve the city, while Lawton-Fort Sill Regional Airport connects <span class="per">Lawton</span> by air. Recreation can be found at the city's many parks, lakes, museums, and festivals. Notable residents of the city include many musical and literary artists, as well as several professional athletes.</p><br><br>
