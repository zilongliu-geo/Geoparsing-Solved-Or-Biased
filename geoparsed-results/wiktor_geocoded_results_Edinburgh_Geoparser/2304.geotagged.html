<p><span class="loc">Pamplona</span> is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Cagayan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 23,236 people. History <span class="loc">Pamplona</span> is the result of the fusion of two villages; Abulacan (now barrio <span class="loc">San Juan</span>) and <span class="loc">Masi</span>. Abulacan was founded by the ecclesiastical authorities on April 30, 1757 with <span class="loc">San Juan Nepomuceno</span> as the patron saint. Sometime in 1842, Vicar Pedro <span class="loc">Montenegro, O.P.</span> convinced the people to unite the two towns. The vicar named it "<span class="loc">Pamplona</span>" in memory of his hometown <span class="loc">Pamplona</span> in <span class="loc">Spain</span>. After the fusion, an agreement was made that there would be two patron saints of <span class="loc">Pamplona</span>: <span class="loc">San Juan Nepomuceno</span> and <span class="loc">San Pedro</span> de <span class="loc">Martir</span>. This is the reason why the town fiesta is celebrated for two days and the images of the two patron saints are carried during religious processions. The town fiesta is celebrated every April 29. In 1919, some of the prominent people of <span class="loc">Pamplona</span> recommended the transfer of the same to <span class="loc">Bidduang</span>, a barrio of <span class="loc">Pamplona</span>. The transfer was made on November 16, 1919, during the administration of municipal president Esteban Meneses by order of General Wood. In 1928, on the sixth year of the administration of municipal president Paulino Ifurung, one of his last acts was the transfer of the municipal government back to its old site, <span class="loc">Pamplona</span>, by then called "Albano."</p>
