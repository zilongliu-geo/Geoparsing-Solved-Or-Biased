<p><span class="loc">Churchill</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Allegheny County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,011 at the 2010 census. The town was named from the hilltop Beulah Presbyterian Church. <span class="loc">Churchill</span> is located at 40°26′18″N 79°50′38″W (40.438418, -79.843827). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 2.2 square miles (5.7 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Churchill</span> borders five other municipalities: <span class="loc">Wilkinsburg</span>, <span class="loc">Penn Hills</span>, <span class="loc">Wilkins Township</span> and <span class="loc">Forest Hills</span>. Interstate 376, known (to east of downtown <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>) as the "Parkway East" by native Pittsburghers, runs through <span class="loc">Churchill</span>. Westbound I-376 from <span class="loc">Churchill</span> goes to Interstate 279 and downtown <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, while eastbound I-376 goes to the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Turnpike. In addition, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 22 (on the same road as I-376) travels through <span class="loc">Churchill</span>. Several bus lines of the Port Authority of <span class="loc">Allegheny County</span> travel through <span class="loc">Churchill</span>, offering service to downtown <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span> west of <span class="loc">Churchill</span>, and also to <span class="loc">Monroeville</span> east of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, where Monroeville Mall and several Port Authority park-and-ride lots for bus commuters are located. The Parkway East used to end at <span class="loc">Churchill</span> (in the traffic configuration just before it was extended to the Turnpike at <span class="loc">Monroeville</span>), with traffic having to continue ahead on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 22—now business <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 22—to get from there to the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Turnpike. When the Parkway East ended there, there was a black-lettering-on-white-background sign "PARKWAY ENDS", because straight ahead there began to be grade-level intersections.</p>
