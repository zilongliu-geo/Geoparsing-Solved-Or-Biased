<p><span class="loc">Rock Island</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Colorado County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. According to the Handbook of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, the community had an estimated population of 160 in 2000. <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> is situated along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 90A in <span class="loc">Colorado County</span>, approximately 12 miles southwest of <span class="loc">Columbus</span> and 15 miles west of Eagle Lake The area was settled in 1896 as part of a land promotion scheme on the <span class="loc">Texas</span> and New Orleans Railroad. The survey and map of the community was completed on February 19, 1896. Initially known as Crasco, after nearby <span class="loc">Crasco Creek</span>, citizens petitioned the post office department to change the name to <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> in 1897. The petition was granted and Charles Petersen was appointed the first postmaster of <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> on August 9, 1897. Dueling realtors' intent on outselling each other recruited land-buyers from <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, and <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, promising a "tropical paradise" near the <span class="loc">Gulf of Mexico</span>. By 1904, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> had a population of 367. In July of 1909 a hurricane made landfall near present-day <span class="loc">Freeport</span>. The storm passed over <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> with winds estimated to be around 75 mph. Several downtown structures, including a bank, were destroyed. The population of <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> peaked in 1925 at around 500. In the 1960s, the community suffered several fires that left large gaps in the former downtown. The number of inhabitants had fallen to 160 by the mid-1980s. It remained at that level through 2000.</p>
