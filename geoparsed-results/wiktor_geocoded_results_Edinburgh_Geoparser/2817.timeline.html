  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Piedras Negras</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈpjeðɾas neɣɾas]) ( Black stones ) is a city and seat of the surrounding municipality of the same name in the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Coahuila</span>. It stands at the northeastern edge of <span class="loc">Coahuila</span> on the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>-<span class="loc">Mexico</span> border, across the Río <span class="org">Bravo</span> (<span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>) from <span class="loc">Eagle Pass</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. In the <span class="date">2012</span> census the city had a population of 139,169 people, which accounted for 91 percent of its municipality's total population of 152,806. The municipality's relatively small area includes some minor localities outside the city limits. The <span class="loc">Eagle Pass</span> and <span class="loc">Piedras Negras</span> area is connected by the Eagle Pass-Piedras Negras International Bridge, Camino Real International Bridge, and the <span class="loc">Eagle Pass</span> Union Pacific International Railroad Bridge. Founded in <span class="date">1849</span>, the city was renamed <span class="loc">Ciudad</span> <span class="per">Porfirio Díaz</span> in <span class="date">1888</span>, in homage to President <span class="per">Porfirio Díaz</span>. It reverted to its original name following the Mexican Revolution. In Spanish <span class="loc">Piedras Negras</span> translates to "black stones" – a reference to coal deposits in the area. Across the river, coal was formerly mined on the <span class="loc">US</span> side at Dolchburg, near <span class="loc">Eagle Pass</span>. This mine closed around <span class="date">1905</span>, after a fire. <span class="loc">Mexico</span> currently operates two large coal-fired power plants named "<span class="per">José López Portillo</span>" and "Carbón 2" located 30 miles (48 km) south of <span class="loc">Piedras Negras</span>.</p><br><br>
