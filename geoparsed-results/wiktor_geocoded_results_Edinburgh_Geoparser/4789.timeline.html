  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Princeton</span> is a city in and county seat of <span class="loc">Mercer County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,432 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Bluefield</span>, WV-VA micropolitan area which has a population of 107,342. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Mercer County</span>. The town hosts the Princeton Rays baseball club of the <span class="org">Appalachian League</span>. In southern <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, in the late 19th century, coal mining and transportation by the emerging technology of the railroads combined to form a new industry. Much of the region's bituminous coal was sent northwest to the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span>, or northeast to the <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Railroad</span>'s coal piers at <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>, or to the world's greatest ice-free port of <span class="loc">Hampton Roads</span> in eastern Virginia. The <span class="loc">Chesapeake</span> and Ohio Railway's coal piers were located at <span class="loc">Newport News</span>. Across the harbor, the <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> and Western Railway's coal piers were located on the <span class="loc">Elizabeth River</span> in <span class="loc">Norfolk</span>. The eastern-bound coal transported by the C&amp;O and the N&amp;W railroads was highly valued for local use and for steam-powered ships, notably those of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Navy. Loaded into large ships called colliers, the <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> "smokeless coal" was sent in coast-wise shipping to the <span class="per">Northeastern U.S.</span> points such as New <span class="loc">York City</span> and <span class="loc">New England</span>, as well as exported to other countries worldwide.</p><br><br>
