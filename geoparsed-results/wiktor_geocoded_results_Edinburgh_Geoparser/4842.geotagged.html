<p><span class="loc">Grafton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windham County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 679 at the 2010 census. The town was founded as <span class="loc">Thomlinson</span>, but renaming rights were auctioned in 1791. The high bidder, who reportedly offered "five dollars and a jug of rum," changed the name to <span class="loc">Grafton</span> after his home town of <span class="loc">Grafton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Possibly as a result of having celebrated a bit too much with the rum (some say it was hard cider), the money was never collected. In the early 19th century, sheep raising became popular and multiple woolen mills sprang up along the branches of the <span class="loc">Saxtons River</span>. Soapstone was quarried on nearby <span class="loc">Bear Mountain</span>. The town became a notable stagecoach hub for traffic across the <span class="loc">Green Mountains</span> into <span class="loc">Albany</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. One inn from that era, "the <span class="loc">Old Tavern</span>," was founded in 1801. It remains one of the oldest continually operating hotels in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> had a population of almost 1,500 just before the American Civil War. The town suffered severe losses during the Civil War. Local cemeteries in the village hold many tombstones of casualties from the Battle of <span class="loc">Gettysburg</span>. After the war, the community declined in population. The soapstone quarry was depleted and closed late in the 19th century. Around the time of the Great Depression, the town's population was less than 400.</p>
