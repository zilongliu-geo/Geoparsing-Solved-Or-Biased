It is located on the southern shore of the <span class="loc">Sognefjorden</span> in the traditional <span class="loc">district of Sogn</span>.

Other villages in the municipality include <span class="loc">Feios</span>, <span class="loc">Fresvik</span>, <span class="loc">Nese</span>, and <span class="loc">Vangsnes</span>. <span class="loc">Vik</span> was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).

Also on this date, the Nybø and Nygjerdet farms were transferred from <span class="loc">Vik</span> to Høyanger Municipality. All these changes gave <span class="loc">Vik</span> a total population of 2,623. On 1 January 1992, the sub-parishes of <span class="loc">Feios</span> and <span class="loc">Fresvik</span> were transferred from <span class="loc">Leikanger Municipality</span> to <span class="loc">Vik Municipality</span>. This added 572 residents to the population of <span class="loc">Vik</span>.</p>
