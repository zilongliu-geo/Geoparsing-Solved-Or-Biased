<p><span class="loc">Marietta</span> is a city in and county seat of <span class="loc">Love County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,626 at the 2010 census, a 7.4 percent increase from 2,445 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Marietta</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Ardmore</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is also a part of the <span class="loc">Texoma region</span>. Settlers were attracted by the fertile land near the <span class="loc">Red River</span>, which was conducive to agriculture and cattle raising. Cotton quickly became the principal crop. William "Bill" Washington had the largest cattle ranch in <span class="loc">Pickens County</span>, <span class="loc">Chickasaw Nation</span>, Indian Territory. Bill's brother, Jerry Washington, who lived about a mile north of present-day <span class="loc">Marietta</span>, became the town's first postmaster when the post office opened on December 20, 1887. A local story claims that the town was named for Jerry's wife. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway (later the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway) laid its rail line in early 1887, stimulating economic growth for the future town of <span class="loc">Marietta</span>, Indian Territory. The first train ran July 28, 1887.</p>
