<p><span class="loc">Frankfort</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 16,422 at the 2010 census. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>. Brothers John, William and Nicholas Pence, previously of <span class="loc">Warren County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, settled on the land on which <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> now stands in 1869, having entered it from the government in 1867 and 1868. In 1860, the brothers donated 60 acres (240,000 m2) of the land to the county commissioners, a donation which led to the establishment of the county seat at that site rather than in Jefferson, a community which had also been vying for the honor. The new town was named <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> at the brothers' request and honors their German great-grandparents' home of <span class="loc">Frankfurt am Main</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> was laid off on the 60-acre (240,000 m2) tract by William Douglass, the county agent, and the plat filed on June 8, 1830. The original plat consisted of 64 lots in eight blocks surrounding a public square where the courthouse now stands. The county board paid contractors Allen &amp; Michael the sum of $20 to erect the first courthouse, a 1 1⁄2-story temporary structure made a logs hewn from trees that grew on the square and surrounding streets. Its replacement was built by contractor John Elder in 1837–1838 for $12,000 and operated for 45 years. Indianapolis architect George W. Bunting in 1881 designed the third courthouse, a 165-foot (50 m) tall structure built of <span class="loc">Indiana</span> limestone by contractors <span class="loc">Farman</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Pearce</span> for approximately $200,000. Its cornerstone was laid September 2, 1882.</p>
