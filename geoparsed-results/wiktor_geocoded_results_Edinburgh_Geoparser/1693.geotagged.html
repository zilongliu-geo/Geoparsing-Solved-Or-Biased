<p><span class="loc">Shuri</span> (首里, Okinawan: <span class="loc">Sui</span> or <span class="loc">Shui</span>) is a district of the <span class="loc">city of Naha</span>, <span class="loc">Okinawa</span>. It was formerly a separate city unto itself, and the royal capital of the Ryūkyū Kingdom. A number of famous historical sites are located in <span class="loc">Shuri</span>, including <span class="loc">Shuri</span> Castle, the Shureimon gate, Sunuhyan-utaki (a sacred space of the native Ryukyuan religion), and royal mausoleum Tamaudun, all of which are designated World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Originally established as a castle town surrounding the royal palace, <span class="loc">Shuri</span> ceased to be the capital when the kingdom was abolished and incorporated into <span class="loc">Japan</span> as <span class="loc">Okinawa</span> prefecture. In 1896, <span class="loc">Shuri</span> was made a ward (区, ku) of the new prefectural capital, <span class="loc">Naha</span>, though it was made a separate city again in 1921. <span class="loc">Shuri</span> was merged into <span class="loc">Naha</span> in 1954. <span class="loc">Shuri</span> Castle was first built during the reign of Shunbajunki (r. 1237-1248), who ruled from nearby <span class="loc">Urasoe</span> Castle. This was nearly a century before <span class="loc">Okinawa</span> Island would become divided into the three kingdoms of <span class="loc">Hokuzan</span>, <span class="loc">Nanzan</span>, and Chūzan; nearly two centuries before the unification of those kingdoms and establishment of the Ryūkyū Kingdom. The island was not yet an organized or unified kingdom, but rather a collection of local chieftains (anji) loyal to the chief chieftain in <span class="loc">Urasoe</span>.</p>
