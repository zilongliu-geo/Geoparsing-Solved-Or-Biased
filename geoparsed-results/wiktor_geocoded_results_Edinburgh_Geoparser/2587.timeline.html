  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Buda</span> (/ˈbjuːdə/ BYOO-da) is a city in <span class="loc">Hays County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,343 residents in <span class="date">2010</span>. <span class="loc">Buda</span> is part of the Austin-Round Rock-San <span class="loc">Marcos metropolitan</span> statistical area and one of Austin's fastest growing suburbs. Some high school competitions held there. <span class="loc">Buda</span> is located at 30°05′03″N 97°50′21″W (30.084229, −97.839081). This is 13 miles (21 km) southwest of Austin and 60 miles (97 km) northeast of <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> on Interstate 35. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.4 square miles (6.2 km2), of which, 2.4 square miles (6.2 km2) of it is land and 0.41% is water. <span class="loc">Buda</span> is served by the <span class="org">Hays</span> Consolidated Independent School District. <span class="loc">Buda</span> Elementary, originally built in <span class="date">1885</span> sits just outside Main Street and currently serves 500 students from the <span class="loc">Buda</span> area. <span class="loc">Buda</span> students attend Jack C. Hays High School. <span class="loc">Buda</span> is home to numerous fast-growing small- to medium-sized businesses. Because of its proximity to Austin, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">Buda</span> is a suburb and commuter town for commuters to Austin. Commercial development along the I-35 corridor, such as the Cabela's sporting good store, has increased city sales tax revenue, and city leaders hope that further revitalization of downtown <span class="loc">Buda</span> will attract tourists and residents to the Main Street area.</p><br><br>
