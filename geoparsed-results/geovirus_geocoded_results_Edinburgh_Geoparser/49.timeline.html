  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="date">Yesterday</span>, the first fatality in the <span class="loc">UK</span> caused by swine flu was announced. <span class="per">Jacqueline Fleming</span>, who was 38, from <span class="loc">Glasgow</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, died at the Royal <span class="org">Alexandria Hospital</span> in Paisley. She had been admitted to hospital <span class="date">two weeks earlier</span> after the premature birth of her baby son, <span class="per">Jack</span>. Reports suggest that she was admitted having suffered a stroke and suffered further complications, in part related to the birth of <span class="per">Jack</span>. <span class="per">Professor Hugh Pennington</span>, a bacteriologist at <span class="org">Aberdeen University</span> was quoted as saying that underlying health problems were likely to have been a significant factor in Jaqueline's death. He also dismissed speculation that the virus was getting worse, saying "This is what the authorities have been saying will happen for <span class="date">a long time</span>. It does not point to the virus getting nastier. All the evidence to date suggests the virus is not changing at all." Her son <span class="per">Jack</span> died <span class="date">today</span> in the special care unit of the same hospital at the age of <span class="date">two weeks</span>, having been born <span class="date">11 weeks</span> early. He was not affected by the H1N1 virus. Jaqueline's husband stated <span class="date">today</span> "My beautiful son was born on the <span class="date">first of June 2009</span>, <span class="date">11 weeks</span> early. He suffered from a number of complications and despite his brave fight he passed away earlier this evening at the Special Care Baby Unit at the Royal <span class="org">Alexandra Hospital</span> in Paisley." On <span class="date">Friday</span>, the Health <span class="per">Protection Agency</span> said confirmed swine flu cases in the <span class="loc">UK</span> had reached <span class="date">1004</span>. Recently, the <span class="org">World Health Organisation</span> declared the outbreak to be a worldwide pandemic.</p><br><br>
