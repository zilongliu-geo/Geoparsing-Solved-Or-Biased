  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Union County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 21,356. The county seat is <span class="loc">Blairsville</span>. Its Sole commissioner is <span class="per">Lamar Paris</span>, who has served since <span class="date">2001</span>. <span class="loc">Union County</span> was carved from <span class="loc">Cherokee County</span> territory during the <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Land Lottery of <span class="date">1832</span>. Originally inhabited by Native Americans, the area became more desirable to white settlers with the discovery of gold in the 1820s. The <span class="org">Union Party</span>, a political group that supported removing the Indians and opening the area to white settlers, is the probable inspiration for the countyâ€™s name. Upon entering the town of <span class="loc">Blairsville</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, one can see a plaque crediting <span class="per">John Thomas</span> (former Justice of the Inferior Court and serving <span class="loc">Union County</span> in the <span class="org">Georgia House of Representatives</span> in <span class="date">1833</span>) for giving the county the name of <span class="org">Union</span>. When asked to suggest a name, he is reported to have said, "Name it <span class="org">Union</span>, for none but union-like men reside in it." Since the county was founded <span class="date">almost 30 years</span> before the <span class="org">U.S. Civil War</span>, <span class="loc">Union County</span> obviously was not named in sympathy for the North, as is sometimes thought. County residents, however, were largely pro-Union in the <span class="date">years</span> leading up to the war, as was true of much of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>'s mountainous north, and the county's delegates to the state convention of <span class="date">1861</span> voted against secession. When the state seceded, most <span class="loc">Union County</span> residents supported the Confederacy, and the majority of its Civil War soldiers fought on the Confederate side, although a significant minority fought for the <span class="org">Union</span>. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the county's memorial to its generations of war dead may be the only one in the South that specifically includes homage to <span class="org">Union</span> soldiers and to American Indians who fought white settlement.</p><br><br>
