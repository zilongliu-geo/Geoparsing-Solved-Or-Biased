<p><span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is a suburb in the northern outskirts of Adelaide, <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">City of Playford</span>. Gawler Plains Post Office opened on 12 July 1850 and was renamed <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> in 1855. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> has Main North Road as its eastern boundary, with service stations, the historic <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> Hotel and several other businesses and private residences. Anderson Walk is the southern boundary of the original village, which was arranged in a grid with Augusta Square in the centre. West of the older residential area is an industrial zone along the railway line, with <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> railway station on the south side of Anderson Walk. Munno Para Shopping City is on the south side of <span class="loc">Smith Creek</span>. There are more residential areas south and west of the railway station, and an Army Reserve depot west of the shopping centre which is home to the 3rd/9th Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles) and 49 ACU Army Cadets. A 1 mile (1.6 km) speedway track was built in the <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> area in 1926 by the Motorcycle Club of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. The exact location may have been in what is now <span class="loc">Elizabeth</span> Downs. The <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> Speedway was believed to be the first in the world to be promoted by a motorcycle club. The first meeting was scheduled for Wednesday 13 October 1926, but postponed to Saturday 16 October due to poor weather. The first race meeting was held before the grandstands were built, and the new track generated a lot of dust. The track was on the east side of the Gawler Road, a little south of <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> township, in a paddock of 80 acres (32 ha). It appears to have only operated until about 1930.</p>
