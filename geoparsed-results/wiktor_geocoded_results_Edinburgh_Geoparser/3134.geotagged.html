<p><span class="loc">El Monte</span> /ɛl ˈmɒntiː/ is a residential, industrial, and commercial city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span> of Southern <span class="loc">California</span>, the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city lies in the <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Valley east of the city of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. <span class="loc">El Monte</span>'s slogan is "Welcome to Friendly <span class="loc">El Monte</span>" and historically is known as "The End of the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail." As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 113,475, down from 115,965 at the 2000 census. As of 2010, <span class="loc">El Monte</span> was the 51st largest city in <span class="loc">California</span>. <span class="loc">El Monte</span> is situated between the <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> and <span class="loc">Rio</span> Hondo Rivers, residents claimed that anything could be grown in the area. Between 1770 and 1830, Spanish soldiers and missionaries often stopped here for respite. They called the area, '<span class="loc">El Monte</span>,' which in Spanish means 'the mountain'. Most people assume the name refers to a mountain, but the word is an archaic Spanish translation of that era, there were no mountains in the valley. The explorers had found this rich, low altitude land, blanketed with thick growths of wispy willows, alders, and cattails, located between the two rivers. They also found wild grapevines and watercress. <span class="loc">El Monte</span> is approximately 7 miles long and 4 miles wide. When the State Legislature organized <span class="loc">California</span> into more manageable designated townships in the 1850s, they called it the <span class="loc">El Monte</span> Township. In a short time the name returned to the original <span class="loc">El Monte</span>.</p>
