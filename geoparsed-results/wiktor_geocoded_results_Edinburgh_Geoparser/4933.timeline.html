As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 57,424. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Elizabethton. The county is named in honor of <span class="per">Landon Carter</span>, an early settler active in the State of <span class="org">Franklin</span> movement. <span class="loc">Carter County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Johnson City</span>, <span class="loc">TN</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area, commonly known as the "Tri-Cities" region of Northeast Tennessee.
