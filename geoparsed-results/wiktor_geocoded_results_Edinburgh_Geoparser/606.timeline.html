  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Arcadia</span> is an unincorporated community located in <span class="loc">Sullivan County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, just outside Kingsport's eastern city limits. <span class="loc">Arcadia</span>, originally known as the Reedy Creek Settlement, was one of the earliest settlements in present-day <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. <span class="per">Daniel Boone</span>'s Wilderness Road ran through this community in <span class="date">1775</span>. <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> is listed in <span class="org">the National Register of Historical Places</span> which includes the Thomas Fain Plantation. Thomas Fain named his plantation "Arcadia" to which the surrounding community became known. <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> is part of the Kingsport–Bristol (TN)–Bristol (VA) Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the <span class="loc">Tri-Cities region</span>. In <span class="date">1770</span>, the "Treaty of <span class="loc">Lochaber</span>" established new boundaries between the Native American lands and the settlers. Settlers then moved into what is <span class="date">now</span> southwestern <span class="per">Virginia</span> and <span class="per">Tennessee</span>. Settlers followed the Great Wagon Road which followed the Great Indian Warpath from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and <span class="loc">Maryland</span> through the Great <span class="loc">Appalachian</span> Valley into <span class="per">Tennessee</span>. The portion of this path that went through present-day <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> was later locally called Reedy Creek Road, Old Kentucky Road, and <span class="date">now</span> Bloomingdale-Pike Road. This portion of the road was also part of <span class="per">Daniel Boone</span>'s Wilderness Road which allowed those following the Great Wagon Road to continue past present-day <span class="loc">Bristol</span>, through the Reedy Creek Settlement, through <span class="loc">Moccasin Gap</span>, and over to <span class="loc">Cumberland Gap</span> to settle in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>.</p><br><br>
