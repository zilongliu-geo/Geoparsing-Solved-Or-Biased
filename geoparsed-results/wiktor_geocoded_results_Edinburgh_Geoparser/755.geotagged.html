<p><span class="loc">Langa</span> is a suburb found in Cape Town, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It was established in 1927 in terms of the 1923 Urban Areas Act. Similar to <span class="loc">Nyanga</span>, <span class="loc">Langa</span> is one of the many areas in <span class="loc">South Africa</span> that were designated for Black Africans before the apartheid era. It is the oldest of such suburbs in Cape Town and was the location of much resistance to apartheid. <span class="loc">Langa</span> is also where several people were killed on 21 March 1960 same day as the Sharpeville massacre, during the anti-pass campaign. On 21 March 2010, now 50 years later, a monument was unveiled by the government in remembrance of the people who lost their lives. <span class="loc">Langa</span> is bordered by Jan Smuts Drive to the west, the N2 to the south, the N7 to the east and is served by <span class="loc">Langa</span> Railway Station. Although <span class="loc">Langa</span> literally means "sun" in Xhosa, the name of the township is derived from the name of Langalibalele - a chief and renowned rainmaker who in 1873 was imprisoned on <span class="loc">Robben Island</span> for rebelling against the Natal government. Various prominent people fought for his release and he was subsequently confined to a farm called "Uitvlugt", which is on the site of present-day <span class="loc">Pinelands</span>. <span class="loc">Langa</span>, which adjoins <span class="loc">Pinelands</span>, commemorates this folk hero as it was developed in 1898 on the land known as "Langalibalele's Location". Hence <span class="loc">Langa</span> is often called "Kwa-Langa" meaning "place of <span class="loc">Langa</span>".</p>
