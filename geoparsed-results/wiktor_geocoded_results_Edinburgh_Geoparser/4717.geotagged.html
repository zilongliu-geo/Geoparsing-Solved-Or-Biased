<p><span class="loc">Pazar</span> (Laz and Georgian: ათინა/Atina; Greek: Αθήνα/Athina) is a town and <span class="loc">district of Rize</span> Province in the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> region of <span class="loc">Turkey</span>, 37 km east of the <span class="loc">city of Rize</span>. The town was formerly named <span class="loc">Atina</span> (Αθήνα του Πόντου) and was renamed <span class="loc">Pazar</span>, meaning 'market', in 1928. <span class="loc">Pazar</span> is a strip of <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> coast with high mountains running parallel to the coast inland. This coast has a mild climate with warm summers (22 °C in August) and cool winters (7 °C in January, it rarely snows on the coast), but very wet and humid, apart from the early summer (April–May–June) it rains heavily year round, with an average of 50 sunny days per year. The wind off the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> is cold in autumn, warm and wet in summer. With all this rainfall the area is very green, and even more water is brought to the area by the many streams bringing rainwater and snowmelt down from the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> mountains, including the <span class="loc">Pazar River</span> itself. This is a hilly district and the main economic activity is tea growing, plus some fishing, trade and light industry (tea processing) in the town of <span class="loc">Pazar</span>. Tea was first planted here in 1944 and there are now three factories in <span class="loc">Pazar</span> for processing the crop. 65% of arable land in <span class="loc">Pazar</span> is used for growing tea. Before tea was planted, citrus fruits and apples were grown here but this has mostly ceased now, apart from trees in family gardens, where people grow vegetables and keep poultry. There are small areas of tobacco, corn, potatoes and beans.</p>
