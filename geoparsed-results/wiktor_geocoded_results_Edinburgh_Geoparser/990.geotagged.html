<p>Roy, <span class="loc">Oregon</span> is an unincorporated historic community in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located south of the Sunset Highway (<span class="loc">U.S.</span> 26) and southeast of the <span class="loc">city of Banks</span>. Around 1905, representatives of the Pacific Railway and Navigation Company, interested in putting a (rail)line through from <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> to Tillamook on the coast, began approaching farmers living northeast of <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. With the railroad coming through the <span class="loc">Tualatin</span> Valley a mile north of the Vandervelden farm, William (Vandervelden) and his sons, J.W. and Frank, decided to buy land around the intended railway went through Lewis Roy's place and thus, the road crossing was called Roy. The railroad went through that region in 1907, and a new church was built north of the tracks in 1908. Roy post office was established in 1907 and named for the Roy family, who were local pioneers. In 1908, a Catholic school called St. Ferdinand's opened in the local church. A standalone wood-framed school opened in September 1912, which was renamed as St. Francis of Assisi Catholic School in 1920. The railroad reached Roy in 1912. St. Francis moved into a new brick building in 1951. Roy post office closed in 1955. Roy currently has a Banks mailing address. Different parts of the area are served by the Forest Grove Rural Fire Protection District, Banks Rural Fire Protection District, and <span class="loc">Washington County</span> Fire District 2.</p>
