  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Summit is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Boyd County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, United Stateson <span class="loc">US</span> 60 just west of <span class="loc">Ashland</span>. Summit is often considered a section of <span class="loc">Ashland</span> because it shares the city's ZIP code. However, it is entirely located outside <span class="loc">Ashland</span>'s corporation limits and is a nearby suburb. The spelling of Summit officially has only one "T" at the end but is often spelled with two "T's" and both are accepted as correct. Summit is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). As of the <span class="date">2000</span> census, the MSA had a population of 288,649. Summit's name reflects its location on relatively flat terrain at a higher elevation than other parts of the surrounding area. Unusual for the region, this terrain was created by the ancient Teay's River and the associated Glacial Lake Tight. In <span class="date">the 1940s</span>, Summit began transforming from a sparsely populated farming community into a populated suburban area, partly due to the construction of <span class="loc">Federal Correctional Institution</span> located there on <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> Route 716, and the upgrading of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 60, which made eased communications with <span class="loc">Ashland</span>.</p><br><br>
