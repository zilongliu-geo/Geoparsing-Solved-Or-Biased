The population was 161 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Elgin</span> is located along the <span class="loc">Babocomari River</span> at 31°37′45″N 110°34′19″W (31.629095, -110.571951).

The train station sequence in the 1955 film classic Oklahoma!, with Gene Nelson singing and dancing the song "<span class="loc">Kansas City</span>" partly atop a moving train, was filmed in <span class="loc">Elgin</span>, and the railroad scenes in the 1957 western 3:10 to <span class="loc">Yuma</span>, with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, were filmed in <span class="loc">Elgin</span>. <span class="loc">Elgin</span> is the first location in <span class="loc">Arizona</span> to engage in commercial scale winemaking. In the 1970s, Gordon Dutt, Ph.D., a soil scientist from the University of Arizona, was intrigued with the similarity between the soil of the Elgin-Sonoita area and that of <span class="loc">Burgundy</span>, <span class="loc">France</span>. In partnership with A. Blake Brophy, he developed an experimental winery that later developed into the Sonoita Vineyards and that encouraged other vineyards in the area. Presently, growers in the area produce <span class="loc">Chardonnay</span>, Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Mission, and Syrah grapes. There are presently (2009) nine vineyards in the region, producing about 50,000 gallons of wine yearly.</p>
