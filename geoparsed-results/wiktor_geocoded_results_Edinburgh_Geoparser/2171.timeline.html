  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mega</span> is a town in southern <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. Located between <span class="loc">Moyale</span> and <span class="loc">Yabelo</span> on the paved highway south to <span class="loc">Kenya</span>, in the Borena Zone of the <span class="loc">Oromia Region</span> (or kilil), this town has a latitude and longitude of 4°01′N 38°15′E with an elevation of 1740 meters above sea level. Named for a nearby mountain, this town is the administrative center of Dire woreda. This town is reported to have telephone service and a post office, as well as at least one primary and one secondary school, but no financial institutions. <span class="loc">Mega</span> came under Ethiopian control in <span class="date">1897</span> when Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis built a fort was nearby. In the early part of the twentieth century, it was important as the residence for <span class="per">Sir Arnold Weinholt Hodson</span>, British <span class="org">Consul for Southern</span> <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span> between <span class="date">1914</span>-<span class="date">1923</span>. The British manned the consulate at least as late as <span class="date">the 1950s</span>. <span class="loc">Mega</span> was captured by the Italians on <span class="date">25 June 1936</span>, then occupied by a South African Brigade in <span class="date">February 1941</span> after prolonged fighting with the Italian garrison. During the Italian occupation, <span class="loc">Mega</span> became an important hub of communications for this part of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>, but when <span class="per">David Buxton</span> passed through in the <span class="date">later 1940s</span> after the Italians had been defeated, he found that "there is little traffic in these <span class="date">days</span>, and <span class="loc">Mega</span> has almost reverted to the sleepy remoteness of pre-Italian times."</p><br><br>
