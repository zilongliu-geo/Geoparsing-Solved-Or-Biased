  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Kishwaukee College</span> hosts annual book sale. <span class="loc">MALTA</span> – About 5,000 books are stacked on, under and around tables near the entrance to the <span class="org">Kishwaukee College</span> library, separated into subjects as diverse as those on the library shelves – job search, self-help, textbooks, encyclopedias and a small mountain of paperback fiction. "We've been getting donations throughout the year and discarding throughout the year, and we had a book drive about <span class="date">a month ago</span>," library staffer <span class="per">Mary Middleton</span> said. "A lot are related to the degrees and programs we have here at the college, and we got a lot of fiction donations." And those thousands of books are available for purchase <span class="date">this week</span> during the library's annual book sale. Paperbacks in the sale are priced at 50 cents and hardcover books at $1. The proceeds from the sale will help the library to purchase new books and materials, <span class="per">Middleton</span> said. When deciding which books to discard, the library staff consider the condition of the book and the number of titles on the shelf with the same subject, she said. They also consider the age of the information. While the information contained in art books never expires, she said, computer or political science texts can become obsolete. "We try to keep the library updated with relevant information," <span class="per">Middleton</span> said. Some of the most desirable books were snapped up early by used book dealers waiting outside the door when the library opened <span class="date">Monday</span>, <span class="per">Middleton</span> said. The books that don't sell by the time the event ends <span class="date">Saturday</span> will either be set out on tables for students to take for free or will be sent to an online used book distributor for sale, she said. Though the annual book sale has been going on since <span class="date">2004</span>, it's not the only opportunity to get a deal on the library's used books, <span class="per">Middleton</span> added. A section of shelves on the library's second floor is filled with books that are always on sale, she said. "That sale goes on year round, so if someone misses the book sale, they might want to come check that out," she said. If You Go The <span class="org">Kishwaukee College</span> library's annual book sale is being held through <span class="date">Saturday</span> in the library on the college's campus at Route 38 and <span class="loc">Malta</span> Road in <span class="loc">Malta</span>. The library is open from 7:30 a.m.-9:30 p.m. <span class="date">Monday</span> through <span class="date">Thursday</span>, 7:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. <span class="date">Friday</span> and 8:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. <span class="date">Saturday</span>.</p><br><br>
