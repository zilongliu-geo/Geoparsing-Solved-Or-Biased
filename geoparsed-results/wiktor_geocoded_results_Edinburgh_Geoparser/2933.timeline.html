  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Garland is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. It is a large city northeast of Dallas and is a part of the Dallasâ€“Fort Worth metroplex, as well as a suburb of Dallas. It is located almost entirely within <span class="loc">Dallas County</span>, except a small portion located in <span class="per">Collin</span> and <span class="per">Rockwall</span> Counties. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a population of 226,876, making it the 87th-most populous city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span> and the 12th-most populous city in the state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Garland is second only to the <span class="loc">City of Dallas</span> in <span class="loc">Dallas County</span> by population and has easy access to downtown Dallas via public transportation including two Dart Blue line stations and buses. Immigrants began arriving in the Peters colony area around <span class="date">1850</span>, but a community was not created until <span class="date">1874</span>. Two communities sprang up in the area: <span class="per">Embree</span>, named for the physician <span class="per">K. H. Embree</span>, and <span class="loc">Duck Creek</span>, named for the local creek of the same name. A rivalry between the two towns ensued as the area began to grow around the Santa Fe Railroad depot. Eventually, to settle a dispute regarding which town should have the local post office, <span class="loc">Dallas County</span> <span class="per">Judge Thomas A. Nash</span> asked visiting Congressman <span class="per">Joe Abbott</span> to move the post office between the two towns. The move was completed in <span class="date">1887</span>. The new location was named Garland after <span class="org">U.S. Attorney General</span> <span class="per">Augustus Hill Garland</span>. Soon after, the towns of <span class="loc">Embree</span> and <span class="loc">Duck Creek</span> were combined, and the three areas combined to form the <span class="loc">city of Garland</span>, which was incorporated in <span class="date">1891</span>. By <span class="date">1904</span>, the town had a population of 819 people.</p><br><br>
