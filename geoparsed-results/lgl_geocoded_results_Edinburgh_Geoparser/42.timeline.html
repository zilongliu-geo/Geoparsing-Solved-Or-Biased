  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Grand Prairie</span> police investigate teen's shooting death after <span class="date">weekend</span> party 10:22 AM CT. <span class="loc">Grand Prairie</span> police are investigating the death of a 16-year-old who was killed and another who was injured <span class="date">early Sunday</span> after an altercation at an <span class="loc">Arlington</span> party. The <span class="loc">Tarrant County</span> Medical Examiner identified the <span class="loc">Arlington</span> teen as Mitchell Taleferio, but police said Taleferio was the teenâ€™s first name. According to police, Taleferio was at a party with friends and may have gotten into an altercation with another group of teens. After he left the party with his friends, their red <span class="date">1991</span> <span class="org">Honda</span> broke down and they stopped at an <span class="org">Exxon</span> gas station on <span class="loc">Mayfield</span> <span class="per">Road</span> and <span class="per">State</span> Highway 360 to fix it. A red <span class="org">Dodge</span> <span class="loc">Durango</span> with a group of teens who may have been at the party also drove to the gas station and started fighting with Taleferio and his friends. Taleferio and his friends left the gas station and stopped about a half-mile away at a light at Forum Drive and <span class="loc">Mayfield Road</span> in <span class="loc">Grand Prairie</span> when the <span class="loc">Durango</span> pulled up next to them. Shots fired from the <span class="loc">Durango</span> struck Taleferio in the back of the head, police said. The <span class="org">Honda</span>'s driver, another 16-year-old, also was struck and suffered non-life threatening injuries. The injured teen drove to <span class="org">USMD Medical Center</span> in <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, and Taleferio was later airlifted to <span class="org">John Peter Smith Hospital</span> in <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span> where he was pronounced dead, authorities said.</p><br><br>
