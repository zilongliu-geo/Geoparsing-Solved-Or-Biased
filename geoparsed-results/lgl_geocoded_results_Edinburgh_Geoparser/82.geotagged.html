<p>City adjusts budget for recycling, winter maintenance. TORRINGTON — City Council tentatively approved several budget changes during a meeting Wednesday, that would affect recycling and winter maintenance supplies for the 2009-10 fiscal year. Mayor Ryan Bingham proposed a reduction of $150,000 in a disposal line item, putting the funds at $1 million. Jerry Rollett, city engineer, noted that was the cost of savings from the city’s decision to switch to single-stream recycling. Last week the council unanimously approved the switch to the new system, which would allow residents to combine recyclables in the same bin. The vote came with an approval to utilize <span class="loc">USA</span> Hauling and Recycling Inc.Along with accepting the new company, the refuse contract line item jumped from $893,000 to $1.77 million. The reason for the hike was due to the contract with <span class="loc">USA</span> Hauling, which was numbered at $2.06 million for the year. A combination of other line items made up for the remainder of the contract prices, he said.</p>
