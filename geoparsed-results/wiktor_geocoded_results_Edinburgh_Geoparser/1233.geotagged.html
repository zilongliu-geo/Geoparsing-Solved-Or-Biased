<p><span class="loc">Yasnaya Polyana</span> (Russian: Я́сная Поля́на; German: <span class="loc">Trakehnen</span>, from 1929 Groß <span class="loc">Trakehnen</span>; Lithuanian: Trakėnai; Polish: Trakany) is a rural settlement (posyolok) in the <span class="loc">Nesterovsky District</span> of <span class="loc">Kaliningrad Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>. It is located in the southeast of the oblast, north of the <span class="loc">Romincka</span> Forest. Nearby Diwnoje Nowoje is a railway station on the former Prussian Eastern Railway from <span class="loc">Kaliningrad</span> to <span class="loc">Kybartai</span> in <span class="loc">Lithuania</span>. The settlement was originally known as the village of <span class="loc">Trakehnen</span> in <span class="loc">East Prussia</span>, named after the Old Prussian word trakis, meaning "great bog". In 1731 King Frederick William I of <span class="loc">Prussia</span> had the swampy territory of the <span class="loc">Pissa</span> River drained to establish the famous warmblood Trakehner horse breed stable (Königliches Stutamt <span class="loc">Trakehnen</span>) northwest of the municipality. The area was colonized by Protestant expellees from the Archbishopric of <span class="loc">Salzburg</span>. Intended for the build-up of an own breeding supplying the Prussian Army cavalry, the stud farm at the time of its opening in 1732 had about 1,100 horses standing on an area of 25 km2 (9.7 sq mi). The "Soldier King" however soon became dissatisfied with the poor efficiency of the stud farm and in 1739 granted it to his son, crown prince Frederick II of <span class="loc">Prussia</span>. Upon Frederick's death in 1786, it was taken over by the Prussian state and renamed Königlich Preußisches Hauptgestüt <span class="loc">Trakehnen</span>. In professional hands, the stud and the village of <span class="loc">Trakehnen</span> prospered from that time on.</p>
