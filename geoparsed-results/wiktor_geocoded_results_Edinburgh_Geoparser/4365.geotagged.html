<p><span class="loc">Saltillo</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [salˈtiʎo]) is the capital and largest city of the northeastern Mexican state of <span class="loc">Coahuila</span> and the municipal seat of the municipality of the same name. The city is located about 400 kilometres (250 mi) south of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, and 90 kilometres (56 mi) west of <span class="loc">Monterrey</span>, Nuevo León. As of the 2005 census, <span class="loc">Saltillo</span> had a population of 725,095 people. 823,098 people reside within the metropolitan area, making it the 19th biggest metro area in the country. The metro area comprises the municipalities of <span class="loc">Saltillo</span>, <span class="loc">Ramos Arizpe</span>, and <span class="loc">Arteaga</span>. <span class="loc">El Cerro</span> del Pueblo (The People's Hill) and its 4-metre (13 ft) cross overlook the city. The city's elevation, at 1,600 metres (5,200 ft), makes it cooler and windier than the neighboring <span class="loc">city of Monterrey</span>. <span class="loc">Saltillo</span> lies near the <span class="loc">city of Arteaga</span> and in the Chihuahuan Desert. The city is flanked by the Zapalinamé mountains, which are part of the <span class="loc">Sierra Madre Oriental</span>. By looking at the relief of the mountains, one can see, according to local legend, the relief of Zapalinamé, chieftain of the Guachichil tribe.</p>
