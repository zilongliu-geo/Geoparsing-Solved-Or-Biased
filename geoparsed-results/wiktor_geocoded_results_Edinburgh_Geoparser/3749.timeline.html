  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, locally also referred to as Montco, is a county located in the Commonwealth of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 799,874, making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, after <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="loc">Allegheny Counties</span>. The county seat is <span class="loc">Norristown</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is very diverse, ranging from farms and open land in Upper Hanover to densely populated rowhouse streets in <span class="loc">Cheltenham</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is included in the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, <span class="loc">PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is a suburban county northwest of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>, and marks the region's northern border, with the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley region of the state to the north. In <span class="date">2010</span>, it was the 51st wealthiest county in the country (measured by median household income). In <span class="date">2008</span>, it was named the 9th Best Place to Raise a Family by <span class="loc">Forbes</span>. The county was created on <span class="date">September 10, 1784</span>, out of land originally part of <span class="loc">Philadelphia County</span>. The first courthouse was housed in the Barley Sheaf Inn. It is believed to have been named either for <span class="per">Richard Montgomery</span>, an American Revolutionary War general killed in <span class="date">1775</span> while attempting to capture <span class="loc">Quebec City</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, or for the Welsh <span class="loc">county of Montgomeryshire</span> (which was named after one of William the Conqueror's main counselors, <span class="per">Roger de Montgomerie</span>), as it was part of the Welsh Tract, an area of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> settled by Quakers from <span class="loc">Wales</span>. Early histories of the county indicate the origin of the county's name as uncertain.</p><br><br>
