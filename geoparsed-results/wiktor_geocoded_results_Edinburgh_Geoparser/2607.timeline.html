  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> is a historic unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> is located about 20 miles south of Antelope, and 10 miles east of <span class="loc">Ashwood</span>. The area was first known as "<span class="loc">Axehandle</span>", and later as "<span class="per">Kilts</span>". <span class="loc">Axehandle</span> was located at 44.7506839°N 120.6511421°W﻿ / 44.7506839; -120.6511421﻿ (<span class="loc">Axehandle</span>). It was about a quarter mile south of <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>. The locale of <span class="loc">Axehandle</span> was named for <span class="loc">Axehandle</span> Spring, which was given its name in the late 19th century by some wood haulers from Antelope who found a broken axehandle near a watering hole while working to bring wood from the <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span>. The "<span class="loc">Axehandle</span>" moniker came to comprise the area of several ranches. <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> is located at 44.7542950°N 120.6511423°W﻿ / 44.7542950; -120.6511423﻿ (<span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>). The name was coined by <span class="per">Joe Brannon</span> for a brawl ("donnybrook", named for the <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> Fair, which took place in <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>, <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>) among some Irish sheepherders during the homestead era. At one time <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> had a school. <span class="per">Jesse Kilts</span> homesteaded in the area, and when a post office was established on <span class="date">September 15, 1914</span>, it was named for <span class="per">Mr. Kilts</span>, whose wife, <span class="per">Ruth</span>, was the first postmaster. <span class="per">Kilts</span> post office closed on <span class="date">June 29, 1940</span>. According to <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Geographic Names, <span class="per">Kilts</span> was considered a newcomer in the area, and longtime residents have always called the locale "<span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>" instead of "<span class="per">Kilts</span>". Modern atlases show the locale as "<span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>". The location of <span class="per">Kilts</span> post office moved many times, as was common in the pioneer era. According to author <span class="per">Ralph Friedman</span>, as of <span class="date">1993</span> only one of the private homes in which the post office was located was still standing, all the rest having been burned or torn down. <span class="per">Kilts</span>, which is the only one of the three locations not marked as a "historical" populated place by the USGS, is shown as currently being located at 44.7387402°N 120.5955845°W﻿ / 44.7387402; -120.5955845﻿ (<span class="per">Kilts</span>), about 4 miles east of <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>.</p><br><br>
