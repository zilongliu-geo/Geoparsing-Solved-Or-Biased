<p>Jackson is a city in Cape <span class="loc">Girardeau County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,758 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Cape <span class="loc">Girardeau County</span>. It is a principal city of the Cape Girardeauâ€“Jackson, <span class="loc">MO-IL Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. In 1813, Cape <span class="loc">Girardeau County</span> succeeded Cape <span class="loc">Girardeau District</span>, and the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of General Quarter-Sessions of the Peace in <span class="loc">Cape Girardeau</span> were superseded by the Court of Common Pleas, leading to a new seat of justice. The seat of the county and the courts were at first held on the plantation of Thomas Bull about one and one-half mile south of present-day Jackson. Land was then purchased along Hubble Creek for the county seat in 1814. The first post office was established in 1814 when the area was called Birdstown. The name was changed to Jackson on August 31, 1819, named for Andrew Jackson, a general popular for his role in the War of 1812. It was the first town to be named after Andrew Jackson. The town was platted in 1815. The <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Herald, the third newspaper in state, was established here on June 25, 1819. In 1818, the town already had a population of 300. The first county courthouse was built in 1818 on Jackson's public square.</p>
