  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Union County</span> is the northeasternmost county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 4,549, making it the fourth-least populous county in <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Clayton. The county was formed in <span class="date">1894</span>. <span class="loc">Union County</span> borders <span class="loc">Colorado</span> to the north, and <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> and <span class="loc">Texas</span> to the east. <span class="loc">Union County</span>, was created by an act of the territorial legislation in <span class="date">1893</span> and was officially recognized on <span class="date">January 1, 1894</span>, when the first slate of elected county officials received their oaths of office. The county is named “Union” because the citizens were united in their desire for the creation of a new county out of three existing <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> counties. <span class="loc">Union County</span> was subsequently “carved up” by the creation of additional counties, Quay in <span class="date">1903</span> and <span class="loc">Harding</span> in <span class="date">1920</span>. At one time, <span class="loc">Union County</span> had a population of over 20,000. There were a number of bustling communities such as <span class="per">Amistad, Hayden</span>, Sedan, <span class="loc">Pasamonte</span>, <span class="loc">Gladstone</span>, Mt Dora, <span class="loc">Grenville</span>, <span class="loc">Des Moines</span>, <span class="loc">Folsom</span> and <span class="loc">Dedman</span> (<span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Capulin</span>).</p><br><br>
