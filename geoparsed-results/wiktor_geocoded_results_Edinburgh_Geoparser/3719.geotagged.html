<p><span class="loc">Bay City</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Bay County</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, located near the base of the <span class="loc">Saginaw Bay</span> on <span class="loc">Lake Huron</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city's population was 34,932, and is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Bay City</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Saginaw-Bay City-Saginaw Township North Combined Statistical Area. The city, along with nearby Midland and Saginaw, form the "Tri-Cities" region of Central <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, which has more recently been called the "Great Lakes Bay" region. The city is geographically divided by the <span class="loc">Saginaw River</span>, and travel between the east and west sides of the city is made possible by four modern drawbridges; Liberty Bridge, Veterans Memorial Bridge, Independence Bridge, and Lafayette Avenue Bridge, which allow large ships to travel easily down the river. The city is served by MBS International Airport, located in nearby <span class="loc">Freeland</span>, and James Clements Municipal Airport. Leon Tromble is regarded as the first settler within the limits of <span class="loc">Bay County</span>, in an area which would become <span class="loc">Bay City</span>. In 1831, he built a log cabin on the east bank of the Saginaw river. <span class="loc">Bay City</span> was first established in 1837, and was incorporated as a city in 1865. In 1834 John B. Trudell built a log-cabin near the present corner of Seventeenth and Broadway. Trudell later purchased land that extended from his residence north along the river to what later became the location for the Industrial Brownhoist, making him the first permanent resident of what has become <span class="loc">Bay County</span>. <span class="loc">Bay City</span> became the largest community in the county and the location of the county seat of government. Most of the county's agencies and associations are located here. The city shares common borders with <span class="loc">Essexville</span> and the townships of <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, <span class="loc">Frankenlust</span>, <span class="loc">Hampton</span>, <span class="loc">Merritt</span>, <span class="loc">Monitor</span>, and <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>.</p>
