<p><span class="loc">Holbrook</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Derbyshire</span> at the southern end of the <span class="loc">Pennines</span> around five miles north of Derby, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> lies about two miles to the north-east of <span class="loc">Duffield</span>, the parish of which it was a part, being within <span class="loc">Duffield</span> <span class="loc">Frith</span>. When the latter was seized by King Henry III following the rebellion of Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby it appears to have been spared. However it became the property of Edmund Crouchback along with the rest of the <span class="loc">Frith</span>. It was sold by the Crown to various local copyholders in the reign of Charles I. It included the capital messuage, called Cocksbench, or <span class="loc">Coxbench</span> Hall. <span class="loc">Coxbench</span>, which is a hamlet just to the south, is supposed to have been the "Herdebi" mentioned in the Domesday Survey, as held under Henry de Ferrers; and the adjoining part of the manor of <span class="loc">Horsley</span> is supposed to have been the "Herdebi" held under Ralph de Burun. In 1863, <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> (or Holbrooke) was created as a separate parish from that of <span class="loc">Duffield</span>. The church of St. Michael is a simple construction in stone built in 1761 by Rev. S. Bradshaw. It was rebuilt and enlarged in 1841 by the MP William Evans.</p>
