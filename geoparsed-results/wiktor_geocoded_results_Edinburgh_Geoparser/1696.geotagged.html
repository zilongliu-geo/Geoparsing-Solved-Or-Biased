<p>Allen is a 6th-class city in <span class="loc">Floyd County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 150 at the 2000 census. Allen was first settled in the early nineteenth century. The first post office was named Mouth of Beaver and was established on August 21, 1854 (Thomas P. Johns, postmaster). The town began to develop rapidly c. 1904-1905 after the establishment of a <span class="loc">Chesapeake</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Railroad</span> station. The station was interchangeably known as <span class="loc">Beaver Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Beaver Creek</span> Junction. In 1905, another post office opened and was named Allen after local resident, T.J. Allen. The town was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1913. In 1936, the railroad station was renamed to prevent confusion during mail delivery. The section of the city known as <span class="loc">New Allen</span> began to develop in 1937 after a bridge was constructed across the <span class="loc">Levisa</span> <span class="loc">Fork River</span>. Allen is located at 37°36′48″N 82°43′33″W (37.613421, -82.725826). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2), all land. Wesley Christian School</p>
