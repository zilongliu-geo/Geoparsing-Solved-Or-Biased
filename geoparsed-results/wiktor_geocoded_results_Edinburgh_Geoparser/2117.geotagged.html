<p><span class="loc">Waterford</span> is an unincorporated village in the <span class="loc">Catoctin</span> Valley of <span class="loc">Loudoun County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, located along <span class="loc">Catoctin</span> Creek. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> is 47 miles (76 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span>, and 7 miles (11 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Leesburg</span>. The entire village and surrounding countryside is a National Historic Landmark district. In the 1810 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the population center of the <span class="loc">United States</span> was recorded as being just northwest of the village. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> was established around 1733 by Amos Janney, a <span class="loc">Quaker</span> from <span class="loc">Bucks County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. <span class="loc">Janney</span> purchased 400 acres (1.6 km2) on the south fork of <span class="loc">Catoctin</span> Creek and established a grist mill and saw mill in the area in the 1740s. Due to the success of the mills, the settlement became known as "Janney's Mill". The town grew quickly as a center of commerce for growers of grain. Amos Janney died in 1747, leaving his estate to his sixteen-year-old son, Mahlon. Mahlon replaced the original log mill with a two-story structure. The village continued to grow, and in 1780, 12 acres (49,000 m2) on the south side of Main Street were subdivided into 15 lots, upon which shops and homes were built. By the 1790s, the village was known as <span class="loc">Waterford</span>, named after the <span class="loc">city of Waterford</span>, in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, where some of its founders had once lived before immigrating to the <span class="loc">United States</span>. New residents continued to come from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, as Quakers were followed by Presbyterians, Lutherans, Baptists, and Methodists. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> was also populated by African-Americans, both free and enslaved.</p>
