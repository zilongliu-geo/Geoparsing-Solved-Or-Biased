  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hanover</span> is a town in the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Ontario</span> with a population of about 7,500 residents. It is located in southern <span class="loc">Grey County</span>, west of <span class="loc">Durham</span> and east of <span class="loc">Walkerton</span> on Grey/Bruce Road 4. <span class="per">Hanover</span> is between <span class="loc">Grey County</span> and <span class="loc">Bruce County</span> and therefore is ideally located to provide a center of commerce and services for the 12,500 residents of the adjacent villages of <span class="org">The Municipality of West Grey</span>. <span class="per">Hanover</span> has its own City Hall, Police Department and award winning <span class="per">Hanover</span> and <span class="per">District</span> Hospital. It was over <span class="date">160 years ago</span>, in the <span class="date">year 1849</span>, that our first pioneer, <span class="per">Abraham Buck</span>, stood on the banks of the <span class="loc">Saugeen River</span> and looked about him to behold the thick forest – good hardwood timber - the realm of the deer, the bear and the wolf. The sky was filled with wild pigeons and the streams teamed with fish. It was at this moment that he expressed the famous words written above. <span class="per">Mr. Buck</span> decided to stay and others were quick to follow. Christian Hassenjager, the first of many German settlers, who was to suggest the name of <span class="per">Hanover</span>; Abram <span class="per">Z. Gottwals</span>, a missionary with the Evangelical Church; <span class="per">Duncan Campbell</span>, who became postmaster; <span class="per">Edward Goodeve</span>, who had one of the first stores; entrepreneurs such as <span class="per">Henry Proctor Adams</span> who built the dam and the first mill and drew up plans for a new proposed village – a man of vision who could foresee the growth of <span class="date">the future</span>; <span class="per">Dr. Landerkin</span>, our first doctor, who let his horse decide which turns to take and ended up in <span class="per">Hanover</span>… and finally, <span class="per">Daniel Knechtel</span>, an eager, hard-working man who arrived in <span class="date">1864</span> with a bag of tools on his back and began making furniture in a small barn behind his house. His vision and determination, also, was to guide <span class="per">Hanover</span> for more than <span class="date">a century</span>. Our community grew and prospered because of the struggles of these first pioneers.</p><br><br>
