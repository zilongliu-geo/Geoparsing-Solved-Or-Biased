The closest attraction is the <span class="loc">Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge</span>. Between Alamo and the town of Rachel is the site of the Devonian Alamo Impact Breccia. According to the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span>, the Alamo CDP has an area of 30.3 square miles (78.4 km2), all of it land. Alamo attracts tourists and truckers traveling from <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> to <span class="loc">northern Nevada</span> and <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. Attractions include the nearby warm springs, wildlife refuge, Extraterrestrial Highway and Area 51. Gas stations in Alamo cater to these tourists by offering alien memorabilia.
