<p>The Royal Free Hospital in <span class="loc">London</span> yesterday said a nurse suffering with complications after <span class="loc">Ebola</span>, Pauline Cafferkey, is "critically ill" after her condition deteriorated. Cafferkey, 39, was readmitted to an isolation unit at the Royal Free on the night of October 8â€“9 where she had spent time earlier in the year after contracting <span class="loc">Ebola</span> in <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span> whilst treating patients with the infection. Cafferkey visited an out of hours GP clinic on October 5 where her symptoms were not linked to <span class="loc">Ebola</span>, before deciding to go to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> on October 6 where she was treated at the hospital's infectious diseases unit. Two days later, she was flown by plane to the Royal Free. She is the only person known to suffer with <span class="loc">Ebola</span> in this way for a second time, which can remain in the body after an initial recovery.</p>
