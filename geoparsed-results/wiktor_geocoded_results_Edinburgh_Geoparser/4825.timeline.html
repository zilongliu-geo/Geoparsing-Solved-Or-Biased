  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Churchill</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Latrobe</span> Valley, located in central <span class="loc">Gippsland</span> in the east of <span class="per">Victoria</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The town had a population of 4,588 at the <span class="date">2006</span> census, and is part of the <span class="loc">Latrobe City</span> local government area. The town was named in honour of former British leader Sir <span class="per">Winston Churchill</span>. <span class="per">Churchill</span> was formerly known as <span class="per">Hazelwood, Victoria</span> and began as a service centre for the <span class="per">Hazelwood</span> Power Station and future replacement for <span class="loc">Yallourn</span> and <span class="loc">Morwell</span> townships. The site was chosen for its pleasant location at the foot of the Strzelecki Ranges, overlooking <span class="per">Hazelwood</span> pondage. It was relatively free from air pollution, is not above rich coalfields and is in close proximity to the larger towns and power stations in the <span class="loc">Latrobe</span> Valley. Construction of <span class="per">Churchill</span> began in <span class="date">1965</span>. In <span class="date">that year</span> the first two houses in <span class="per">Churchill</span> were completed and occupied by the <span class="per">Arch</span> and <span class="per">Ayers</span> families who received morning paper deliveries from <span class="org">Yinnar General Store</span>, and milk delivery from <span class="per">John Koedijk</span>. Within <span class="date">a week</span> five more families arrived and so the town began to grow street by street. The town was sufficiently advanced for the Post Office to open on <span class="date">11 April 1966</span>. The shopping centre in <span class="per">Churchill</span> was officially opened on <span class="date">July 1967</span>, the first two shops (butcher and pharmacy) having opened <span class="date">19 May 1967</span>. In <span class="date">that year</span> many new traders opened for business. All the shop keepers were offered a commission house in <span class="per">Churchill</span> for their use. The <span class="per">Churchill</span> Newsagency opened in <span class="date">1967</span> and was run by <span class="per">Ian</span> and <span class="per">Winifred</span> <span class="loc">Jones</span> who had previously run the <span class="org">Yinnar General Store</span>. <span class="per">A Tattersalls</span> agency was established in <span class="date">1975</span>. The <span class="per">Churchill</span> Newsagency business was later purchased in <span class="date">April 1978</span> by <span class="per">Jack</span> and <span class="per">Olive</span> <span class="loc">Robson</span></p><br><br>
