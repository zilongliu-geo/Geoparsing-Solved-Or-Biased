  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Crosse</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> and the county seat of La <span class="loc">Crosse County</span>. Lying alongside the <span class="loc">Mississippi River</span>, <span class="loc">La Crosse</span> is the largest <span class="loc">city on Wisconsin</span>'s western border. The city's estimated population in <span class="date">2014</span> was 52,440. The city forms the core of and is the principal city in the La Crosse-Onalaska, <span class="loc">WI-MN Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which includes all of La <span class="loc">Crosse County</span> and <span class="loc">Houston County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, with a combined population of 135,298. <span class="loc">La Crosse</span> is home to the <span class="org">University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, Viterbo University</span>, and <span class="org">Western Technical College</span>. A regional technology and medical hub, <span class="loc">La Crosse</span> has received high rankings from some magazines in health, well-being, quality of life, and education. The first Europeans to see the site of <span class="loc">La Crosse</span> were French fur traders who traveled the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River in the late 17th century. There is no written record, however, of any visit to the site until <span class="date">1805</span>, when Lt. <span class="per">Zebulon Pike</span> mounted an expedition up the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River for the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Pike recorded the location's name as "Prairie <span class="loc">La Crosse</span>." The name originated from the game with sticks that resembled a bishop's crozier or la crosse in French, which was played by Native Americans there.</p><br><br>
