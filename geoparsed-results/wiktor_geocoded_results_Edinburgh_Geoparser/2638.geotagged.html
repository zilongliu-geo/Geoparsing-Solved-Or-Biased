<p><span class="loc">Fontana</span> (/fɒnˈtænə/) is a city of 203,003 residents in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Bernardino County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. Founded by Azariel Blanchard Miller in 1913, it remained essentially rural until World War II, when entrepreneur Henry J. Kaiser built a large steel mill in the area. It is now a regional hub of the trucking industry, with Interstate 10 and State Route 210 transecting the city from east to west, and Interstate 15 passing diagonally through its northwestern quadrant. It is home to the largest of the <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Bernardino County</span> system libraries, a renovated historic theater, a municipal park, and the Auto Club Speedway on the site of the Kaiser Steel Mill. <span class="loc">Fontana</span> also hosts the <span class="loc">Fontana</span> Days Half Marathon and 5K run. This race is the fastest half-marathon course in the world. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau estimated <span class="loc">Fontana</span>'s 2013 population at 203,003, making it the second most populous city in <span class="loc">San Bernardino</span> county and the 20th largest in the state. <span class="loc">Fontana</span> was founded in 1913 by Azariel Blanchard Miller. Within a few years it became an agricultural town of citrus orchards, vineyards and chicken ranches astride <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66 (now known as Foothill Boulevard). The <span class="loc">Fontana</span> area was radically transformed during World War II when Henry J. Kaiser built one of only two steel mills west of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River outside the city limits. To provide for the plant workers' health needs, Henry J. Kaiser constructed the <span class="loc">Fontana</span> Kaiser Permanente medical facility, now the largest managed care organization in the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p>
