  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>South Korean authorities are refusing to allow more protests against the government's decision to allow beef imports from the <span class="loc">United States</span>, after hundreds of people were injured in clashes with riot police overnight <span class="date">Saturday</span>. Around 300 police buses blocked protesters from entering the plaza in front of <span class="loc">Seoul City</span> Hall on <span class="date">Sunday</span>, where a candlelight vigil was scheduled for that night. Any rally held after sunset without police permission is considered illegal. Nevertheless, the daily vigils have continued for <span class="date">weeks</span>, with as many as 80,000 in attendance. After the plaza was sealed off, a group of about 1,700 protesters gathered in nearby streets, chanting slogans that urged <span class="per">President Lee Myung-Bak</span> to cancel his decision allowing <span class="loc">U.S.</span> beef imports. Around 70 people were detained by police for illegally occupying roads, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported, but no major clashes occurred. Over 200 protesters and police officers were injured in <span class="date">Saturday</span>'s protests. The demonstration turned violent when some protesters tried to drag away police buses used to prevent entry into Cheongwadae, the President's house. Riot police responded by spraying water cannons and fire extinguishers at the protesters, who threw stones, water bottles and eggs at police.</p><br><br>
