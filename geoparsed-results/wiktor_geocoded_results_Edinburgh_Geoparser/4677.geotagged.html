<p><span class="loc">Sumba</span> (Indonesian: <span class="loc">Pulau Sumba</span>) is an island in eastern <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>, is one of the <span class="loc">Lesser Sunda Islands</span>, and is in the <span class="loc">province of East</span> <span class="loc">Nusa Tenggara</span>. <span class="loc">Sumba</span> has an area of 11,153 square kilometres (4,306 square miles), and the population was 656,259 at the 2010 Census. To the northwest of <span class="loc">Sumba</span> is <span class="loc">Sumbawa</span>, to the northeast, across the <span class="loc">Sumba Strait</span> (<span class="loc">Selat Sumba</span>), is Flores, to the east, across the <span class="loc">Savu Sea</span>, is <span class="loc">Timor</span>, and to the south, across part of the <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span>, is <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Historically, this island exported sandalwood and was known as <span class="loc">Sandalwood Island</span>. Before colonization by western Europeans in the 1500s, <span class="loc">Sumba</span> was inhabited by Melanesian and Austronesian people. In 1522, through the Portuguese, the first ships from <span class="loc">Europe</span> arrived, and by 1866 <span class="loc">Sumba</span> belonged to the <span class="loc">Dutch East Indies</span>, although the island did not come under real Dutch administration until the twentieth century. Jesuits opened a mission in Laura, <span class="loc">West Sumba</span> in 1866. Despite contact with western cultures, <span class="loc">Sumba</span> is one of the few places in the world in which megalithic burials, are used as a 'living tradition' to inter prominent individuals when they die. Burial in megaliths is a practice that was used in many parts of the world during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, but has survived to this day in <span class="loc">Sumba</span>, and has raised significant interest from scholars. At Anakalang, for instance, quadrangular adzes have been unearthed. Another long-lasting tradition is the sometimes lethal game of pasola, in which teams of often several hundred horse-riders fight with spears.</p>
