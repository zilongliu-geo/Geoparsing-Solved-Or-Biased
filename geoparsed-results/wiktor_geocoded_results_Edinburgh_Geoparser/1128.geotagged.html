<p><span class="loc">Daqing</span> (Chinese: 大庆; pinyin: Dàqìng; formerly romanized as <span class="loc">Taching</span>) is a prefecture-level city in the west of <span class="loc">Heilongjiang province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. The name literally means "Great Celebration". <span class="loc">Daqing</span> is known as the Oil Capital of <span class="loc">China</span> and has experienced a phenomenal boom since oil was discovered there in 1959. Its population was 2,904,532 at the 2010 PRC National Census, of whom 1,415,268 lived in the built-up area in 4 out of the total of 5 urban districts, i.e. (<span class="loc">Sartu</span>, <span class="loc">Longfeng</span>, <span class="loc">Ranghulu</span> and <span class="loc">Honggang</span>). The region now known as Daqing Prefecture was a reasonably insignificant place until the Qing Dynasty, known only as an unsettled hunting ground of Dörbet Oirat tribes due to its wetland and prairies. The region began to grow slightly after Czarist <span class="loc">Russia</span> constructed the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) through the area in 1898. The railway has a station at <span class="loc">Sartu</span> in today's <span class="loc">Sartu District</span>. It was not until 1959 that oil was discovered in the region as part of the large scale oil exploration put into motion across the Northeast <span class="loc">China</span> Plain. The Daqing oilfield was discovered in the late 1950s, and drilling began in 1958. A town with the same name was founded in 1959 to house workers extracting oil and gas from the Daqing oilfield and to host industries which could take advantage of the energy and petrochemicals, shortly before the 10th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. The name <span class="loc">Daqing</span> literally means "Great Celebration". On 26 May 1960, <span class="loc">Anda City</span> was established at former Anda town (today's <span class="loc">Anda City</span> in Suihua prefecture), administering Daqing oilfield area. Five months later, the administrative organs of the oilfield relocated in <span class="loc">Sartu</span>. On 23 June 1964, the city was established <span class="loc">Anda</span> special administrative region, with <span class="loc">Anda county</span> administering its surrounding area. On 14 December 1979, the city was separated from <span class="loc">Anda</span> and was renamed <span class="loc">Daqing</span> after the oilfield.</p>
