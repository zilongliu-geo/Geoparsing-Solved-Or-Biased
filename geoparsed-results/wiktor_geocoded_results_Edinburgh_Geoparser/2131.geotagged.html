<p>Troy is a city in <span class="loc">Latah County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located in the eastern part of the <span class="loc">Palouse region</span>, its population was 862 at the 2010 census. Troy is located at 46°44′19″N 116°46′15″W (46.738571, -116.770785)., east of <span class="loc">Moscow</span> on State Highway 8, at an elevation of 2,487 feet (758 m) above sea level. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.79 square miles (2.05 km2), all of it land. The community was originally known as Huffs Gulch when J. Wesley Seat homesteaded in the area in 1885. In 1890, area businessman John P. Vollmer rechristened the area with his own surname when he brought the railroad through. Vollmer gained much of his 30,000 acres of land by foreclosing on the bank loans of local farmers. This made him so unpopular that in 1897 the residents decided to rename the town. Local legend states that the name Troy was selected when a Greek railroad worker offered free shots of whiskey to any who would support the name. The defunct Tamarack Ski Area was 7 miles (11 km) northwest of Troy on <span class="loc">East Moscow Mountain</span>, near the top of Tamarack Road. Founded in 1966, the ski hill operated intermittently due to varying conditions, and seldom after 1980. The primary lift, a T-bar, was removed in 1992 and its A-frame lodge was later razed.</p>
