  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lee</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Berkshire County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> settled by. It is part of the <span class="loc">Pittsfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, metropolitan statistical area.

The first non-native settlement in the area was known as <span class="loc">Dodgetown</span> as early as <span class="date">1760</span>. <span class="loc">Dodgetown</span> was named after its founding settler, <span class="per">Asahel Dodge</span>, who immigrated to the area from Cape Cod. <span class="per">Lee</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1777</span> from parts of <span class="loc">Great Barrington</span> and <span class="loc">Washington</span>. It is named after Revolutionary War General <span class="per">Charles Lee</span>. <span class="per">Lee</span> is a former mill town. In the <span class="date">autumn of 1786</span> during Shays' Rebellion, about 250 followers of <span class="per">Daniel Shays</span> encountered state troops commanded by General <span class="per">John Paterson</span> near <span class="loc">East Lee</span>. The Shaysites paraded a fake cannon crafted from a yarn beam, and the troops fled. Early industries included agriculture, lumbering, and lime making.

The Smith Paper Company discovered how to manufacture paper solely from wood pulp in <span class="date">1867</span>, and through the 1870s was the largest producer of paper in the country. The mills previously owned by Smith Paper Company were closed in <span class="date">2008</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="per">Lee</span> has only a single papermaking facility.</p><br><br>
