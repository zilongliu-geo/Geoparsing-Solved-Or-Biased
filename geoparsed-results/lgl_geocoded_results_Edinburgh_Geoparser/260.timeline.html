  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Israel</span> floods Lebanese farmlands, destroys crops . <span class="loc">BEIRUT</span>: <span class="loc">Israel</span> deliberately flooded Lebanese farmlands with excess rainwater from an Israeli orchard, located off the southern town of <span class="loc">Mais</span> al-Jabal <span class="date">early Tuesday</span>, ruining crops and properties, the state-run national news agency said. The Lebanese Army and the United Nations Interim Force in <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> (UNIFIL) dispatched teams to look into the incident, which drew protests from the southern residents. <span class="date">Tuesday</span>'s flooding is part of a systematic practice by the Israeli authorities to turn the highly-fertile land into swamps by channeling rainwater into the fields via trenches, which were dug for that purpose. The Lebanese Army and UNIFIL have tried to block the water channels to protect the crops. Separately, UNIFIL's media coordinator, Dhalia Farran, reiterated calls for <span class="loc">Israel</span> to hand over official maps detailing where the Israeli army dropped cluster bombs during the <span class="date">summer 2006</span> war.</p><br><br>
