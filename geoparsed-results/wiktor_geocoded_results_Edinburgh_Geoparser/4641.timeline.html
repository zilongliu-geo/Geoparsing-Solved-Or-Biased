  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>This article is about the town of <span class="loc">Walpole</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place <span class="loc">Walpole</span>, please see the article <span class="per">Walpole</span> (CDP), <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. <span class="per">Walpole</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and also encompasses the entirely distinct entity of <span class="per">Walpole</span> (CDP), with its much smaller area of 2.9 square miles and smaller population of 5198 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Walpole</span> Town, as the Census refers to the actual town, is located about 13 miles (21 km) south of Downtown Boston and 23.5 miles (37.8 km) north of Providence, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. The population was 24,070 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Walpole</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1659</span> and was considered a part of <span class="loc">Dedham</span> until officially incorporated in <span class="date">1724</span>. The town was named after Sir <span class="per">Robert Walpole</span>, de facto first Prime Minister of <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>. It started out as a territory that was claimed by the <span class="org">Neponset Native American</span> tribe. The Neponset tribe officially claimed the area that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Walpole</span>, and some of its surrounding territory in <span class="date">1635</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Dedham</span> was not included in this claim, so they began to negotiate with the Neponset tribe to gain land. In <span class="date">1636</span>, a deal was made between the town of <span class="loc">Dedham</span> and the Neponsets to grant <span class="loc">Dedham</span> lands that <span class="date">now</span> comprise the towns of <span class="loc">Walpole</span>, <span class="loc">Norwood</span>, <span class="loc">Westwood</span>, <span class="loc">Medfield</span>, <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> and <span class="loc">Dover</span> as well as <span class="loc">Dedham</span>. The land given to <span class="loc">Dedham</span> in this deal currently includes parts of 16 different towns.</p><br><br>
