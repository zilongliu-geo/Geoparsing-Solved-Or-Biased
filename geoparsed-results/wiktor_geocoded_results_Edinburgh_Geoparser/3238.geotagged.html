<p><span class="loc">Liaoyuan</span> (simplified Chinese: 辽源; traditional Chinese: 遼源; pinyin: Liáoyuán) is a prefecture-level city in <span class="loc">Jilin province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. It is bounded on the west and south by <span class="loc">Tieling</span> of <span class="loc">Liaoning province</span>, west and north by <span class="loc">Siping</span>, and east by <span class="loc">Tonghua</span> and <span class="loc">Jilin City</span>. <span class="loc">Liaoyuan</span> lies some 100 km (62 mi) south of <span class="loc">Changchun</span>, the provincial capital. Covering an area of 5,125 km2 (1,979 sq mi), <span class="loc">Liaoyuan</span> is the smallest among the prefecture-level divisions of <span class="loc">Jilin</span>. <span class="loc">Liaoyuan</span> has a total population of 1,176,645 in the prefecture, while the urban area has a population of 462,233. <span class="loc">Liaoyuan</span> was an imperial hunting ground during the Qing Dynasty, going by the name Shengjing Paddock (盛京圍場). Ordinary citizens were prohibited from entering this region until late 1800s, when waves of immigrants from <span class="loc">Hebei</span>, <span class="loc">Shandong</span> and <span class="loc">Henan</span> began to populate <span class="loc">Manchuria</span> (see Chuang Guandong). In 1902, Qing government established <span class="loc">Xi</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> County (西安縣) in this region, which became today's <span class="loc">Xi</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> District. The discovery of coal underground shortly afterwards brought prosperity to the city. Between 1931 and 1945, <span class="loc">Xi</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> was an important coal-mining city in Manchukuo and also the place where American Army General Jonathan M. Wainwright was held as a prisoner. During the Chinese Civil War after World War II, <span class="loc">Xi</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> was a focal point of the intense fighting between the Communist and Nationalist forces until the summer of 1947 when it was permanently captured by the Communist force. The city was renamed <span class="loc">Liaoyuan</span> (literally the source of the <span class="loc">East Liao River</span>) in 1952 as the former name conflicted with that of the much larger <span class="loc">city of Xi</span>'an in <span class="loc">Shaanxi province</span>. As a county-level city, <span class="loc">Liaoyuan</span> was under Siping Prefecture's jurisdiction till 1983, when it became a prefecture-level city, administering two districts and two counties.</p>
