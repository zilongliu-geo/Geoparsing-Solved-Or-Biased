<p><span class="loc">Casa Blanca</span> was an unincorporated community two miles (3 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Sandia</span> and twenty miles (32 km) northeast of Alice in extreme northeastern Jim <span class="loc">Wells County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The <span class="loc">Casa Blanca</span> or White House was part of a settlement established at the site around 1754 by Tomás Sánchez de la Barrera y <span class="loc">Gallardo</span>, captain of <span class="loc">Laredo</span>, who was ordered to find a suitable site for a new settlement. After surveying the country Sánchez selected a site on the banks of Peñitas Creek. A settlement was established there, and the White House was constructed of caliche blocks known as ciares. The house was built in the shape of a square with a courtyard in the center; the well in the courtyard also served as the end of a tunnel out of the building. Toward the end of the eighteenth century the house was used as a mission. The Spanish crown granted the land to Juan José de la Garza Montemayor and his sons Agustín, Perfecto, and Manuel on April 2, 1807. They used the <span class="loc">Casa Blanca</span> as a ranchhouse. According to records the land was occupied by their heirs until 1852. However, local legend has it that the Montemayor family was driven away by a band of outlaws, who in turn were driven out by hostile Indians. Subsequently various families occupied the house and the surrounding area, and a post office operated at the site from 1860 to 1866. The area continued to be inhabited by several families. In 1876 the land was purchased by John L. Wade. Because <span class="loc">Casa Blanca</span> was already established as a stopping point Wade established Wade City adjacent to it, platting streets and setting aside land for stores and churches. In 1893, the post office was reactivated. In 1896 Casa <span class="loc">Blanca-Wade City</span> had a combined estimated population of 150, a Methodist church, a general store, a gin, and a lumberyard. Wade City did not prosper, however, and by 1914 its population had decreased to thirty-five. The post office ceased operation in 1922.</p>
