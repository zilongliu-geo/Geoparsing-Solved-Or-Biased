  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Holbrook</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the town population was 10,791. Before European settlement, the area <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Holbrook</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, like all of <span class="loc">New England</span>, had long been inhabited by Algonquian-speaking peoples. <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> was first settled by Europeans (mostly British colonists) in <span class="date">1710</span> as the southern part of Old Braintree, and was officially incorporated on <span class="date">February 29, 1872</span>, the last town created from the former lands of <span class="loc">Braintree</span>. It was formerly known as <span class="loc">East Randolph</span>, being divided from <span class="loc">Randolph</span> by track from the Old Colony Railroad line. <span class="loc">Holbrook</span>'s development is typical of suburban Greater Boston. In the 18th and 19th <span class="date">centuries</span>, farming and cottage trades, particularly shoe production, dominated the economy. Slowly, the town evolved into a primarily residential community with many residents commuting to work in <span class="loc">Boston</span> proper and the primary employment within the town being in service industries. As was true of many towns in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, its residents served during the <span class="loc">United States</span> Civil War. Some members of the famed 54th <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Volunteer Infantry are buried in Union Cemetery. The impact of the War came not only from the residents' direct participation in the conflict, but was also from the need for production of boots for soldiers. It was during the Civil War that shoe production became a significant component of the town's economic life, and production moved decidedly from the home and into factories.</p><br><br>
