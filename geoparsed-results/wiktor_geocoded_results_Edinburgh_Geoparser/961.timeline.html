  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Columbus</span> /kəˈlʌmbəs/ is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Bartholomew County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 44,061 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In its built environment, the relatively small city has provided a unique place for noted Modern architecture. Located about 40 miles (64 km) south of <span class="loc">Indianapolis</span>, on the east fork of the <span class="loc">White River</span>, it is the state's 20th largest city. It is also the principal city of the <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses all of <span class="loc">Bartholomew County</span>. National Geographic Traveler ranked <span class="loc">Columbus</span> 11th on its historic destinations list in <span class="date">late 2008</span>, describing the city as "authentic, unique, and unspoiled." <span class="loc">Columbus</span> won the national contest "<span class="loc">America</span> in <span class="org">Bloom</span>" in <span class="date">2006</span>, and in <span class="date">2004</span> it was named one of "The Ten Most Playful Towns" by Nick Jr. Family Magazine. The <span class="date">July 2005</span> edition of GQ magazine named <span class="loc">Columbus</span> one of the "62 Reasons to Love Your Country". <span class="loc">Columbus</span> is the headquarters of the engine company <span class="org">Cummins, Inc</span>. The land which is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Columbus</span> was bought by General <span class="per">John Tipton</span> and <span class="per">Luke Bonesteel</span> in <span class="date">1820</span>. <span class="per">Tipton</span> built a log cabin on <span class="loc">Mount Tipton</span>, a small hill overlooking <span class="loc">White River</span> and the surrounding flat, heavily forested and swampy valley. The town was known as <span class="loc">Tiptonia</span>, named in honor of <span class="per">Tipton</span>. The town's name was changed to <span class="loc">Columbus</span> on <span class="date">March 20, 1821</span>. <span class="per">General Tipton</span> was upset by the name change and decided to leave the newly founded town. He later became the highway commissioner for the State of <span class="loc">Indiana</span> and was assigned to building a highway from <span class="loc">Indianapolis</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> to <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. When the road reached <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">Tipton</span> constructed the first bypass road ever built; it detoured south around the west side of <span class="loc">Columbus</span> en route to <span class="loc">Seymour</span>.</p><br><br>
