  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Clinton</span> is an unincorporated community situated on a peninsula in the middle of <span class="loc">Clinton Lake</span> in <span class="loc">Douglas County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town of <span class="per">Bloomington</span> was settled in <span class="date">June 1854</span> but was not called as such until <span class="date">April 1855</span> when <span class="per">Harrison Burson</span> applied to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Government for a post office. Within <span class="date">eight months</span> of the area being settled some 530 settlers were in the area that would become Bloomington-Clinton. The people of <span class="per">Bloomington</span> were greatly anti-slavery and helped slaves escape through the Underground Railroad. In <span class="date">early 1857</span>, the north half of <span class="per">Bloomington</span> was moved to a new location and the south portion of the town was renamed <span class="loc">Winchester</span>. <span class="loc">Winchester</span> was named after a city in <span class="loc">Illinois</span> as was <span class="per">Bloomington</span>. <span class="date">Later in the year</span> <span class="per">Bloomington</span> acted to become an incorporated city with <span class="loc">Winchester</span> following suit <span class="date">four days later</span>. <span class="loc">Winchester</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">February 20, 1857</span> under the name of <span class="per">Clinton</span>. The present name is after <span class="per">Clinton</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="per">Clinton</span> and <span class="per">Bloomington</span> quickly became rivals since they were only separated by about three miles. <span class="per">Bloomington</span> started losing ground in <span class="date">1858</span> when on <span class="date">August 30</span>, the post office was moved to <span class="per">Clinton</span>. Within <span class="date">the first five years</span> of existence, <span class="per">Clinton</span> constructed two schoolhouses, two churches and a town hall. In <span class="date">1869</span>, the <span class="per">Clinton</span> Cemetery was established on land already used for a cemetery and is considered one of the oldest burial grounds in <span class="loc">Douglas County</span>.</p><br><br>
