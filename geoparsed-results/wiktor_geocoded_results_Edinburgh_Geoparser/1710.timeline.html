  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is the capital of <span class="loc">Guyana</span>, located in Region 4, which is also known as the <span class="loc">Demerara-Mahaica region</span>. It is the country's largest urban centre. It is situated on the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> coast at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Demerara River</span> and it was nicknamed '<span class="loc">Garden City</span> of the Caribbean.' <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> serves primarily as a retail and administrative centre. It also serves as a financial services centre. The estimated population by the <span class="date">2012</span> <span class="loc">Guyana</span> census was 235,017 inhabitants. The <span class="loc">city of Georgetown</span> began as a small town in the 18th century. Originally, the capital of the Demerara-Essequibo colony was located on <span class="loc">Borselen Island</span> in the <span class="loc">Demerara River</span> under the administration of the Dutch. When the colony was captured by the British in <span class="date">1781</span>, Lieutenant-Colonel <span class="per">Robert Kingston</span> chose the mouth of the <span class="loc">Demerara River</span> for the establishment of a town which was situated between Plantations Werk-en-rust and <span class="loc">Vlissengen</span>. It was the French who made it a capital city when they colonized it in <span class="date">1782</span>. The French called the capital <span class="loc">Longchamps</span>. When the town was restored to the Dutch in <span class="date">1784</span>, it was renamed <span class="loc">Stabroek</span> after <span class="per">Nicolaas Geelvinck</span>, Lord of <span class="loc">Stabroek</span>, and President of the Dutch <span class="loc">West India</span> Company. Eventually the town expanded and covered the estates of <span class="loc">Vlissengen</span>, <span class="loc">La</span> <span class="per">Bourgade</span> and <span class="per">Eve</span> <span class="loc">Leary</span> to the North, and Werk-en-rust and <span class="loc">La</span> <span class="loc">Repentir</span> to the South.</p><br><br>
