<p>Chekhov (Russian: Че́хов) is a town and the administrative center of <span class="loc">Chekhovsky District</span> in <span class="loc">Moscow Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>. Population: 60,720 (2010 Census); 72,917 (2002 Census); 59,206 (1989 Census); 56,000 (1985). Originally named <span class="loc">Lopasnya</span> (Лопа́сня), after the <span class="loc">Lopasnya</span> River, it was granted town status and given its present name in 1954 in honor of writer Anton Chekhov. Within the framework of administrative divisions, Chekhov serves as the administrative center of <span class="loc">Chekhovsky District</span>. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within <span class="loc">Chekhovsky District</span> as the Town of Chekhov. As a municipal division, the Town of Chekhov is incorporated within Chekhovsky Municipal District as <span class="loc">Chekhov Urban</span> Settlement. Near Chekhov is the Russian General Staff wartime command post, buried deep underground, which is almost certainly linked directly to the <span class="loc">Kremlin</span> by an underground rail link—the Moscow Metro 2 line operated by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). On the outskirts of Chekhov lies the Davidov Hermitage, reputedly the richest monastery in <span class="loc">Russia</span>. It contains many churches from the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>
