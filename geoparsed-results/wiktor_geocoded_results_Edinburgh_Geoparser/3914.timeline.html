  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Aguilar</span> is a third class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Pangasinan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 39,529 people. The municipality was named after Spanish <span class="per">governor-general Rafael Maria</span> de <span class="loc">Aguilar</span>, who ordered the establishment of an independent civil political unit on <span class="date">16 July 1805</span> The Municipality of <span class="loc">Aguilar</span> had its early beginnings as cattle ranch founded by the Spaniards. The place was known then as Sitio Balubad, which was then still part of the town of Binalatongan (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">San Carlos</span>). On the western part were the <span class="loc">Zambales Mountains</span> with thick forests and verdant foliage. It was hunterâ€™s paradise with deer roaming here and there with an occasional wild boar making an appearance. The grass in the plains were succulent fare for fattening cattle and the water from the brooks and streams clear and sparkling. On the eastern part was the <span class="loc">Agno River</span>. At that time, there were no roads were yet established. There were footpaths which eventually roads providing access from one place to another. The river arteries constituted the main mode of transportation in the interior towns. Through these river systems, boats sailed from the <span class="loc">Ilocos provinces</span> in the North southwards to <span class="loc">Dagupan</span>, <span class="loc">Calasiao</span>, <span class="loc">Lingayen</span> and sometimes even as far as <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Isidro</span> <span class="loc">De</span> <span class="loc">Labrador</span>, <span class="loc">Salasa</span>, <span class="loc">Aguilar</span> and <span class="loc">Camiling</span>. Worth noting was the fossiliferous river bank in <span class="loc">Camiling</span> useful in making lime, while mineral waters consisting of ferruginous and alkaline waters were and are still found in <span class="loc">Aguilar</span> and <span class="loc">Mangatarem</span>. As a thriving place for cattle and bountiful rice harvests, it was natural for <span class="loc">Aguilar</span> to attract people from other towns to stay and settle in the place. The early settlers prospered and lived in peace and contentment. When the Spaniards in <span class="loc">Lingayen</span> heard of this flourishing village, they sent Spanish explorers through the town of <span class="loc">Salasa</span> to visit the place. Some Spanish soldiers and priest were left to organize a pueblo. In time, the clamor to convert the settlement into a town became popular. A petition was therefore, filed with the principales or municipal officials of Binalatongan to convert the village into a town. The petition was finally favorably endorsed.</p><br><br>
