<p><span class="loc">Middleton</span> is a small village in the <span class="loc">North Warwickshire district</span> of the <span class="loc">county of Warwickshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 630. At the time of the Domesday Book Middleton was under a Norman Overlord Hugh de Grandmesnil who had several holdings in <span class="loc">Warwickshire</span>. When he died it passed to the Marmions of <span class="loc">Tamworth</span>. In 1291 the estate was divided into three and <span class="loc">Middleton</span> was held by the de Frevilles. In the mid 15th century Sir Richard Bingham married Margaret Freville of <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span>. There is a brass memorial to Sir Richard in the Parish Church. When Margaret died in 1493 she left the estate to her grandson (by her first marriage) Sir Henry Willughby. Ornithologist Francis Willughby was born there in 1635. It stayed in the family until 1924. By the late 1970s <span class="loc">Middleton Hall</span> and the surrounding estate came under the ownership of the Amey Roadstone Construction (ARC) for sand and gravel extraction. The Hall and its outbuildings, with some remains dating back to the Norman period, was in serious danger of being lost. It was saved by the establishment of the <span class="loc">Middleton Hall</span> Trust in 1980, a group of volunteers who are restoring the Hall with the help of local authorities and national bodies. ARC have assisted in this by renting at a low rate the Hall and surroundings to the Trust, and by restoring a Tudor period stable block as a craft centre.</p>
