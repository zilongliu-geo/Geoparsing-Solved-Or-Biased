  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Temple is a town in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town was named after Temple, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. It is located at the end of <span class="loc">Maine</span> State Route 43 (Temple Road), and is said to be one of only two towns in <span class="loc">Maine</span> to be situated at the end of a public highway. The population was 528 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Hill-farmers from Temple, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, Old <span class="loc">North Yarmouth</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, and nearby <span class="loc">Farmington</span> settled the town beginning in <span class="date">1796</span>. It incorporated in <span class="date">1803</span>. Commercial sawmills operated on Temple Stream in the village for <span class="date">many years</span> in the 1800s and <span class="date">1900s</span>, providing the town a robust local economy. Logging is still vibrant in Temple, but its timber is <span class="date">now</span> trucked to mills in nearby towns. The town contains a town hall (formerly an elementary school), a post office in the former general store, a theater (formerly the Congregational Church), a fire station, and a youth baseball field, established in <span class="date">1957</span>, commemorating the life of <span class="per">Larry Boyce</span>, the former Temple Townies player and manager for whom the field is named.</p><br><br>
