  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Cookville Volunteer Fire Department</span> hosts 19th annual fundraiser <span class="date">Saturday</span>. The <span class="org">Cookville Volunteer Fire Department</span> will host its 19th annual fundraiser <span class="date">Saturday, March 28</span>, from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the fire station in <span class="loc">Cookville</span>, located on County Road 4045, behind the Cookville store. According to <span class="org">Cookville Fire</span> Chief <span class="per">Wesley McCollum</span>, patrons attending can expect a family-friendly environment with a hip hop for the kids and dominoes for the adults, as well as a scrumptious spread including brisket, crawfish, baked beans, potato salad and desserts prepared by volunteers, families and community members. A pie and cake auction will also be held at 6 p.m., <span class="per">McCollum</span> said, and door prizes will be given away. "We have tons of door prizes people have donated, and we will probably be giving away around four an hour," <span class="per">McCollum</span> said. The event will be free to the public but donations will be accepted and appreciated, he added. "We know not everyone can afford to donate right <span class="date">now</span>, but we want to welcome everyone to come out and visit with us and enjoy some good food and fun," <span class="per">McCollum</span> said.</p><br><br>
