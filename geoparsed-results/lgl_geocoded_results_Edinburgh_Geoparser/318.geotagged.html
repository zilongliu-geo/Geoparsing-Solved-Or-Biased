<p>Miami man gets 17 years in iPod scheme. A federal judge imposed the sentence Friday on 48-year-old Andres Leonel Pimstein, who pleaded guilty to 12 counts of wire fraud. Prosecutors say Pimstein raised some $50 million for his scheme, in which he claimed huge profits from iPods sales to <span class="loc">Chile</span>'s <span class="loc">Ripley</span> department store chain. Investment returns of between 18 percent and 36 percent were promised. But instead of actual sales, prosecutors say Pimstein created fake documents and used money from new investors to pay older investors. The scheme fell apart in spring 2008 when Pimstein failed to continue attracting investors.</p>
