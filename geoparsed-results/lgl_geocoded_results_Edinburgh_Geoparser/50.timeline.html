  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>New call for help in lynch case . MONROE - Federal and state law enforcement officials are nearly certain there are people living who can help them solve the <span class="date">1946</span> Moore's <span class="org">Ford</span> lynching. Top brass from the federal Department of Justice and the <span class="org">Georgia Bureau of Investigation</span> made a plea <span class="date">Saturday</span> in <span class="loc">Monroe</span> - just a few miles from the site of the country's last mass-lynching - for the public's help with one of their coldest cases. "With a pretty good degree of certainty, almost 100 percent, there are individuals here in <span class="loc">Walton County</span> who can help us solve this and provide details that would fill in the blank," said <span class="per">Gregory Jones</span>, special agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta office. <span class="per">Jones</span>, GBI Director <span class="per">Vernon Keenan</span> and <span class="per">Cynthia Deitle</span>, the FBI's civil rights unit chief, were among the panelists at a <span class="date">Saturday</span> discussion and film screening on the murders in the <span class="loc">Walton County</span> seat. Law enforcement officials sought to show they are serious about prosecuting the murders, in which an angry white mob shot to death two black sharecroppers and their wives <span class="date">July 25, 1946</span>, at the Moore's <span class="org">Ford</span> bridge between <span class="loc">Walton</span> and <span class="loc">Oconee</span> counties. They also wanted to continue publicizing the case and call for anyone with information to come forward and help with the investigation. "If we could solve the case through sheer resources, that would be done, but that is not what occurs," <span class="per">Keenan</span> said. "We've got to have cooperation from people who have direct knowledge or evidence about what happened. They have got to work with law enforcement for us to be able to prevail and solve this case." At the same time, the panelists admitted the difficulties inherent in investigating a nearly 63-year-old case and tried to tamp down expectations. "We still have some things to do, but I certainly don't want to raise expectations," <span class="per">Jones</span> said. However, he said, "We're not finished, and there are a number of things that we continue to pick up on." No matter how gruesome the crime, the rules of evidence still apply, <span class="per">Keenan</span> said. The horrific nature of the lynching of <span class="per">Roger</span> and <span class="per">Dorothy</span> <span class="per">Malcom</span> and <span class="per">George</span> and <span class="per">Mae Murray Dorsey</span>, and the national attention it received in the <span class="date">summer of 1946</span>, caused federal officials to put an "unprecedented amount of pressure" on FBI agents to solve the case back then, <span class="per">Jones</span> said. Two dozen federal agents swarmed the area, interviewing people and identifying 160 persons of interest. But they ran into a wall of silence from the local community and couldn't put together a case to arrest anyone. <span class="date">Today</span>, the case still is a priority for the FBI and GBI, the panelists said, but they still face a problem with cooperation from people who may know something. "It's not just a standard cold case homicide," said <span class="per">Deitle</span>, whose office is in charge of investigating a number old civil rights era crimes. "It's also a case where some victims' relatives, witnesses and even some perpetrators are still paralyzed by a climate of fear." Of the 107 cold cases the FBI currently is reviewing, the Moore's <span class="org">Ford</span> lynching is the oldest and involves the most victims and alleged perpetrators, <span class="per">Deitle</span> said. There have been a few breaks in the case in <span class="date">recent years</span>, though none appear to have gone anywhere. <span class="date">Last year</span>, FBI and GBI agents executed a search warrant at a house in <span class="loc">Walton County</span>'s rural Gratis community. After digging in the backyard of the home, agents seized some items and sent them to the GBI's crime lab. <span class="per">Keenan</span> declined to discuss the items seized or any other evidence in the case <span class="date">Saturday</span> because it could inhibit the ongoing investigation. <span class="date">Several years ago</span>, <span class="per">Keenan</span> thought about releasing to the public the GBI's investigative file on Moore's <span class="org">Ford</span>, he said following <span class="date">Saturday</span>'s event. He discussed it with the state attorney general, but they decided against it because there still is a chance of prosecution, he said. "I have seen many cases that we considered to be stagnant that ... there was no activity on and then with a phone call we suddenly piece together a case and go forward with an arrest and prosecution," he said. "That has happened many times in my career so I never believe that a case is hopeless. And I don't believe this one is." <span class="date">Saturday</span>'s event, sponsored by the Moore's <span class="org">Ford</span> Memorial Committee, also featured a screening of filmmaker <span class="per">Keith Beauchamp</span>'s documentary on the killings for the TV One network.</p><br><br>
