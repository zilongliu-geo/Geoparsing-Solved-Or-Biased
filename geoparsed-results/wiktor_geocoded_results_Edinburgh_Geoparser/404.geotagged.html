In June 1863, the Confederate cavalry under John Hunt Morgan had departed <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> on what would later become known as Morgan's Raid. Traveling through <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> and into Kentucky, Morgan eventually crossed into <span class="loc">Indiana</span>; he reached <span class="loc">Salem</span> on July 10, 1863, coming north from <span class="loc">Corydon</span>. Upon entering <span class="loc">Salem</span> at approximately 9 a.m., Morgan immediately took possession of the town and placed guards over the stores and streets. The cavalrymen burned the large, brick railroad depot, along with all the train cars on the track and the railroad bridges on each side of the town. Morgan demanded taxes from the two flour mills that belonged to DePauw and Knight, and from the Allen Wollen Mill. Morgan's men looted stores and took about $500 from the area before departing about 3 p.m.</p>
