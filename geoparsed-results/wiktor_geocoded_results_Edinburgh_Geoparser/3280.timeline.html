  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>For other places with the same name, see <span class="loc">Oakland</span>. <span class="loc">Oakland</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Kennebec County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Maine</span>. The population was 6,240 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="org">Gateway</span> to the <span class="loc">Belgrade Lakes</span> region, <span class="loc">Oakland</span> is 4 miles (6 km) west of <span class="loc">Waterville</span> and approximately 18 miles (29 km) north of <span class="loc">Augusta</span>, the state capital. It was first settled about <span class="date">1780</span> by colonists of English descent from <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. At that time, the region was known as <span class="per">Taconnet</span> after Indian Chief <span class="per">Taconnet</span>, an Abenaki sachem. It was incorporated by the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> in <span class="date">1771</span> as part of <span class="loc">Winslow</span>. In <span class="date">1802</span>, the area west of the <span class="loc">Kennebec River</span> was incorporated as <span class="loc">Waterville</span>. But manufacturers in the western section, who had created a separate center of industry and trade and were dissatisfied with its taxation, petitioned to have the district set off as a town. The Maine State Legislature complied, and on <span class="date">February 26, 1873</span> incorporated it as <span class="loc">West Waterville</span>. In <span class="date">1883</span>, it was renamed <span class="loc">Oakland</span>, presumably after all the oak trees in the town, though some favored the name <span class="loc">Weldon</span>.</p><br><br>
