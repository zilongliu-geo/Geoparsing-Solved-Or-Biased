  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> /ˈnjuːˌkɑːsəl/ metropolitan area is the second most populated area in <span class="org">the Australian</span> state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> and includes most of the <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> and <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span> local government areas. It is the hub of the Greater <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> area which includes most parts of the local government areas of <span class="loc">City of Newcastle</span>, City of <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span>, <span class="loc">City of Cessnock</span>, <span class="loc">City of Maitland and Port Stephens Council</span>. 162 kilometres (101 mi) NNE of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Hunter River</span>, it is the predominant city within the <span class="per">Hunter</span> Region. Famous for its coal, <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> is the largest coal exporting harbour in the world, exporting over 97 Mt of coal in <span class="date">2009</span>–10 with plans to expand annual capacity to 180 Mt by <span class="date">2013</span>. Beyond the city, the <span class="per">Hunter</span> Region possesses large coal deposits. Geologically, the area is located in the central-eastern part of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> basin. <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> and the lower <span class="per">Hunter</span> Region were traditionally occupied by the <span class="per">Awabakal</span> and <span class="per">Worimi</span> Aboriginal People, who called the area Malubimba. In <span class="date">September 1797</span> Lieutenant <span class="per">John Shortland</span> became the first European to explore the area. His discovery of the area was largely accidental; as he had been sent in search of a number of convicts who had seized HMS <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> as she was sailing from <span class="loc">Sydney</span> Cove. While returning, <span class="per">Lt. Shortland</span> entered what he later described as "a very fine river", which he named after <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>' Governor <span class="per">John Hunter</span>. He returned with reports of the deep-water port and the area's abundant coal. Over <span class="date">the next two years</span>, coal mined from the area was the <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> colony's first export.</p><br><br>
