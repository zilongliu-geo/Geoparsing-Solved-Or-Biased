  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Delta</span> is a district municipality in British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, and forms part of Greater Vancouver. Located south of <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, it is bordered by the <span class="loc">Fraser River</span> to the north, the <span class="loc">United States</span> (<span class="loc">Point Roberts</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>) to the south and the <span class="loc">city of Surrey</span> to the east. <span class="org">Delta</span> is composed of three distinct communities: <span class="loc">Ladner</span>, <span class="loc">Tsawwassen</span>, and <span class="loc">North Delta</span>. Prior to European settlement, <span class="org">Delta</span>'s flatlands and coastal shores were inhabited by the <span class="loc">Tsawwassen</span> indigenous peoples, of the <span class="org">Coast Salish First Nations</span>. The land was first sighted by Europeans in <span class="date">1791</span>, when Spanish explorer Lieutenant <span class="per">Francisco de Eliza</span> mistook the area for an island and named it "Isla Capeda". The first European settler in <span class="org">Delta</span> was <span class="per">James Kennedy</span> who pre-empted 135 acres in what later became <span class="loc">Annieville</span> in <span class="date">February 1860</span>. <span class="per">Thomas</span> and <span class="per">William</span> <span class="loc">Ladner</span>, began farming the area named after them in <span class="date">1868</span>. Farming and fishing helped the community grow quickly over <span class="date">the next few decades</span>. In <span class="date">1879</span>, the area was incorporated to become "<span class="org">Delta</span>", and the village of <span class="loc">Ladner</span> was made as its administrative centre.</p><br><br>
