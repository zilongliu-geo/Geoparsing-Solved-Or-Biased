  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Budget would reduce funding for public schools. A House-Senate conference committee agreed <span class="date">Thursday</span> on a state budget that reduces funding for public school districts but generally appears to leave higher education alone. That recommendation will be put to vote <span class="date">early next week</span>, said Rep. <span class="per">Tom Hawk</span>, a <span class="per">Manhattan Democrat</span>, who believes the proposal is likely to be approved. <span class="per">Hawk</span> said although the cuts were not favorable to K-12 education, he is "optimistic about the bipartisan consensus to use the stimulus dollars as much as possible."</p><br><br>
