<p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is the easternmost county of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. As of the 2010 census the population was 53,498. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Charles Town. The county was founded in 1801. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is part of the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, <span class="loc">DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was formed from <span class="loc">Berkeley County</span> in 1801 because the citizens of <span class="loc">southeastern Berkeley county</span> felt they had to travel too far to the county seat of <span class="loc">Martinsburg</span>. Charles Washington, the founder of Charles Town and brother to <span class="loc">George Washington</span> petitioned for a new county to be formed. It was named for Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence and third President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Virginia previously had a <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, which was lost to form the new state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. Accordingly, in the State records of Virginia, there will be listings for <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> from 1780-1792 and <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> from 1801-1863. Neither is still located in Virginia and despite naming a county after him twice, Virginia no longer has a county named for its hero Thomas Jefferson. The county was a frequent site of conflict during the civil war, as Union and Confederate lines moved back and forth along the <span class="loc">Shenandoah</span> Valley. Some towns in the county changed hands between the Union and Confederacy over a dozen times, including Charles Town, and especially Harpers Ferry.</p>
