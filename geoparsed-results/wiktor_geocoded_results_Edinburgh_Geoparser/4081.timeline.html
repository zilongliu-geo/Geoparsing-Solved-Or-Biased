  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Frankfort</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 16,422 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>. Brothers <span class="per">John, William</span> and <span class="per">Nicholas Pence</span>, previously of <span class="loc">Warren County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, settled on the land on which <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> <span class="date">now</span> stands in <span class="date">1869</span>, having entered it from the government in <span class="date">1867</span> and <span class="date">1868</span>. In <span class="date">1860</span>, the brothers donated 60 acres (240,000 m2) of the land to the county commissioners, a donation which led to the establishment of the county seat at that site rather than in Jefferson, a community which had also been vying for the honor. The new town was named <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> at the brothers' request and honors their German great-grandparents' home of <span class="loc">Frankfurt am Main</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> was laid off on the 60-acre (240,000 m2) tract by <span class="per">William Douglass</span>, the county agent, and the plat filed on <span class="date">June 8, 1830</span>. The original plat consisted of 64 lots in eight blocks surrounding a public square where the courthouse <span class="date">now</span> stands. The county board paid contractors <span class="per">Allen</span> &amp; Michael the sum of $20 to erect the first courthouse, a 1 1⁄2-story temporary structure made a logs hewn from trees that grew on the square and surrounding streets. Its replacement was built by contractor <span class="per">John Elder</span> in <span class="date">1837</span>–<span class="date">1838</span> for $12,000 and operated for <span class="date">45 years</span>. Indianapolis architect <span class="per">George</span> W. Bunting in <span class="date">1881</span> designed the third courthouse, a 165-foot (50 m) tall structure built of <span class="loc">Indiana</span> limestone by contractors <span class="loc">Farman</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Pearce</span> for approximately $200,000. Its cornerstone was laid <span class="date">September 2, 1882</span>.</p><br><br>
