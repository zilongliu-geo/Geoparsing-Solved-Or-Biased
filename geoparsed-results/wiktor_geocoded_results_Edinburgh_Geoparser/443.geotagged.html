<p>Mora or <span class="loc">Santa Gertrudis</span> de lo de Mora is a census-designated place in, and the county seat of, <span class="loc">Mora County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located about half way between <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and <span class="loc">Taos</span> on Highway 518 at an altitude of 7,180 feet. The Battle of Mora and the Second Battle of Mora were fought in Mora in 1847, where <span class="loc">US</span> troops eventually defeated the insurgents, effectively ending the <span class="loc">Taos Revolt</span> in the <span class="loc">Mora Valley</span>. Hispanic settlers had occupied lands within the <span class="loc">Mora Valley</span> without legal title ever since Governor de Anza had made peace with the Comanches in the late 18th century opening up the east side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains for settlement. However, Mora was formally founded as a farming community in 1835 The settlers came primarily from <span class="loc">Las Trampas</span>, but also from <span class="loc">Picuris</span> and <span class="loc">Embudo</span>. The 76 families each received a strip of land by grant of Governor Albino Perez. Despite fanciful stories about fur trappers, scattered bones and subsistence on mulberries (mora means mulberry in Spanish), the fact is that the valley, the river and the town took their name from the family name "Mora" of several of the settler families.</p>
