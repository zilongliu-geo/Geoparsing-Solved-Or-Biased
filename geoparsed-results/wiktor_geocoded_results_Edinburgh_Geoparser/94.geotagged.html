<p>Belen (/bəˈlɪn/; Spanish: Belén) is the second most populous city in <span class="loc">Valencia County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, after its county seat Los Lunas. The population was 7,175 in 2014 census data. Belen is Spanish for <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> but gained the nickname "The <span class="loc">Hub City</span>" because of a major rail junction on BNSF Railway's Southern Transcon rail line. The city is geographically near the center of <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and has been a significant transportation hub for central <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> that includes access to rail, the interstate and air at <span class="loc">Valencia County</span>'s only public airport. Belen is at the southern end of the <span class="loc">Albuquerque Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The city is located 35 miles south of <span class="loc">Albuquerque</span>. Belen was founded in 1740 as <span class="loc">Nuestra Senora de Belen</span> by a group of Spanish colonists led by Diego Torres and Antonio Salazar, who received permission to settle the tract of land known as the Belen Grant the year before. Recognizing the strategic significance of Belen, Spanish authorities established a fort in Belen to protect the settlements along the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> in 1760. By the 1790s, Belen had established a city center known as <span class="loc">Plaza Vieja</span>, or <span class="loc">Old Town</span>, and had grown from a paraje, or precinct, to a partido, or district, with a population of 1,695. By 1793, a Catholic church and parish was founded.</p>
