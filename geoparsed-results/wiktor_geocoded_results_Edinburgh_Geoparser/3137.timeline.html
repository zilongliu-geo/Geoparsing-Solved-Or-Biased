  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Buru</span> (formerly spelt <span class="loc">Boeroe</span>) is the third largest island within <span class="loc">Maluku</span> Islands of <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>. It lies between the <span class="loc">Banda Sea</span> to the south and <span class="loc">Seram</span> Sea to the north, <span class="loc">west of Ambon</span> and <span class="loc">Seram</span> islands. The island belongs to <span class="loc">Maluku province</span> (Indonesian: Provinsi <span class="loc">Maluku</span>) and includes the <span class="loc">Buru</span> (Indonesian: Kabupaten <span class="loc">Buru</span>) and <span class="loc">South Buru</span> (Indonesian: Kabupaten <span class="loc">Buru</span> <span class="loc">Selatan</span>) regencies. Their administrative centers, <span class="loc">Namlea</span> and <span class="loc">Namrole</span>, respectively, have ports and the largest towns of the island. There is a military airport at <span class="loc">Namlea</span> which supports civilian cargo transportation. About a third of the population is indigenous, mostly <span class="loc">Buru</span>, but also Lisela, <span class="per">Ambelau</span> and <span class="per">Kayeli</span> people. The rest of population are immigrants from <span class="loc">Java</span> and nearby <span class="loc">Maluku</span> Islands. The religious affiliation is evenly split between <span class="per">Christianity</span> and <span class="per">Sunni</span> <span class="loc">Islam</span>, with some remnants of traditional beliefs. While local languages and dialects are spoken within individual communities, the national Indonesian language is used among the communities and by the administration. Most of the island is covered with forests rich in tropical flora and fauna. From the present 179 bird and 25 mammal species, about 14 are found either on <span class="loc">Buru</span> only or also on a few nearby islands, the most notable being the wild pig <span class="loc">Buru</span> babirusa. There is little industry on the island, and most population is engaged in growing rice, maize, sweet potato, beans, coconuts, cocoa, coffee, clove and nutmeg. Other significant activities are animal farming and fishing.</p><br><br>
