  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Quirino</span> is a landlocked province in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> located in the <span class="loc">Cagayan</span> Valley region in <span class="loc">Luzon</span> and named after <span class="per">Elpidio Quirino</span>, the sixth President of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. Its capital is <span class="loc">Cabarroguis</span>. The province borders <span class="org">Aurora</span> to the southeast, <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span> to the west, and Isabela to the north. <span class="per">Quirino</span> used to be part of the province of <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span>, until it was separated in <span class="date">1966</span>. Long before its formal creation as an independent province, <span class="per">Quirino</span> was the forest region of the province of <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span>, inhabited by tribal groups known as the <span class="loc">Negritos</span>. They roamed the hinterlands and built their huts at the heart of the jungle. On <span class="date">June 18, 1966</span>, Republic Act 4734 was enacted, constituting the municipalities of <span class="loc">Diffun</span>, <span class="loc">Saguday</span>, <span class="loc">Aglipay</span>, and <span class="loc">Maddela</span> (all of <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span> province) into a new sub-province to be known as "<span class="per">Quirino</span>", named after the late Philippine president <span class="per">Elpidio Quirino</span>. On <span class="date">June 21, 1969</span>, Republic Act 5554 was enacted, amending RA 4734 and creating the municipality of <span class="loc">Cabarroguis</span> (<span class="date">now</span> the provincial capital town), which was taken from portions of <span class="loc">Diffun</span>, <span class="loc">Saguday</span>, and <span class="loc">Aglipay</span>.</p><br><br>
