<p>Keith (Scottish Gaelic: Baile Chèith, or Cèith Mhaol Rubha (archaic)) is a small town in the Moray council area in north east <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It has a population of 4,734. Until 1975 it was in <span class="loc">Banffshire</span>, a name which persists in common usage and historical references. Keith has three distinct sections: <span class="loc">Old Town</span>, where the original settlement was first established; Keith which is the main commercial centre and <span class="loc">Fife Keith</span> which was originally a separate town built in competition by the Earl of Fife but which, having proved less economically vibrant, was eventually joined to form one homogeneous settlement separated now only by the river. The oldest part of Keith dates to around 1180 where the <span class="loc">Old Town</span> still remains, now almost indistinguishable from the rest of the town. It developed around the old bridge which was built there by two mourning parents as a permanent memorial to their dear child who drowned in the river at that crossing point in the hope that none should suffer similar loss. The main part of the town is on higher ground above the river, laid out around 1750 by the Earl of Findlater. It is located at the crossing of the A95 and A96 roads. Local services include a health centre, dentist, optician and multiple hairdressing salons. The town has three schools: Keith Grammar School, Keith Primary School and St Thomas RC Primary School.</p>
