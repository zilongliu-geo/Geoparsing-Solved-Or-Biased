<p><span class="loc">Velasco</span> was a town in <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, that was later annexed by the <span class="loc">city of Freeport</span>. Founded in 1831, <span class="loc">Velasco</span> is situated on the east side of the <span class="loc">Brazos River</span> in southeast <span class="loc">Texas</span>. It is sixteen miles south of Angleton, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, and four miles from the <span class="loc">Gulf of Mexico</span>. The town's early history is closely tied with the Battle of <span class="loc">Velasco</span> and the <span class="loc">Texas Revolution</span>. <span class="loc">Velasco</span> was an important entry point for American settlers in <span class="loc">Texas</span>. In 1836 following the decisive Battle of <span class="loc">San Jacinto</span>, <span class="loc">Velasco</span> was named a temporary capital of the Republic of <span class="loc">Texas</span> by the interim President David G. Burnet. In 1837, the final actions of the Battle of <span class="loc">Brazos River</span> occurred there. <span class="loc">Velasco</span> was originally located on the Gulf Coast on the east side of the mouth of the <span class="loc">Brazos River</span> where present-day <span class="loc">Surfside</span> is located. In 1821, the schooner Lively landed at the site with thirty-eight men, the first of Stephen F. Austin's colonists. At the time, <span class="loc">Texas</span> was part of <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, but Austin had obtained permission to bring American settlers into the area, with the first colonists settling in what is now southern <span class="loc">Brazoria County</span>.</p>
