<p>Man tried to run over trooper, officials say. A man authorities say was shot by a state trooper after he tried to hit the trooper and a woman with a car last week in <span class="loc">Swansea</span> was jailed Tuesday. Gregory M. Crolley, 42, of <span class="loc">Swansea</span>, who suffered gunshot wounds to the head and hand, is at the <span class="loc">Lexington County</span> jail, charged with two counts of assault with intent to kill, SLED arrest affidavits say. Crolley was a passenger in a 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier that was stopped March 16 on suspicion of DUI on S.C. 6 near <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 321, authorities said. Crolley got into the driver’s seat and tried several times to hit Trooper Drew Ledbetter and Crolley’s wife, Amelia, who was being detained, authorities said. Ledbetter opened fire when the car came toward him about 10:30 p.m., SLED said. Amelia Crolley was charged with DUI, Department of Public Safety spokesman Sid Gaulden said. Gregory Crolley was taken to Palmetto Health Richland in stable condition for treatment of his gunshot wounds. Ledbetter, who had been placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of SLED’s investigation, has returned to regular duty, Gaulden said. It is not the first time Gregory Crolley has been arrested. His convictions date to 1985, including assault and battery with intent to kill, assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, second-degree arson, criminal domestic violence and housebreaking, SLED records show.</p>
