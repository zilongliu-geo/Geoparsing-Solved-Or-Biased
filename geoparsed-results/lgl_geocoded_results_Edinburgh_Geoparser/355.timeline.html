  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Vandals target 4x4s in <span class="loc">Oxford</span>. A SPATE of vandalised 4x4 vehicles has sparked fears an eco-fanatic is targeting “gas guzzling” cars in <span class="loc">Oxford</span>. Builder <span class="per">Phillip Bradley</span> has seen his new £25,000 <span class="org">Isuzu</span> attacked outside his home in <span class="loc">Osney</span> Island four times, leaving him with a £1,700 repair bill. Over <span class="date">the past</span> fortnight his vehicle has been vandalised twice. Another 4x4 owner nearby has also had his windscreen of his <span class="org">Toyota</span> Hilux repeatedly smashed since <span class="date">January</span>. People in <span class="loc">Osney</span> Island have been shocked by the level of car vandalism in <span class="date">recent weeks</span>, with the damage always happening at <span class="date">weekends</span> in the early hours of the morning. But residents are <span class="date">now</span> convinced the vandalism is not random, as 4x4s are suffering the brunt of the attacks. One owner on <span class="loc">Osney</span> Island has <span class="date">now</span> taken to sleeping in his vehicle at night in the hope of catching his tormentor. And he has also had CCTV cameras put in front of his house. <span class="per">Mr Bradley</span> said his <span class="org">Isuzu</span> Denver Rodeo was first damaged just <span class="date">two days</span> after he bought it in <span class="date">October</span>, when the windscreen was smashed. The car had been parked outside his home in <span class="loc">West Street</span>. The latest attack happened on <span class="date">Friday night</span> when the windscreen was again smashed and the bonnet pierced — apparently with a heavy metal spike. <span class="per">Mr Bradley</span>, a father-of-two who owns the building firm Attics +, said he was disturbed at 4am by a loud smashing noise. He had been sleeping in the front bedroom of his house to keep watch over his vehicle. But the offender had fled down <span class="loc">Swan Street</span> by the time he had rushed to his car. <span class="per">Mr Bradley</span> said: “I had thought I was the victim of some personal vendetta when if first happened. But then I heard about another guy in <span class="loc">East Street</span> having his 4x4 damaged. I don’t believe we are talking about youngsters who have been to the clubs, or the hooded crew. This seems to be someone who is on a mission. “It is someone who is going to keep on coming back until he is caught. “My guess is that it’s someone who perceives cars like mine to be a ‘gas guzzler’. “It isn’t. It actually takes diesel. I bought it because it’s a nice car for the family and I can also use it at work. The owner of the vandalised <span class="org">Toyota</span> Hilux is <span class="per">Ian Beesley</span>, also a builder, who lives on Ferry Hinksey Road. <span class="per">Mr Beesley</span>, widely known as Digger, said his car had been parked on only yards from his home when it was vandalised. He also feared a misguided ecologically-minded fanatic was the most likely culprit. A spokesman for Oxford Police said: “The neighbourhood policing team have increased their patrols in the area and are carrying out investigations to catch those responsible.”</p><br><br>
