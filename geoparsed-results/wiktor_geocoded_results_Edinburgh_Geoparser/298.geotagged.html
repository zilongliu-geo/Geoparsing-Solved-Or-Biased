<p><span class="loc">Trinidad</span> (Spanish: "Trinity") is the larger and more populous of the two major islands and numerous landforms which make up the island nation of <span class="loc">Trinidad and Tobago</span>. The island lies 11 km (6.8 mi) off the northeastern coast of <span class="loc">Venezuela</span> and sits on the continental shelf of <span class="loc">South America</span>. Though part of the South American continent, from a socio-economic standpoint it is often referred to as the southernmost island in the Caribbean. With an area of 4,768 km2 (1,841 sq mi) Many believe the original name for the island in the Arawaks' language was "IÃ«re" which meant "Land of the Hummingbird". Some believe that "Iere" was actually a mispronunciation or corruption by early colonists of the Arawak word "Kairi" which simply means "Island". Christopher Columbus renamed it "<span class="loc">La Isla</span> de la <span class="loc">Trinidad</span>" ("The Island of the Trinity"), fulfilling a vow he had made before setting out on his third voyage of exploration. Caribs and Arawaks lived in <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> long before Christopher Columbus encountered the islands on his third voyage in 1498. <span class="loc">Tobago</span> changed hands between the British, French, Dutch and Courlanders, but eventually ended up in British hands. <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> remained Spanish until 1797, but it was largely settled by French colonists from the French Caribbean, especially <span class="loc">Martinique</span>. In 1889 the two islands became a single British Crown colony. <span class="loc">Trinidad and Tobago</span> obtained self-governance in 1958 and independence from the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> in 1962.</p>
