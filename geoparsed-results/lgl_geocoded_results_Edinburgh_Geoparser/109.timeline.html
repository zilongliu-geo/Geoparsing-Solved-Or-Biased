  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Restaurateur to give <span class="loc">Southridge</span> venture another shot. <span class="loc">SOUTH CHARLESTON</span>, <span class="loc">W.Va</span>. -- Restaurateur Bill Sohovich is giving <span class="loc">Southridge</span> another go, but this time he's opening slowly and more deliberately. Billy's opened and closed at <span class="loc">Southridge</span> over about a four-month period <span class="date">last year</span>. "We made some mistakes and we know we did," <span class="per">Sohovich</span> said. "My daughter and I and my wife analyzed these. We're starting over again up there. We're starting very slowly, to get our feet on the ground." Sohovich owns Soho's in <span class="loc">Capitol</span> <span class="per">Market</span> and <span class="per">Blossom</span> Deli downtown. The short-lived Billy's served comfort food - items like chicken and dumplings and meatloaf. "From the time we closed we've gotten all kinds of feedback," <span class="per">Sohovich</span> said. "The common thread was, people wanted a little bit better food up there. They expect more from Bill Sohovich than home-cooked food." The new venture, Billy's Soho's @ <span class="loc">Southridge</span>, opened <span class="date">about two weeks ago</span>. It is in the former Smokey Bones location near Olive Garden. "What we're doing <span class="date">now</span> is, we're going to keep some of the old and bring some new in," <span class="per">Sohovich</span> said. "We'll broaden our menu. We have trout, oysters <span class="loc">Rockefeller</span> and some fillets. We've kept some of the Billy's favorites - chicken and dumplings, meatloaf and ribs. "Every day we're adding new menu items," he said. "By <span class="date">the middle of next week</span> we should have everything we're going to serve on the menu available. We want to take it <span class="date">one day</span>, one step at a time, and make sure our feet are firmly planted on the ground." "We got away from lunch," he said. "We're going to concentrate on the dinner entree business and the sports bar aspect. We have a full bar and an upgraded wine list." The restaurant is open from 4 p.m. to <span class="date">10 p.m. Monday</span> through <span class="date">Friday</span>, noon to <span class="date">10 p.m. Saturday</span>; and noon to 9 p.m. Sunday. "Absolutely great people who worked there before are in there <span class="date">now</span> helping me," <span class="per">Sohovich</span> said. He praised his bankers, United Bank Charleston Market President <span class="per">Julie Gurtis</span> and her assistant, <span class="per">David Mills</span>, as well as his <span class="loc">Southridge</span> landlord, <span class="per">Lee Rashid</span>. "These people have made it possible with the financing, the rent - they've given me the opportunity to get this restaurant back up and running," <span class="per">Sohovich</span> said. "They're truly trying to help me put everything back together. "Every one of the purveyors has been a gentleman and has been working with me," he added. "I could have taken Billy's into bankruptcy. But I live in this community. I am a man of my word. These people are going to get paid back."</p><br><br>
