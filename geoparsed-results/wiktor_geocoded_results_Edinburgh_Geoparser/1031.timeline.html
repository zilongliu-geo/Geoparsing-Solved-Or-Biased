  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Grafton County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,374 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> includes the village of <span class="loc">North Woodstock</span>, the commercial center. Its extensive land area is largely forested, and includes the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. <span class="org">Parts of the White Mountain National Forest</span> are in the east and west. The Appalachian Trail crosses the town's northwest corner. Russell Pond Campground is in the east. West of <span class="loc">North Woodstock</span> is the <span class="loc">Lost River</span> Reservation. First granted in <span class="date">1763</span>, Colonial Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span> named the town Peeling after an English town. Many of the first colonists were originally from <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. In <span class="date">1771</span>, his nephew, Governor <span class="per">John Wentworth</span>, gave it the name <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, after <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. The town was renamed <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> in <span class="date">1840</span> for <span class="loc">Blenheim Palace</span> in <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Logging became a principal early industry, with sawmills established using water power from the <span class="loc">Pemigewasset River</span>. The entrance of the railroad in the 19th century opened the wilderness to development, carrying away wood products to market. It also brought tourists, many attracted by paintings of the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span> by <span class="loc">White Mountain</span> artists. Several inns and hotels were built to accommodate the wealthy, who sought relief from the <span class="date">summer</span> heat, humidity and pollution of coal-age <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>. They often relaxed by taking carriage rides through the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span>, or by hiking along the <span class="loc">Lost River</span> in <span class="loc">Lost River</span> Reservation. But with the advent of automobiles, patrons were no longer restricted by the limits of rail service. Consequently, many grand hotels established near depots declined and closed. <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>, however, remains a popular tourist destination.</p><br><br>
