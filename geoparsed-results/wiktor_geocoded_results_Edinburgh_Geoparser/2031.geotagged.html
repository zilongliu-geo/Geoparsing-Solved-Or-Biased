<p><span class="loc">Union County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">US</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 52,300. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Marysville</span>. Its name is reflective of its origins, it being the union of pieces of Franklin, Delaware, Madison, and Logan counties. <span class="loc">Union County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">OH</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Union County</span> has been under the rule of three countries in its history: <span class="loc">France</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, and the present-day <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was discovered by the French explorer <span class="loc">La Salle</span>, along with traders and missionaries who accompanied him. After the French and Indian War, the Treaty of <span class="loc">Paris</span> of 1763 placed the area under British rule. Following the American Revolution, in 1783, the area would eventually become known as the Northwest Territory and part of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. After the American Revolution, former soldiers from <span class="loc">New England</span> poured into <span class="loc">Ohio</span> after being granted land by the government. They surveyed the land, and sought to develop a state between <span class="loc">Lake Erie</span> and the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>. Their proposals for the governance of the territory led to the passage of the Ordinance of 1787, which guided the establishment of states within the Northwestern Territory. Bitter struggles with American Indians over the next decades would follow, culminating with the battle of <span class="loc">Tippecanoe</span> in 1811, which saw the final defeat of the American Indian tribes in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> led by <span class="loc">Tecumseh</span>. A notable victim of the warring between the settlers and Indians was Jonathan Alder, who resided in and around the <span class="loc">Union County</span> area throughout his life.</p>
