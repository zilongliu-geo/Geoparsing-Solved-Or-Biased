It has fields of sugarcanes, and they make the best sugar — better than in all the rest of <span class="loc">Syria</span>." Ali of Herat reports in 1173 that two sons of Jacob are buried in the town, namely Reuben and Simeon. <span class="loc">Kabul</span> was one of the principal <span class="loc">cities of Jund</span> al-Urrdun.
