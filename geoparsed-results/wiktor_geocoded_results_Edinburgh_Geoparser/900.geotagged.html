<p><span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is named after the Mission <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Arc치ngel, founded by Junipero Serra. The city grew outward from the mission and in 1852 became the original township of <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>. <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> was incorporated in 1913. The city's motto is "A city with a Mission" and it is often called the "Birthplace" of the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> metropolitan area. At the 2010 census, the population was 39,718. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish to Alta <span class="loc">California</span>, the area that is now <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> was inhabited by the Tongva Native Americans, whom the Spanish called the Gabriele침o. The Tongva name for the <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> region has been reconstructed as Shevaa. Today a center for culture and art, the Mission <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Arc치ngel, founded by Father Junipero Serra, is the fourth of twenty-one <span class="loc">California</span> Missions, and is known as the "Pride of the <span class="loc">California</span> Missions." The Mission <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Arc치ngel served a pivotal role in the colonial Spanish society, with many of the area's first Mexican settlers being baptized at the mission, including future governor Pio Pico, who was born in 1801 at the mission and baptized there the same year. He was appointed as <span class="loc">California</span>'s governor twice, serving briefly in 1832 and again from 1845 through the Mexican-American War. Later in life, he was elected as a <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles City</span> councilman. The city of <span class="loc">Pico Rivera</span> was named to honor him as the last governor of <span class="loc">California</span> to be born in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>.</p>
