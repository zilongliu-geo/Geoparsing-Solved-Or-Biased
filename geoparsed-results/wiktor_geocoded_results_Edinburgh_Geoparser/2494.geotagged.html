<p><span class="loc">Kent</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,507 at the 2010 census. The name is that of an early settler family. The town is in the north-central part of the <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>. Many of the lakes are reservoirs for New <span class="loc">York City</span>. <span class="loc">Kent</span> was part of the Philipse Patent of 1697, when it was still populated by the Wappinger tribe. Daniel Nimham (1724â€“1778) was the last chief of the Wappingers and was the most prominent Native American of his time in the <span class="loc">Hudson</span> Valley. The town was first settled by Europeans in the mid-18th century by Zachariah Merritt and others, from <span class="loc">New England</span>, <span class="loc">Westchester County</span>, or the <span class="loc">Fishkill</span> area. Elisha Cole and his wife Hannah Smalley built <span class="loc">Coles</span> Mills in 1748, having moved to that location the previous year from Cape Cod. <span class="loc">Coles</span> Mill operated until 1888 when it was submerged under West Branch Reservoir. Around this same time the northeastern part of the county was settled by the <span class="loc">Kent</span>, <span class="loc">Townsend</span>, and <span class="loc">Ludington</span> families, among others. The father of Hannah Smalley and his family moved to <span class="loc">Kent</span> about two years before Elisha Cole and his family.</p>
