<p><span class="loc">Chatham</span> is a Canadian urban neighbourhood in the <span class="loc">city of Miramichi</span>, <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span>. Prior to municipal amalgamation in 1995, <span class="loc">Chatham</span> was an incorporated town in <span class="loc">Northumberland County</span> along the south bank of the <span class="loc">Miramichi River</span> opposite <span class="loc">Douglastown</span>. Since amalgamation, it has been sometimes referred to as <span class="loc">Miramichi</span> East. At <span class="loc">Chatham</span>, the <span class="loc">Miramichi River</span> is quite wide, the water salt and tidal. Just downstream from the town, the river begins to widen into a broad estuary, where the <span class="loc">Miramichi River</span> gradually becomes <span class="loc">Miramichi Bay</span>. Because of its eastward facing location, ships coming from the <span class="loc">British Isles</span> in early times had easy access through the <span class="loc">Strait of Belle Isle</span> and across the Gulf of <span class="loc">St. Lawrence</span>. It was more accessible and safer to get to than the ports of <span class="loc">Quebec City</span> or <span class="loc">Saint John</span>, <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span>. In colonial times, the surrounding lands were heavily forested; the stands of eastern white pine were especially valued for ships' masts. The river teemed with fish, Atlantic salmon the most prized. Abundant game roamed the forests, and berries were a valuable food supplement.</p>
