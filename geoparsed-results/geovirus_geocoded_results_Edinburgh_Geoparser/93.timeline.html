  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The government of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> has unveiled their strategy to deal with any future influenza pandemic in their Pandemic Influenza Contingency Plan. The document, based on the World Health Organization's framework for responses, explains how the <span class="loc">UK</span> would respond to a major outbreak of flu. Any flu pandemic would differ from the seasonal outbreaks of flu observed worldwide every year. While seasonal flu kills 12,000 Britons annually, a pandemic would affect far more people and could result in the deaths of up to 50,000 people in the <span class="loc">UK</span> if there were no medical intervention. The government will have the power to cancel events where large numbers of people gather, such as football (soccer) matches. It could also advise travel restrictions to and from areas of high infection, but would not be able to enforce any such measures. <span class="loc">Canada</span> and <span class="loc">Australia</span> have also bought the equivalent amounts of anti-viral drugs. The <span class="loc">U.S.</span> has also bought large amounts of similar drugs. The total cost of the acquisition was not published by the government, but the <span class="org">BBC</span> estimated the cost to be Â£180 million. Unlike a vaccine, oseltamivir can be used to treat any strain of the influenza virus. Many new variants of the influenza virus are seen every year, and combined with the long lead times associated with the development of vaccinces, mass vaccination is frequently impractical.</p><br><br>
