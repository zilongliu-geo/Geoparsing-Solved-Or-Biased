  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Wilderâ€™s executive-protection unit involved in seven wrecks. Wilder's unit had seven wrecks from <span class="date">2005</span> to'08 <span class="loc">Richmond</span> police officers blamed for three crashes but charged in none At 1:40 a.m. on a <span class="date">Thursday last October</span>, a <span class="date">2006</span> Mercury crashed into a deer on state Route 5 in Charles <span class="loc">City County</span>. The wreck caused $1,713 in damage to the car's front end but no injuries to its occupants. It's an accident that typically would get little notice, except it involved a <span class="org">Richmond Police Department</span> unit assigned to provide 24-hour security to then-Mayor L. <span class="per">Douglas Wilder</span>. It was one of seven, mostly minor wrecks involving vehicles of the executive-protection unit since it was established in <span class="date">2005</span>, according to police records released under a <span class="org">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span> request. The <span class="loc">Charles City</span> crash occurred <span class="date">Oct. 16</span> at Route 5 and Adkins Road, about 12 miles northwest of Wilder's estate on the <span class="loc">James River</span>. Wilder lived there before he moved back to <span class="loc">Richmond</span> to meet residency requirements to be mayor. Assessment records show he still owns the property. Of the seven wrecks, city officers were blamed for three but charged in none, according to police reports and <span class="loc">Charles City</span> Sheriff Javier J. Smith. Other drivers were faulted in three wrecks and charged in at least two. One driver was cited with an improper lane change and another with failure to yield and driving without a license. Typically, city police officers aren't charged in minor wrecks because "internal discipline procedures generally carry greater consequences to the officers than the citation would," <span class="per">Victoria N. Pearson</span>, general counsel for the police department, said in an e-mail. "Additionally, all of our accidents are reviewed by a review board, which includes citizens who participate in the process of determining appropriate discipline." Citing confidential personnel issues, Pearson would not say whether any officers had been disciplined. The accident reports describe officers' vehicles bumping into the back of one car, sideswiping another, and hitting the bumper of yet another. Except for the one in <span class="loc">Charles City</span>, all the wrecks occurred in <span class="loc">Richmond</span>. Damage estimates ranged from $50 to $4,000 per incident and more than $12,000 overall. The most expensive wreck caused by a city officer cost $1,822, according to the police department. The wrecks happened from <span class="date">June 2005</span> to <span class="date">October 2008</span>, before <span class="loc">Dwight</span> <span class="per">C. Jones</span> took office in <span class="date">January</span> and ordered cuts of at least 50 percents to the unit's staff and fleet. The wreck in <span class="loc">Charles City</span> wasn't significant enough to warrant a full report, and no charges were filed, <span class="per">Sheriff Smith</span> said. Two <span class="loc">Richmond</span> officers were in the vehicle at the time, he said.</p><br><br>
