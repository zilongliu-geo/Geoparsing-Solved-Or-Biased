<p><span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [la espeˈɾansa]) is the capital city and a municipality of the same name of the department of Intibucá, <span class="loc">Honduras</span>. The city of <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> is merged indistinguishably with the <span class="loc">city of Intibucá</span>, the head of the neighboring municipality of Intibucá. Intibucá is the older of the two cities and was originally a Lenca community, while <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> is the newer ladino community. The two cities, often called the twin cities, while distinct with separate municipal governments, are generally referred to jointly as <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> and are separated only by a street that crosses town. <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> is famous for having the coolest climate in <span class="loc">Honduras</span> and also for being the heart of the Ruta Lenca, a region of Lenca ethnic influence that spans <span class="loc">Honduras</span> from <span class="loc">Santa Rosa de Copan</span> to <span class="loc">Choluteca</span>. The area was originally occupied by Maya and Lenca people from pre-Columbian times who formed two settlements called Eramani and Lentercala. In 1647, Mayor Francisco de <span class="loc">La Cerda</span> was appointed by the Spanish throne to officially demarcate the territory of the indigenous population. He divided the land into two jurisdictions, not corresponding to the Eramani and Lentercala sites, and created boundaries and names for the surrounding small communities. Over time, the two jurisdictions developed a rivalry, especially over land. The cities grew in population especially in the 1800s and <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> was named a villa on September 22, 1848. <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> officially became a city in 1883 when the department of Intibucá was formed by separating from the neighboring department of Lempira, then called <span class="loc">Gracias</span>.</p>
