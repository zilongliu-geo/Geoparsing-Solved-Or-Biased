<p><span class="loc">Carter County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 6,265. The county seat is <span class="loc">Van Buren</span>. The county was officially organized on March 10, 1859, and is named after Zimri A. Carter, a pioneer settler who came to <span class="loc">Missouri</span> from <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> in 1812. <span class="loc">Carter County</span> is located in the <span class="loc">Ozarks region</span> of southeast <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. When the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> legislature created <span class="loc">Carter County</span> on March 10, 1859, it named the county after Zimri A. Carter. Zimri A. Carter (1794–1870), the man for whom <span class="loc">Carter County</span> was named, was born in <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. In 1807, at the age of 13, he came to <span class="loc">Missouri</span> with his parents. The Carter family initially settled in what is now <span class="loc">Warren County</span>. Shortly after his arrival in <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Zimri Carter joined up with a party of traders traveling the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> rivers in flat boats, and was away for a number of years. In his absence his father Benjamin Carter traded a horse and a cow for a large tract of land in what was then <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, about eight miles southeast of where the town of <span class="loc">Van Buren</span> would eventually be established. When Zimri Carter returned from his trading ventures he joined his father in farming their new homestead. (Various sources give dates as early as 1812 and as late as 1820 for Zimri Carter’s arrival in the area.) Zimri Carter became one of the most influential and respected men in southeast <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and was instrumental in bringing about the creation of <span class="loc">Carter County</span> and served for a time as county judge of <span class="loc">Carter County</span>. The Carters were soon followed by other families: the <span class="loc">Chilton</span>, <span class="loc">Kenard</span>, <span class="loc">Snider</span> and Kelly families, who, along with the Carters opened up large tracts of wilderness land.</p>
