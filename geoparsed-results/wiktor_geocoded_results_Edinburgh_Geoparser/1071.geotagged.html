There are three small waterways in Franklin: <span class="loc">Canary Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Hurricane Creek</span> flow into Young's Creek. These creeks flood frequently. Their small floodplain has been adapted as the basis of Franklin's green walkways and parks, which extend the entire length of the town. <span class="loc">Hurricane Creek</span> empties into Young's Creek in Province Park, downtown, which flows into the <span class="loc">Big Blue River</span> farther South. A buried stream, Roaring Run, flows beneath Franklin. In the June 2008 Midwest floods, all of these streams overflowed, damaging or destroying more than 100 houses throughout Franklin, including some entire neighborhoods.</p>
