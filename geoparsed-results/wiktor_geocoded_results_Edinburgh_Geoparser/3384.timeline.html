  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Scarborough</span> (/ˈskɑːrbrə/ or /ˈskɑːrbərə/) is a town on the <span class="loc">North Sea</span> coast of <span class="loc">North Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically part of the <span class="loc">North Riding</span> of <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span>, the town lies between 10–230 feet (3–70 m) above sea level, rising steeply northward and westward from the harbour onto limestone cliffs. The older part of the town lies around the harbour and is protected by a rocky headland. With a population of just over 61,000, <span class="loc">Scarborough</span> is the largest holiday resort on the Yorkshire coast. The town has fishing and service industries, including a growing digital and creative economy, as well as being a tourist destination. Inhabitants of the town are known as Scarborians. The most striking feature of the town's geography is a high rocky promontory pointing eastward into the <span class="loc">North Sea</span>. The promontory supports the 11th-century ruins of <span class="loc">Scarborough</span> Castle and separates the seafront into two bays, to the north and south. The <span class="loc">South Bay</span> was the site of the original early-medieval settlement and harbour, which form the old town. This remains the main tourist area, with a sandy beach, cafés, amusements, arcades, theatres and entertainment facilities. The modern commercial town centre has migrated 440 yards (400 m) north-west of the harbour area and 100 feet (30 m) above it and contains the transport hubs, main services, shopping and nightlife. The harbour has undergone major regeneration including the new Albert Strange Pontoons, a more pedestrian-friendly promenade, street lighting and seating.</p><br><br>
