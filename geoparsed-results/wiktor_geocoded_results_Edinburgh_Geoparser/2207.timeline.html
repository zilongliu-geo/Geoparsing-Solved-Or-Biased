  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bolivar</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Allegany County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,189 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is named after <span class="per">Simón Bolívar</span>. <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> is on the south border of the county and is east of <span class="loc">Olean</span>. There is also a village of <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> in the town. As "the heart of the <span class="loc">Allegany Oil</span> Field" the Bolivar-Richburg area rose to significance during the oil boom era of the late 1800s. During the brief initial oil boom of the 1880s it was purportedly the wealthiest locale, per capita, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. By <span class="date">the early 1900s</span> the initial boom, with its economic and population impacts, had significantly faded, but secondary oil recovery techniques applied to the oil fields (starting around <span class="date">1920</span>) drastically rejuvenated the industry in the area. An extensive collection of photos and documents (over 6,000 items) related to the history (including the area's oil industry dating from <span class="date">1879</span>), schools and other institutions, and people of <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> <span class="loc">N.Y.</span> (including current and former residents) is maintained on Facebook as the "<span class="loc">Bolivar</span> <span class="loc">New York</span> <span class="per">Fan Page</span>." The items are organized into dozens of albums, by topic.</p><br><br>
