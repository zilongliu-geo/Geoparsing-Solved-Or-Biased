  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Medina</span> (/məˈdaɪnə/) is a city located in the <span class="loc">Eastside</span>, a region of <span class="loc">King County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Surrounded on the north, west, and south by <span class="loc">Lake Washington</span>, opposite Seattle, <span class="loc">Medina</span> is bordered by <span class="loc">Clyde Hill</span> and <span class="loc">Hunts Point</span>, as well as the satellite <span class="loc">city of Bellevue</span>. The city's population was 2,969 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city is mostly residential and includes <span class="per">Bill Gates</span>' house. <span class="loc">Medina</span> has the second highest per-capita income in the state of <span class="loc">Washington</span> and the 49th highest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Named in <span class="date">1891</span> for the <span class="loc">city of Medina</span> in <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span>, <span class="loc">Medina</span> was platted in <span class="date">1914</span> and officially incorporated on <span class="date">August 19, 1955</span>. According to the city: In <span class="date">1891</span>, <span class="per">T.L. Dabney</span> built the first landing in <span class="loc">Medina</span> on what later became known as <span class="loc">Dabney Point</span>. The landing was directly across from the <span class="loc">Leschi</span> Park landing and it became the main crossing point for settlers to enter "the Points Country". As the community around the landing began to grow, local residents wanted to give it a distinct name. A community meeting was held and three women were appointed to select a name for the community. <span class="per">Flora Belote</span>’s choice was the name selected. She had decided on the name "Medeena", after the <span class="loc">Arabian city</span>. <span class="per">Dabney</span> was offended, he wanted it named "Floridine". <span class="per">Dabney</span> built a large sign that said "Floridine" and placed it in the water beside his landing. The next evening when he came home from working in Seattle, he found his sign had been replaced by a "Medeena" sign. He promptly took it down and put his sign back up. This feud continued for <span class="date">several days</span>, with <span class="per">Dabney</span> replacing the "Medeena" sign each evening when he would return from work. The ladies prevailed. <span class="per">Dabney</span> eventually tired and left the "Medeena" sign up.</p><br><br>
