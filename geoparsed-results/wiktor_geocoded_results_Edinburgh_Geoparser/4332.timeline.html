  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jones County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 10,153, making it the fifth-least populous county in <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Trenton. <span class="loc">Jones County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">New Bern</span>, <span class="loc">NC</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Jones County</span> is a member of the regional <span class="org">Eastern Carolina Council of Governments</span>. The <span class="loc">Jones County</span> Government relies entirely upon an all volunteer (non-paid) fire department force segregated by geographic location(s). The Law Enforcement structure consists of one paid Pollocksville Police Chief, one paid Maysville Police Chief, and an elected Sheriff with a small (less than 25 person force) to handle law enforcement, detention, and emergency communications. The county government relies heavily on volunteer deputization. Emergency ambulance services consist of one full-time medical unit dispatched from the town of Trenton and relies heavily on other volunteer EMS personnel geographically scattered around the county to assist with a medical emergency. Additional EMS transportation vehicles are subsidized by EMS services provided by adjacent counties or private enterprises. There is no animal control unit. <span class="loc">The County</span> Detention Facility is a 21 bed (3 female) facility located in the basement of the county courthouse and the detention staff double up as the communications/911 emergency communications staff. Prisoner Meals are provided by contract through licensed restaurants.</p><br><br>
