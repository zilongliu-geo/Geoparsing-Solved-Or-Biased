  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Duncan</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Spartanburg County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,181 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Duncan</span> is located at 34°56′6″N 82°8′5″W (34.934983, -82.134801). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 3.5 square miles (9.1 km2), all of it land. Founded by <span class="per">Zachary Barnett Duncan</span>. In <span class="date">1811</span>, a post office was established on what is <span class="date">now</span> S.C. Highway 290. A tiny settlement sprung up around it, and both the post office and community were named <span class="loc">New Hope</span>. In <span class="date">1854</span>, the town changed its name to Vernonville or <span class="loc">Vernonsville</span> in honor of local physician J.J. Vernon. In the mid-1850s, plans were under way to put a railroad line through <span class="per">Duncan</span>, but the impending Civil War disrupted them. It wasn’t until <span class="date">1873</span> that the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> and <span class="loc">Richmond Railroad</span> laid a line through the town. Shortly after the Civil War, <span class="per">Leroy Duncan</span> came to town and began buying land. <span class="per">Duncan</span> was an ambitious man who craved recognition. During celebrations for the new railroad line, <span class="per">Duncan</span> promised townspeople that he would provide land for city streets if they would agree to rename the town after him. In <span class="date">1881</span>, the name change became official.</p><br><br>
