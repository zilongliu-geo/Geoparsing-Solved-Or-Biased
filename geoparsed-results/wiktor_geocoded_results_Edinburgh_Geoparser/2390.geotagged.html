<p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Greenville Township</span>, <span class="loc">Floyd County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 595 at the 2010 census. Early in <span class="loc">Floyd County</span>'s history, <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was initially to be the county seat. A <span class="loc">New Albany</span> resident offered to provide a bell for the courthouse, on the condition that the courthouse were built in <span class="loc">New Albany</span>; thus, it was built there instead. Captain John Baptiste Ford found his way to <span class="loc">Greenville</span> as a 14-year-old runaway from <span class="loc">Danville</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. Ford began as an apprentice in the local saddle shop which led him into his first business venture. Ford purchased the <span class="loc">Old Mill</span> and saddle shop from its owner, added a grocery and began making tin pie safes which he sold throughout the country. In 1824, Ford became the first man to succeed in making plate glass in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. That success was the precursor to several glass companies, most notably the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company now known as PPG. Ford became the father of American plate glass. That original business venture that housed the mill, saddle shop and grocery still stands today. Historically referred to as the <span class="loc">Old Mill</span> and Ford's Flour Mill, the <span class="loc">Greenville</span> Station is believed to be the oldest commercial building in <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. Construction on the three-story brick structure began in 1810 and finished in 1812. Besides housing Ford's grocery and the saddle shop, the <span class="loc">Old Mill</span> was the Greenville Post Office from 1823 until the early 1940s when it was relocated to H. Miller's house at the corner of East First Street and Hwy 150. The Station was a stop for the 104-mile stagecoach route that ran from Falls Cities to the <span class="loc">Wabash</span> River. The building also served as a stop along the <span class="loc">Pony Express</span> route from 1861 to 1867. The <span class="loc">Greenville</span> Station served as lodge hall for two civil organizations: the fraternal order of the Free and Accepted Masons and the International Order of Oddfellows. Through a majority of the early 20th century, the <span class="loc">Greenville</span> Station was referred to by the townspeople as the "lodge building" or the "lodge."</p>
