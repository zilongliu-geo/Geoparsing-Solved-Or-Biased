  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Serik</span> is a town and district in <span class="loc">Antalya Province</span> of <span class="loc">Turkey</span>, 38 km (24 mi) east of the <span class="loc">city of Antalya</span>, along the Mediterranean coast. Towards the coast the district is mainly flat farmland, used for growing vegetables, while the inland half of <span class="loc">Serik</span> is forested hills and the <span class="loc">Taurus Mountains</span>. The district has a typical Mediterranean climate of hot, dry summers and warm, wet winters, and the natural vegetation is dry shrubs. <span class="loc">Serik</span> itself is a town of 52,647 people. The <span class="loc">city of Antalya</span> is nearby limiting the potential for retailing and commerce in <span class="loc">Serik</span>, but there is some light industry. There is a well-known köfte and piyaz restaurant in the town centre; the piyaz is served with a sesame (tahini) sauce. Although wealthy and only 15 km from the wild amenities on the coast, the people of <span class="loc">Serik</span> are typically conservative and traditional in outlook. The population includes many who still identify themselves as Yörük or Turkmen, descendants of the nomadic people that populated the area during the Ottoman Empire and before. These are close-knit communities shunning outside influence and new immigration, prompting some Turkish people to give it the nickname Capital of a Yörük Republic, an echo of the vivaciously preserved traditions and lifestyle. Although the district has seen a large influx of migrant workers in agriculture and tourism most business in the town is still very much in the hands of these original Turkmen people. They defend their interests fervently and Serik municipality is controlled by the Turkish nationalist <span class="per">Nationalist</span> Movement Party (MHP).</p><br><br>
