  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Newton is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Newton County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,436 at the <span class="date">2012</span> census. Both <span class="loc">Newton County</span> and its county seat, Newton, were named after <span class="per">John Newton</span>, a supposed hero of the American Revolutionary War. However, <span class="per">John Newton</span>'s heroics are said to be a product of <span class="per">Parson Weems</span>, who also fictionalized the story of <span class="loc">George Washington</span> and the cherry tree. In <span class="date">1853</span>, disputes led to the building of a courthouse and town in the county's geographical center instead of in <span class="loc">Burkeville</span>, a community 11 miles north northeast of Newton. A second courthouse in Newton, a Second Empire style structure, was built in 1902-03 with bricks from nearby <span class="loc">Caney Creek</span>, according to a <span class="org">Texas Historical Commission</span> marker. The town was incorporated in <span class="date">1935</span> and remains the only incorporated city in the county. The town's public school began when the W.H. <span class="org">Ford</span> <span class="per">Male</span> and <span class="per">Female</span> College was chartered in <span class="date">1889</span>. The site of the college later became the Powell Hotel and <span class="date">now</span> serves as a museum and houses the city's chamber of commerce. The growth of the city during the first half of the 20th century was largely due to the dominant timber industry in <span class="loc">East Texas</span>. The town had at least one newspaper prior to <span class="date">1920s</span>. The county courthouse, a focal point of a city square that featured extensive <span class="date">Christmas</span> lighting in <span class="date">the early 1990s</span>, was severely damaged by a fire in <span class="date">August 2000</span>. Various funding and other problems pushed back the time frame for the restoration of the edifice for <span class="date">several years</span>. Completion of the rebuilding is estimated to be sometime in <span class="date">2008</span>. Although almost 80 miles from the <span class="loc">Gulf of Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">Newton</span> suffered extensive damage in <span class="date">September 2005</span> from Hurricane Rita. The National Weather Service estimated wind gusts in the vicinity of Newton to be between 80 mph to 100 mph. Some residents were without electricity for <span class="date">at least one month</span>.</p><br><br>
