<p><span class="loc">Bayan</span> (Arabic: بيان‎) is a residential area within the Hawalli Governorate of <span class="loc">Kuwait</span>, consisting of thirteen blocks, and situated approximately 15 kilometres away from the capital, <span class="loc">Kuwait City</span>. Its naming was inspired by the fact that it's an area of higher altitude in comparison to its surrounding Mishref, <span class="loc">Salwa</span> and <span class="loc">Rumaithiya</span>. The <span class="loc">Kuwait</span> Government headquarters are located in Bayan Palace which houses its own mosque and gardens within its walls. Beside it, the main skyline feature is quintessentially Kuwaiti Water Towers (known for their white-and-blue vertical stripes and long mushroom form), as nine of them are arranged in a diamond shape. <span class="loc">Bayan</span> also houses several international embassies, including that of the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>, <span class="loc">Belgium</span>, and <span class="loc">Thailand</span>. As with other residential areas in <span class="loc">Kuwait</span>, basic features include, bus stations, several supermarkets (one open 24 hours a day), mosques, bakeries, sand football fields, schools (from kindergarten to secondary school), a park, a hospital and dental centre, a jogging path, and a sports club. Almost each residential building has its own unique appearance, as most tend to be privately owned, making this area like some others architecturally diverse.</p>
