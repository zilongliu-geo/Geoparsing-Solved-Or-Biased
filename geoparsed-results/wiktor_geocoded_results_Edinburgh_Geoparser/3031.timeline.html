  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jiangxi</span> (Chinese: 江西; pinyin:  Jiāngxī; Wade–Giles: Chiang1-hsi1; <span class="per">Gan</span>: Kongsi) is a province in the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, located in the southeast of the country. Spanning from the banks of the Yangtze river in the north into hillier areas in the south and east, it shares a border with Anhui to the north, <span class="loc">Zhejiang</span> to the northeast, Fujian to the east, Guangdong to the south, <span class="loc">Hunan</span> to the west, and <span class="loc">Hubei</span> to the northwest. The name "Jiangxi" derives from the circuit administrated under the Tang dynasty in 733, Jiangnanxidao (江南西道, <span class="org">Circuit of Western</span> <span class="loc">Jiangnan</span>; <span class="per">Gan</span>: Kongnomsitau). The short name for <span class="loc">Jiangxi</span> is 赣 (pinyin: Gàn; <span class="per">Gan</span>: Gōm), for the <span class="loc">Gan River</span> which runs across from the south to the north and flows into the <span class="loc">Yangtze River</span>. <span class="loc">Jiangxi</span> is also alternately called Ganpo Dadi (贛鄱大地) which literally means the "Great Land of <span class="per">Gan</span> and <span class="per">Po</span>". <span class="loc">Jiangxi</span> is centered on the <span class="loc">Gan River</span> valley, which historically provided the main north-south transport route of south <span class="loc">China</span>. The corridor along the <span class="loc">Gan River</span> is one of the few easily traveled routes through the otherwise mountainous and rugged terrain of the south-eastern mountains. This open corridor was the primary route for trade and communication between the <span class="loc">North China Plain</span> and the <span class="loc">Yangtze River</span> valley in the north and the territory of modern <span class="loc">Guangdong province</span> in the south. As a result, <span class="loc">Jiangxi</span> has been strategically important throughout much of <span class="loc">China</span>'s history.</p><br><br>
