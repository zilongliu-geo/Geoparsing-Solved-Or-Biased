    In mid-January, Wilson had pled guilty to the state jail felony offense of evading arrest with a motor vehicle, stemming from an August 2007 incident during which he fled from local police after they had received a report of an intoxicated driver, according to Stanley Sokolowski, assistant district attorney for Anderson County.

    Wilson ultimately pulled into the driveway of a residence in the 1200 block of North John Street, according to Sokolowski.

    Wilson already had an “extensive criminal history relating to DWIs” and also was sentenced to five years in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice on an arson conviction in the mid-1990s, according to Sokolowski.

    Some may portray the August 2007 incident as a “victimless crime” since no one was injured, but Sokolowski disagrees, saying innocent peoples’ lives are put at risk when an intoxicated driver flees from police and runs red lights and stop signs in the process.
