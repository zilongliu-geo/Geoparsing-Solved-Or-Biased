  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The Town of <span class="per">Limon</span> is the Statutory Town that is the most populous municipality in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="per">Limon</span> is located immediately east of <span class="loc">Elbert County</span>. The population was <span class="date">1880</span> at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. <span class="per">Limon</span> has been called the "<span class="loc">Hub City</span>" of Eastern <span class="loc">Colorado</span> because Interstate 70, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highways 24, 40, and 287, and State Highways 71 and 86 all pass through the town. The <span class="per">Limon</span> Correctional Facility is part of the <span class="org">Colorado Department of Corrections</span> system and is a major employer in the area with employment of roughly 350. <span class="per">Limon</span> is listed as the official AASHTO control city for signs on Interstate 70 between <span class="loc">Denver</span> and <span class="loc">Hays</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, although westbound signs in both <span class="loc">Colorado</span> and <span class="loc">Kansas</span> often omit <span class="per">Limon</span> and list the larger <span class="loc">city of Denver</span>. <span class="per">Limon</span> is the western terminus of the Kyle Railroad and it is here the shortline interchanges with the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific Railroad. Trains previously stopped at <span class="per">Limon</span> Railroad Depot. The town was named for <span class="per">John Limon</span>, meaning lemon in Spanish, a railroad construction supervisor. <span class="per">Limon</span> was the site of one of the most gruesome lynchings in American history on <span class="date">November 16, 1900</span>. <span class="per">Preston Porter Jr</span>, who had confessed to the murder of a white girl, was led by rope through town, and then tied to a stake and burned to death. He screamed out to be shot, but onlookers only heaped on more fuel, according to an article in the <span class="date">November 17, 1900</span>, edition of <span class="org">The New York Times</span>.</p><br><br>
