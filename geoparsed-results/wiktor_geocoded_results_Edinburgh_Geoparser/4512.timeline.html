  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Chekhov</span> (Russian: Че́хов) is a town and the administrative center of <span class="loc">Chekhovsky District</span> in <span class="loc">Moscow Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>. Population: 60,720 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census); 72,917 (<span class="date">2002</span> Census); 59,206 (<span class="date">1989</span> Census); 56,000 (<span class="date">1985</span>). Originally named <span class="loc">Lopasnya</span> (Лопа́сня), after the <span class="loc">Lopasnya</span> River, it was granted town status and given its present name in <span class="date">1954</span> in honor of writer <span class="per">Anton Chekhov</span>. Within the framework of administrative divisions, <span class="per">Chekhov</span> serves as the administrative center of <span class="loc">Chekhovsky District</span>.
