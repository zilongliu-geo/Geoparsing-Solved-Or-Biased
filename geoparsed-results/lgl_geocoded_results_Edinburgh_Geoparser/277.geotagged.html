<p>How to spend $160 million . A Jazz Dash 8, looking distorted by warm air rising from the runway, takes off from London International Airport -- a crucial spoke in a proposal to make <span class="loc">London</span> a major cargo hub. (Mike Hensen, Sun Media) For some, the future must come now. Deputy Mayor Tom Gosnell and councillors Paul Van Meerbergen, Roger Caranci and Bernie MacDonald pushed hard for a proposal to make <span class="loc">London</span> an international cargo transportation hub whose first spoke would point toward an expanding airport, at a cost of $21 million. Cote says council should consider putting in the needed public works up to the property line of the airport at a cost of $6 million, with the city paying $2 million -- but not paying a share of $15 million of work on airport property.</p>
