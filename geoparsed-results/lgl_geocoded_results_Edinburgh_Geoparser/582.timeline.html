  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Couple found dead in condo. An elderly husband and wife were found dead <span class="date">Monday night</span> in their downtown Hanover condominium in an apparent murder-suicide, authorities said <span class="date">yesterday</span>. The bodies of <span class="per">Elliott Lewis</span>, 84, and <span class="per">Barbara Lewis</span>, 82, were discovered by two Hanover police officers, who responded to the complex at 85 S. Main St. after the couple's adult son grew concerned about their welfare and called the police. <span class="date">Yesterday</span>, authorities released few details and said they were awaiting results of autopsies conducted by the state medical examiner's office, which should be released <span class="date">today</span>. "We have some preliminary assessments from people on scene, but it's inappropriate for me to say," Senior Assistant Attorney General <span class="per">Kirsten Wilson</span> said during an afternoon press conference outside the Hanover police station. Authorities did say that soon after arriving at the condo <span class="date">Monday night</span>, it was determined that only the Lewises were involved and that the public was not in danger. "There are no outside forces," Hanover police Chief <span class="per">Nick Giaccone</span> said. "The community can rest assured that it is safe. It was fairly obvious from the beginning." <span class="per">Wilson</span> declined to say if authorities had pinpointed who died first, a motive or a weapon, or if they had found a note at the scene. Authorities said they were interviewing the Lewises' neighbors and relatives <span class="date">yesterday</span>. <span class="per">Giaccone</span> said the Lewises had two adult sons and other family members scattered throughout the region and country. One of their sons, <span class="per">Spencer Lewis</span> of Bethel, Vt., declined to comment <span class="date">yesterday</span> when reached by phone. "I am beside myself right <span class="date">now</span>," said <span class="per">Spencer Lewis</span>, a local singer-songwriter. <span class="per">Giaccone</span> said the Hanover police had no prior contact with <span class="per">Elliott</span> or <span class="per">Barbara Lewis</span>. "From the police perspective, they were not generally known to us," <span class="per">Giaccone</span> said. The Lewises' 900-square-foot condominium is part of a 55-and-over complex adjacent to the <span class="org">CVS</span> parking lot in downtown <span class="loc">Hanover</span>. The Lewises had lived in the building for <span class="date">about 10 years</span>, <span class="per">Giaccone</span> said. They were renters, according to Hanover Town Hall records.</p><br><br>
