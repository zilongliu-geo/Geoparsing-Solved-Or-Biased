  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Reina</span> (Spanish: "The Queen") is a commune of <span class="loc">Chile</span> located in <span class="loc">Santiago Province</span>, <span class="loc">Santiago Metropolitan</span> Region. It was originally the Larraín family ranch; the corruption of the Larraín surname gives the area its unusual name. It was created in <span class="date">1963</span> from an eastern portion of the Ñuñoa commune. <span class="loc">La Reina</span> is a leafy, residential commune, inhabited by mostly mid to upper-mid income families, with certain areas inhabited by mid-low (Villa <span class="loc">La Reina</span>) and high-income (<span class="loc">La Reina</span> <span class="loc">Alta</span>, towards the east) groups. It consistently ranks in the top five communes with the best quality of life in the Metropolitan Region. A small airport —Aerodrómo Eulogio Sánchez Errázuriz (better known as Tobalaba)— is located on the southern part. The military recently opened its new hospital complex along the commune's main avenue Avenida Larraín. According to the <span class="date">2002</span> census of the National Statistics Institute, <span class="loc">La Reina</span> spans an area of 23.4 km2 (9 sq mi) and has 96,762 inhabitants (44,293 men and 52,469 women), making the commune an entirely urban area. The population grew by 4.7% (4,352 persons) between the <span class="date">1992</span> and 2002 censuses. The <span class="date">2006</span> projected population was 96,551.</p><br><br>
