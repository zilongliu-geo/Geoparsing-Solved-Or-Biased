  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county located in the western portion of the state of <span class="loc">New York</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The county is along the southern shore of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span>. As of <span class="date">2013</span>, the population of <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was 749,857. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is the <span class="loc">city of Rochester</span>. The county is named after <span class="per">James Monroe</span>, the fifth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">NY</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">When counties</span> were established in the Province of <span class="loc">New York</span> in <span class="date">1683</span>, the present <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was part of <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of <span class="loc">New York</span> State as well as all of the present State of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> and, in theory, extending westward to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. This county was reduced in size on <span class="date">July 3, 1766</span> by the creation of <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, and further on <span class="date">March 16, 1770</span> by the creation of <span class="loc">Gloucester County</span>, both containing territory <span class="date">now</span> in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. On <span class="date">March 12, 1772</span>, what was left of <span class="loc">Albany County</span> was split into three parts, one remaining under the name <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. One of the other pieces, <span class="loc">Tryon County</span>, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of <span class="loc">Tryon County</span> was approximately five miles west of the present <span class="loc">city of Schenectady</span>, and the county included the western part of the <span class="loc">Adirondack Mountains</span> and the area west of the <span class="loc">West Branch of the Delaware River</span>. The area then designated as <span class="loc">Tryon County</span> <span class="date">now</span> includes 37 <span class="loc">counties of New York State</span>. The county was named for <span class="per">William Tryon</span>, colonial governor of <span class="loc">New York</span>.</p><br><br>
