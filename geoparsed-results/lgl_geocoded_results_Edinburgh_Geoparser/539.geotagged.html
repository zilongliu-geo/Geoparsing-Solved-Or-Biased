<p>Body of Winona man found behind residence . <span class="loc">WINONA</span> -- The body of a 22-year-old Winona man was found behind a Winona residence Sunday morning. Winona police have identified the body as Matthew Jon Christensen. Police received a call about 10 a.m. that Christensen was lying near the bottom of an exterior stairway next to an alley. Winona police and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension responded. An autopsy will be done, and the investigation is continuing. On March 7, police found Kellen Donald Coatney dead at the base of a slippery shed roof. He apparently climbed a balcony to an adjoining two-story shed with a metal roof. The metal was slippery from frost, and he lost his balance and fell, hitting either a railing or staircase.</p>
