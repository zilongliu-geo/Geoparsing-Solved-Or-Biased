<p><span class="loc">Machang</span> (Jawi: ماچڠ, Thai: มาจัง) is one of the administrative territories (jajahan) or districts in the state of <span class="loc">Kelantan</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. It is situated at the centre of the state, bordering with Kelantanese territories of <span class="loc">Kota Bharu</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Pasir Puteh</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Tanah Merah</span> to the west and <span class="loc">Kuala Krai</span> to the south. It is a home to one of the main campuses of Universiti Teknologi MARA. Its major town and administrative centre is Bandar Machang. The territory of <span class="loc">Machang</span> originated as a village of the same name, Kampung Machang. It was opened in 1880 by a group of settlers from <span class="loc">Pasir Tumboh</span>, <span class="loc">Kota Bharu</span> led by <span class="loc">Senik</span> <span class="loc">Awang</span> <span class="loc">Kecik</span>. On its inception, the territory was mainly economically agrarian with some of the population involved in commerce. Around 1949, <span class="loc">Machang</span> was delineated as a minor Territory of <span class="loc">Kelantan</span>. Owing to its rapid pace of development and active economic sector, <span class="loc">Machang</span> was upgraded as a full Territory on January 1, 1952. The territory is still largely agrarian home to a lot of paddy fields, palm and rubber plantations.</p>
