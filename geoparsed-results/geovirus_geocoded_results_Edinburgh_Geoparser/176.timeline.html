  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>While Aid starts to pour in to the worst hit areas of South <span class="loc">Asia</span> Earthquake that has killed more than 30,000 people, bad weather is hampering the relief efforts with snow falling on the peaks of the earthquake-devastated areas of <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>. The measure of human suffering can't just be measured in the death toll, which officially stands at 23,000, but also in the 4 million who have been made homeless, hungry, and cold with 1 million in acute need, facing certain death without outside assistance. In the Indian state of <span class="loc">Jammu</span> and <span class="loc">Kashmir</span>, authorities say at least 1,300 people are known to have died, but officials fear the number will rise. <span class="org">ABC</span> <span class="loc">Australia</span> reports of a man in <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>-administered <span class="loc">Kashmir</span>, who has been cut from aid, saying "I find that we are alone <span class="date">now</span>. We have nothing. We are finished." Choppers are the main lifeline of support; trucks are unable to deliver relief supplies due to looting and general mayhem on the ground. The more snow, the less able aid agencies are to make their way to those in the direst need. <span class="date">Jan</span> <span class="per">Vandemoortele, U.N.</span> Resident Coordinator for <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>, said key roads into the quake zone have been reopened, as 30 countries including <span class="loc">Australia</span>, <span class="loc">France</span>, <span class="loc">Japan</span>, <span class="loc">Jordan</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, <span class="loc">Iran</span>, <span class="loc">Syria</span> and the <span class="loc">US</span> provide assistance in the form of money, doctors, tents, blankets, and disaster relief teams. United Nations officials are warning of a growing threat of measles, cholera, and diarrhea outbreaks among the millions of survivors. There have been no reports of epidemic outbreaks so far, but the area's health infrastructure has completely collapsed, <span class="per">Vandemoortele</span> said.</p><br><br>
