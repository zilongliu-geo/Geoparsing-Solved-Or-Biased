  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newport</span> is a civil parish and the county town of the <span class="loc">Isle of Wight</span>, an island off the south coast of <span class="loc">England</span>, in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. <span class="loc">Newport</span> had a population of 23,957 according to the <span class="date">2001</span> census, increasing to 25,496 at the <span class="date">2011</span> census. The town is situated slightly to the north of the centre of the Island, at the head of the navigable section of the <span class="loc">River Medina</span>, which flows northward to <span class="loc">Cowes</span> and the Solent, and on which the town has a quay. There are signs of Roman settlement in the area, which was probably known as <span class="loc">Medina</span>, including two known Roman villas, one of which, Newport Roman Villa, has been excavated and is open to the public. There was little later use until after the Norman conquest of <span class="loc">England</span>. The first charter was granted in the late 12th century. In <span class="date">1377</span> an invading French force burnt down much of the town while attempting to take <span class="loc">Carisbrooke Castle</span>, then under the command of <span class="per">Sir Hugh Tyrill</span>. A group of Frenchmen were captured and killed, then buried in a tumulus later nicknamed <span class="loc">Noddies</span> Hill, a "noddy" being medieval slang for a body. This was later corrupted to Nodehill, the present-day name for a part of central <span class="loc">Newport</span> â€“ a name confusing to many as the area is flat.</p><br><br>
