<p>Jackson is the county seat of <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. Located 70 miles east of Memphis, it has long been associated with the large city in trade. Its total population was 65,211 at the 2010 census and 67,265 in the 2012 Census estimate. Jackson is the primary city of the Jackson, <span class="loc">Tennessee metropolitan</span> area, which is included in the Jackson-Humboldt, Tennessee Combined Statistical Area. Jackson is <span class="loc">Madison County</span>'s largest city, and the second largest city in West Tennessee next to Memphis. It is home to the <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span>'s courthouse for West Tennessee, as Jackson was the major city in the west when the court was established in 1834. In the antebellum era, Jackson was the market city for an agricultural area based on cultivation of cotton, the major commodity crop. Beginning in 1851, the city became a hub of railroad systems ultimately connecting to major markets in the north and south, as well as east and west. This was key to its development, attracting trade and many workers on the railroads in the late 19th century with the construction of railroads after the American Civil War. Through the 1960s, the city was served by 15 passenger trains daily, but industry restructuring reduced such service and caused the loss of jobs. The economy has adjusted to new businesses, with major manufacturing in the area.</p>
