<p><span class="loc">Isla Culebra</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [kuˈleβɾa], "<span class="loc">Snake Island</span>") is an island-municipality of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>. It is located approximately 17 miles (27 km) east of the Puerto Rican mainland, 12 miles (19 km) west of <span class="loc">St. Thomas</span> and 9 miles (14 km) north of <span class="loc">Vieques</span>. <span class="loc">Culebra</span> is spread over 5 wards and <span class="loc">Culebra Pueblo</span> (<span class="loc">Dewey</span>), the downtown area and the administrative center of the city. Residents of the island are known as Culebrenses. With a population of 1,818 as of the latest census, it is <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>'s least populous municipality. Originally called <span class="loc">Isla Pasaje</span> and <span class="loc">Isla</span> de <span class="loc">San Ildefonso</span>, <span class="loc">Culebra</span> is also known as <span class="loc">Isla Chiquita</span> (“<span class="loc">Little Island</span>”) and Última <span class="loc">Virgen</span> (“Last Virgin”, due to its position at the end of the <span class="loc">Virgin Islands</span> archipelago). Some sources claim that Christopher Columbus was the first European to arrive at the island during his second voyage in 1493. It is believed that the island was populated by Carib Indians during the colonization. After Agüeybaná and Agüeybaná II led the Taíno rebellion of 1511, Taíno Indians from the main island sought refuge on <span class="loc">Culebra</span> and allied with Caribs to launch random attacks at the island estates.</p>
