<p>Sharon is a town in <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 17,612 at the 2010 census. Sharon is part of Greater Boston, about 17 miles (27 km) southwest of downtown <span class="loc">Boston</span>. Sharon, first settled as part of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span> in 1637, was deemed the 2nd precinct of <span class="loc">Stoughton</span> in 1740. It was established as the <span class="loc">district of Stoughtonham</span> on June 21, 1765, incorporated as the Town of Stoughtonham on August 23, 1775 and was named Sharon on February 25, 1783 after <span class="loc">Israel</span>'s Sharon plain, due to its high level of forestation. Several towns in <span class="loc">New England</span> were given this name. Part of Stoughtonham went to the new town of <span class="loc">Foxborough</span> on June 10, 1776. During the American Revolution, the townspeople of Sharon made cannonballs and cannons for the Continental Army at a local foundry. In front of the Sharon Public Library stands a statue of Deborah Sampson, Sharon's town heroine. Sampson disguised herself as a man to fight in the Revolutionary War. She married Benjamin Gannett, a farmer, after she fought in the war and lived in Sharon until the end of her life. She is buried in the local Rockridge Cemetery. A street in Sharon is named Deborah Sampson Street in her honor.</p>
