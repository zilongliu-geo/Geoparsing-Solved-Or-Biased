<p>Jefferson is a city in <span class="loc">Greene County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along the <span class="loc">North Raccoon River</span>. The population was 4,345 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Greene County</span>. It is the home of the Mahanay Memorial Bell Tower, 168 feet (51 m) tall, located on the town square, and visible for miles. The tower is named for Floyd Mahanay, a philanthropist and former resident. Jefferson is bisected east to west by the old Lincoln Highway (formerly <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 30). A new <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 30 is located about one mile to the north. While platted and settled a few years earlier, "<span class="loc">New Jefferson</span>" was organized in the winter of 1855â€“56 and officially incorporated in January 1872. It began as a farming community and remains so today. The first settlers of the new city were the family of George S. Walton who built there in 1855. During the Civil War, Jefferson as well as <span class="loc">Greene County</span> contributed its sons to raising Company H, 10th <span class="loc">Iowa</span> Infantry (1861) and Company E, 39th <span class="loc">Iowa</span> Infantry (1862). The railway came to Jefferson in the decades after the Civil War. Jefferson's first mayor was Mahlon Head, elected in 1872. Jefferson's library was completed in 1904 through the generosity of the <span class="loc">Carnegie</span> library fund. The stretch of Lincoln Highway that runs through Jefferson was completed circa 1924.</p>
