  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bolivar</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">northern Denton County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, at the intersection of Farm Roads <span class="date">2450</span> and 455, 14 miles northwest of <span class="loc">Denton</span>, on <span class="loc">Clear Creek</span>. The community was founded as <span class="loc">New Prospect</span> in <span class="date">1859</span>. <span class="per">William Crawford</span> sold the site to Hiram Daily, a Methodist minister and doctor, who opened a general store, and laid out and named the town. In <span class="date">1861</span> <span class="per">Ben Brown</span>, a farmer who had moved from <span class="loc">Bolivar</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, suggested the renaming of the town and persuaded residents to vote for the name <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> (pronounced by locals as "BALL-iver") by providing them free rum. <span class="per">John Simpson</span> <span class="loc">Chisum</span> ranched near <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> but moved his herds in <span class="date">1863</span> to <span class="per">West Texas</span>. <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> was three miles east of the <span class="loc">Chisholm</span> Trail, which ran through nearby cattle ranches. Cowboys on the trail came to <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> to stay at its hotel and patronize its saloons. Development of the community was slow but steady until <span class="date">1886</span>. In <span class="date">that year</span>, <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> merchants moved their businesses to <span class="loc">Sanger</span>, on the Gulf, <span class="per">Colorado</span> and <span class="per">Santa</span> Fe Railwayâ€”locals say <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> residents opposed giving up land for the railroad, whereas nearby <span class="loc">Sanger</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> to the east was much more accommodating.</p><br><br>
