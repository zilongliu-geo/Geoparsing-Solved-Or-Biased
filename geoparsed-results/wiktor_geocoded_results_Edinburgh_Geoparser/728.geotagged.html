<p>Dalton is a town in <span class="loc">Berkshire County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Dalton is a transition town between the urban and rural portions of <span class="loc">Berkshire County</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Pittsfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 6,756 at the 2010 census. Dalton was first settled in 1755 and officially incorporated in 1784. The town was named after Tristram Dalton, the Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives at the time of the town's incorporation. Dalton was settled as a rural-industrial community, with mills set up along the <span class="loc">East Branch of the Housatonic River</span> and small patches of farmland in other areas. In 1801, Zenas Crane, Henry Wiswall and John Willard set up a paper mill along the river which, by 1844, had begun producing banknote paper, which was purchased by banks all the way to <span class="loc">Boston</span>. The company, Crane &amp; Co., still is the largest employer in town, making paper products, stationery, and, since 1873, has been the only supplier of paper for the Federal Reserve Note, the <span class="loc">United States</span>' paper money. The town now has a mix of small town and suburban qualities, and was served by trolleys to <span class="loc">Pittsfield</span> for many years.</p>
