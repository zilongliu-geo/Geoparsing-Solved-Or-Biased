  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Flora is a city in <span class="loc">Clay County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,070 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Flora was founded by <span class="per">Samuel White</span>. White was born <span class="date">September 10, 1831</span> in <span class="loc">Warren County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. He and his family came to <span class="loc">Clay County</span> in <span class="date">1852</span>. During that time, he purchased 85 acres (34 ha) of land from the State of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. His first wife, <span class="per">Sarah Ann</span> Wall was born in <span class="date">1833</span>. <span class="per">Sarah</span> died <span class="date">December 13, 1859</span> in Flora, and is buried in the family plot in Elmwood Cemetery. In <span class="date">December 1860</span>, White married <span class="per">Helen M. Riggs</span> in Flora. The original town of Flora was laid out, surveyed and platted in <span class="date">February 1854</span> by Ethelred Nixon, County Surveyor; <span class="per">John Brown</span>, Trustee for Songer, Camp &amp; Company; and <span class="per">Samuel White</span>. It embraced eighty-five acres of the west half of Section 25, Township 3 north Range 6 east. <span class="per">Samuel White</span> who still owned the land, deeded one-half interest in forty acres to <span class="per">John Brown</span>, Trustee, with a view of securing the town and depot. An effort had already been made to establish a town one mile west called <span class="loc">Mooresville</span>, where over 100 lots had been sold and some buildings done. After the collapse of that village, the principal house was moved to Flora, and was then known as the "Commercial House."</p><br><br>
