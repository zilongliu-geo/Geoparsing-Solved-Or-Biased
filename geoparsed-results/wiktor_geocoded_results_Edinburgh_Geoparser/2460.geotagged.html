<p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 11,638. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Gainesboro</span>. Jackson is part of the Cookeville, TN Micropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> was created by an act of the Tennessee General Assembly on November 6, 1801. It was the eighteenth county established in the state. It was formed from part of <span class="loc">Smith County</span> plus Indian lands. The name honors Andrew Jackson, a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> congressman and senator, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> judge, commander at the Battle of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>, and the seventh President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In the 1790s, an Army outpost named Fort Blount was built 10 miles (16 km) west of <span class="loc">Gainesboro</span> on the <span class="loc">Cumberland River</span>, in what is now western <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>. Fort Blount was an important stop for travellers on Avery's Trace. <span class="loc">Williamsburg</span>, a town developed around the fort, served as the <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> seat from 1807 to 1819. The county's early records were all lost in a disastrous courthouse fire on August 14, 1872.</p>
