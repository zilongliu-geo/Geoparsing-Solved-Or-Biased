<p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 1,163,414, making it the second-most populous county in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, the state capital and most populous city in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The county was established on April 30, 1803, less than two months after <span class="loc">Ohio</span> became a state, and was named after Benjamin Franklin. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> originally extended all the way north to <span class="loc">Lake Erie</span> before <span class="loc">Ohio</span> subdivided further into more counties. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">OH</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, particularly <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, has been a centerpiece for presidential and congressional politics, most notably the 2000 presidential election, the 2004 presidential election, and the 2006 midterm elections. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is home to one of the largest universities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, The Ohio State University, which as of fall 2014 has an enrollment of 58,322 students on its main <span class="loc">Columbus</span> campus. On March 30, 1803, the Ohio government authorized the creation of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>. The county originally was part of <span class="loc">Ross County</span>. Residents named the county in honor of Benjamin Franklin. In 1816, <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>’s <span class="loc">Columbus</span> became Ohio’s state capital. Surveyors laid out the city in 1812, and officials incorporated it in 1816. <span class="loc">Columbus</span> was not Ohio’s original capital, but the state legislature chose to move the state government there after its location for a short time at <span class="loc">Chillicothe</span> and at <span class="loc">Zanesville</span>. <span class="loc">Columbus</span> was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access by way of major transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio’s capital over a number of other competitors, including <span class="loc">Franklinton</span>, <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Worthington</span>, and <span class="loc">Delaware</span>.</p>
