<p><span class="loc">Liuli</span>, formerly known as Sphinx Hafen (German: Sphinxhafen), is a settlement on the Tanzanian shore of <span class="loc">Lake Malawi</span> in the <span class="loc">Mbinga District</span> of <span class="loc">Ruvuma province</span>. It is notable for being the site of the first naval action of World War I. The settlement is distinguished on the lake shore by a sphinx-like series of 7 rocks lying offshore. The rocks indicate deep water, leading to its development by the Germans as a ship repair base. The <span class="loc">Anglican</span> missionary William Percival Johnson described the rocks as follows: "Sphinx Hafen rocks, so called by the Germans (the native name is <span class="loc">Liuli</span>) is fairly central placed on the east side. If you can see the great rock on the south side of the entrance in the right light you will not ask 'Why is this place called Sphinx?' The harbor is small but good, and here was the first opening skirmish of the Great War on the Lake. The German steamer had been pulled up on a slipway here, and was seized by the British. <span class="loc">Nyasa</span>, the great water: being a description of the lake and the life of the People. 1922</p>
