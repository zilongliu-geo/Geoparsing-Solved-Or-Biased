  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Middleton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Strafford County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,783 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Granted by the Masonian Proprietors in <span class="date">1749</span>, the town was named after Sir <span class="per">Charles Middleton</span>, 1st <span class="per">Baron Barham</span>, who was in charge of convoy service between <span class="loc">Barbados</span> and the colonies. The land was first settled shortly before the Revolutionary War by settlers from <span class="per">Lee</span> and <span class="per">Rochester</span>. Soon after the War, its population was challenged when a number of Quaker families led by the town auditor, <span class="per">Nicholas Austin</span>, left for the more peaceful setting of <span class="per">Austin</span>, <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. Although the soil is rocky and unsuited for cultivation, cider was made in considerable quantities, and maple syrup to some extent. <span class="per">Middleton</span> was situated on the road between the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> <span class="per">Seacoast</span> and <span class="per">Wolfeboro</span>, the location of Colonial Governor <span class="per">John Wentworth</span>'s <span class="date">summer</span> home, <span class="loc">Kingswood</span>. (<span class="date">Today</span> the road survives as "Governors Road" in northern <span class="loc">Rochester</span> and Milton and continues as "<span class="loc">Kings Highway</span>" through <span class="per">Middleton</span>.) Neglect of the road caused the governor to bill the proprietors for repairs he had to make for safe travel to <span class="loc">Kingswood</span>, built in <span class="date">1771</span>. <span class="per">Middleton</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">March 4, 1778</span>, and originally included <span class="loc">Brookfield</span>, which was split off in <span class="date">December of 1794</span>.</p><br><br>
