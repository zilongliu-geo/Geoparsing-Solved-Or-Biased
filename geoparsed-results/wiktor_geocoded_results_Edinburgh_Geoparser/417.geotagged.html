<p><span class="loc">Salem</span> is an unincorporated community east-centrally located in <span class="loc">Lee County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 280 between <span class="loc">Opelika</span> and <span class="loc">Phenix City</span>. It is part of the Auburn Metropolitan Area. <span class="loc">Salem</span> was first settled in 1835, and grew rapidly for the next two decades. <span class="loc">Salem</span> incorporated in 1846 and quickly became one of the area's largest cities. However, a fire which engulfed the town in 1854 and the subsequent Civil War resulted in the collapse of the town's government, and rapid depopulation. <span class="loc">Salem</span> lost a bid to be the county seat of the newly formed <span class="loc">Lee County</span> in 1865, and then saw its charter become inactive in the following decades. Today, <span class="loc">Salem</span> is a small unincorporated community of a few hundred. By the late 20th century <span class="loc">Salem</span> was the location of <span class="loc">Lee County</span>'s only covered bridge, the Salem-Shotwell <span class="loc">Covered</span> Bridge. A symbol of the area, the bridge was destroyed by a fallen tree following a storm in 2005. It was rebuilt in 2007 at <span class="loc">Opelika</span> Municipal Park in nearby <span class="loc">Opelika</span>. A post office operating under the name <span class="loc">Salem</span> was first opened in 1839.</p>
