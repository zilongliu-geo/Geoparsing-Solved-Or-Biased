<p><span class="loc">Waterloo</span> (/ˌwɔːtərˈluː/) is a <span class="loc">district of Central London</span>, and part of the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Lambeth</span>. It is situated 1 mile (1.6 km) east of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. The area is part of a business improvement district known as <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> Quarter, which includes The Cut and the <span class="loc">Old Vic</span> and Young Vic theatres, including some sections in the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Southwark</span>. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is connected to the Strand area on the north bank of the <span class="loc">River Thames</span> by <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> Bridge. The first bridge on the site was opened in 1817 and the current bridge was opened in 1945. The bridge was named to commemorate the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> in 1815. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> Road also dates from this time, built on land belonging to the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Church of <span class="loc">St John</span> the Evangelist, <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> Road was constructed from 1822 by the Commissioners for Building New Churches as the population of the <span class="loc">parish of Lambeth</span> had significantly increased. After the opening of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> railway station in 1848 the locality around the station and <span class="loc">Lower Marsh</span> became known as <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. The boundary of the ecclesiastical <span class="loc">parish of St John Waterloo</span> established in 1824 was formed by the <span class="loc">River Thames</span> in the north and west, approximated Westminster Bridge Road in the south, and followed the boundary with <span class="loc">Southwark</span> in the east.</p>
