  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Govan</span> (/ˈɡʌvən/ GUV-ən; Scottish Gaelic: <span class="loc">Baile</span> a' Ghobhainn) is a district, parish, and former burgh <span class="date">now</span> part of southwest City of <span class="loc">Glasgow</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is situated 2.5 miles (4.0 km) west of <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> city centre, on the south bank of the <span class="loc">River Clyde</span>, opposite the mouth of the <span class="loc">River Kelvin</span> and the <span class="loc">district of Partick</span>. Historically it was part of the <span class="loc">County of Lanark</span>. According to medieval legend, <span class="per">Constantine</span>, a 7th-century <span class="per">King of Strathclyde</span>, founded a monastery under the rule of Columbanus in <span class="loc">Govan</span>. During the Middle Ages, <span class="loc">Govan</span> was the site of a ferry which linked the area with <span class="loc">Partick</span> for seasonal cattle drovers. In the 18th and 19th <span class="date">centuries</span>, textile mills and coal mining were important; in the early 19th century shipbuilding emerged as Govan's principal industry. In <span class="date">1864</span>, <span class="loc">Govan</span> gained burgh status, and was <span class="loc">Scotland</span>'s fifth largest burgh. It was incorporated into the <span class="loc">city of Glasgow</span> in <span class="date">1912</span>. Recent studies of the archaeology of old <span class="loc">Govan</span> have revealed the presence of an ancient Christian church. Two associated Christian burials are radiocarbon dated to the 5th or 6th <span class="date">centuries</span>, making <span class="loc">Govan</span> the earliest known Christian site in the region. <span class="loc">Govan</span> is believed to have then been part of a kingdom ruled from <span class="loc">Dumbarton</span> Rock, known as Alt Clut, the rock on the <span class="loc">Clyde</span>. During the Viking Age, perhaps following the sack of <span class="loc">Dumbarton</span> Rock in 878, <span class="loc">Govan</span> is believed to have been one of the major centres of the Kingdom of <span class="per">Strathclyde</span>. According to John of Fordun, <span class="per">Constantine</span>, a 7th-century king of <span class="per">Strathclyde</span>, founded a monastery at <span class="loc">Govan</span>, where he died and was buried. In <span class="date">1855</span>, an elaborately carved sandstone sarcophagus was found during digging in the churchyard. It is <span class="date">now</span> kept inside the church. It may have been used to contain the body or relics of <span class="per">Constantine</span>, although the style of carving indicates an origin in the 10th or 11th <span class="date">centuries</span>. This <span class="per">King Constantine</span> is first mentioned in the 12th-century Life of St. Kentigern by Jocelyn of <span class="loc">Furness</span>, where he is said to have been son of <span class="per">Riderch Hael</span>. He is likely a literary invention. The early church in <span class="loc">Govan</span> is dedicated to a <span class="per">Saint Constantine</span>, about whom nothing else is known.</p><br><br>
