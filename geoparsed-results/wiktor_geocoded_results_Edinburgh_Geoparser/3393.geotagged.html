<p><span class="loc">Toko</span> is a small rural settlement 10 kilometres <span class="loc">east of Stratford</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, at the intersection of <span class="loc">East Road</span> (State Highway 43) and <span class="loc">Toko</span> Road. It is located on a railway, the Stratfordâ€“Okahukura Line, the western portion of which was operated as a branch line known as the <span class="loc">Toko</span> Branch prior to the line's completion. The <span class="loc">Toko</span> Stream flows through the area to join the <span class="loc">Patea River</span>. The population of the <span class="loc">Toko</span> statistical area was 1164 in the 2006 Census, unchanged from 2001. The statistical area covers a large region to the east of <span class="loc">Stratford</span>, not just the settlement of <span class="loc">Toko</span>. <span class="loc">Toko</span> is surrounded by extremely fertile land, being located on the periphery of the Taranaki ringplain and adjacent to the <span class="loc">Patea River</span>. The area is drained by the <span class="loc">Toko</span> Stream, and its tributaries the Manawaiwiri and Waiwiri Streams. Once covered in wetlands, since settlement the area has been drained to take advantage of the fertile soils. Dairy farming predominates the surrounding land use, with some sheep and beef farming in the steeper hill country. <span class="loc">Toko</span> was established in the 1890s, and served as an important centre for the developing hinterland. The settlement took on the nature of a village, containing a railway station, a dairy factory, a church, a hall, a hotel, a sawmill, a trucking depot, a playcentre, a sports facility, and a number of other businesses and numerous dwellings. Toko School was established in 1893, and located on a site approximately 2 km east of <span class="loc">Toko</span> at the intersection of <span class="loc">East Road</span> and Wawiri Road.</p>
