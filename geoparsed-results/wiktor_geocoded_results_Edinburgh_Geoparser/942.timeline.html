  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Effingham County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,852 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 1,821 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Effingham County</span>. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Savannah Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is the seat of government for <span class="loc">Effingham County</span>. <span class="loc">Ebenezer</span> was the county seat from <span class="date">1797</span> to <span class="date">1799</span>. In <span class="date">1799</span>, <span class="loc">Effingham County</span> had three different county seats. The state legislature appointed a commission to select a new centrally located site for the permanent county seat. A location five miles from the center of the county was chosen and named <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, for the plantation of <span class="per">General David Blackshear</span>. The county government surveyed the new town, and designated streets, lots, and the public squares that were to be used for the courthouse and the jail. The lots were sold to finance the construction of these public buildings. A map drawn in <span class="date">1821</span> shows four north–south streets and nine east–west streets. Development of the new county seat was slow, as it was isolated from customary routes of trade. At the turn of the 20th century, it was listed as having only about twelve houses.</p><br><br>
