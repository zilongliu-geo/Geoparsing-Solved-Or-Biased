<p><span class="loc">Kampala</span> is the capital and largest <span class="loc">city of Uganda</span>. The city is divided into five boroughs that oversee local planning: <span class="loc">Kampala</span> <span class="loc">Central Division</span>, <span class="loc">Kawempe Division</span>, <span class="loc">Makindye Division</span>, <span class="loc">Nakawa Division</span>, and <span class="loc">Lubaga Division</span>. The city is coterminous with <span class="loc">Kampala District</span>. Surrounding <span class="loc">Kampala</span> is the rapidly growing <span class="loc">Wakiso District</span>, whose population more than doubled between 2002 and 2014 and now stands at over 2 million. Before the arrival of the British colonists, the <span class="loc">Kabaka</span> of <span class="loc">Buganda</span> had chosen the zone that would become <span class="loc">Kampala</span> as a hunting reserve. The area, composed of rolling hills with grassy wetlands in the valleys, was home to several species of antelope, particularly impala. When the British arrived, they called it "Hills of the Impala". The language of the <span class="loc">Buganda</span>, <span class="loc">Luganda</span>, adopted many English words because of their interactions with the British. The <span class="loc">Buganda</span> translated "Hill of the Impala" as Akasozi ke'Empala - "Kasozi" meaning "hill", "ke" meaning "of", and "empala" the plural of "impala". In <span class="loc">Luganda</span>, the words "ka'mpala" means "that is of the impala", in reference to a hill, and the single word "Kampala" was adopted as the name for the city that grew out of the <span class="loc">Kabaka</span>'s hills.</p>
