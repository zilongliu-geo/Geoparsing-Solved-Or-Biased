<p><span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 13 km north-east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>'s central business district. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Banyule</span>. At the 2011 Census, <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> had a population of 5,714. Once a large town on <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>'s fringe, <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> was absorbed into <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> as part of the latter's northward expansion after World War II. <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> once had its own historic Central Business District including its own municipality in the former <span class="loc">City of Heidelberg</span>. It was named after the German <span class="loc">city of Heidelberg</span>. The land at <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> was sold by crown auction in 1838, making it one of the earliest rural allotments; <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> was founded only three years earlier. By 1840, Warringal had been established as a surveyed township, the name referring to an Aboriginal term for eagle's nest. Eventually, Warringal was changed to <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> by a land agent, after the German <span class="loc">city of Heidelberg</span>. The <span class="loc">Heidelberg City</span> Council proposed a name change during World War II, but it was rejected after public outcry. When it was settled, <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> was reached by track from <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> via <span class="loc">North Fitzroy</span>, and in 1841 the Heidelberg Road Trust was formed. As a form of Local Government, it preceded the Melbourne Town Council. By the late 1840s, the road had a toll bar at <span class="loc">Merri Creek</span>, and a macadamised surface. It became a tourist attraction, enhancing Heidelberg's reputation as a desirable place for views, excursions and rural estates. Cattle overlander Joseph Hawdon built his gothic Banyule Homestead in 1846, overlooking the <span class="loc">Yarra</span> Valley.</p>
