  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Milford</span> is an incorporated rural community located in North Central <span class="loc">Texas</span>, in the southwestern corner of <span class="loc">Ellis County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 728 in <span class="date">2010</span>. The town is located approximately 14 miles (22 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> and 20 miles (32 km) south of Waxahachie, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 77 and Interstate 35E; <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 77 is signed locally as the town's Main Street. The community received media attention due to a Chevron gas pipeline explosion and resulting town evacuation which occurred in <span class="date">2013</span>. <span class="loc">Milford</span> dates back to the 1850s, when several men from <span class="loc">Cherokee County</span> came to the <span class="loc">Mill Creek</span> valley and bought land at 50 cents an acre from <span class="loc">Ellis County</span> landowner Arvin Wright. <span class="loc">Milford</span> was named by <span class="per">William R. Hudson</span> after a factory town in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. During <span class="date">1853</span> the first house, a combined residence and general store belonging to <span class="per">William R. Hudson</span> was built, along with a two story schoolhouse which served as church and community hall until it burned during the Civil War. In <span class="date">1854</span> <span class="per">Wright, Hudson</span>, and <span class="per">J.M. Higgins</span> laid out town lots atop a ridge. In <span class="date">1857</span>, a gristmill began operation at the community. <span class="loc">Milford</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1888</span>, with <span class="per">W.R. McDaniel</span> serving as the first mayor. In <span class="date">1890</span>, the tracks of the <span class="loc">Dallas</span> and Waco Railway (later acquired by the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad) reached the community, which became an important shipping point for area cotton farmers.</p><br><br>
