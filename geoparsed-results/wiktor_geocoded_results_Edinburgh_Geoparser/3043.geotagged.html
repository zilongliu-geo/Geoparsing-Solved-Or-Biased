<p><span class="loc">La Plata</span> is the capital city of the Province of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, and of the partido <span class="loc">La Plata</span>. According to the 2001 census [INDEC], it has a population of 740,369 and its metropolitan area has 894,253 inhabitants. <span class="loc">La Plata</span> was planned and developed to serve as the provincial capital after the city of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> was federalized in 1880. It was officially founded by Governor Dardo Rocha on 19 November 1882. Its construction is fully documented in photographs by Tomás Bradley Sutton. <span class="loc">La Plata</span> was renamed Eva <span class="loc">Perón City</span> (Ciudad Eva Perón) between 1952 and 1955. The city is home to two important first division football (soccer) teams: <span class="loc">Estudiantes</span> de <span class="loc">La Plata</span>, and Gimnasia y Esgrima <span class="loc">La Plata</span>. Rocha decided to erect a new city to host the provincial government institutions and a university which had already been planned. Urban planner Pedro Benoit designed a city layout based on a rationalist conception of urban centers. The city has the shape of a square with a central park and two main diagonal avenues, north to south and east to west. In addition, there are numerous other shorter diagonal streets. This design is copied in a self-similar manner in small blocks of six by six blocks in length. For every six blocks, there is a small park or square. Other than the diagonal streets, all streets are on a rectangular grid and are numbered consecutively. Thus, <span class="loc">La Plata</span> is nicknamed "la ciudad de las diagonales" (city of diagonals). It is also called "la ciudad de los tilos" (city of linden trees), because of the large number of linden trees lining the many streets and squares. The linden tree is one of a number of deciduous Northern Hemisphere tree species which dominate <span class="loc">La Plata</span>'s parks and streets; ash, horsechestnut, plane, sweetgum and tulip tree are among the other examples. Palms and subtropical broadleaf evergreen trees thrive, but are comparatively infrequent.</p>
