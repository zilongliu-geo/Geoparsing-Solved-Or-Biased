  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Jefferson (also known as <span class="loc">Owendale</span>) is an unincorporated community within <span class="loc">Cardston County</span>, <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It community is located approximately 16 km (9.9 mi) southeast of <span class="loc">Cardston</span>, which is home to <span class="loc">Cardston County</span>'s municipal office. One of Jefferson's two services at this point in time is an unmanned postal box outlet (Rural Route 2 Site 10). It shares the same postal code as <span class="loc">Cardston</span> (T0K 0K0), and in fact, mail going to the Jefferson area is addressed to <span class="loc">Cardston</span> - as Jefferson-bound mail is sorted at <span class="loc">Cardston</span> - then delivered to Jefferson by <span class="org">Canada Post</span> on <span class="date">Monday</span>, <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, and <span class="date">Friday</span>. There is a new <span class="org">Canada Post</span> box installment after the old, green one was covered by debris when the neighboring abandoned Jefferson Garage collapsed in a windstorm in <span class="date">2003</span>. The garage had been abandoned for generations and the wooden structure had seemed to be on the verge of collapse for <span class="date">years</span>. The now-flattened garage had been beside an old General Store, but that store was converted into a family home generations ago. The other service for the community is the Jefferson Waste Transfer Site, constructed in <span class="date">the 1980s</span> to replace an old open-air dump that was located in a small gully two miles west of Jefferson. The newer Waste Transfer Site is located only about a quarter-mile east of Jefferson, and is manned only <span class="date">one day</span> <span class="date">a week</span>.</p><br><br>
