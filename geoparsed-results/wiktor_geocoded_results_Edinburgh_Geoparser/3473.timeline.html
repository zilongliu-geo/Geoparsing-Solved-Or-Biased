  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dauphin (French for <span class="org">Dolphin</span>, see Dauphin of <span class="loc">France</span>) is a city in <span class="loc">Manitoba</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, with a population of 8,251 as of the <span class="date">2011</span> Canadian Census. The nearby lake was given the name "Dauphin" by the explorer <span class="per">Pierre Gaultier de Varennes</span>, sieur de La Vérendrye in <span class="date">1741</span> in honour of the heir to the French throne. Settlers began arriving in the area in <span class="date">1883</span> and two early settlements, <span class="loc">Gartmore</span> and "Old Dauphin" were established. With the coming of the railway in <span class="date">1896</span> – the line ran roughly halfway between the two villages – settlement shifted to the present site. This coincided with the beginning of Ukrainian settlement in the area: previously most arrivals had been of British extraction. Incorporated as a village in <span class="date">1898</span> and as a town in <span class="date">1901</span>, Dauphin became an important centre for the transportation of grain. Farming still plays a central role in the economy of the area, but its role has been greatly reduced. The current mayor of Dauphin is <span class="per">Eric Irwin</span>, a lawyer. Conservative <span class="per">Robert Sopuck</span> has been <span class="org">the Member of Parliament</span> for the Dauphin—Swan River—Marquette riding since <span class="date">November 2010</span>. He is the <span class="loc">Manitoba</span> Caucus Chairman in the Conservative Government of <span class="per">Stephen Harper</span>. New Democrat Stan Struthers is the current Member of the Legislative Assembly, in the NDP <span class="org">Government of Premier</span> <span class="per">Greg Selinger</span>. Dauphin plays host to several <span class="date">summer</span> festivals, including <span class="org">Dauphin's Countryfest and Canada's National Ukrainian Festival</span>. Dauphin is known as the "Garden Capital of <span class="loc">Manitoba</span>."</p><br><br>
