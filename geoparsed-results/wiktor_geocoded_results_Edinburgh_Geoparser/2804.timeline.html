  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Newcastle</span> is the third-largest city in the <span class="loc">province of KwaZulu-Natal</span>, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>, with a population of 363,236 citizens as of the <span class="date">2011</span> census. 56,144 of these citizens reside in <span class="loc">Newcastle West</span>, whilst the balance of the population reside in the main townships of <span class="loc">Madadeni</span> and <span class="loc">Osizweni</span>, which form <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> East. Set at the picturesque foothills of the northern KwaZulu-Natal <span class="loc">Drakensberg</span> Mountains, <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> is located in the north west corner of the province along the <span class="loc">Ncandu</span> River and is one of the country's main industrial centers. <span class="per">Newcastle</span>'s municipal area is 188 square kilometres (73 square miles), consists of 31 wards and a population growth rate of 0.87%, ranking <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> as <span class="loc">South Africa</span>'s tenth-largest city. The N11 and R34 are the principal roads linking the city to the rest of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. <span class="per">Newcastle</span> is the seat of the local municipality as well as being the seat to the <span class="loc">Amajuba District</span> Municipality. <span class="per">Newcastle</span> has a long illustrious history having changed names on numerous occasions during the country's historic rule. It was initially named Post Halt Number 2 on military maps during the 1840s, as postal coaches stopped here to obtain fresh horses on the journey between <span class="loc">Durban</span> (then <span class="loc">Port Natal</span> in Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek) and <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span>. It was later known as the Waterfall River Township because of the <span class="loc">Ncandu</span> River. <span class="per">Newcastle</span> received her name after the British Colonial Secretary, the fifth <span class="per">Duke of Newcastle</span>, a British aristocrat, and not the city in <span class="loc">England</span> as some believe. During the Anglo-Boer War, <span class="per">Newcastle</span> was invaded by Boer forces on <span class="date">October 14, 1899</span>, and the entire district was incorporated into the Transvaal Republic. <span class="per">Newcastle</span>'s name lasted for a period of <span class="date">seven months</span> when it was renamed to Viljoensdorp after the commander of the Johannesburg Commando, <span class="per">General Ben Viljoen</span>. However, after relief of <span class="loc">Ladysmith</span> under the command of <span class="per">General Redver Buller</span>, the British forces reclaimed the name back to <span class="loc">Newcastle</span>.</p><br><br>
