  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Caba</span> (Ilocano: Ili ti <span class="loc">Caba</span>; <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>: <span class="org">Baley na</span> <span class="loc">Caba</span>) is a fourth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">La Union</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. <span class="loc">Caba</span> is the birthplace of <span class="per">Diego Silang</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 21,244 people. <span class="loc">Caba</span> was a part of the municipality of <span class="loc">Aringay</span> until the late-19th century when it was permanently separated to form its own entity. It has a land area of 4,631 hectares (11,440 acres). <span class="loc">Caba</span> is between <span class="loc">Aringay</span> to the south and <span class="loc">Bauang</span>, <span class="loc">La Union</span>, a main connection in the <span class="loc">Manila-Laoag City</span> itinerary and 248 kilometres (154 mi) from <span class="loc">Metro Manila</span> or approximately 5 hours by land transportation. History records show that this municipality used three names interchangeably: <span class="loc">Caba</span>, <span class="loc">Cava</span> and <span class="loc">Caua</span>. According to a local historian <span class="per">Pedro Manongdo</span>, two tales have persisted on how the town got his name. One group referred to an incident when a Spaniard asked an inhabitant the name of the place. The youth mistook the question as an inquiry to the name of the animal he was herding and answered “Cava.” The repetition of the name ended with <span class="loc">Cava</span> and later <span class="loc">Caba</span>.</p><br><br>
