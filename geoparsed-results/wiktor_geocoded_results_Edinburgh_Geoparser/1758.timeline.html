  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Nelson</span> (Welsh: Ffos y Gerddinen) is a village and community in the <span class="loc">county borough of Caerphilly</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span>. It sits five miles north of <span class="loc">Caerphilly</span> and ten miles north of <span class="loc">Cardiff</span>, at the lower end of the <span class="loc">Taff Bargoed</span> Valley, and lies adjacent to <span class="loc">Treharris</span>, <span class="loc">Trelewis</span> and <span class="loc">Quakers Yard</span>. <span class="per">Nelson</span> was originally called Ffos-y-Gerddinen, a relatively flat piece of land at the southern extremity of the <span class="loc">Taff Bargoed</span> Valley to the south of the hamlet of <span class="loc">Llancaiach</span>. It existed on a drovers trail from the <span class="loc">South Wales</span> coast towards <span class="loc">Merthyr Tydfil</span> and onwards to <span class="per">Brecon</span> and <span class="per">Mid</span> <span class="loc">Wales</span>, where an enterprising man built a coaching inn that he called <span class="per">Nelson</span>, possibly after Admiral <span class="per">Lord Nelson</span> and his victory at the Battle of <span class="loc">Trafalgar</span>. Had it not been for the development of the <span class="loc">South Wales</span> coalfield, <span class="per">Nelson</span> would have remained just a coaching inn surrounded by fields. When the Llancaiach Colliery was developed from <span class="date">1811</span>, it created a need for new housing for the workers and heavy transport for the coal, which spilled onto the flat lands below the colliery. Freight transport from <span class="loc">Merthyr Tydfil</span> had already brought about the development of the <span class="loc">Glamorganshire Canal</span> which by-passed <span class="per">Nelson</span> in the nearby <span class="loc">Taff</span> Valley, but in <span class="date">1841</span> the <span class="loc">Taff</span> Vale Railway's Llancaiach Branch was built specifically to service Llancaiach Colliery and entered the <span class="loc">Taff Bargoed</span> Valley via the centre of <span class="per">Nelson</span>. Looking for a name for its station, which was built on the flat land south of the colliery, the directors of the <span class="org">TVR</span> chose the name of the coaching inn. When the <span class="loc">Taff</span> Vale Extension railway of the <span class="loc">Newport</span>, <span class="loc">Abergavenny</span> and <span class="loc">Hereford Railway</span> was built, it replicated the <span class="org">TVR</span> naming convention for its station, and <span class="per">Nelson</span> was born as a village with a separate identity to <span class="loc">Llancaiach</span>.</p><br><br>
