<p>Brewster is a village in, and the county seat of, <span class="loc">Blaine County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 17 at the 2010 census. The town was laid out in 1884 by George Washington Brewster who had homesteaded the land there. It was named for one of his ancestors, William Brewster, who had arrived in <span class="loc">America</span> on the <span class="loc">Mayflower</span>. The community was named the county seat in 1887 after George Washington Brewster offered to build the required buildings. According to town lore, Brewster had expected the state capitol to be located in the community because of its central location. In 1887 the outlaw D.C."Doc" <span class="loc">Middleton</span> opened a saloon in the community. Following the 2010 census Brewster became the smallest incorporated county seat in the <span class="loc">United States</span> replacing Amidon, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span> for the title. Amidon had 26 people in 2000 and Brewster had 29. In the 2010 census Brewster had 17 while Amidon had 20. There are two other unincorporated county seats in the same range -- <span class="loc">Mentone</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> (population 19), the county seat of <span class="loc">Loving County</span> and <span class="loc">Gann Valley</span>, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span> (population 14), the county seat of <span class="loc">Buffalo County</span>, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>.</p>
