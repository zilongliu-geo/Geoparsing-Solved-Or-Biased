  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Woodville</span> is a very small township in the Hunter Region of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> that is shared between the <span class="loc">Port Stephens</span> and <span class="loc">Maitland</span> local government areas (LGA). Most of the town lies to the east of the <span class="loc">Paterson River</span> in the <span class="loc">Port Stephens</span> LGA while a small area of approximately 1.3 square kilometres (0.5 sq mi), to the west of the <span class="loc">Paterson</span>, is within the boundaries of the <span class="loc">Maitland</span> LGA. Woodville's primary land use is agricultural, although housing and small-acre rural residential lots are increasingly significant. Its agriculture consists mainly of broad-acre hay production, along with beef cattle grazing, turf-farming, poultry and olive production. It sits on the floodplains of the lower <span class="loc">Hunter River</span> and is subject to periodic flooding. The <span class="loc">Woodville region</span> was occupied originally by Aboriginals, most likely the Worimi people. It offered abundant natural resources, with rivers, extensive wetlands, lakes, open woodland and rainforest. In the early 19th century, the first Europeans known to enter the region were timber-getters seeking to exploit the extensive red cedar trees that grew on and near the banks of the <span class="loc">Paterson</span> and Hunter rivers. Felled trees were floated down-river to timber mills in <span class="loc">Newcastle</span>.</p><br><br>
