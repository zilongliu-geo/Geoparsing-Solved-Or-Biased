  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Croydon</span> is a village and civil parish in <span class="loc">South Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is 10 miles (16 km) south-west of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> and immediately west of the A1198 road (the Roman <span class="loc">Ermine</span> Street). The population in <span class="date">2001</span> was 221 people. The site of the deserted medieval village of <span class="loc">Clopton</span> is in <span class="loc">Croydon parish</span>, which was formerly known as Croydon-cum-Clopton. The village's name was spelled Crauudene in the <span class="date">1086</span> Domesday book - it is derived from the Old English crawe and denu, meaning 'valley of the crows'. The parish is <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Croydon</span>, but it used to be called 'Croydon-with-Clopton' or 'Croydon-cum-Clopton' - In <span class="date">1086</span>, about 28 peasants lived at <span class="loc">Croydon</span>. The separate vills of <span class="loc">Croydon</span> and <span class="loc">Clopton</span> were joined in <span class="date">1561</span> and <span class="loc">Croydon</span>'s population may have increased to around 140 people early in the 17th century, but fell to 90 during the reign of <span class="per">Charles II</span>. Open fields surrounding <span class="loc">Croydon</span> village were inclosed for pasture around <span class="date">1640</span>, but from the late 18th century arable farming recommenced. Current-day <span class="loc">Croydon</span> grew up along a street which runs east-west along the ridge to the north of the parish. Some timber-framed houses dating from the late 17th or early 18th <span class="date">centuries</span> still stand, though most of the cottages date from the early 19th century. The main route through the parish followed a terrace along the steep hillside towards <span class="loc">Tadlow</span>. The track, called 'Royston road', was improved and incorporated into the Cambridge-Biggleswade turnpike, later became the A603 and it has <span class="date">now</span> been downgraded to the B1042. <span class="loc">Croydon</span> Old Lane, in the north, went towards <span class="loc">Hatley</span>, while the current road up <span class="loc">Croydon Hill</span> to <span class="loc">Hatley</span> was first built in <span class="date">1830</span>.</p><br><br>
