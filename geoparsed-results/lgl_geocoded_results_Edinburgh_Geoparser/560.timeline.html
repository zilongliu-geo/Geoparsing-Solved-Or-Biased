  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>French filmmaker slammed for likening illegals to WWII Jews. <span class="loc">France</span>'s immigration minister criticized a film director on <span class="date">Monday</span> for likening the situation of illegal immigrants in <span class="loc">France</span> <span class="date">today</span> to that of Jews under the Nazi occupation during World War Two. Director <span class="per">Philippe Lioret</span> - whose film "Welcome" about illegal immigrants trying to reach <span class="loc">Britain</span> from northern <span class="loc">France</span> opens on <span class="date">Wednesday</span> - has criticized a French law that makes it a crime to help illegal immigrants. "To see that a decent guy can all of a sudden be charged and that he can go to prison is crazy. It feels like it's <span class="date">1943</span> and we've hidden a Jew in the basement," <span class="per">Lioret</span> told the regional newspaper <span class="per">La Voix du Nord</span> <span class="date">last week</span>. Some 76,000 Jews were arrested in <span class="loc">France</span> during World War Two and taken to concentration camps such as <span class="loc">Auschwitz</span>, where most died. Those found to be hiding Jews faced a similar fate. Immigration Minister <span class="per">Eric Besson</span> told <span class="loc">Europe</span> 1 radio that comparing the plight of Afghans in the northern town of <span class="loc">Calais</span> to that of Jews during the occupation was "intolerable", and that <span class="per">Lioret</span> had "crossed the red line". "I have the impression that the film's promoters are committing a deliberate slur, no doubt with the intention of increasing publicity for the film's release," he said. French President <span class="per">Nicolas Sarkozy</span> has promoted a controversial tough immigration policy, which is widely believed to have won him the support of many far-right National Front voters in the <span class="date">2007</span> presidential election. <span class="per">Sarkozy</span>'s policies include setting targets for police on the number of illegal immigrants they must expel each year. "Welcome" tells the story of a middle-aged lifeguard at a Calais swimming pool who, while trying to win back his wife's affections, meets a young Kurd and helps him swim across the Channel to <span class="loc">Britain</span>, where the young man's girlfriend lives. <span class="per">Vincent Lindon</span>, who plays the lifeguard, has also spoken out about immigration policy in the run-up to the film's release, denouncing the often squalid conditions in which immigrants live while attempting to find a way into <span class="loc">Britain</span>. "I believe we must respect human beings. The people in <span class="loc">Calais</span> are often treated worse than dogs. And I don't like that," <span class="per">Lindon</span> told the newspaper <span class="org">Le Parisien</span> in an interview published on <span class="date">Saturday</span>. "I do not understand that there is an article of the (law) that says: 'Any person who helps a person in an illegal situation is punishable by <span class="date">up to five years</span> in prison'."</p><br><br>
