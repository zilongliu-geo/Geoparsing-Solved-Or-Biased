  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Killer asks <span class="loc">Ohio</span> court to delay execution . A convicted killer scheduled to die <span class="date">next month</span> has asked the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> to delay his execution, alleging that a jailhouse informant committed perjury. <span class="per">Brett Hartmann</span> said a motion filed <span class="date">Friday</span> that he needs time to gather evidence of the alleged perjury and test other evidence he says will prove his innocence. The motion also asks the court to delay the execution to allow <span class="per">Hartmann</span> time to demonstrate that <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s method of lethal injection is unconstitutional. He has said that it would deny him a quick and painless death as required by state law. The state <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> <span class="date">this month</span> denied an earlier request by <span class="per">Hartmann</span> to delay his execution so he could challenge the state's execution method. <span class="per">Hartmann</span> had asked for that stay to allow time for him to join a lawsuit pending in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> that makes a similar challenge. <span class="per">Hartmann</span> is scheduled to die <span class="date">April 7</span> for the fatal stabbing and mutilation of 46-year-old <span class="loc">Wanda Snipes</span> in <span class="loc">Akron</span> on <span class="date">Sept. 9, 1997</span>. Documents and legal filings in the case refer to the inmate as <span class="loc">Hartman</span>, but he has said his name is <span class="per">Hartmann</span>. The filing <span class="date">Friday</span> said the state has repeatedly referred to the informant's testimony as critical evidence of <span class="per">Hartmann</span>'s guilt. The new evidence severely undermines the informant's credibility and casts doubt on the validity of the conviction, <span class="per">Hartmann</span>'s motion said. His motion also referred to testimony presented <span class="date">March 23</span> in a federal trial in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> that is part of another condemned inmate's challenge to the lethal injection process. The judge in the federal case is taking testimony from <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s execution team to determine whether condemned killer <span class="per">Kenneth Biros</span> can prove he has a chance of making a successful argument against injection in a longer and more detailed trial. <span class="per">Hartmann</span>'s motion said testimony given in the federal court case provided evidence to demonstrate that <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s execution method carries "substantial risk of harm, i.e. excruciating pain during the execution." It would be "particularly unfair and inhumane" to execute <span class="per">Hartmann</span> within <span class="date">days</span> of the first time that testimony became available to him and to the public, <span class="per">Hartmann</span>'s motion said. <span class="per">Hartmann</span> has said he must be given the same opportunity as other death row inmates to challenge the constitutionality of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s execution method.</p><br><br>
