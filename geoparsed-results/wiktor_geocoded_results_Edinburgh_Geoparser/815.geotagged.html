<p>Lara is a residential Town, 18 km north-east of <span class="loc">Geelong</span>, inland from the Princes Freeway to <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. The explorers Hume and Hovell arrived at Lara on December 16, 1824, believing that they had reached <span class="loc">Westernport</span> Bay. They recorded that the Aboriginals described the bay as Jullong and land as Corago, suggesting origins for the names of <span class="loc">Geelong</span> and <span class="loc">Corio</span>. The area was originally named Kennedy's Creek but was also given several different names including <span class="loc">Duck Ponds</span>, Hovell's Creek, Cheddar, <span class="loc">Swindon</span> and <span class="loc">Lara Lake</span>. The area of Lara was no more than a few farms at this time. The railway though the town was opened in 1857 along with the local railway station, with several subdivisions then announced. A Post Office opened on 1 March 1858 as <span class="loc">Duck Ponds</span>, renamed Hovell's Creek in 1872, and finally Lara in 1884. The population grew to a few hundred by 1890, and several facilities like schools and churches were built, but a municipal water supply was not completed until 1947. In January 1969, 17 people were killed in bushfires which ravaged Lara. Most of the victims were trapped by the fast-moving grass fire while travelling on the Princes Highway.</p>
