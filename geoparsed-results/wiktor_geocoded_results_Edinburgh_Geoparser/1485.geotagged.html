<p><span class="loc">Santa Monica</span> is a beachfront city in western <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city is named after the Christian saint, Monica. Situated on <span class="loc">Santa Monica Bay</span>, it is bordered on three sides by the city of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> – <span class="loc">Pacific Palisades</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Brentwood</span> on the northeast, <span class="loc">Sawtelle</span> on the east, Mar Vista on the southeast, and <span class="loc">Venice</span> on the south. <span class="loc">Santa Monica</span> is well known for its affluent single-family neighborhoods but also has many neighborhoods consisting primarily of condominiums and apartments. Over two-thirds of <span class="loc">Santa Monica</span>'s residents are renters. The Census Bureau population for <span class="loc">Santa Monica</span> in 2010 was 89,736. Partly because of its agreeable climate, <span class="loc">Santa Monica</span> had become a famed resort town by the early 20th century. The city has experienced a boom since the late 1980s through the revitalization of its downtown core, significant job growth and increased tourism. The Santa Monica Pier remains a popular and iconic destination. <span class="loc">Santa Monica</span> was long inhabited by the Tongva people. <span class="loc">Santa Monica</span> was called Kecheek in the Tongva language. The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portolà, who camped near the present day intersection of <span class="loc">Barrington</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Avenues</span> on August 3, 1769. There are two different versions of the naming of the city. One says that it was named in honor of the feast day of <span class="loc">Saint Monica</span> (mother of <span class="loc">Saint Augustine</span>), but her feast day is actually May 4. Another version says that it was named by Juan Crespí on account of a pair of springs, the <span class="loc">Kuruvungna</span> Springs (<span class="loc">Serra</span> Springs), that were reminiscent of the tears that <span class="loc">Saint Monica</span> shed over her son's early impiety.</p>
