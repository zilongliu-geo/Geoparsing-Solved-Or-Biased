  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kent</span> /ˈkɛnt/ is a county in <span class="loc">South East England</span> and one of the home counties. It borders <span class="loc">Greater London</span> to the north west, <span class="loc">Surrey</span> to the west, <span class="loc">East Sussex</span> to the south west, and across the <span class="loc">Thames Estuary</span> is the <span class="loc">county of Essex</span>. The county town is <span class="loc">Maidstone</span>. <span class="loc">Canterbury Cathedral</span> in <span class="loc">Kent</span> has been the seat of the <span class="per">Archbishop of Canterbury</span>, leader of the <span class="org">Church of England</span>, since the conversion of <span class="loc">England</span> to Christianity by <span class="loc">Saint Augustine</span> in the 6th century. Between <span class="loc">London</span> and the <span class="loc">Strait of Dover</span>, which separates it from mainland <span class="loc">Europe</span>, <span class="loc">Kent</span> has seen both diplomacy and conflict, ranging from the <span class="loc">Leeds</span> Castle peace talks of <span class="date">1978</span> and <span class="date">2004</span> to the Battle of <span class="loc">Britain</span> in World War II. <span class="loc">England</span> relied on the county's ports to provide warships through much of its history; the Cinque Ports in the 12th–14th <span class="date">centuries</span> and Chatham Dockyard in the 16th–20th <span class="date">centuries</span> were of particular importance. <span class="loc">France</span> can be seen clearly in fine weather from <span class="loc">Folkestone</span> and the <span class="loc">White Cliffs</span> of <span class="loc">Dover</span>. Hills in the form of the <span class="loc">North Downs</span> and the <span class="loc">Greensand Ridge</span> span the length of the county and in the series of valleys in between and to the south are most of the county's 26 castles.</p><br><br>
