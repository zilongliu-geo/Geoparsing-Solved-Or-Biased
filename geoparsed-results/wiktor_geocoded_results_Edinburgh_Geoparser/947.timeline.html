  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Livingston Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 487 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Baton Rouge</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is located at 30°25′45″N 90°32′53″W (30.429173, -90.548065). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.4 square miles (3.6 km²), all of it land. The town's name comes from the numerous artesian springs in the area. The ZIP Code of <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is 70462. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> began in the 18th century at one of the northernmost points considered to be navigable on the <span class="loc">Natalbany River</span>. Between <span class="loc">Springfield</span> and <span class="loc">Lake Maurepas</span>, <span class="loc">Ponchatoula Creek</span> joins the <span class="loc">Natalbany</span> and increases its flow. The town was also connected to the Natchez Trace. Via the <span class="loc">Natalbany</span>, <span class="loc">Lake Maurepas</span>, <span class="loc">Lake Pontchartrain</span>, and <span class="loc">Bayou Saint John</span>, <span class="loc">Springfield</span> had access to <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> by water. Similarly, at the time (prior to the damming of the channel by levees) along the <span class="loc">Amite River</span> and <span class="loc">Mississippi River</span>, <span class="loc">Bayou Manchac</span> provided shallow-water access between <span class="loc">Springfield</span> and <span class="loc">Baton Rouge</span>. By <span class="date">1810</span> <span class="loc">Springfield</span> was one of the areas of interest in the rebellion against <span class="loc">Spain</span>, which produced the short-lived <span class="org">Republic of West</span> <span class="loc">Florida</span>. Bricks from an old Spanish fort can still be found, roughly 200 yards in front of <span class="date">today</span>'s post office. At this time the area was part of <span class="per">St. Helena</span> Parish, with <span class="loc">Livingston Parish</span> created in <span class="date">1832</span> from the southern portion of <span class="loc">St. Helena</span>.</p><br><br>
