  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Luni</span> is an abandoned town and the name of a frazione of the comune (municipality) of <span class="loc">Ortonovo</span>, province of <span class="loc">La Spezia</span>, in the easternmost end of the <span class="loc">Liguria region</span> of northern <span class="loc">Italy</span>. It gives its name to Lunigiana, a region spanning eastern <span class="loc">Liguria</span> and <span class="loc">northern Tuscany (province</span> of Massa-Carrara). Points of interest include remains of the elliptical Roman amphitheatre (<span class="date">1st century AD</span>) and the Archaeological Museum. Located in a plain near the <span class="loc">Tyrrhenian Sea</span> and close to the borders with <span class="loc">Tuscany</span>, <span class="loc">Luni</span> is crossed by the river <span class="loc">Magra</span> and lies between <span class="loc">Sarzana</span> (7 km in north) and <span class="loc">Carrara</span> (5 km in south). It is 4 km far from <span class="loc">Ortonovo</span>, 15 from <span class="loc">Massa</span> and 30 from <span class="loc">La Spezia</span>. The village is served by the National Highway 1 "Aurelia", crossed at <span class="loc">Luni</span> Mare by the A12 motorway and counts a railway station on the Pisa-Genoa line. In the 5th century, it was still notable, as it was chosen as episcopal see. Captured by the Goths in <span class="date">the following century</span>, it was reconquered by the Byzantines in 552, who however lost it to the <span class="loc">Lombards</span> in 642. The latter damaged the city's economy, favouring the trades routes that passed through the nearby port of <span class="loc">Lucca</span> to the south. <span class="loc">Luni</span> had been reduced to a small village at the time of the Lombard king Liutprand, later, it was a countship see under <span class="loc">Charlemagne</span>, exactly on the border between the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Italy</span> and the Papal States.</p><br><br>
