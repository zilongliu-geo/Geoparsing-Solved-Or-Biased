<p><span class="loc">Pakistan</span> to restore chief justice ousted by Musharraf. <span class="loc">ISLAMABAD</span>, <span class="loc">Pakistan</span> â€” <span class="loc">Pakistan</span> agreed Monday to reinstate a fired chief justice, a move that will help defuse a political crisis that has sparked street battles and raised fears of instability in the country at a time of surging Islamist violence. Opposition leaders and lawyers had vowed to sit-in at the parliament later Monday until Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, known for his independence and willingness to challenge authority, was reinstated. The capital has been barricaded and scores of extra police brought in amid fears of violence. In a dawn address to the nation that capped a night of high drama, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani announced Chaudhry would be sworn in on March 21, the day the current chief justice was due to retire. The speech triggered scenes of jubilation outside Chaudhry's home in the capital, <span class="loc">Islamabad</span>. Gilani also ordered all lawyers and political activists arrested over the past week to be freed immediately. The concession came as thousands of protesters led by Nawaz Sharif, the head of the largest opposition party and a longtime foe of President Asif Ali Zardari, were traveling to <span class="loc">Islamabad</span> to join the planned sit-in. Sharif joined the convoy after ignoring a house arrest order in his hometown of <span class="loc">Lahore</span> in <span class="loc">Punjab</span>, where his supporters fought running battles with police. "This is a victory for the people of this country," said <span class="loc">Baz</span> Mohammad Kakar, a leader of the lawyers' movement. "Chaudhry is the first chief justice in the history of <span class="loc">Pakistan</span> who has proved himself to be a judge for the people, as a chief justice for the people." Former President Pervez Musharraf fired Chaudhry, 60, in 2007 after he took up cases challenging the leader's rule, sparking a wave of protests that helped force Musharraf from power in 2008. Musharraf's successor, Zardari, pledged to reinstate Chaudhry within 30 days of taking office, but reneged on the promise, apparently fearing the justice might examine a deal that he and his wife, slain politician Benazir Bhutto, struck with Musharraf to grant the pair immunity from prosecution over alleged corruption cases. Lawyers and civil rights activists have remained committed to the cause of Chaudhry's reinstatement, believing it was a vital first step in getting an independent judiciary in <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>.</p>
