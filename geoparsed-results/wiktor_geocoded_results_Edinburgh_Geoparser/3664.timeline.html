  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Qatar</span> (/ˈkæˌtɑːr/, /ˈkɑːtɑːr/, /ˈkɑːtər/ or /kəˈtɑːr/; Arabic: قطر‎ Qaṭar [ˈqɑtˤɑr]; local vernacular pronunciation: [ɡɪtˤɑr]), officially the <span class="loc">State of Qatar</span> (Arabic: دولة قطر‎ Dawlat Qaṭar), is a sovereign country located in Southwest <span class="loc">Asia</span>, occupying the small <span class="loc">Qatar Peninsula</span> on the northeastern coast of the <span class="loc">Arabian Peninsula</span>. Its sole land border is with <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span> to the south, with the rest of its territory surrounded by the <span class="loc">Persian Gulf</span>. A strait in the <span class="loc">Persian Gulf</span> separates <span class="loc">Qatar</span> from the nearby island of <span class="loc">Bahrain</span>, as well as sharing sea borders with the <span class="loc">United Arab Emirates</span> and <span class="loc">Iran</span>. Following Ottoman rule, <span class="loc">Qatar</span> became a British protectorate in the early 20th century until gaining independence in <span class="date">1971</span>. <span class="loc">Qatar</span> has been ruled by the <span class="org">House of Thani</span> since the early 19th century. Sheikh Jassim bin <span class="per">Mohammed Al Thani</span> was the founder of the <span class="loc">State of Qatar</span>. <span class="loc">Qatar</span> is a hereditary constitutional monarchy and its head of state is <span class="per">Emir Sheikh Tamim</span> bin <span class="loc">Hamad</span> <span class="loc">Al</span> <span class="per">Thani</span>. The constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a constitutional referendum, with almost 98% in favour. In <span class="date">2013</span>, <span class="loc">Qatar</span>'s total population was 1.8 million: 278,000 Qatari citizens and 1.5 million expatriates. After <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span> and <span class="loc">Oman</span>, <span class="loc">Qatar</span> is the most conservative society in the Gulf Cooperation Council.</p><br><br>
