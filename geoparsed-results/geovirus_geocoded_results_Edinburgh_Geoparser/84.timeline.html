  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Health officials have said that at least nine people were killed and over sixty remain in critical condition on <span class="date">Saturday</span> after an outbreak of cholera in a slum in <span class="loc">Kenya</span>'s capital <span class="loc">Nairobi</span>. A mission hospital in the Mukuru kwa <span class="loc">Njenga district</span> of <span class="loc">Nairobi</span> said that the first cases had been reported on <span class="date">Monday</span>, but had increased substantially by <span class="date">Friday</span>. "We have so far recorded nine deaths from the Mukuru slums in <span class="loc">Nairobi</span> and some of them might have also died at home and so we believe this number is very conservative because it is not accounting for home deaths," said a physician at the <span class="org">Kenyatta National Hospital</span>. The outbreak has been blamed on poor sanitation and low levels of hygiene. Community health worker <span class="per">Peninah Nzuki</span> told the Daily Nation news agency that â€œthe water is dirty and the levels of hygiene are poor, thus the disease is spreading fast." Officials, however, have warned that the true death toll may be higher than indicated, as some people might have died before reaching hospitals.</p><br><br>
