<p><span class="loc">Charleston</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Coles County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and is also the county seat. The population was 21,838, as of the 2010 census. The city is home to Eastern Illinois University and has close ties with its neighbor, <span class="loc">Mattoon</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. Both are principal cities of the Charleston–Mattoon Micropolitan Statistical Area. Native Americans lived in the <span class="loc">Charleston</span> area for thousands of years before Europeans arrived. With the great tallgrass prairie to the west, beech-maple forests to the east, and the <span class="loc">Embarras River</span> and <span class="loc">Wabash Rivers</span> between, the <span class="loc">Charleston</span> area provided semi-nomadic Native Americans access to a variety of resources. Indians may have deliberately set the "wildfires" which maintained the local mosaic of prairie and oak–hickory forest. Streams with names like <span class="loc">Indian Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Kickapoo Creek</span> mark the sites of former Native settlements. One village is said to have been located south of Fox Ridge State Park near a deposit of flint. The early history of European settlement in the area was marked by uneasy co-existence between Native Americans and European settlers. Some settlers lived peacefully with the natives. But in the 1810s and 1820s, after Native Americans allegedly harassed surveying crews, an escalating series of poorly documented skirmishes occurred between Native Americans, settlers, and militias known as the <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Rangers. Two pitched battles (complete with cannon on one side) occurred just south of <span class="loc">Charleston</span> along "the hills of the Embarrass," near the entrance to modern <span class="loc">Lake Charleston</span> park. These conflicts did not slow European settlement. Native American history in <span class="loc">Coles County</span> effectively ended when all natives were expelled by law from <span class="loc">Illinois</span> after the 1832 Black Hawk War. With the grudging exception of Indian wives, the last natives were driven out by the 1840s.</p>
