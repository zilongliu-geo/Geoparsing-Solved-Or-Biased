  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> (/ˈkeɪmbrɪdʒ/ KAYM-brij) is a university city and the county town of <span class="loc">Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, on the <span class="loc">River Cam</span> about 50 miles (80 km) north of <span class="loc">London</span>. At the United Kingdom Census <span class="date">2011</span>, its population was 123,867, including 24,488 students. There is archaeological evidence of settlement in the area in the Bronze Age and in Roman <span class="loc">Britain</span>; under <span class="org">Viking</span> rule, <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> became an important trading centre. The first town charters were granted in the 12th century, although city status was not conferred until <span class="date">1951</span>. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is the home of the <span class="org">University of Cambridge</span>, founded in <span class="date">1209</span> and one of the top five universities in the world. The university includes the Cavendish Laboratory, King's College Chapel, and the <span class="org">Cambridge University Library</span>. The Cambridge skyline is dominated by the last two buildings, along with the spire of the Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church, the chimney of Addenbrooke's Hospital and St John's College Chapel tower. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is at the heart of the high-technology Silicon Fen with industries such as software and bioscience and many start-up companies spun out of the university. Over 40% of the workforce have a higher education qualification, more than twice the national average. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is also home to the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, one of the largest biomedical research clusters in the world, soon to be home to <span class="org">AstraZeneca</span>, a hotel and relocated <span class="org">Papworth Hospital</span>.</p><br><br>
