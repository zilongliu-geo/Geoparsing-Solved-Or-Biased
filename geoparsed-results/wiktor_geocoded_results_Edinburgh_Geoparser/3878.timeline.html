In the Domesday Book, the name is given as Malgun, meaning "settlement by the gravelly places". The parish has a population of approximately 150. including <span class="loc">Malham Moor</span> at the <span class="date">2011</span> Census and increasing to 238. <span class="loc">Malham</span> lies at the upper end of the valley of the <span class="loc">River Aire</span>, known above <span class="loc">Airton</span> as Malhamdale, in the Yorkshire Dales. The surrounding countryside is well known for its limestone pavements and other examples of limestone scenery. Tourist attractions include <span class="loc">Malham Tarn</span>, <span class="loc">Malham Cove</span>, <span class="loc">Gordale Scar</span> and the Dry Valley. The village hosts an annual agricultural and horticultural show on the <span class="date">Saturday</span> before the <span class="org">August Bank Holiday</span>.
