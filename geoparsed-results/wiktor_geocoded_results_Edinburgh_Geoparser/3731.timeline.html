  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Nora</span> is a small, unincorporated town in <span class="loc">Dickenson County</span> in the southern state of Virginia. In the <span class="date">2000</span> <span class="loc">US</span> census, its population is listed as 566. <span class="per">Nora</span> is built along one side of the <span class="loc">McClure River</span>. Coal mining has always been the primary business for the town and county. However, in <span class="date">recent years</span> natural gas production has increased sharply because it has become possible to extract gas from the underlying Huron Shale formation. The Huron Shale deposit in this part of Virginia is called the <span class="per">Nora Field</span>. The site of the town was originally called "<span class="org">Mouth of Open Fork</span>", and in <span class="date">1882</span> it was briefly the county seat of the newly formed <span class="loc">Dickenson County</span>. In <span class="date">1904</span>, a post office was built at <span class="org">Mouth of Open Fork</span>, and the first postmaster, W. <span class="per">A. Dorton</span>, arranged for the town and post office to be named for his wife <span class="per">Nora</span>. The Clinchfield Railroad, which was built to haul coal from the area, passes through <span class="per">Nora</span>. Construction of the railroad was completed in <span class="date">1915</span>, when the last track was laid near <span class="per">Nora</span>.</p><br><br>
