<p><span class="loc">La Plata</span> /ləˈpleɪtə/ is a town in <span class="loc">Charles County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,753 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Charles County</span>. According to one of several legends, the town was given its name by Colonel Samuel Chapman, whose family owned 6,000 acres (24 km2) of land in Southern <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, including what would become the areas of <span class="loc">La Plata</span> and <span class="loc">Port Tobacco</span>. The Colonel traveled to Central and <span class="loc">South America</span> with his son George, who had contracted tuberculosis, in search of a cure. In his travels, the Colonel was impressed with the La <span class="loc">Plata River</span> in <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, so he decided to name a portion of his property "<span class="loc">La Plata</span>" after the river. The town was founded in 1888, after the river flowing into the previous county seat, <span class="loc">Port Tobacco</span> (a few miles to the west), silted up, ending that town's utility as a port. At the same time, a new railroad line made <span class="loc">La Plata</span> attractive as a new county seat location. The courthouse was built there after the <span class="loc">Port Tobacco</span> courthouse burned down (arson suspected, but unproven). Christ Episcopal Church was dismantled stone by stone and rebuilt in <span class="loc">La Plata</span>. In 1940, the opening of the then "Potomac <span class="loc">River Bridge</span>" (later renamed the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge), which carries <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 301 over the <span class="loc">Potomac River</span>, provided a link to Virginia and brought many long-distance east coast thru-travelers through the town as an alternative to using urban <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 1 and, later, the often-congested Interstate 95.</p>
