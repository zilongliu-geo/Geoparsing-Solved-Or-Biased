<p><span class="loc">Brighton</span> is a beach-side suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 11 km south-east of Melbourne's central business district. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Bayside</span>. At the 2011 Census, <span class="loc">Brighton</span> had a population of 21,257. <span class="loc">Brighton</span> is named after <span class="loc">Brighton</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. In <span class="loc">England</span>, on 29 August 1840, Henry Dendy (1800–81) purchased 5,120 acres (2,070 ha) of <span class="loc">Port Phillip</span> land at £1 per acre, site unseen, under the terms of the short-lived Special Survey regulations. Dendy arrived on 5 February 1841 to claim his land. The area was known as Dendy's Special Survey. The area Dendy was compelled to take, called "Waterville", was bound by the coastline to the west and the present day North Road, East Boundary Road and South Road. A town was surveyed in mid-1841, defined by the crescent-shaped street layout which remains today, and subdivided allotments were offered for sale. The area soon became the "<span class="loc">Brighton</span> Estate", and Dendy's site for his own home was named "<span class="loc">Brighton</span> Park". Unfortunately, the land did not have any ready sources of water. Sales were slow at first, and the financial depression came and Dendy's scheme for emigration and land sales failed. The family of his agent Jonathan Binns Were (1809–85) who had arrived in Melbourne in 1839, bought the land. All of Dendy's business ventures failed, and he died a pauper.</p>
