  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Warren is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Bradley County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 6,003. When settlers from the east began to arrive in south <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, the land was inhabited by the indigenous tribe known as the <span class="loc">Quapaw</span>. The earliest cession of territory was made in <span class="date">1818</span>, with a later boundary against the neighboring Choctaw tribe in <span class="date">1820</span>, opening up the southeastern corner of the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Territory for settlement. Although the area had been settled by European-Americans for <span class="date">about thirty years</span>, the city itself was not incorporated until <span class="date">1851</span>. Tradition says the city is named after a former slave, freed by Captain <span class="per">Hugh Bradley</span>, the namesake of the county and leader of the main early settlement party which established the city. The original plat was laid out on land donated by <span class="per">Isaac Pennington</span>, a key member of <span class="org">Bradley</span>'s company. Around the turn of the twentieth century, Warren found itself in the middle of a boom in the timber industry, a resource which continues to be important to the city's economy, although the lumber yards that were vital to Warren throughout <span class="date">the past century</span> are no longer in operation.</p><br><br>
