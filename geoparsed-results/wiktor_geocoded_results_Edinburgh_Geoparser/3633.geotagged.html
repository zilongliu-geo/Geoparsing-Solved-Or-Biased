<p><span class="loc">Lensk</span> (Russian: Ленск; IPA: [lʲɛnsk]; <span class="loc">Yakut</span>: Лиэнскэй, Lienskey) is a town and the administrative center of <span class="loc">Lensky District</span> of the <span class="loc">Sakha Republic</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the left bank of the <span class="loc">Lena River</span>, approximately 840 kilometers (520 mi) west of <span class="loc">Yakutsk</span>, the capital of the republic. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 24,966. The original settlement was founded as <span class="loc">Mukhtuya</span> (Мухтуя) in 1663 by Russian fur traders, on the site of an older Evenk settlement known as Mukhtuy. The name of the original settlement was derived from an Evenk term meaning "great water". During the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a place of political exile. It experienced a period of rapid growth during the 20th century as a result of the discovery and development of diamond deposits in the <span class="loc">Vilyuy</span> River basin. As the closest significant settlement to the major kimberlite excavations at the Mir Mine and the establishment of the associated town of <span class="loc">Mirny</span>, <span class="loc">Mukhtuya</span> became a major base of construction. In 1956, roads were built connecting <span class="loc">Mukhtuya</span> to the future <span class="loc">Mirny</span> and the port was established. On July 13, 1963, <span class="loc">Mukhtuya</span> was granted town status and was given its present name, after the river on which it stands.</p>
