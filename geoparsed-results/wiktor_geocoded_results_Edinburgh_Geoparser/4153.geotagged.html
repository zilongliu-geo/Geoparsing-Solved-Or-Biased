<p>Burke is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Fairfax County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2000 census, Burke had a total population of 57,737. Before 2010, the CDP was divided, with a portion of it becoming Burke Centre CDP; the population remaining in the Burke CDP was reported at 41,055 in the 2010 census. The area of <span class="loc">Fairfax County</span> known as Burke is named for Silas Burke (1796â€“1854), a 19th-century farmer, merchant, and local politician who built a house on a hill overlooking the valley of <span class="loc">Pohick Creek</span> in approximately 1824. The house is still standing. When the Orange and Alexandria Railroad was constructed in the late 1840s, the railroad station at the base of that hill was named Burke's Station after Burke, who owned the land in the area and donated a right-of-way to the railroad company. The community that grew up around the railroad station acquired a post office branch in 1852. Currently, railroad tracks on the same historical line are owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway and form part of the Manassas line of the <span class="loc">Virginia</span> Railway Express commuter rail system, of which two stations lie in the Burke area.</p>
