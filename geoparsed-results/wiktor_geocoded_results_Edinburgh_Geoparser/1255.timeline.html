  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Pilar is a first class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Sorsogon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span> located at the south of <span class="loc">Luzon</span> island. It is part of the <span class="loc">Bicol Region</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 68,245 people. Pilar is subdivided into 49 barangays. In <span class="date">1957</span> the sitios of <span class="per">Naspi</span> and <span class="per">Calaguitan</span> were separated from the barrio of <span class="loc">Putiao</span> and converted into the barrio of <span class="per">Naspi</span>. Though whale sharks are more associated with the town of <span class="loc">Donsol</span>, whale sharks can also be seen in <span class="loc">Pilar Bay</span> near <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>. Interaction with the whale sharks is regulated by the local department office. With the help of <span class="org">WWF</span>, strict guidelines were developed to protect the sharks. These include limiting the number of swimmers per boat, no scuba divers and staying further than three meters away from the sharks. In practise this rule is almost never applied. As many as 14 boats at a time may 'mob' a shark, with up to 30 or 40 swimmers following the shark on the surface. In <span class="date">recent years</span> the number of male sharks have out-numbered female sharks by 20:1. The females that are seen are generally large mature adults in the 7m ~ 9m range. Increasing numbers of sharks show propellor marks on their backs. Anecdotal evidence from local fishermen suggests that prop strikes are from fishing boats in the off-season, rather than from tourist boats in the main Januaryâ€“May tourist season.</p><br><br>
