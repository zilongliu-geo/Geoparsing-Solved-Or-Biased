<p><span class="loc">San Ignacio</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Elena</span> are towns in western <span class="loc">Belize</span>. <span class="loc">San Ignacio</span> serves as the cultural-economic hub of <span class="loc">Cayo District</span>. It got its start from Mahogany and chicle production during British colonialism. Over time it attracted people from the surrounding areas, which led to the diverse population of the town today. <span class="loc">San Ignacio</span> is the largest settlement in <span class="loc">Cayo District</span> and the second largest in the country, after <span class="loc">Belize City</span>. The town was originally named <span class="loc">El Cayo</span> by the Spanish. On October 19, 1904, <span class="loc">El Cayo</span> was officially declared a town by the government of <span class="loc">British Honduras</span>. In the past a creek ran between the <span class="loc">Macal</span> and the <span class="loc">Mopan</span> rivers one mile outside of <span class="loc">San Ignacio</span> going toward <span class="loc">Benque Viejo</span>. This creek then fulfilled the definition of an area of land completely surrounded by water and thus the name <span class="loc">Cayo</span>, "island". There was a large wooden bridge across this creek in the late 1940s, but since the creek eventually dried up, the area was filled with limestone gravel and today there remains no evidence of its existence. The demise of the creek, however, took away the distinction for the classification of a 'cayo' from the venerable western town of '<span class="loc">El Cayo</span>' and returned it to a regular land mass.</p>
