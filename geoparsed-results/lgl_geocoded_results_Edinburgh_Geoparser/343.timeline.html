  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Man cited for driving drunk after crashing motorized barstool. <span class="loc">NEWARK</span> &#x97; It was classified as “all others” under vehicle type in the <span class="loc">Newark</span> police crash report, but that category doesn’t do a motorized barstool justice. Its 28-year-old creator and operator was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated after he rolled over the Frankenstein-esque lawnmower-barstool hybrid, according to a police report and court records. On <span class="date">March 4</span>, Officer Michael Trotter, one of the two members of the traffic unit, responded to the 500 block of <span class="per">Kelley Lane</span> in reference to assisting Newark Fire with a man who had suffered injuries from a crash. Subsequent investigation revealed that the man had been operating the motorized barstool on <span class="per">Kelley Lane</span> when he crashed it while trying to make a turn, the report states. The man claimed the barstool could reach speeds of 38 mph on its five-horsepower engine but that he was traveling at about 20 mph when he crashed it at 5:40 p.m., according to Trotter’s report. He allegedly admitted to drinking about 15 beers during an interview with Trotter at the hospital, where he was transported after the crash. He was issued a citation for operating a vehicle while intoxicated and driving under suspension, according to court documents. The driver was arraigned <span class="date">last week</span> and pleaded not guilty. He has demanded a jury trial. <span class="loc">Newark</span> police says operating any type of machinery after consuming alcohol often has devastating consequences.
