<p><span class="loc">Warburton</span> is a village and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Trafford</span> in <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically in <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>, <span class="loc">Warburton</span> lies on the south bank of the <span class="loc">River Mersey</span> between the <span class="loc">borough of Warrington</span> and <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>. In the 21st century, the village remains predominantly rural. <span class="loc">Altrincham</span> is the nearest town. According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 286. <span class="loc">Warburton</span> has a history of settlement stretching back to the 11th century, with the possibility of earlier habitation. There are 17 listed buildings in the village, including the timber framed Grade I Church of St Werburgh, which is at least 700 years old. Among the other listed buildings are examples of architect John Douglas' work, including the second Church of St Werburgh, built in 1883. In 2006, Time Team excavated in the lands of Moss <span class="loc">Brow Farm</span> in <span class="loc">Warburton</span>, looking for a Roman fortlet. Some limited evidence has been found of activity on the site of <span class="loc">Warburton</span> dating from the Bronze Age, through the Iron Age and Roman periods; these include a flint blade, six Mesolithic tools, pieces of quernstone, and a snake bracelet. Archaeological evidence indicates that the area around <span class="loc">Warburton</span> has been used agriculturally since at least the Roman times. In the Domesday Book, the name was Warburgtune which name has evolved to today's '<span class="loc">Warburton</span>'. The suffix –ton means a settlement or farmstead in Old English, indicating that the settlement has pre-Conquest origins. It has been suggested that <span class="loc">Warburton</span> was the site of an Anglo-Saxon burgh or defended settlement, possibly either called "Toppingburgh" orWeard byrig, established by Aethelflaed, Queen of the Mercians, in 915 during the wars with the Vikings. However, it now seems likely that site lay on the Wales–Cheshire border.</p>
