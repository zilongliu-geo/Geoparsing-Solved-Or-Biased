<p><span class="loc">San Agustin</span> (formerly Guintigui-an and <span class="loc">Badajoz</span>) is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Romblon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. <span class="loc">San Agustin</span> was known during Spanish times as Guintigui-an because of the abundance of a fish called "tigue" in the area. Negrito and Mangyan tribes from <span class="loc">Panay</span> and <span class="loc">Mindoro</span> were the first inhabitants, as well as migrants from island of <span class="loc">Romblon</span>, and southern <span class="loc">Tablas</span>. In the early part of Spanish conquest, the first settlement was at barangay <span class="loc">Cabolutan</span>. The early settlers found it very trying at times to cross the channel to Romblon town to attend to civil and religious duties. To solve this problem, <span class="loc">Cabolutan</span> leaders discussed the matter such as building a visita in their settlement of around 250 souls. Finally in 1635, the first church building made of coral stone and lime was started. In 1700, Spanish authorities decided to separate <span class="loc">Cabolutan</span> in <span class="loc">Tablas Island</span> from <span class="loc">Romblon</span>, with its seat at visita <span class="loc">Cabolutan</span> subjugating all settlements west of <span class="loc">Tablas Island</span>. The new pueblo or town of <span class="loc">Cabolutan</span> progressed slowly and grew more populous despite frequent Moro kidnapping raids. However, in 1790, a smallpox epidemic almost wiped out the town's entire population. The heavy casualty toll caused the puebloâ€™s abolition which led to re- incorporation to <span class="loc">Romblon</span> until 1855, when another pueblo named Guintigui-an was founded some 4 kilometers south of the old town site. The town was founded by Don Laureano Montesa together with his brother Don Esteban and cousin Don Luis Montesa, who became Tiniente Absoluto in <span class="loc">Romblon</span>. Its jurisdiction included what is now the towns of <span class="loc">Calatrava</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span>. The construction of the <span class="loc">Cotta</span> (fort) at Payong-Payong hill (located in present-day barangay Cagbo-aya), started in 1873. <span class="loc">Cotta</span> protected the community from Muslim pirates and still stands today. In 1868, the town was renamed "Badajoz" by Andres Lebarde, a visiting Spanish soldier, after his native <span class="loc">city of Badajoz</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>.</p>
