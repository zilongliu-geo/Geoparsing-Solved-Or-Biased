  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Cartagena</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [kartaˈxena]; Arabic: Al-Qartājanna قرطاجنة‎, Latin: Carthago Nova) is a Spanish city and a major naval station located in the Region of <span class="loc">Murcia</span>, by the Mediterranean coast, south-eastern <span class="loc">Spain</span>. As of <span class="date">January 2011</span>, it has a population of 218,210 inhabitants being the Region’s second largest municipality and the country’s 6th non-Province capital city. The metropolitan area of <span class="per">Cartagena</span>, known as <span class="per">Campo de Cartagena</span>, has a population of 409,586 inhabitants. <span class="per">Cartagena</span> has been inhabited for over two millennia, being founded around <span class="date">227 BC</span> by the Carthaginian Hasdrubal the Fair as Qart Hadasht, the same name as the original <span class="loc">city of Carthage</span>. The city had its heyday during the Roman Empire, when it was known as Carthago Nova (the <span class="loc">New Carthage</span>) and Carthago Spartaria, capital of the <span class="loc">province of Carthaginensis</span>. It was one of the important cities during the Umayyad invasion of <span class="loc">Hispania</span>, under its Arabic name of <span class="per">Qartayannat al-Halfa</span>. Much of the historical weight of <span class="per">Cartagena</span> in <span class="date">the past</span> goes to its coveted defensive port, one of the most important in the western Mediterranean. <span class="per">Cartagena</span> has been the capital of the Spanish <span class="org">Navy's Maritime Department</span> of the Mediterranean since the arrival of the Spanish Bourbons in the 18th century. As far back as the 16th century it was one of the most important naval ports in <span class="loc">Spain</span>, together with <span class="loc">Ferrol</span> in the North. It is still an important naval seaport, the main military haven of <span class="loc">Spain</span>, and is home to a large naval shipyard.</p><br><br>
