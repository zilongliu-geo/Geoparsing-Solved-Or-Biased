  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Monroe County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 9,811 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Monroe County</span>. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is located at 38°20′7″N 90°9′10″W (38.335243, -90.152685). According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> has a total area of 7.66 square miles (19.84 km2), of which 7.52 square miles (19.48 km2) (or 98.17%) is land and 0.14 square miles (0.36 km2) (or 1.83%) is water. <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Route 3 and <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Route 156 intersect within its bounds, and it is along the historic trail from <span class="loc">Kaskaskia</span> to <span class="per">St. Louis</span>. Waterloo's history dates back to the 18th century, with the French being the first Europeans to settle in the area. The site was ideal because of its elevation; the proximity of the Mississippi River Valley brought frequent flooding to the lowlands. It was also close to Fort de <span class="loc">Chartres</span>, a French stronghold. They named their settlement <span class="loc">Bellefontaine</span>, meaning 'beautiful spring.' This name related to a spring of water a mile south of the site of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>, a frequent campsite on journeys between <span class="loc">Kaskaskia</span>, <span class="loc">Cahokia</span>, and <span class="per">St. Louis</span>.</p><br><br>
