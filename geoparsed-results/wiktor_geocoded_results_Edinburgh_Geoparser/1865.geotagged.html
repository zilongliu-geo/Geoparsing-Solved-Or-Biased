<p><span class="loc">Tete</span> is the capital <span class="loc">city of Tete</span> Province in <span class="loc">Mozambique</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Zambezi River</span>, and is the site of two of the four bridges crossing the river in <span class="loc">Mozambique</span>. A Swahili trade center before the Portuguese colonial era, <span class="loc">Tete</span> continues to dominate the west-central part of the country and region, and is the largest city on the <span class="loc">Zambezi</span>. In the local language, <span class="loc">Nyungwe</span>, <span class="loc">Tete</span> (or <span class="loc">Mitete</span>) means "reed." The region was an important Swahili trade center before the Portuguese colonial era. On the east coast of <span class="loc">Africa</span> the Portuguese were drawn to <span class="loc">Mozambique</span> and the <span class="loc">Zambezi</span> river by news of a local ruler, the Munhumutapa, who was said to have had fabulous wealth in gold. In their efforts to reach the Munhumutapa, the Portuguese established in 1531 two settlements far up the <span class="loc">Zambezi</span> – one of them, at <span class="loc">Tete</span>, some 260 miles from the sea. The Munhumutapa Kingdom and gold mines remained autonomous and mostly isolated from the Portuguese. But in this region of east <span class="loc">Africa</span> – as in <span class="loc">Portuguese Guinea</span> and <span class="loc">Angola</span> in the west – Portuguese involvement became sufficiently strong to survive into the third quarter of the 20th century. Under Portuguese influence <span class="loc">Tete</span> had become a market centre for ivory and gold by the mid-17th century. Given a Portuguese town charter in 1761, it became a city of the Portuguese Overseas Province of <span class="loc">Mozambique</span> in 1959. After the Portuguese Colonial War in Portuguese <span class="loc">Africa</span> and the April 1974 military coup in <span class="loc">Lisbon</span>, the then Portuguese Overseas Province of <span class="loc">Mozambique</span> become an independent state. The newly independent <span class="loc">People's Republic of Mozambique</span>, created in 1975 after the exodus of <span class="loc">Mozambique</span>'s ethnic Portuguese, descended into civil war between 1977 and 1992.</p>
