  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is an area of the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Sefton</span>, in <span class="loc">Merseyside</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is home to The Plaza Community Cinema and three primary schools. There is also Crosby Beach, which begins in <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> and stretches 3 miles up to <span class="loc">Blundellsands</span>. It is the location of <span class="per">Antony Gormley</span>'s Another Place. It is mainly connected to <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> by <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> railway station. Historically part of <span class="loc">Lancashire</span> and originally an area of <span class="loc">Crosby</span>, named Crosby Seabank, it consisted mostly of sandhills and fields. One of the first major buildings in the area was opened on <span class="date">18 June 1816</span>, the first anniversary of the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>, and was named the Royal <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> Hotel in honour of the event. Gradually, as population increased and the area became an identifiable location, it became known as <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. Some of the buildings in <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> for example, the Grade II Listed Potters Barn park buildings are replicas of the ones found in <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>, <span class="loc">Belgium</span>. Ironically, the name <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> was dropped from the original building, which still stands, and it is <span class="date">now</span> known simply as the Royal Hotel.</p><br><br>
