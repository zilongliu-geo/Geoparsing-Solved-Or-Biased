  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 8,135. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Butler County</span> and is known as the <span class="loc">Camellia City</span>. The movement to change the official <span class="loc">Alabama</span> state flower from the goldenrod to the camellia originated in <span class="loc">Greenville</span> with legislative sponsors LaMont Glass and H.B. Taylor. Greenville was first settled in <span class="date">1819</span>. Its original name was <span class="loc">Buttsville</span>, but after becoming the county seat in <span class="date">1822</span>, its name was changed to <span class="loc">Greenville</span>, in remembrance of the former locale in <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> of many of the original settlers. The first county seat was at <span class="loc">Fort Dale</span>, a fortification that was named for <span class="per">Sam Dale</span>, who fought to defend the area during the Creek War. The site of <span class="loc">Fort Dale</span> lies on the north of the city near the <span class="per">Fort Dale</span> Cemetery, along what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Alabama</span> Highway 185. The namesake of the county, Captain <span class="per">William Butler</span>, was killed during the Creek War. He is buried in the <span class="org">Pioneer</span> Cemetery, which is across from the oldest church in <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, the First United Methodist Church of <span class="loc">Greenville</span>.</p><br><br>
