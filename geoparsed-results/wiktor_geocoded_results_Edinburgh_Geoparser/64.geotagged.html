<p>Aurora is a housing estate in Melbourne, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span> designed to provide homes with higher levels of energy and water efficiency. The plan is to build it over 15 years and to have 8500 residences. Aurora is now located partly within the suburb of <span class="loc">Epping</span> (an outer northern suburb of Melbourne) and partly within the rural locality of <span class="loc">Wollert</span>. Aurora is in the <span class="loc">City of Whittlesea</span> council area. It is about 20 km from the Melbourne CBD and is approximately 668 ha in area. It is bound by the Hume Freeway (to <span class="loc">Sydney</span>), <span class="loc">Epping Road</span>, <span class="loc">Craigieburn Road</span> and O'Herns Road on the west, east, north and south sides respectively. It is north of the ring road and west of Plenty Road. Homes in Aurora will be expected to have an energy efficiency rating of at least 6 stars, achieved by using efficient appliances, solar-heating of water where possible, insulation of buildings and houses designed with good ventilation and orientation of windows. Streets are designed for optimal capturing of solar power. Aurora's water efficiency measures aim to have 54% less potable water consumed per person than normal houses, and are expected to discharge 90% less water into the sea. Water efficient appliances will be used to minimise consumption.</p>
