<p><span class="loc">Matala</span> (Greek Μάταλα) is a village located 75 km south-west of <span class="loc">Heraklion</span>, <span class="loc">Crete</span>, <span class="loc">Greece</span>. <span class="loc">Matala</span> is part of the community of Pitsidia within the municipal unit of <span class="loc">Festos</span>, <span class="loc">Heraklion</span> regional unit. The artificial caves in the cliff of the Matala bay were created in the Neolithic Age. <span class="loc">Matala</span> was the port of <span class="loc">Phaistos</span> during the Minoan period. In the year 220 BC., <span class="loc">Matala</span> was occupied by the Gortynians, and during the Roman period, <span class="loc">Matala</span> became the port of Gortys. In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the caves were used as tombs. One of the caves is called "Brutospeliana" because according to the legend it was frequented by the Roman general Brutus. <span class="loc">Matala</span> was then a fishing village. In the 1960s, the caves were occupied by hippies who were later driven out by the church and the military junta. Now <span class="loc">Matala</span> is a small village living mainly from tourism. Canadian folk singer Joni Mitchell's experiences with the Matala hippies were immortalised in her 1971 song "Carey". When <span class="loc">Zeus</span> seduced the princess <span class="loc">Europa</span> in the form of a white bull, he crossed the sea and brought her to the beach of <span class="loc">Matala</span>. There he changed into an eagle and flew her to Gortys where he had sex with her.</p>
