<p>Bellingham is a town in <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 16,332 at the 2010 census. The town sits on the southwestern fringe of Metropolitan Boston, along the rapidly growing "outer belt" that is Route 495. It is formally a part of the <span class="loc">Boston–Cambridge–Quincy metropolitan</span> statistical area, as well as the <span class="loc">Providence metropolitan</span> area. For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place Bellingham, please see the article Bellingham (CDP), <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The area of the town south of the <span class="loc">Charles River</span> constituted the southwestern corner of the Dedham Grant, which sprouted much of what has become <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>. The land was swampy, and the town of <span class="loc">Dedham</span> did not believe it worthy of settlement. The area north of the river would be purchased by Edward Rawson, and due to the settlement of borders with the surrounding communities, these two areas would eventually merge. By 1713, there were enough citizens to warrant village meetings in the area. By 1718, the village petitioned for separation, and the town officially incorporated on November 27, 1719. The village was originally named "Westham" (short for "<span class="loc">West Dedham</span>"), but at the time of incorporation, its name was changed to <span class="loc">Bellingham</span> without record of the benefactor. The town is named for Richard Bellingham, an early governor of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span>.</p>
