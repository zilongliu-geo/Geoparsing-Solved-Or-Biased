  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Senate DFL proposes cuts, $2 billion tax hike. However, the DFL plan does not include $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money that lawmakers still do not know just how they can use. The <span class="date">Thursday</span> announcement brought the first public acknowledgment that Democrats would increase taxes to help balance the budget. Senate Tax Chairman <span class="per">Tom Bakk</span>, DFL-Cook, said a "lion's share" of the $2 billion in new revenue would come from higher taxes on the rich, apparently via the income tax. The plan calls for cutting every segment of state government, for a total of $2.4 billion. While the Democratic leaders say they would take roughly equal amounts of new taxes and program cuts to balance the budget, they have yet to figure out where to put about $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money. Given that, Senate Majority Leader <span class="per">Larry Pogemiller</span>, DFL-Minneapolis, said education cuts may end up being moderated once details of how the state can spend the federal money are unraveled. The state's $33 billion two-year budget would be $6.4 billion short without cuts, new taxes and federal money. Pawlenty figures the federal money into his budget and calls the deficit $4.6 billion. He is to announce changes to his budget in <span class="date">the next week</span> to <span class="date">10 days</span>, taking into account recent economic changes. Pawlenty's spokesman said it was good that DFL leaders "are finally publicly admitting they'd like to wallop the families and small businesses of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> with massive tax increases." <span class="per">Brian McClung</span> added that the cuts did not look at funding priorities. "An off-the-shelf computer program could do these kinds of across-the-board cuts," <span class="per">McClung</span> said. "We would expect more from DFL legislators." <span class="per">Tom Dooher</span>, president of Education Minnesota, was not happy with <span class="org">the Senate</span> announcement. "The proposed cuts are not in the best interest of Minnesotaâ s school children," <span class="per">Dooher</span> said. "If enacted, they would seriously harm the quality of education the state takes pride in providing its students." <span class="org">House</span> leaders plan to announce their budget outline soon, too. <span class="org">House</span> and Senate committees will work out details of their budgets, then establish conference committees to work out differences between the two budgets. Pawlenty often has said he will veto tax increases, and <span class="per">Pogemiller</span> has said that he believes Pawlenty. A third of the budget balancing act Democrats propose relies on higher taxes. <span class="per">Bakk</span> said he would not allow his committee to consider adding the sales tax to clothing or services. Other taxes may be considered, he said, although higher taxes on the rich are his primary goal. <span class="per">Bakk</span> also said he would like to freeze the amount of money the state gives local governments at a time when most policymakers are calling for a cut in local government aid. Pawlenty would cut the aid, which has raised city leaders' ire. Local governments will be forced to enact moderate property tax increases to deal with the DFL budget, <span class="per">Bakk</span> said, but less than under Pawlenty's proposal. Republican senators said they were not consulted about the proposal. They called tax increases job killers, supporting Pawlenty's proposed business tax cuts instead. <span class="per">Pogemiller</span> said drastic measures such as the 7 percent cut are needed because of the current recession. Most of the cuts, he added, will be to programs most affecting the state's needy residents. He called the economy "as bad, potentially, as <span class="date">the 1930s</span>." The <span class="org">Minnesota House</span> unanimously voted to support freedom of the press <span class="date">Thursday</span>, after <span class="date">a week</span> of controversy. <span class="org">House</span> Minority Leader <span class="per">Marty Seifert</span>, R-Marshall â “ joined by <span class="org">House</span> Majority Leader <span class="per">Tony Sertich</span>, DFL-Chisholm â “ brought a motion to the floor voicing that support because proposed <span class="org">House</span> rules would have restricted media work on the <span class="org">House</span> floor and in committees. The proposed rules emerged <span class="date">a week ago today</span>, creating a stir among the Capitol press corps. Then, <span class="date">Monday night</span>, a committee page demanded to see credentials from a photographer â “ two hours after a <span class="org">House</span> leadership spokesman assured the media that no credentials would be needed to cover committee meetings. <span class="per">Seifert</span> said recent events had "a chilling effect" on the press. "I am very concerned about what has taken place recently." <span class="per">Sertich</span> said the proposed rules will not be implemented. He said there has been confusion as the rules were being discussed and no changes should have been made by <span class="org">House</span> staff members. Rep. Torrey <span class="per">Westrom, R</span>-<span class="loc">Elbow Lake</span>, said the talk of stricter press rules is a sign of bigger problems with DFL leaders. "I know the press isn't really happy with some of the moves going on around here," <span class="per">Westrom</span> said. "I'm glad they are speaking up." Numerous <span class="org">House</span> members have told reporters that they also were not happy with the proposals.</p><br><br>
