<p><span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, also known as Cumberland/Galleria, is a neighborhood in Northwest <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, situated ten miles (16 km) northwest of downtown <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>. With approximately 122,000 workers and 103,000 residents, <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is the region's fifth-largest business district, and is marked by several modern skyscrapers rising from the wooded hills above the freeways. It is situated ten miles (16 km) northwest of downtown <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> at the junction of I-75 and I-285 (the "Cobb Cloverleaf") in <span class="loc">Cobb County</span>. Although small portions lie within incorporated <span class="loc">Smyrna</span>, the majority of the area is unincorporated and shares ZIP code 30339 with the Vinings area, which the USPS considers to be unincorporated <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>. While there are no official boundaries (except for the CID, which is a 5Â½-square-mile area that includes the interchange of I-75, I-285 and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 41), the business district generally extends as far northeast as the Wildwood Office Park on Powers Ferry Road, and up Cobb Parkway, the district's main street. Windy Hill Road is generally the northern extent of the district. To the south and west, it extends down <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> Parkway and Paces Ferry Road.</p>
