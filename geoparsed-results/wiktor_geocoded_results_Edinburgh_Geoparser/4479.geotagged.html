<p><span class="loc">Bergen</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Genesee County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town is in the northeast corner of the county. The population was 3,120 at the 2010 census. There is also a village of <span class="loc">Bergen</span> in the town. <span class="loc">Bergen</span> is the second smallest town in <span class="loc">Genesee County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Bergen</span> was part of the Triangle Tract and the 100,000 Acre Tract (or the Connecticut Tract) in the <span class="loc">Morris</span> Reserve. It is a portion of the triangular tract sold to <span class="loc">Le Roy</span> and others from the <span class="loc">Morris</span> Reserve; and it contains two tiers of lots from the Connecticut tract. The latter are in the western part of the town. The community was named for the city in <span class="loc">Norway</span>. The Bergen area was opened up in 1801 when a road was hacked through the thick "Northwoods" (In its early days of settlement, <span class="loc">Bergen</span> was called <span class="loc">Northwoods</span>.) from <span class="loc">LeRoy</span> to <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span>. <span class="loc">Bergen</span> was first settled in 1801 by Samuel Lincoln. In the same year George Letson, William Letson, <span class="loc">Benajah</span> Worden, Richard Abbey, Solomon Levi, Jesse Leach, James Letson, Gideon Elliott and David Scott settled in town. A colony of 60 families from the State of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> settled the area along Route 19 from <span class="loc">Fort Hill</span> (near Parmalee Rd) to <span class="loc">Black Creek</span> from 1805-1810. The first store was a mile south of Route 33 on Route 19 on the east side of the road. The first group of stores was located from the intersection of Lake Rd. (rt. 19) and Route 262 to the intersection of Rt. 19 and the Scottsville Road (Rt.33A). This area was called Buell's Corner, later Bergen Corners or High Bergen. The first church organization was established in December 1807. The Congregational church was founded January 25, 1808. Harry Kelsey, a graduate of Yale college, taught the first school. The first frame house in the town was erected by Dr. Levi Ward, the pioneer physician. Jared Merritt built the first saw mill. <span class="loc">Dr. Ward</span> was also proprietor of the first store, in 1808. The first inn was opened in 1809 by Samuel Butler. Colonel W. H. Ward was the first postmaster.</p>
