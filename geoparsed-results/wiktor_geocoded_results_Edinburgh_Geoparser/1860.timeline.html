  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Farmington</span> is a town located in <span class="loc">Strafford County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The <span class="date">2010</span> census reported that the town had a total population of 6,786. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> is home to Blue Job State Forest. The compact town center, where 3,885 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined by the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> as the <span class="loc">Farmington</span> census-designated place and is located at the junction of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> routes 75 and 153. Abenaki Indians once used the <span class="loc">Cochecho River</span> for transportation, and had a camping ground on <span class="loc">Meetinghouse</span> Hill, where they built birch bark canoes. Otherwise, the river valley was wilderness, through which Indians from the north traveled after crossing <span class="loc">Lake Winnipesaukee</span> on their way to raid settlements in and around <span class="loc">Dover</span>. To stop the raids, in <span class="date">1721</span> the Colonial Assembly in <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> approved construction of a fort at the foot of the lake, with a soldiers' road built from <span class="loc">Dover</span> to supply it. In <span class="date">1722</span>, Bay Road was surveyed and completed. Along its course the town of <span class="loc">Farmington</span> would grow. The settlement began as the Northwest Parish of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, which was chartered in <span class="date">1722</span>. The last Indian attack in the general region occurred in <span class="date">1748</span>, but by <span class="date">1749</span>, Native Americans had disappeared from warfare and disease. Farmers cultivated the rocky soil, and gristmills used water power of streams to grind their grain. Sawmills cut the abundant timber, and the first frame house at the village was built in <span class="date">1782</span>. In <span class="date">1790</span>, Jonas March from <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> established a store, behind which teamsters unloaded on his dock the lumber he traded. The area became known as <span class="date">March</span>'s Dock, <span class="loc">Farmington</span> Dock, and finally just The Dock.</p><br><br>
