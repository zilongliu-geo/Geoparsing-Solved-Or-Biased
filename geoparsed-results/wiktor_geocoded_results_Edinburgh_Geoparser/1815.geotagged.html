<p><span class="loc">Jaba</span>' (Arabic: جبع‎) is a Palestinian village in the northern <span class="loc">West Bank</span>, located 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) southwest of the <span class="loc">city of Jenin</span>. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the town had a population of 8,942 in the 2007 census. The village's name translates as "hill" and it is situated on the slopes of the Jabal Dabrun mountain. The village and its immediate vicinity contain a number of archaeological sites, including a tomb for a certain Neby Yarub. During the Ottoman era, <span class="loc">Jaba</span>' served as a throne village of the powerful Jarrar clan. The town is administered by a municipal council, currently headed by Bassam Jarrar. The village's name <span class="loc">Jaba</span>' is the word for "hill". Biblical scholars Edward Robinson and Eli Smith believed that the village's name made it "decidedly another ancient <span class="loc">Geba</span> or <span class="loc">Gibeah</span>", but they were not aware of the existence of an ancient village with either of those names in Jaba's vicinity. A possibility, they noted, was that <span class="loc">Jaba</span>' was the "Gabe", mentioned by the Byzantine historian Jerome, that was located 16 Roman miles from the coastal <span class="loc">city of Caesarea</span>.</p>
