  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Burke is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Fairfax County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2000</span> census, Burke had a total population of 57,737. Before <span class="date">2010</span>, the CDP was divided, with a portion of it becoming Burke Centre CDP; the population remaining in the Burke CDP was reported at 41,055 in the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The area of <span class="loc">Fairfax County</span> known as Burke is named for <span class="per">Silas Burke</span> (<span class="date">1796</span>â€“<span class="date">1854</span>), a 19th-century farmer, merchant, and local politician who built a house on a hill overlooking the valley of <span class="loc">Pohick Creek</span> in approximately <span class="date">1824</span>. The house is still standing. When the <span class="per">Orange</span> and <span class="per">Alexandria</span> Railroad was constructed in the late 1840s, the railroad station at the base of that hill was named Burke's Station after Burke, who owned the land in the area and donated a right-of-way to the railroad company. The community that grew up around the railroad station acquired a post office branch in <span class="date">1852</span>. Currently, railroad tracks on the same historical line are owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway and form part of the Manassas line of the <span class="loc">Virginia</span> Railway Express commuter rail system, of which two stations lie in the Burke area.</p><br><br>
