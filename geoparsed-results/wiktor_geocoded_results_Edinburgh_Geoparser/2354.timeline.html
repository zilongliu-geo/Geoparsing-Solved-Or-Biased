  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Peru</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Clinton County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. The population was 6,998 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town was named <span class="loc">Peru</span> because the mountainous nature of its western reaches suggested that country. <span class="loc">Peru</span> is in the southeastern part of <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>, south of <span class="loc">Plattsburgh</span>. The area was first settled in <span class="date">1772</span>. The Battle of <span class="loc">Valcour Island</span> was fought in <span class="loc">Lake Champlain</span> in the eastern part of <span class="loc">Peru</span> in <span class="date">1776</span>. <span class="loc">Peru</span> was formed from parts of the towns of <span class="loc">Plattsburgh</span> and <span class="loc">Willsboro</span> (the latter <span class="date">now</span> in <span class="loc">Essex County</span>) in <span class="date">1792</span>. Part of <span class="loc">Peru</span> was returned to <span class="loc">Willsboro</span> in <span class="date">1799</span>. In <span class="date">1838</span>, part of the town was used to form the towns of <span class="loc">Au Sable</span> and <span class="loc">Black Brook</span>. On <span class="date">April 20, 2002</span>, around 6:50 am, a magnitude 5.2 earthquake was centered in the western part of <span class="loc">Peru</span>, 15 miles (24 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Plattsburgh</span>. The earthquake was felt as far north as <span class="loc">Montreal</span>, as far west as <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, as far south as <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, and throughout <span class="loc">New England</span> to the east. No injuries or deaths were reported, but moderate damage in the surrounding area was common, including partial road collapses, fallen chimneys, and broken windows.</p><br><br>
