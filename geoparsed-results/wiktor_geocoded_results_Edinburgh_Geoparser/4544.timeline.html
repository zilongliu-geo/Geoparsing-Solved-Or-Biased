  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Murray County</span> is a county located in the southern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 13,488. This is a 6.9 percent increase from 12,623 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The county seat is Sulphur. The county was named for <span class="per">William H. Murray</span>, a member and president of the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention and later a Governor of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. The area <span class="date">now</span> occupied by <span class="loc">Murray County</span> was part of the land granted to the Choctaw Nation by the Treaty of Dancing <span class="loc">Rabbit Creek</span> in <span class="date">1820</span>. The <span class="loc">Chickasaw</span> received part of the land under the Treaty of Doaksville in <span class="date">1838</span>. The area became part of the <span class="loc">Chickasaw</span> Nation in <span class="date">1855</span>. There was an extended conflict before the <span class="org">U. S. Civil War</span> between the Plains Indians and the newly arrived <span class="per">Choctaws</span> and <span class="per">Chickasaws</span>. The <span class="loc">U. S</span>. Army built <span class="loc">Fort Towson</span> (<span class="date">1824</span>); <span class="loc">Fort Washita</span> (<span class="date">1842</span>) and Fort Arbuckle (<span class="date">1851</span>) to protect the <span class="per">Chickasaws</span>. After the conflict between the tribes was settled, various bands of outlaws moved in and continued to create law enforcement problems. Sulphur began developing in the 1880s around the springs for which it was named. The springs encouraged the building of bathhouses and spas. Several were established by the time that a post office was established in <span class="date">1898</span>. The Sulphur Springs Railway (acquired by the St. <span class="per">Louis</span> and <span class="per">San</span> Francisco Railway in <span class="date">1907</span>) arrived there in <span class="date">1902</span>, and the <span class="date">1904</span> establishment of Platt National Park, with headquarters at Sulphur, spurred the expansion of services for health-seekers. Other visitors were drawn to the park and to nearby <span class="loc">Turner Falls</span>, making Sulphur one of the state's earliest recreational centers.</p><br><br>
