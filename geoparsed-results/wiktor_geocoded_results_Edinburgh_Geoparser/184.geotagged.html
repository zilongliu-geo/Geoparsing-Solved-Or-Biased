<p><span class="loc">San Rafael</span> (/ˌsæn rəˈfɛl/ SAN rə-FEL; Spanish pronunciation: [san rafaˈel]) (Spanish for "<span class="loc">Saint Raphael</span>") is a city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Marin County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city is located in the <span class="loc">North Bay</span> region of the San Francisco Bay Area. As of the 2010 census the city's population is 57,713. What is now <span class="loc">San Rafael</span> was once the site of several Coast Miwok villages; Awani-wi, near downtown <span class="loc">San Rafael</span>, <span class="loc">Ewu</span>, near <span class="loc">Terra Linda</span>, and Shotomko-cha, in <span class="loc">Marinwood</span>. Mission San Rafael Arcángel was founded in what is now downtown <span class="loc">San Rafael</span> as the 20th Spanish mission in the colonial Mexican <span class="loc">province of Alta California</span> by three priests—Father Narciso Durán from Mission San José, Father Abella from Mission <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> de Asís, Father Luis Gíl y <span class="loc">Taboada</span> from <span class="loc">La Iglesia</span> de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Angeles—on Dec. 14, 1817, four years before <span class="loc">Mexico</span> gained independence from <span class="loc">Spain</span>. Mission San Rafael Arcángel was located a donkey's day walk to the mission below it. The mission and the city are named after the Archangel Raphael, the Angel of Healing.</p>
