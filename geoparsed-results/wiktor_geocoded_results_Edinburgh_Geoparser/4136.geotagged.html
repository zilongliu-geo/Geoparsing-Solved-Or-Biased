<p>Ely (/ˈiːli/ EE-lee) is a city in Saint <span class="loc">Louis County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,460 at the 2010 census. It is located on the Vermilion Iron Range, and is historically home to several iron ore mines. Today the <span class="loc">city of Ely</span> is best known as a popular entry point for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness; the International Wolf Center, and the North American Bear Center. The main street of Ely is lined with outfitters, outdoor clothing stores, and restaurants. State Highway 1 (MN 1), State Highway 169 (MN 169) and County Road 21 (Central Avenue) are the main routes in Ely. The first Europeans to explore the area were fur traders who made their way into the wilderness in search of furs. But it was the Lake Vermillion gold rush that brought the first large numbers of pioneers to the area in 1865. Although hardly any gold was ever found, it was discovered that the area did contain large deposits of iron ore. Thousands of new immigrants were arriving in <span class="loc">America</span> at that time, and many of them came to the area later to be known as the <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> Iron Range, looking for work. When the <span class="loc">Duluth</span>, Missabe and Iron Range Railway laid tracks extending the rails from Tower to Ely in 1888, Ely began mining operations with the opening of the Chandler Mine, shipping the ore to docks on <span class="loc">Lake Superior</span> in <span class="loc">Two Harbors</span> and <span class="loc">Duluth</span>. That year the miners incorporated the town of <span class="loc">Florence</span>, population 177, near the east side of <span class="loc">Shagawa Lake</span> on a site now known as <span class="loc">Spaulding</span>. The miners named their settlement <span class="loc">Florence</span> after the daughter of the Chandler mine’s Captain Jack Pengilly (also the town’s first mayor). But the community moved after ore was discovered farther west, and it changed its name as well. Since it was found that the name “Florence” was already taken by another <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> village, “Ely” was chosen in honor of mining executive Samuel B. Ely, a big promoter of Vermilion Range ore who lived in <span class="loc">Michigan</span> (and never actually visited the town that bears his name).</p>
