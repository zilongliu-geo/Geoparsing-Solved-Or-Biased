<p><span class="loc">Yenga</span> is a village in Kissi Teng Chiefdom, <span class="loc">Kailahun District</span> in the Eastern province of <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span>. The village is at the international border between <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span> and <span class="loc">Guinea</span>. <span class="loc">Yenga</span> is located on a hill above the south side of the confluence of the <span class="loc">Mafissia River</span> and the <span class="loc">Makona River</span> (<span class="loc">Moa River</span>), where that river forms the border between the two countries. The area is inhabited by the Kissi people. In July 2012 <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span> and <span class="loc">Guinea</span> declared the demilitarization of the Yenga area. Prior to the late 1990s <span class="loc">Yenga</span> was a small fishing village. However, after occupation by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), alluvial diamonds were discovered in the <span class="loc">Makona River</span>. Mining and agriculture have replaced fishing as the major economic activity. In 2001, during <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span>â€™s civil war, the <span class="loc">Republic of Guinea</span> sent troops into <span class="loc">Yenga</span> to help the army of <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span> suppress the rebel RUF. After the rebels were quashed, the Guinean soldiers remained in <span class="loc">Yenga</span>. Prior to the civil war <span class="loc">Yenga</span> was administered by the <span class="loc">Kailahun District</span> of <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span>. In 2002 <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span> and <span class="loc">Guinea</span> signed an agreement than <span class="loc">Yenga</span> would be returned to <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span>, as soon as <span class="loc">Guinea</span>'s border could be secured. In 2005 <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span> and <span class="loc">Guinea</span> signed an agreement that <span class="loc">Yenga</span> belonged to <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span>. The two heads of state settled this dispute in 2013</p>
