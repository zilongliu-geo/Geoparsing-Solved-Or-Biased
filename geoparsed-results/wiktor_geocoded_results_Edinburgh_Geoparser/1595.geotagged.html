<p>Newton is a suburban city in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is approximately 7 miles (11 km) west of downtown <span class="loc">Boston</span> and is bordered by Boston's <span class="loc">Brighton</span> and <span class="loc">West Roxbury</span> neighborhoods to the east and south, respectively, and by the suburb of <span class="loc">Brookline</span> to the east, the suburbs of <span class="loc">Watertown</span> and <span class="loc">Waltham</span> to the north, and <span class="loc">Wellesley</span> and <span class="loc">Needham</span> to the west. Rather than having a single city center, Newton is a patchwork of thirteen villages. According to the 2010 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, the population of Newton was 85,146, making it the eleventh largest city in the state. Newton's proximity to <span class="loc">Boston</span> along with its historic homes, good public schools, and safe and quiet neighborhoods make it a desirable community for those who commute to <span class="loc">Boston</span>. Newton is served by three modes of mass transit run by the MBTA: light rail, commuter rail, and bus service. Newton has consistently ranked as one of the best cities to live in in the country. In August 2012, Money magazine named Newton fourth best small city among places to live in <span class="loc">America</span>.</p>
