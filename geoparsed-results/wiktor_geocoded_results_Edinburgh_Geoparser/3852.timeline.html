  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Providence</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cache County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,075 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is included in the Logan, <span class="loc">Utah-Idaho Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Providence</span> lies 2.5 miles (4.0 km) south of Logan on former State Route 238. Its <span class="date">1990</span> census population was 3,344. Situated immediately east of the confluence of <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span> with the <span class="loc">Logan River</span>, the town lies astride a delta at the mouth of <span class="loc">Providence</span> Canyon and beneath 8,881-foot (2,707 m) <span class="loc">Big Baldy Mountain</span>. The settlement was located on <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span> to take advantage of water, arable land, timber resources, and existing trails. As directed by LDS President <span class="per">Brigham Young</span>, on <span class="date">24 July 1855</span> <span class="per">Captain Briant Stringham</span>, <span class="per">Simon Baker</span>, <span class="per">Andrew Moffat</span>, and <span class="per">Brigham Young</span>, Jr., located headquarters for the Elkhorn Cattle Ranch on a spring of water near the west bank of the Blacksmith <span class="loc">Fork River</span>, immediately southwest of the present site of <span class="loc">Providence</span>. Subsequently, in the <span class="date">early spring</span> of <span class="date">1857</span>, <span class="per">Samuel, Joseph</span>, Aboile, and Nephi Campbell, and <span class="per">John Dunn</span>, crossed the mountains from <span class="loc">North Ogden</span> into Cache Valley, seeking a new place to settle. To them, the town they called "Ogden's Hole" was becoming too crowded. They pitched camp at the present site of <span class="loc">Providence</span>, at a spring and pond where a creek from a canyon in the Bear River Range entered the alluvial lowland. To assess the fertility of the soil, the explorers broke sod and plowed a long furrow.</p><br><br>
