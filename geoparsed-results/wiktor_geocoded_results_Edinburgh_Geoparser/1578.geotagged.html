<p><span class="loc">Armenia</span> (/ɑːrˈmiːniə/, /-ˈmiːnjə/; Armenian: Հայաստան, tr. <span class="loc">Hayastan</span>, IPA: [hɑjɑsˈtɑn]), officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Armenia</span> (Armenian: Հայաստանի Հանրապետություն, tr. Hayastani Hanrapetut’yun), is a sovereign state in the <span class="loc">South Caucasus region</span> of <span class="loc">Eurasia</span>. Located in Western <span class="loc">Asia</span>, it is bordered by <span class="loc">Turkey</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Georgia</span> to the north, the de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and <span class="loc">Azerbaijan</span> to the east, and <span class="loc">Iran</span> and the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. <span class="loc">Armenia</span> is a unitary, multi-party, democratic nation-state with an ancient cultural heritage. The Kingdom of Van was established in 860 BC and by the 6th century BC it was replaced by the Satrapy of <span class="loc">Armenia</span>. In the 1st century BC the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Armenia</span> reached its height under Tigranes the Great. <span class="loc">Armenia</span> became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion.

The ancient Armenian kingdom was split between the Byzantine and Sasanid empires around the early 5th century. Under the Bagratuni dynasty, the Armenian Kingdom was restored in the 9th century.
