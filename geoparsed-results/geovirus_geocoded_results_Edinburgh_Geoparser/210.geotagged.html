<p>The All <span class="loc">India</span> Institute of Hygiene and Public Health has begun a campaign to instruct street vendors in <span class="loc">India</span> how to safely prepare food for their customers to avoid inflicting 'Delhi belly'–severe diarrhea–which afflicts about half of the visitors to the region. Over 150,000 "stall wallahs" in <span class="loc">Calcutta</span> will be shown how to properly prepare dishes such as jhalmuri (a rice, tomato, and onion dish) and ghughni (a chick pea curry dish). "Do not set up your stall in the middle of a rubbish dump, drain or sewage channel," the report recommends. "Wash your hands before cooking and do not let large swarms of flies settle on food displays." "One of the tips we’ve been given is to wear aprons," Banahari Saha, a stall operator on <span class="loc">Camac</span> Street, in <span class="loc">Calcutta</span>, told UPI. "We’ve also been told how important it is to make sure the water is clean and uncooked food is protected from flies," he said. The campaign is also sponsored by the World Health Organization. Tourists will be given maps pointing to street vendors who have been approved by the All <span class="loc">India</span> Institute. "My customers say they're happy with the changes I've introduced," <span class="loc">Saha</span> told UPI.</p>
