<p><span class="loc">Benavides</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Duval County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,362 at the 2010 census, down from 1,686 at the 2000 census. The town is named after Plácido <span class="loc">Benavides</span> (1837–1919), namesake nephew of Plácido <span class="loc">Benavides</span> (1810–1837), Tejano 1832 alcalde of Victoria, who served under Stephen F. Austin with Juan Seguin, in the Siege of Béxar. Plácido <span class="loc">Benavides</span> whom the town is named after served in the Confederate States Army. After the war, he built his "<span class="loc">Rancho Palo Alto</span>" into one of the largest ranches in <span class="loc">Duval County</span>. In 1880, he agreed to let the county locate a railroad station on his property. In 1881, he donated 80 acres (32 ha) to establish the community that grew up around the station on the <span class="loc">Texas</span> Mexican Railway. In 1882 Archie Parr arrived to manage the <span class="loc">Sweden</span> Ranch for the <span class="loc">Lott</span> &amp; Nielson Pasture Company. The former schoolteacher and ranch hand was later a rancher, <span class="loc">Texas</span> state senator, and the first "Duke of Duval", political boss of the county. His middle son, George Berham Parr, succeeded him as El Patrón and Duke of Duval. Other descendants of <span class="loc">Archie</span> also figured prominently in county politics. In 1911, <span class="loc">Archie</span> campaigned unsuccessfully to move the county courthouse from <span class="loc">San Diego</span> to <span class="loc">Benavides</span>.</p>
