  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Taco Bell</span> killer pleads guilty. <span class="per">CHARLESTON</span>, <span class="per">W.Va</span>. -- <span class="per">A Charleston</span> man admitted in <span class="org">Kanawha Circuit Court</span> on <span class="date">Monday</span> that he gunned down his longtime girlfriend in a West Side <span class="per">Taco Bell</span> in <span class="date">July 2008</span>. <span class="per">Desmond Demetrius Clark</span>, 22, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, saying he shot Na'lisha Gravely, 19, with whom he had a son. "I shot '<span class="loc">Lisha</span> in the <span class="loc">Taco Bell</span>," <span class="per">Clark</span> said. "I later learned that she died from it." As part of the plea deal, prosecutors agreed to drop two wanton endangerment charges and a kidnapping charge against <span class="per">Clark</span>. <span class="per">Clark</span>, who had a lengthy history of domestic violence against Gravely, followed her into the <span class="per">Patrick Street</span> restaurant, where she had apparently fled from him during an argument. Video surveillance appeared to show <span class="per">Clark</span> hopping the counter moments before he fired into the closet where Gravely was hiding. Chief <span class="per">Kanawha Circuit</span> <span class="per">Judge Jim Stucky</span> accepted <span class="per">Clark</span>'s plea, and set his sentencing for <span class="date">June 2</span>. Both sides are free to call witnesses and argue whether or not <span class="per">Clark</span>'s life sentence should come with a recommendation of mercy, meaning that he could eventually be paroled. <span class="per">Clark</span> was captured following a brief manhunt. His arrest and subsequent murder charges set off an uproar, in part because of his extensive criminal history and in part because he was subject of a domestic violence protective order taken out by Gravely when he killed her. <span class="per">Clark</span> turned and quietly said "I love you" to his supporters before he was led out of the courtroom. Gravely's family and friends left the courtroom without talking to reporters. After the hearing, Plants said he was pleased with the conviction and that he plans to ask <span class="per">Stucky</span> to send <span class="per">Clark</span> to prison for the rest of his life. "The facts of this case are just brutal. He shot her in broad daylight. He admitted it," Plants said. <span class="per">Clark</span> told <span class="per">Stucky</span> that his son <span class="date">now</span> lives with Gravely's family. Defense attorney <span class="per">Theresa Chisolm</span> said <span class="per">Clark</span> wanted to accept responsibility for his actions. Plants said Gravely's tragic murder brought additional attention to the issue of domestic violence. "Women who are in the cycle of abuse need to get out of the cycle," he said. <span class="date">Earlier this month</span>, the state <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> touted the launch of its electronic domestic violence registry, which gives police officers statewide electronic access to domestic violence protective orders like the one a <span class="org">Kanawha County Family Court</span> judge issued to Gravely on <span class="date">May 28, 2008</span>. According to that order, <span class="per">Clark</span> and <span class="per">Gravely</span> were not supposed to be around each other until <span class="date">Aug. 28, 2008</span>, <span class="date">a few days</span> after she would have turned 20. A <span class="loc">Dunbar</span> police officer pulled over a car driven by <span class="per">Clark</span> with Gravely in the passenger seat on the day of the murder, but, apparently unaware of the protective order, he ticketed <span class="per">Clark</span> for driving on a suspended license and for having a small amount of marijuana. <span class="per">Clark</span> was on probation at the time, having been sentenced by <span class="per">Stucky</span> to <span class="date">two years</span> probation in <span class="date">March 2008</span> for felony possession with intent to distribute and several misdemeanors. The domestic violence registry is <span class="date">now</span> up and running in 14 counties, but those do not yet include <span class="loc">Kanawha County</span>, <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> administrative director <span class="per">Steve Canterbury</span> said <span class="date">Monday</span>. A bailiff leads <span class="per">Desmond Clark</span> out of the courtroom following his guilty plea <span class="date">Monday</span>. <span class="per">Clark</span> admitted that he shot and killed Na'lisha Gravely, the mother of his child, in a West Side <span class="per">Taco Bell</span> in <span class="date">2008</span>.</p><br><br>
