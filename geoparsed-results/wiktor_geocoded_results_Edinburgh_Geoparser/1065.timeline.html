  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Portland</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Northampton County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Portland</span> is located in the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley region of the state. It is part of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>'s Slate Belt. The population of <span class="loc">Portland</span> was 579 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="loc">Portland</span> is located at 40°55′14″N 75°5′52″W (40.920622, -75.097738). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2), of which, 0.5 square miles (1.3 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) of it (8.93%) is water. <span class="loc">Portland</span> was settled because of the logging trade and what buildings were here in the early 19th century came as a result of this industry. It served to increase at least one business – that of the taverns and hotels. Records show that the Hibblertown Hotel (present Ackerson house on <span class="org">State Street</span>), the Dill’s Tavern (oldest tavern, was located on the south side of Emery’s, <span class="date">now</span> torn down) and the What Cheer Inn (present Duckloe Showroom at the corner of <span class="loc">Delaware</span> <span class="per">Avenue</span> and <span class="per">Main</span> Street) all prospered because of loggers.</p><br><br>
