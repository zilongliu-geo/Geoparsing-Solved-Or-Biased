  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Minden</span> is a town of about 83,000 inhabitants in the north-east of North Rhine-Westphalia, <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The town extends along both sides of the River <span class="loc">Weser</span>. It is the capital of the district (Kreis) of Minden-Lübbecke, which is part of the region of <span class="loc">Detmold</span>. <span class="loc">Minden</span> is the historic political centre of the cultural region of <span class="loc">Minden</span> Land. It is widely known as the intersection of the <span class="loc">Mittelland Canal</span> and the River <span class="loc">Weser</span>. The town is over <span class="date">1,200 years</span> old and has many buildings in the <span class="loc">Weser</span> Renaissance style, in addition to its architecturally symbolic 1,000-year-old cathedral. <span class="loc">Minden</span> is in the northeast of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It lies on the River <span class="loc">Weser</span>, north of the <span class="loc">Porta Westfalica</span> gap between the ridges of the <span class="loc">Weser</span> Hills and <span class="loc">Wiehen</span> Hills. The <span class="loc">Weser</span> leaves the <span class="loc">Weser</span> <span class="loc">Uplands</span> and flows into the North German Plain through the town's subdistricts of Dützen and <span class="loc">Haddenhausen</span>. The town centre lies 5 kilometres (3 miles) to the north, on a plateau on the western side of the river. The small Bastau stream flows into the <span class="loc">Weser</span> from the west near the town centre. The edge of the plateau marks the transition from the Middle <span class="loc">Weser</span> Valley to the Lübbecke Loessland. This marked change in terrain divides the upper town from the lower town, and marks the boundary between two ecological zones. The formation of the town was strongly influenced by the Prussian fortress of <span class="loc">Minden</span>, whose now-demolished fortifications have been turned into a green belt around the town centre.</p><br><br>
