<p>Hudson is a city in St. <span class="loc">Croix County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> census, its population was 12,719. It is part of the Minneapolis–St. <span class="loc">Paul Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area (MSA). The village of <span class="loc">North Hudson</span> is located directly to the north of Hudson. Hudson was settled in the summer of 1840 by Louis Massey and his brother in-law, Peter Bouchea. William Steets arrived at about the same time. Later that same year, Joseph Sauperson (commonly known as Joe LaGrue) took up residence. These four are considered Hudson's original inhabitants. Massey and Bouchea settled at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Willow River</span>, near the present-day First and St. Croix Streets. They had been part of the group who lived for some time along the river below Fort Snelling, which appears on some old maps as "Massey's Landing". The 1840s saw a few settlers making their appearance here — Captain John Page, the Nobles brothers, Dr. Philip Aldrich, Ammah Andrews, Moses <span class="loc">Perrin</span>, Colonel James Hughes, Daniel Anderson, and others.</p>
