<p><span class="loc">Labuan</span> (/ləˈbuːən/) is a federal territory of <span class="loc">Malaysia</span> off the coast of <span class="loc">Borneo</span> in <span class="loc">East Malaysia</span>. It is made up of the homonymous <span class="loc">Labuan</span> Island and six smaller islands, and is located off the coast of the state of <span class="loc">Sabah</span>. <span class="loc">Labuan</span>'s capital is Victoria and is best known as an offshore financial centre offering international financial and business services via <span class="loc">Labuan</span> IBFC since 1990 as well as being an offshore support hub for deepwater oil and gas activities in the region. It is also a tourist destination for people travelling through <span class="loc">Sabah</span>, nearby Bruneians and scuba divers. The name <span class="loc">Labuan</span> derives from the Malay word labuhan which means harbour. Since the 15th century, the north and west coast of <span class="loc">Borneo</span> including the island of <span class="loc">Labuan</span> was part of the Bruneian Empire. In the 18th century, <span class="loc">Labuan</span> attracted British interest. James Brooke acquired the island for <span class="loc">Britain</span> in 1846 through a treaty with the Sultan of <span class="loc">Brunei</span>, Omar Ali Saifuddin II on 18 December 1846. A British naval officer, Rodney Mundy, visited <span class="loc">Brunei</span> with his ship HMS Iris to keep the Sultan in line until the British Government made a final decision to take the island and he took Pengiran Mumin to witness the island's accession to the British Crown on 24 December 1846. Some sources state that during the signing of the treaty, the Sultan had been threatened by a British navy warship ready to fire on the Sultan's palace if he refused to sign the treaty while another source says the island was ceded to <span class="loc">Britain</span> as a reward for assistance in combating pirates.</p>
