<p><span class="loc">Sandala</span> (Arabic: صندله‎; Hebrew: צַנְדַלָה, סַנְדַלָה) is an Arab village in the <span class="loc">North District</span> of <span class="loc">Israel</span>. Located near <span class="loc">Afula</span>, it falls under the jurisdiction of <span class="loc">Gilboa Regional Council</span>. In 2006 it had a population of 1,500. According to a local tradition, the present village was (re-)established in the 18th-century in the Ottoman era by two brothers from the nearby village <span class="loc">Arranah</span>, which is today part of the <span class="loc">West Bank</span>. When Edward Robinson passed by <span class="loc">Sandala</span> in 1838, he described it as a "small site of ruined foundations," while Victor Guérin, who passed by in 1870, noted it as "a hamlet, situated on a mound." In 1882 the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western <span class="loc">Palestine</span> described it as a "small village on the edge of the plain, built of stone and mud, supplied by cisterns, and surrounded by plough-land." In the 1922 census of <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, <span class="loc">Sandala</span> had a population of 146, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 189, still all Muslim, in a total of 36 houses.</p>
