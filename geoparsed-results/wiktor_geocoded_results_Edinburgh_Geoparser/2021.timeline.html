  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Burton is a small village with 103 households (<span class="date">2014</span>) in the <span class="loc">Cotswolds</span> <span class="org">Area of Outstanding Natural</span> Beauty in <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="org">Kelly's Directory</span> of <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span> of 1915 identifies Burton as the most important part of the <span class="loc">parish of Nettleton</span>. It is about 8 miles (13 km) west of <span class="loc">Chippenham</span>. There is a record of Burton dating back to AD <span class="date">1204</span>, and more recently in Book 44 - <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span>, of the Topographical Collections of <span class="per">John Aubrey</span> 1659-70. The modern community has an active Anglican church, <span class="per">St Mary</span>'s; the <span class="org">Burton Community Association</span>, formed in <span class="date">2014</span>; and a public house, The <span class="loc">Old House</span> at Home. It is served by two nearby Church schools, Bybrook Valley CofE School in <span class="loc">Yatton Keynell</span> (4 miles) and Trinity CofE School in <span class="loc">Acton Turville</span> (1 mile), as well as <span class="org">Grittleton House</span> private school (3 miles). The Church of <span class="per">St Mary</span> the <span class="org">Virgin</span>, which stands on the hill above the hamlet of Burton, is the oldest and most important building in the village, and is a Grade I listed building. The oldest parts of the Church date from about <span class="date">1290</span> although little remains from that period. <span class="org">The Register of Incumbents</span> dates back to <span class="date">1305</span> when the Abbot of <span class="loc">Glastonbury</span> presented <span class="per">Johannes de Montacute</span> to the living. The Manor and Advowson of Netlington belonged, until the Dissolution, to <span class="loc">Glastonbury</span> Abbey. The Church is <span class="date">now</span> in the ByBrook Benefice in the rural deanery of <span class="loc">Chippenham</span>, archdeaconry of <span class="loc">Malmesbury</span>, and the present patron is the <span class="per">Bishop of Bristol</span>.</p><br><br>
