<p><span class="loc">Darlington</span> is a small, inner-city suburb of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is located about 3 kilometres south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district and is part of the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Sydney</span>. At the time of its incorporation in 1864, it had the distinction of being the smallest municipality in the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> metropolitan area, at a mere 44 acres. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is bordered by City Road, Cleveland Street, Golden Grove Street, <span class="loc">Wilson Street</span> and <span class="loc">Abercrombie Street</span>. The first Aboriginal inhabitants of <span class="loc">Darlington</span> were the Cadigal people of the Eora belonging to the wider Dharug language group. The Cadigal were a coastal people who subsisted on fishing, hunting land animals and gathering shellfish and plants. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> was part of their southern range bordered by the Kameygal clan to the south at <span class="loc">Botany Bay</span> and the <span class="loc">Wangal</span> clan to the west. The earliest recorded British history of <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is linked to school purposes when in 1789, Governor Arthur Phillip received instructions from <span class="loc">England</span> to set aside land in the new penal colony for church and school use. In 1819, fifty two acres of land was given to William Hutchinson by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. In 1835, a 28 acres land grant was made to William Shepherd by Governor Richard Bourke. It had been promised earlier in 1827 by Governor Ralph Darling and in his honour, Shepherd named the fruit and flower farm he established 'Shepherd's Darling Nursery'. His nursery is still remembered today in many <span class="loc">Darlington</span> street names such as Ivy, Pine, Myrtle, Rose, Vine and Shepherd Streets. By 1844, the Hutchinson estate, much of Shepherd's Nursery and a portion of the adjoining 96 acre land grant to William Chippendale comprised much of present-day <span class="loc">Darlington</span>.</p>
