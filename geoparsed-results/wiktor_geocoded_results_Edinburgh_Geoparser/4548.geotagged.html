<p><span class="loc">Xianyang</span> (simplified Chinese: 咸阳; traditional Chinese: 咸陽; pinyin: Xiányáng; IPA: [ɕjɛ̌n.jɑ̌ŋ]) was the capital of <span class="loc">China</span> in the Qin dynasty. It is a prefecture in modern-day <span class="loc">Shaanxi province</span>, on the <span class="loc">Wei River</span>, and is located a few kilometers upstream (west) from <span class="loc">Xi</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span>. Integrated into the <span class="loc">Xi</span>'an metropolitan area, one of the main urban agglomerations in inland <span class="loc">China</span>, with more than 7.17 million inhabitants, its built-up area made of 2 urban districts (<span class="loc">Qindu</span> and <span class="loc">Weicheng</span>) was 945,420 inhabitants at the 2010 census. It has a total area of 10,213 square kilometres (3,943 sq mi). <span class="loc">Xianyang</span> was among the capital city's environs during the Western <span class="loc">Zhou</span> dynasty, and was made the capital of the state of Qin in 350 BC during the Warring States period before becoming the capital of <span class="loc">China</span> during the short-lived Qin dynasty. Because the city lay south of the <span class="loc">Jiuzong</span> Mountains and north of the <span class="loc">Wei River</span> - both sunlight-rich (yang) orientations - it was named "Xianyang", meaning "fully yang". Under Duke Xiao of Qin, minister Shang Yang designed <span class="loc">Xianyang</span> in 350 BC, which was then the capital for over 140 years. It was located in the modern day <span class="loc">Shaanxi province</span> on the northern bank of the <span class="loc">Wei River</span>, on the opposite side of which Liu Bang would later build the <span class="loc">Han</span> dynasty capital of <span class="loc">Chang</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> once he became emperor.</p>
