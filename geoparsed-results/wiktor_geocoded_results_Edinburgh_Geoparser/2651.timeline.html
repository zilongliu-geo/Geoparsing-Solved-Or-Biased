  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Douglas is a community on <span class="loc">Douglas Island</span> in southeastern <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, directly across the Gastineau Channel from downtown <span class="loc">Juneau</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, Douglas is a residential community on <span class="loc">Douglas Island</span> and the only traditional school left on Douglas is Gastineau Elementary, which serves all the <span class="loc">Douglas Island</span> elementary aged students. The <span class="org">Douglas Public Library</span> is part of the Capital City Libraries, and a couple restaurants and bars exist (The Island Pub, Louie's Douglas Inn, and The Douglas Café). The town’s population dropped over the <span class="date">years</span>, but recently is up to about 3000 people, or close to 10 percent of the City and <span class="loc">Borough of Juneau</span>’s population. Douglas gets its water and electricity from <span class="loc">Juneau</span> and has a mix of onsite and municipal (diverted to <span class="loc">Juneau</span>) wastewater treatment. The <span class="org">Alaska Department of Corrections</span> has its headquarters in Douglas. <span class="loc">Douglas Island</span> was originally a border of the Auke people’s and Taku people’s territory. It was not usually used for year-round settlement, but as a place to spend the <span class="date">summer</span>, or at times a place for battles. Some historical reports indicate an early settler to the area may be credited for the naming of <span class="loc">Douglas Island</span>.</p><br><br>
