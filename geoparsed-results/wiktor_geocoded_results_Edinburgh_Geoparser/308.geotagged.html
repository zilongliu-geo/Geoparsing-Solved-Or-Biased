<p><span class="loc">Concepcion</span> is a sixth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Romblon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. <span class="loc">Concepcion</span> started as a small village founded in 1570 by the Spanish colonization forces led by Martin de Goiti and Juan de Salcedo, upon orders from then Spanish Governor-General of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, <span class="loc">Miguel Lopez</span> de <span class="loc">Legazpi</span>. The village was named after the Immaculate <span class="loc">Concepcion</span>. Throughout the Spanish era, the village was administered as part of <span class="loc">Banton</span> municipality on nearby <span class="loc">Banton Island</span>. On 2 July 1907, during the American colonization of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, <span class="loc">Concepcion</span> was elevated to municipal status but was incorporated as part of <span class="loc">Mindoro province</span> after <span class="loc">Romblon</span> was abolished and incorporated as part of <span class="loc">Capiz province</span>. However, on 10 March 1917, <span class="loc">Romblon</span> was reinstated as a separate province, and thus, <span class="loc">Concepcion</span> was incorporated back to the province. On 8 June 1940, the special municipality of Maghali was established upon passage of Commonwealth Act No. 581 (authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin). This demoted <span class="loc">Concepcion</span> and <span class="loc">Corcuera</span> from their municipality status and incorporated into the new municipality with its capital in <span class="loc">Banton</span>. On 26 May 1946, the special municipality was abolished through the passage of Republic Act No. 38 (authored by Congressman Modesto Formilleza), and by 1 January 1947, <span class="loc">Concepcion</span> regained its municipal status which it still holds today.</p>
