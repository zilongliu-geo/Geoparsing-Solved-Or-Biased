<p>Harrison is a town in <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,730 at the 2010 census. A historic resort area, Harrison straddles <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> and <span class="loc">Crystal Lake</span>. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> statistical area. The Massachusetts General Court granted Otis Field Plantation in 1771 to James Otis and other heirs of Captain John Gorham and his company for their service in the 1690 Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. It replaced a 1736 grant which had been ruled invalid. In 1797, the plantation was incorporated as <span class="loc">Otisfield</span>. On March 8, 1805, Harrison was set off and incorporated from portions of <span class="loc">Otisfield</span> and <span class="loc">Bridgton</span>. It was named after a principal landowner, Harrison Gray Otis of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, the heir of James Otis. In the autumn of 1792, two brothers from Gorham, John and Nathan Carsley, built a camp and cleared land in Harrison. During the winter they returned to Gorham, coming back in March 1793 with their wives. Because John Carsley and his wife remained in Harrison when Nathan Carsley and his wife resumed living in Gorham until 1796, he is considered the town's first permanent settler. More pioneers arrived, living in log houses chinked with moss. The outlet of <span class="loc">Crystal Lake</span> into <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> provided water power for industry, and James Sampson erected at Harrison village the first sawmill and gristmill. Over the years other industries followed, including a wire-making business, blacksmithy, shingle mill, harness-maker, foundry, carriage maker, clothing maker and shoe shop. Scribner's Mill (now a museum) was built in 1847 on the <span class="loc">Crooked River</span>. On the <span class="loc">Bear River</span>, in 1867 the Harrison Water Power Company established the <span class="loc">Bear River</span> <span class="loc">Woolen</span> Mill, destroyed by fire in 1872.</p>
