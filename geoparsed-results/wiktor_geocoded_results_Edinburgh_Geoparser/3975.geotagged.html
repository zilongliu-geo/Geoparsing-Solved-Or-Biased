<p><span class="loc">Tubao</span> is a fourth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">La Union</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 26,993 people. Formerly known as the "Home of the Native Tobacco", <span class="loc">Tubao</span> was famous for its tobacco leaf and cigars. It had a tobacco trade for decades where its town center was littered by huge tobacco warehouses and trading posts for tobacco. Today, corn is its prime agricultural output where Chichacorn is among its by-products. The town has an average annual income of PHP 42,803,624 pesos. "Legend states that <span class="loc">Tubao</span> got its name when the Spaniards led by one Father <span class="loc">Luis Gonzaga</span> y <span class="loc">Espinosa</span>, in their desire to spread Christianity, headed towards the eastern parts of <span class="loc">Agoo</span>. At that time, these parts of <span class="loc">Agoo</span> were hinterlands and heavily forested. While the Spaniards were resting under the full-grown trees, they distributed manuscripts of the cartilla and catecismo to the natives. Suddenly, they heard a loud chorus of sound "<span class="loc">TUAO</span>, <span class="loc">TUAO</span>", emanating from the top of the trees. These sounds made by the birds locally known as kalaw, (the rufous hornbill, Buceros hydrocorax) attracted and bewildered the Spaniards. Even as the Spaniards went further east, the sound persisted. When Father Espinosa returned from their journey, he reported an area called "<span class="loc">TUAO</span>." However, due to inadvertent recordings made by the Spanish authorities, the word "<span class="loc">TUAO</span>" was written as "TUBAO", hence, the name of the place."</p>
