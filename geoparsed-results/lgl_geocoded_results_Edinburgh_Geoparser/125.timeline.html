  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Funding to dry up on <span class="date">Friday</span> for <span class="org">Charles Webb Center</span>. The <span class="org">Charles Webb Center</span> for developmentally disabled kids, which has survived on donations for <span class="date">nearly three months</span>, is hoping for another miracle. The center has funding to stay open through <span class="date">Friday</span>. It may be able to secure a grant <span class="date">this week</span> to keep it running through <span class="date">April 3</span>. The community has kept the center afloat since <span class="date">Jan. 1</span> with more than $30,000 in donations. The state Department of <span class="org">Disabilities and Special Needs</span> cut $150,000 in annual funding for the center in response to a General Assembly mandate to trim $21.5 million or 11.2 percent from its budget. On the state <span class="org">House</span> floor <span class="date">last week</span>, Rep. Wendell <span class="per">Gilliard, D</span>-Charleston, tried unsuccessfully to restore $250,000 in funding for the <span class="org">Webb Center</span> and another center for developmentally disabled children in Anderson. "They knocked it down," <span class="per">Gilliard</span> said. "I'm still soliciting private donations to keep the <span class="org">Webb Center</span> afloat. It's an invaluable service to our children," he said. No one knows that better than <span class="per">Mindy Miller</span> of <span class="loc">Ravenel</span>, whose son, <span class="per">Parker</span>, 8, has Fragile X syndrome and is developmentally delayed by <span class="date">about three years</span>. He has been at the <span class="org">Webb Center</span> for <span class="date">nearly seven years</span>. Miller and the other parents of the 30 children at the center said there is no place like it. "You hang on to every day and hope that a miracle happens. It's kind of wearing me down. It's frustrating, an emotional roller coaster," <span class="per">Miller</span> said. educable mentally disabled children at Drayton Hall Elementary School. After school, he takes a bus to the <span class="org">Webb Center</span> on Evergreen Street, where he is picked up when his parents leave their business, Miller Signs, about 6 p.m. Several of the parents have said that if the <span class="org">Webb Center</span> closes, it could mean they would have to quit their jobs to stay home to care for a special needs child. Parents learned <span class="date">Nov. 13</span> that the center would close at <span class="date">the end of the year</span> because of state budget cuts. Kids at the center range from infants to age 10 and have developmental problems such as autism and mental retardation. The center has a staff of eight. The state Department of <span class="org">Disabilities and Special Needs</span> cut funds for five child day-care programs, including the <span class="org">Webb Center</span>. State Sen. <span class="per">Robert Ford</span>, D-Charleston, said he is optimistic about restoring state funding to the <span class="org">Webb Center</span> in the new budget year beginning <span class="date">July 1</span>. "We're almost sure that we're going to be able to do it," <span class="per">Ford</span> said. The state money enables the center to receive matching Medicaid funds to meet its budget, officials said. On <span class="date">March 6</span>, Ford, <span class="per">Gilliard</span> and <span class="per">Senate</span> <span class="per">President Pro Tem</span> <span class="per">Glenn McConnell</span>, R-Charleston, donated a total of $5,000 to the center. <span class="per">Ford</span> said he has spoken with Sen. Finance Committee Chairman <span class="per">Hugh Leatherman</span>, a Republican from <span class="loc">Florence</span>, who has been impressed with support for the center from local legislators. <span class="per">Ford</span> said that <span class="org">House</span> Speaker <span class="per">Bobby Harrell</span>, R-Charleston, can pave the way for restoring center funding in the <span class="org">House</span>. <span class="per">Ford</span> said he thinks that the center also could be the beneficiary of federal stimulus money. Meanwhile, the <span class="org">Webb Center</span> will be living from week-to-week on the largesse of the community. "I can definitely go through <span class="date">next week</span>. We're hoping for another <span class="date">two weeks</span>," said <span class="per">Rick Magner</span>, director of the Disabilities Board of <span class="loc">Charleston County</span>. The center's weekly operating cost is about $5,000, he said.</p><br><br>
