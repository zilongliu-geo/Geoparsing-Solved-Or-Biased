<p>Billings (Russian: Би́ллингс) is a rural locality (a selo) in <span class="loc">Iultinsky District</span> of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, <span class="loc">Russia</span>. Population: 211 (2010 Census);  Municipally, it is incorporated as Billings Rural Settlement in Chaunsky Municipal District. Like <span class="loc">Mys Shmidta</span>, Billings is named after a nearby cape, which in turn was named after British Captain Joseph Billings (1758—1806) who was at the service of the Russian Imperial Navy during Catherine the Great's reign. The cape itself marks the point of separation between the <span class="loc">Chukchi Sea</span> and the <span class="loc">East Siberian Sea</span>. Joseph Billings was an English-born member of the Russian navy who in 1785, together with C. G. Sarychevym, was part of the expedition that mapped and researched the coast of North-Eastern <span class="loc">Siberia</span>. Using reindeer, he crossed <span class="loc">Chukotka</span> as far as <span class="loc">Kolyuchinskaya Guba</span> and mapped the area. The local Chukchi people originally called the place "Valkyran", meaning a dugout of whale jaws. This is in reference to the remains of an ancient Inuit camp consisting of a number of homes dug into the soil and constructed of wood and the bones of the <span class="loc">Greenland</span> whale.</p>
