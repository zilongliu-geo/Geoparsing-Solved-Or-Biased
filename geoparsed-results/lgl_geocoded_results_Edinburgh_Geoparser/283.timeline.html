  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>School district officials discuss changed in school calendar. <span class="date">Last day</span> of school for <span class="loc">Laurel County</span> students scheduled for <span class="date">June 5</span>; graduation set <span class="date">June 6</span> if state approves <span class="date">The last day</span> of school for <span class="loc">Laurel County</span> School District students will be <span class="date">June 5</span> and graduation will be <span class="date">June 6</span>, pending approval from the <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> <span class="loc">Department of Education</span>. Director of Pupil Personnel <span class="per">Rhonda Welch</span> said the district will ask the <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> <span class="loc">Department of Education</span> to forgive one of its 13 missed school <span class="date">days</span> <span class="date">this year</span>, which will allow the <span class="date">June 5</span> end date. “We can apply for <span class="date">one day</span>,” <span class="per">Welch</span> said. “The lady at <span class="org">KDE</span> said the same thing.” The rest of the missed <span class="date">days</span> that were not covered under banked time will be made up. <span class="date">The last day</span> of school was originally scheduled for <span class="date">May 27</span>. <span class="per">Welch</span> said muddling through the details of House Bill 322, which allows districts to apply for missed <span class="date">days</span>, hasn’t been easy. “Developing the amended calendar <span class="date">this year</span> has been somewhat of an adventure,” she admitted. <span class="per">Welch</span> said the commissioner has <span class="date">10 days</span> to respond to the request. If it is denied, Superintendent <span class="per">David Young</span> said going to school on <span class="date">Memorial Day</span> is an option. “That’s the only day we can take,” he said. “If we did lose another day, it gives us another option, but still keep graduation <span class="date">June 6</span>.” Motion was approved by <span class="per">Joe Schenkenfelder</span>, seconded by Bud Stuber and unanimously approved. Following the motion, <span class="org">Hacker Brothers</span> Construction Manager <span class="per">David Jackson</span> told School Board members Phase I of the North Laurel High School renovation — which involves replacing the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems <span class="date">this summer</span> — will be “severely affected” by the calendar change. Business Manager <span class="per">Jim Kennedy</span> said he would speak with <span class="per">Jackson</span> and <span class="per">Superintendent</span> <span class="per">David Young</span> to arrive at some type of arrangement. In other action, School Board members: Approved design development drawings for Phase II of North Laurel High School. The multi-million dollar renovations to the school will involve adding four classrooms to its northwest corner, upgrading bathrooms, fixing the roof, replacing the ceiling in the auditorium, fixing doors leading to the gym and enclosing the front canopy. Motion was made by <span class="per">Tommy Smith</span>, seconded by <span class="per">Eddie Jones</span> and unanimously approved. Authorized the sale of four buses after declaring a school bus surplus. “This is continuing to keep us on a rotation schedule to basically replace the fleet every <span class="date">14 years</span>,” <span class="per">Young</span> said. Motion was made by <span class="per">Schenkenfelder</span>, seconded by Stuber and unanimously approved.
