<p><span class="loc">Fala</span> (pronounced [ˈfaːla]) is a settlement on the <span class="loc">Drava River</span> in <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. The settlement on the left bank of the river belongs to the Municipality of <span class="loc">Selnica</span> ob Dravi and the remainder of the settlement on the right bank of the river belongs to the Municipality of Ruše. <span class="loc">Fala</span> was mentioned in written sources in 1245 as in domo Volmari (and as de <span class="loc">Valle</span> in 1279, <span class="loc">Vall</span> and <span class="loc">Valle</span> in 1289, and Fall in 1495). The name is of unclear origin, although the initial F- indicates a German origin. It could be derived from Old High German falo 'yellowish' (referring to soil or water color) or from valle 'trap' (referring to hunting activity). Derivation from Latin vallis 'valley' is unlikely because the area was not under Romance influence. The settlement was historically a property of <span class="loc">Fala</span> Castle, on the opposite side of the river. Notable people that were born or lived in <span class="loc">Fala</span> include: Miloš Štibler (1882–1969), social activist Alojz Šušmelj (1913–1942), painter <span class="loc">Fala</span>, <span class="loc">Selnica</span> ob Dravi on Geopedia</p>
