  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hamilton</span> is an inner northern suburb of the <span class="loc">City of Brisbane</span> in <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, lying on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Brisbane River</span> along <span class="loc">Hamilton Reach</span>. The area is hilly with views of the <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> central business district. At the <span class="date">2011</span> Australian census the suburb recorded a population of 4,721. In <span class="date">2013</span>, the suburb had the highest mean taxable income of any in <span class="loc">Queensland</span>. It is believed the first hotel in the district was built by the <span class="per">Gustavus Hamilton</span> (father of <span class="org">Messrs. F. G. Hamilton,</span> barrister, and <span class="per">R. Hamilton</span>, surveyor). Amongst the earlier lessees of the hotel was a <span class="per">Mrs. Warren</span>, who, by coincidence, married another <span class="per">Mr. Hamilton</span>, so that the hotel was occupied by different families of the name <span class="per">Hamilton</span>. The <span class="per">Hamilton</span> Hotel became an easy reference mark in the <span class="date">days</span> when buildings were few in the district, and its name was gradually applied to the whole district. In <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>'s early history, <span class="per">Hamilton</span> was the home to many aristocrats and clergy. This suburb is known for being an "old wealth" suburb compared to "new wealth" suburbs in <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> such as <span class="loc">Paddington</span>, <span class="loc">Toowong</span> and Indooroopilly. Many of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>'s iconic mansions are found in <span class="per">Hamilton</span>, mainly because the exclusive suburb boasts spectacular views of the entire central business district and other surrounding suburbs.</p><br><br>
