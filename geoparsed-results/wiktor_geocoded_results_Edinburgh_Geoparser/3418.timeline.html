  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sorrento</span> is a northern coastal suburb of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, the capital <span class="loc">city of Western Australia</span> in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Joondalup</span>. At its northwestern corner is the <span class="loc">Hillarys Boat Harbour</span>, built in <span class="date">the late 1980s</span>. A private subdivision of freehold land known as 'Sorrento' was surveyed here in <span class="date">1929</span>. It is assumed that the name was taken from the Italian seaside town of <span class="loc">Sorrento</span> which is located south of <span class="loc">Naples</span> opposite the <span class="loc">Isle of Capri</span>. Prior to white settlement, the Whadjuk Aboriginal people, who called the area Mooro, gathered abalone and other shellfish in large numbers off the nearby reefs. The first European to settle in the area was <span class="per">Patrick Marmion</span>, master whaler, who operated a whaling station in the area in <span class="date">1849</span>. There are still some remains of the old whaling station at the present-day Surf Lifesaving Club site, and a monument to <span class="per">Marmion</span> can be found in <span class="loc">Geneff</span> Park in Padbury Circle. The area was popular with fishermen in <span class="date">the 1930s</span>, and numerous boatsheds and shacks were built there. Residential settlement commenced in <span class="date">the early 1950s</span> and until <span class="date">1981</span>, it was part of the suburb of <span class="per">Marmion</span>.</p><br><br>
