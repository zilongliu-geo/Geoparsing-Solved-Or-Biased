  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Jamestown</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Russell County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the seat of its county. The population was 1,624 at the <span class="date">2000</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> is located at 36°59′5″N 85°4′1″W (36.984730, -85.066840). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.2 square miles (5.7 km2), all land. The community was established in <span class="date">1826</span> to be the seat of the newly formed <span class="loc">Russell County</span>. It was briefly known as <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span> in honor of General <span class="per">Andrew Jackson</span>, who had just won a plurality of the popular vote during the <span class="date">1824</span> presidential election but lost the runoff in the <span class="org">House of Representatives</span>, largely because of the "corrupt bargain" struck by <span class="loc">Henry Clay</span> and <span class="per">John Quincy Adams</span>. However, an anti-Jacksonian party loyal to Clay came into power the same year and the post office was established in <span class="date">November</span> as <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> after local landowner <span class="per">James Wooldridge</span>, who (together with his brother <span class="per">John</span>) had donated 110 acres of land for the town. The act of the state legislature incorporating the city in <span class="date">December</span> continued this name, which the city has used since.</p><br><br>
