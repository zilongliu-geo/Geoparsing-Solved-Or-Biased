<p><span class="loc">San Jose</span> is a fourth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 38,523 people. It is located at the southern part of the province approximately 520 km. south of <span class="loc">Metro Manila</span>. It also has a distance of about 55 km. from <span class="loc">Naga City</span> and 45 km. away from the town of Pili, the capital town of the province. The history of the town of <span class="loc">San Jose</span> dates back to 1601 when this town was a barrio of <span class="loc">Lagonoy</span> under the name <span class="loc">Danlog</span>. The old Parish Priest of <span class="loc">Lagonoy</span>, Fr. Salvador Mendoza, decided to build a church in a place called "Cabayawasan" because of the presence of so many guava trees in the area. The construction of the church began in 1818. It was a cooperative effort of the people of <span class="loc">Lagonoy</span> who worked on the northern part and the people of <span class="loc">Danlog</span> on the southern part. Most of the materials and labor were either free or as payment for weddings and baptism. In 1813, the town of <span class="loc">San Jose</span> was officially established under the name "Patrocinio" derived from the word "Patron", meaning model. Then it was changed to <span class="loc">Patrocinio</span> de <span class="loc">San Jose</span> in honor of its Patron Saint, <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> the Patriarch. Later in 1883, it was shortened to "<span class="loc">San Jose</span>" which is now the official name. Its founders were Fr. Salvador Mendoza, then the Parish Priest of <span class="loc">San Jose</span> and Don Macario Agustin, the first Captain Municipal of the town.</p>
