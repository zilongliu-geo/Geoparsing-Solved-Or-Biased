  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Controversial pastor picked for <span class="per">Mansfield</span> patrol program. By <span class="per">Vickie Welborn</span> vwelborn@gannett.com <span class="loc">Gannett</span> <span class="date">March 24, 2009</span> <span class="per">MANSFIELD</span> -- <span class="per">Mansfield Mayor Curtis McCoy</span> wants to start a pastor on patrol program for the <span class="org">Mansfield Police Department</span> and he's selected as his first candidate a self-described minister with a controversial past that includes time spent on the other side of the jail bars and troubles with the court system. The Rev. <span class="per">Roy Jones</span>' most recent job was a convenience store clerk for which he had to obtain an alcoholic beverage control card so that he could sell alcoholic beverages. "This is something I'm trying to do to make a better relationship between the police and the citizens," <span class="per">McCoy</span> said of <span class="per">Jones</span>' appointment. Unlike a similar program run by the <span class="org">Shreveport Police Department</span> where ministers volunteer their time to ride on patrol with officers, <span class="per">Mansfield</span>'s Pastor on Patrol won't depend upon volunteers - or at this point anyone beyond <span class="per">Jones</span>. <span class="per">Jones</span> will be paid $9 an hour and work 24 hours <span class="date">a week</span>. Asked why he didn't use Shreveport's program as a model, <span class="per">McCoy</span> answered, "I don't know what <span class="loc">Shreveport</span> does nor do I care to know what <span class="loc">Shreveport</span> does on that line. I only know what <span class="per">Mansfield</span> is doing. "<span class="per">McCoy</span> would not comment on <span class="per">Jones</span>' checkered past or his ability to remain unbiased in situations involving the police and citizenry since he is on the city's payroll. "Based on his relationship in the community as far as knowing people, every time I go to church, I see him in a pulpit - I'm serious. I'm talking the honest God truth. &amp; If he's not pastoring, he's there as a guest. But he knows the people in the community, and I think over the <span class="date">years</span> he has proven himself to be an asset. "Part-time employees can work <span class="date">six months</span> before being presented to the <span class="org">Board of Aldermen</span>. That's why <span class="per">Jones</span>' official appointment was news to two <span class="per">Mansfield</span> aldermen. <span class="per">Mitch Lewis</span> and G.B. "Sonny" Hall were unaware of <span class="per">Jones</span>' addition to the payroll. <span class="per">Lewis</span> admitted that he was questioned over <span class="date">the weekend</span> about <span class="per">Jones</span> being seen <span class="date">last week</span> in a patrol car with a police officer. "I talked to <span class="per">Roy</span> <span class="date">today</span> (at the council meeting)," <span class="per">Lewis</span> said <span class="date">Monday night</span>. "He said yes he was doing it, but he didn't go into it. He said he was pastor on patrol. He said he was trying to get involved with the youth on <span class="date">the weekend</span> and stuff like, which I think is good, but &amp; I don't know. I think (<span class="per">McCoy</span>'s) intentions were good to try to set up that type of program. "<span class="loc">Added</span> Hall: "Most true pastors volunteer their time to do that. "<span class="per">Jones</span>, who was unseated in <span class="date">October 2007</span> from his first term on the <span class="loc">DeSoto Parish</span> Police Jury, is a close friend of <span class="per">McCoy</span>'s. He's aided the mayor in his two election campaigns and frequently accompanies him to functions. <span class="per">Jones</span> did not return a message left on his answering machine <span class="date">Monday</span>. <span class="per">Jones</span> grabbed his own headlines while on the parish governing body. He was consistently involved in employee issues and public criticism of the road department supervisor, including filing complaints with the state attorney general's office that were later deemed unfounded. The <span class="per">Mansfield</span> resident got his own hand slapped in <span class="date">2005</span> when the district attorney ordered him to reimburse the parish $175 for gravel he directed onto a private driveway. He has prior arrests for trespassing, issuing worthless checks, failure to appear in court for criminal neglect of family and for failing to report to court on issuing worthless check charges. While he spent time in the DeSoto Detention Center for his arrests, <span class="per">Jones</span> has avoided jail sentences by paying off the insufficient funds and the late child support payments. <span class="per">McCoy</span> said he would later evaluate the program and add a "white minister, too, because we want everyone to have someone they can talk to." <span class="per">Jones</span> is black.</p><br><br>
