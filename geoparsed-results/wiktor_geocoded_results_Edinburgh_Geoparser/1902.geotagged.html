<p><span class="loc">Lakewood</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 80,048 at the 2010 census. It is bordered by Long Beach on the west and south, Bellflower on the north, <span class="loc">Cerritos</span> on the northeast, Cypress on the east, and Hawaiian Gardens on the southeast. Major thoroughfares include <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> (SR 19), Bellflower, and Del Amo Boulevards and Carson and South Streets. The San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605) runs through the city's eastern regions. Sometimes called "an instant city" because of its origins—going from lima bean fields in 1950 to a well-developed city by 1960—Lakewood is a classic example of a post–World War II American suburb. <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> is a planned, post-World War II community. Developers Louis Boyar, Mark Taper and Ben Weingart are credited with "altering forever the map of Southern <span class="loc">California</span>." Begun in late 1949, the completion of the developers' plan in 1953 helped in the transformation of mass-produced housing from its early phases in the 1930s and 1940s to the reality of the 1950s. The feel of this transformation from the point of view of a resident growing up in <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> was captured by D. J. Waldie in his award-winning memoir, Holy Land: A Suburban Memoir.</p>
