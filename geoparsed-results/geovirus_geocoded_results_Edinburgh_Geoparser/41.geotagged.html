<p>Health officials in the <span class="loc">Gaza Strip</span> confirmed the territory's first five cases of H1N1 swine flu earlier today. The territory's Health Ministry is working with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to obtain the supplies needed to treat the potentially deadly virus. Neighbouring <span class="loc">Israel</span> has a blockade on <span class="loc">Gaza</span>, and <span class="loc">Egypt</span> restricts movement across its border with the territory as well. Health officials say that isolation likely kept the H1N1 virus from affecting <span class="loc">Gaza</span> sooner. Mahmoud Daher, a senior official for the WHO, said that <span class="loc">Gaza</span> has around 1,000 vaccine doses for the 8,000 medical workers in the territory. <span class="loc">West</span> Bank Health Ministry official Asad Ramlawi, however, commented that an additional one million doses would be delivered to the area at the end of the year.</p>
