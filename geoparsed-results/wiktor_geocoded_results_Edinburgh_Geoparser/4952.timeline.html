  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cabo Blanco</span> is a fishing village in northwestern <span class="loc">Peru</span>, 3 km northwest from <span class="loc">El Alto</span>, <span class="loc">Talara</span>, <span class="loc">Piura</span>. It was famous in <span class="date">the past</span> among big-game fishermen and <span class="date">today</span> is a noted surf break. The village takes its name from the light coloured nearby mountains. In <span class="date">the 1950s and 1960s</span>, fishermen traveled to <span class="loc">Cabo Blanco</span> to hunt big marlin. <span class="per">Ernest Hemingway</span> stayed more than <span class="date">a month</span> at the famous "<span class="org">Cabo Blanco Fishing Club</span>" and caught a 700 pound marlin while filming the motion picture based on his novel, The <span class="loc">Old Man</span> and the Sea. In <span class="date">1953</span>, <span class="per">Alfred Glassell Jr.</span> caught the IGFA all tackle world record black marlin, weighing 1560 pounds. In <span class="date">1979</span>, Peruvian surfer Gordo Barreda discovered the wave when he visited the village to check the surf in the area. The wave is a hollow powerful left and is reckoned the "Peruvian Pipeline", referring to the <span class="loc">Banzai Pipeline</span> in <span class="loc">Hawaii</span>. Swell from <span class="loc">Hawaii</span> does in fact go on to reach <span class="loc">Peru</span>; in <span class="date">the 1990s</span> the best way to get a surf forecast was to phone <span class="loc">Hawaii</span> and whatever swell they had would arrive <span class="date">about 5 days later</span>.</p><br><br>
