The population was 737 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census.

The town was originally named <span class="per">Rhodes</span> for general store owner <span class="per">W. R. Rhodes</span> and postmaster <span class="per">H. R. Rhodes</span>, but about <span class="date">1885</span> it was renamed for Edmund L. Burke, a railroad employee who directed the railroad survey.
