<p><span class="loc">Norwood</span> is the second most populous city in <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and an enclave of the larger <span class="loc">city of Cincinnati</span>. The population was 19,207 at the 2010 census. Originally settled as an early suburb of <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span> in the wooded countryside north of the city, the area is characterized by older homes and tree-lined streets. The earliest humans in the area now known as <span class="loc">Norwood</span> are believed to have been Pre-Columbian era people of the <span class="loc">Adena</span> culture. Norwood Mound, a prehistoric earthwork mound built by the <span class="loc">Adena</span>, is located in <span class="loc">Norwood</span> and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The <span class="loc">Adena</span> constructed the mound at the location of Norwood's present-day Water Tower Park, which is the highest land elevation in the city and one of the highest in all of <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>. Archaeologists believe the mound was built at this site due to the high elevation and was used by the <span class="loc">Adena</span> for religious ceremonies and smoke signaling. Native American mounds are not uncommon in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and several were located in Downtown Cincinnati at the time of arrival of the first white settlers. However by 1895, the Norwood Mound was the only remaining mound in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>." The mound has never been excavated, but it is reported that many artifacts found in the area by early <span class="loc">Norwood</span> settlers in the 1800s made up the original nucleus of the Native American Art Collection of the <span class="loc">Cincinnati Art Museum</span>. In the early-20th century, Norwood High School named their sports team mascot the Indians in honor of this local Native American heritage.</p>
