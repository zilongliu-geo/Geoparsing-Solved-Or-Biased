  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Belmont</span> is a suburb in the Hunter Region of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, located 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Newcastle's central business district on the eastern side of <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span> and is part of the City of <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span>. <span class="loc">Belmont</span> is situated on a sandy peninsula formed by the <span class="loc">Tasman Sea</span> on the east and <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span>. The area around <span class="loc">Belmont</span> was inhabited by the <span class="org">Awabakal People</span>. Traces of middens of shellfish, axe grinding grooves and place names can still be seen here. In <span class="date">1825</span> Reverend <span class="per">Lancelot Edward Threlkeld</span> established a mission at <span class="loc">Belmont</span>. He established small scale farming of wheat and Indian Corn and employed the local Aboriginal people to help him. While doing so, <span class="per">Threlkeld</span> recorded the language of the Awabakal and produced the first serious works on Aboriginal language, its grammar, usage, and relation to other Aboriginal languages. The mission closed after <span class="date">a few years</span> and <span class="per">Threlkeld</span> moved to the Western side of <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span>. <span class="per">Thomas Williamson</span> [ <span class="date">1833</span> - 80 ] was born in the northernmost island of <span class="loc">Unst</span>, <span class="loc">Shetland Islands</span> in a town called <span class="loc">Belmont</span>. He was the third settler in the <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span> area and in <span class="date">1865</span> selected 100 acres, including Bahtahbah [ site of <span class="per">Rev. Threlkeld</span>'s old Aboriginal mission ] to settle. On the top of the hill, corner of <span class="per">Walter</span> and <span class="per">Victoria</span> Streets [ and what became, <span class="date">many years later</span> the Infants School ] he built a large residence to serve as a guest house, naming it after the town of his birth " <span class="loc">Belmont</span>" House. It is thought the village which grew up around it may have assumed the name from the house. As the village grew, some of the streets were named after his children: <span class="per">Ada St</span> leads down to the yacht club, <span class="per">Maude St</span> comes from Cahill Oval down to the water at the baths. <span class="per">Walter St</span> would have come right past the old <span class="loc">Belmont</span> house whilst Alick [ named for Alexander ] and <span class="per">Ernest Sts</span> marked the eastern boundary of the original acreage. <span class="per">Thomas St</span>, outside the shopping centre, is named after <span class="per">Thomas Williamson</span> himself. On the eastern side of the old house <span class="per">Williamson</span> planted a vineyard, facing towards the lagoon, and to the north an orchard including banana trees.</p><br><br>
