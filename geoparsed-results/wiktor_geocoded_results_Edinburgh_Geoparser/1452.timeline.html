  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> State of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> and is the county seat of <span class="loc">Olmsted County</span>. Located on the <span class="loc">Zumbro River</span>'s south fork, the city has a population of 106,769 according to the <span class="date">2010</span> United States Census. The <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> estimated that the <span class="date">2014</span> population was 111,402. It is <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>'s third-largest city and the largest city located outside of the Minneapolis-St. <span class="loc">Paul-Bloomington Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. As of <span class="date">2013</span>, the <span class="loc">Rochester</span> metropolitan area has a population of 211,853. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was platted in <span class="date">1855</span>. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> developed as a stagecoach stop between <span class="loc">Saint Paul</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, and <span class="loc">Dubuque</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. When the railroad arrived in the 1860s, it brought new residents and business opportunities. In <span class="date">1863</span>, <span class="per">Dr. William W. Mayo</span> arrived as the examining surgeon for draftees in the Civil War. The community was named after <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. On <span class="date">August 21, 1883</span>, the Great Tornado demolished much of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, leaving 37 dead and about 200 injured. As there was no medical facility at the time, <span class="per">Mayo</span> and his two sons worked together to care for the wounded. Donations of $60,000 were collected and the Sisters of <span class="per">St. Francis</span>, assisted by <span class="per">Mayo</span>, opened a new facility named St. <span class="org">Marys Hospital</span> in <span class="date">1889</span>. The <span class="per">Mayo</span> practice grew and is <span class="date">today</span> among the largest and most well-respected medical facilities in the world. Many famous people from around the world, including former Presidents George H. W. Bush, <span class="per">Gerald Ford</span>, and <span class="per">Ronald Reagan</span>, have visited <span class="loc">Rochester</span> as patients of the <span class="loc">Mayo Clinic</span>. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> has also been hit by two F4 tornadoes since <span class="date">1950</span> (the first on <span class="date">May 10, 1953</span> and the other on <span class="date">September 16, 1962</span>.)</p><br><br>
