<p><span class="loc">Windsor</span> is a small historic unincorporated community located within Robbinsville Township (known as Washington Township until 2007) in <span class="loc">Mercer County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The area is served as <span class="loc">United States</span> Postal Service ZIP Code 08561. There are approximately 50 homes in the area, and as of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the population for ZIP Code Tabulation Area 08561 was 226. The community, covering 570 acres (230 ha), was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Earliest mention of the local area in the 17th century refers to it as a wilderness with several Native American camps. Founded in 1818, it was named <span class="loc">Centerville</span> because it was the geographical center of the state. Until then, adjacent heavily wooded lands were called Magrilla (origins unknown). In 1814, after the completion of the <span class="loc">Bordentown</span> and <span class="loc">South Amboy</span> stagecoach turnpike, William McKnight, director of the turnpike company, built a tavern at the intersection of the turnpike and present-day Windsor-Perrineville Road. A major thruway between <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>, the turnpike replaced Old York Road, which started out as a Native-American path prior to European settlement. In 1816 the local section of the stagecoach turnpike between <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> ran along Main Street. In late 1831, the <span class="loc">Camden</span> and Amboy Railroad was constructed through <span class="loc">Centerville</span>. The village became a stopover for rail travelers, and a thriving center for the bountiful farms and mills which serviced the growing population. It quickly became the largest village between <span class="loc">Yardville</span> (Sand Town) and <span class="loc">Hightstown</span>, and was renamed "Windsor" in 1846 to avoid any confusion with a Centerville post office in <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>.</p>
