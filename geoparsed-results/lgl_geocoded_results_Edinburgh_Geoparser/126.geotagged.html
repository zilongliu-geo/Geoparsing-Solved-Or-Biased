<p>Atlantic Beachto host Bikefest. ATLANTIC BEACH â€” Officials in a coastal <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> town have decided to host an annual biker rally, but they will impose new restrictions this year. The Sun News of Myrtle Beach reported that Atlantic Beach officials decided Saturday night to host the 29th annual Bikefest, ending three weeks of uncertainty. Officials said discussions with Myrtle Beach, <span class="loc">Horry County</span> and North Myrtle Beach about the Bikefest's future will continue. But for the Memorial Day weekend, vendor fees were raised an average of $500 each, to $1,000 for retail, $1,500 for food and $3,000 for alcohol. Property owners who want to allow vendors on their lots must pay the town a $200 permit fee, which is double the price of last year's fee.</p>
