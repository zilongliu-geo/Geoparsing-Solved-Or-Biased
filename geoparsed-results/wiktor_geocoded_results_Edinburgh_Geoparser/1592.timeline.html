  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newton</span> is the county seat and most populous city in <span class="loc">Jasper County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located 30 mi (48 km) miles <span class="loc">east of Des Moines</span>, <span class="loc">Newton</span>, is in Central <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 15,254. It is the home of <span class="loc">Iowa Speedway</span>, <span class="loc">Maytag Dairy Farms</span>, and the <span class="loc">Iowa Sculpture Festival</span>. <span class="loc">Newton</span> was founded in <span class="date">1850</span> and incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1857</span>. In the late 19th century, <span class="loc">Newton</span>'s growth was fueled by the development of coal mines in the region. The first significant mine in the area was the Couch mine of the <span class="org">Jasper County Coal and Railway Company</span>, opened in the 1870s. It was, for a while, the largest mine in the county, producing 70 tons per day. William Snooks opened a mine near <span class="loc">Newton</span> in <span class="date">1886</span>. In the early 20th century, large scale mining in the <span class="loc">Newton</span> area had declined, but there were still several mines in the area that were worked intermittently. In the 20th century, <span class="loc">Newton</span> was a manufacturing community, much of its growth derived from the washing machine industry. Its most distinctive landmark, the <span class="loc">Jasper County</span> Courthouse, was built in <span class="date">1911</span>.</p><br><br>
