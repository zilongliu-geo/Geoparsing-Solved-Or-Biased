  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Ignacio</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Elena</span> are towns in western <span class="loc">Belize</span>. <span class="loc">San Ignacio</span> serves as the cultural-economic hub of <span class="loc">Cayo District</span>. It got its start from Mahogany and chicle production during British colonialism. Over time it attracted people from the surrounding areas, which led to the diverse population of the town <span class="date">today</span>. <span class="loc">San Ignacio</span> is the largest settlement in <span class="loc">Cayo District</span> and the second largest in the country, after <span class="loc">Belize City</span>. The town was originally named <span class="loc">El Cayo</span> by the Spanish. On <span class="date">October 19, 1904</span>, <span class="loc">El Cayo</span> was officially declared a town by the government of <span class="loc">British Honduras</span>. In <span class="date">the past</span> a creek ran between the <span class="loc">Macal</span> and the <span class="loc">Mopan</span> rivers one mile outside of <span class="loc">San Ignacio</span> going toward <span class="loc">Benque Viejo</span>. This creek then fulfilled the definition of an area of land completely surrounded by water and thus the name <span class="loc">Cayo</span>, "island". There was a large wooden bridge across this creek in <span class="date">the late 1940s</span>, but since the creek eventually dried up, the area was filled with limestone gravel and <span class="date">today</span> there remains no evidence of its existence. The demise of the creek, however, took away the distinction for the classification of a 'cayo' from the venerable western town of '<span class="loc">El Cayo</span>' and returned it to a regular land mass.</p><br><br>
