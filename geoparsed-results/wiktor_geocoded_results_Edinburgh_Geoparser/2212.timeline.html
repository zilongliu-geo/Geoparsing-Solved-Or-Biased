  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kostroma</span> (Russian: Кострома; IPA: [kəstrɐˈma]) is a historic city and the administrative center of <span class="loc">Kostroma Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>. A part of the <span class="loc">Golden Ring</span> of Russian towns, it is located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Volga</span> and <span class="loc">Kostroma Rivers</span>. Population: 268,742 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census); 278,750 (<span class="date">2002</span> Census); 278,414 (<span class="date">1989</span> Census). The city was first recorded in the chronicles for the <span class="date">year 1213</span>, but historians believe it could have been founded by Yury Dolgoruky more than half <span class="date">a century earlier</span>, in <span class="date">1152</span>. Like other towns of the <span class="loc">Eastern Rus</span>, <span class="loc">Kostroma</span> was sacked by the Mongols in <span class="date">1238</span>. It then constituted a small principality, under leadership of <span class="per">Prince Vasily</span> the Drunkard, a younger brother of the famous <span class="per">Alexander Nevsky</span>. Upon inheriting the grand ducal title in <span class="date">1271</span>, Vasily didn't leave the town for <span class="loc">Vladimir</span>, and his descendants ruled <span class="loc">Kostroma</span> for another half <span class="date">a century</span>, until the town was bought by <span class="per">Ivan I</span> of <span class="loc">Moscow</span>. As one of the northernmost towns of the Grand Duchy of <span class="loc">Moscow</span>, <span class="loc">Kostroma</span> served for grand dukes as a place of retreat when enemies besieged <span class="loc">Moscow</span> in <span class="date">1382</span>, <span class="date">1408</span>, and <span class="date">1433</span>. In <span class="date">1375</span>, the town was looted by Novgorod pirates (ushkuiniks). The spectacular growth of the city in the 16th century may be attributed to the establishment of trade connections with English and Dutch merchants (<span class="org">Muscovy Company</span>) through the northern port of Archangel. <span class="per">Boris Godunov</span> had the Ipatiev and <span class="date">Epiphany</span> monasteries rebuilt in stone. The construction works were finished just in time for the city to witness some of the most dramatic events of <span class="org">the Time of Troubles</span>.</p><br><br>
