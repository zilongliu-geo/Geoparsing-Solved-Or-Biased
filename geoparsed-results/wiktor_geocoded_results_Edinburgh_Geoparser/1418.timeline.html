The population was 5,421 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is most famous for being the hometown of the <span class="org">Shelton Brothers</span> Gang, notorious bootleggers who fought it out with the <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> based <span class="per">Birger Gang</span> to control criminal activities in Southern <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. During the first half of the 20th century gang leaders <span class="per">Carl, Earl</span> and <span class="per">Bernie Shelton</span> made <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> a household name. Based on testimony of <span class="per">Charlie Birger</span> himself, the <span class="org">Shelton Brothers</span> were convicted for a <span class="date">1925</span> unsolved mail carrier robbery of $15,000 and were sentenced to <span class="date">25 years</span>. They were released <span class="date">a few years later</span>. <span class="per">Birger</span> dominated bootlegging in Southern <span class="loc">Illinois</span> until he himself was hanged in <span class="loc">Benton</span>. for the murder of West City Mayor <span class="per">Joe Adams</span> in <span class="date">1928</span>. After serving their time, the <span class="org">Shelton brothers</span> built a new criminal empire. Based out of East <span class="per">St Louis</span>, one of the most prosperous cities of its day, they controlled all vice from <span class="loc">Peoria</span> and southward. They met their demise at the hands of the Chicago mob and an insider Charles "Blackie" <span class="loc">Harris</span>. A land dispute led to <span class="loc">Blackie</span> joining forces with the Mob to kill off members of the <span class="per">Shelton</span> gang. His most notable victim was <span class="per">Carl Shelton</span>, the leader. He was ambushed several miles south east of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, shot from his <span class="org">Jeep</span>. <span class="per">Bernie</span> was killed at his Peoria roadhouse. <span class="per">Earl</span> moved to <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span> and became a successful land speculator.</p><br><br>
