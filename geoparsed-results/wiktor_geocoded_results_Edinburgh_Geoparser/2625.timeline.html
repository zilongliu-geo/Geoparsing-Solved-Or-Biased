The <span class="loc">Wolli</span> Creek waterway also empties into the <span class="loc">Cooks River</span> near <span class="loc">Tempe</span>. <span class="loc">Tempe</span> was named after the mansion on the southern banks of the <span class="loc">Cooks River</span> in the area that is <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Wolli</span> Creek. <span class="per">Alexander Brodie Spark</span> (<span class="date">1792</span>–<span class="date">1856</span>), an immigrant from <span class="loc">Elgin</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, built <span class="org">Tempe House</span> in <span class="date">1836</span>.
