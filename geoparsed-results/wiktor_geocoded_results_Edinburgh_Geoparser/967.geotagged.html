<p>Columbus is the second largest city and county seat of <span class="loc">Cherokee County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, 15 miles south-southwest of <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 3,312. The first settlement was made at Columbus in 1868. The first post office in Columbus was established in 1869. Columbus was a railroad junction for the <span class="loc">Saint Louis</span> and <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>, and the <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, and <span class="loc">Texas</span> railroads. It was named Columbus by A.L. Peters, one of the European-American founders, for his hometown of <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>; the name thus indirectly honors Christopher Columbus, the explorer. Coal, lead and zinc were mined in the region. Columbus had a considerable trade in agricultural products, and its businesses included machine shops, grain elevators, flour mills, a cigar factory, bottle works (soft drinks), a canning factory, and an extensive brick-making plant. In 1875, Robert A. Long and Victor Bell formed the Long-Bell Lumber Company in Columbus. From one lumberyard, Long-Bell expanded operations and holdings to become one of the largest vertically integrated lumber companies in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In 1956 it was purchased by International Paper.</p>
