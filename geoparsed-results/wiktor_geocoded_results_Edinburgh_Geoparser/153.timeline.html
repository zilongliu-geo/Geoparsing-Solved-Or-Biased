  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Juan</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Lapog</span>) is a third class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 25,199 people. Because it produces most of the goods made of buri leaf in the province, it is sometimes called the <span class="org">Buri Capital</span> of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Lapog</span> was established in <span class="date">1772</span>. The name of the municipality has gone through a series of changes. The early settlers and occupants called it "Lapo", short for "Lapo-Lapo", a tall grass which grew everywhere in the area. In the <span class="date">year 1772</span>, <span class="per">Don Tomas Aquino</span>, the first local leader, initiated the organization of the scattered communities into one, calling the place "Lapog", a derivative of local vernacular "Lap-Lapog" which means unirrigated land. For <span class="date">189 years</span>, "Lapog" remained in the records as the official name of the town until <span class="date">June 18, 1961</span>, Republic Act No. 3386 was enacted and it was renamed to <span class="loc">San Juan</span>. Since most of the inhabitants were of the belief that religious names bring peace, happiness, and prosperity, the town was renamed "<span class="loc">San Juan</span>", after the name of its patron saint, <span class="loc">Saint John</span> the <span class="loc">Baptist</span>.</p><br><br>
