<p>James Brown, often referred to as the Godfather of Soul, died in <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> due to congestive heart failure, combined with pneumonia. His death at age 73 was announced by his agent. After his dentist noticed something unusual with him, Brown was told to visit a doctor immediately. He was taken into the hospital yesterday for treatment of his pneumonia until his death at around 1:45 AM (6:45 AM GMT). It is not known whether he received a pneumonia vaccination, as recommended for people of his age. He was born in 1933 and grew up in poverty until he formed James Brown &amp; The Famous Flames. His influence on 20th century music, from funk to hip hop was profound. Before he died, he scheduled a New Year's Eve concert series in <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span> that would help kick off a 2007 tour.</p>
