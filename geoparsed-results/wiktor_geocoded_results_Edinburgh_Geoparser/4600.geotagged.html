<p><span class="loc">Bradford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Merrimack County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,650 at the 2010 census. The main village of the town, where 356 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Bradford</span> census-designated place (CDP), and is located west of the junction of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> routes 103 and 114. The town also includes the villages of Bradford Center and Melvin Mills.

William Presbury and family. Three years later other settlers arrived, several of them from <span class="loc">Bradford</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, after which the town was named <span class="loc">New Bradford</span>. Later, it was called <span class="loc">Bradfordton</span>, but upon incorporation by the General Court on September 27, 1787, it was officially named <span class="loc">Bradford</span>. Parts of the town are hilly, but the largest portion is in a valley with varied soil. Streams provided water power for watermills.

In 1850, the Concord &amp; Claremont Railroad opened from Concord to <span class="loc">Bradford</span>, which would remain its terminus until the line was extended to <span class="loc">Claremont</span> in 1871-1872.</p>
