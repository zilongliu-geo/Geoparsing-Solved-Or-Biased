  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Greer</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> . The city offers beautiful scenery with vistas that include both mountains and lakes. Families and young professionals have also discovered the city's first- rate services, outstanding park facilities and recreation programs, and big- city amenities while preserving a small- town feel. Spanning more than 20 square miles, <span class="loc">Greer</span>'s city limits to the north offer outdoor recreation at <span class="loc">Lake Robinson</span>, <span class="loc">Lake Cunningham</span>, and <span class="loc">Apalache Lake</span>, while the city's southern boundary includes a major transportation corridor with Interstate 85 and the <span class="loc">Greenville</span>- <span class="org">Spartanburg International Airport</span>. Downtown <span class="loc">Greer</span>, known locally as <span class="loc">Greer</span> Station, has become a destination in itself with approximately 12 square blocks of retail, dining, entertainment, and professional service organizations. <span class="loc">Greer</span> Station has more than 40 buildings on the National Historic Register. <span class="loc">Greer</span> Station took on a new look in <span class="date">2008</span> as new municipal facilities opened to serve the public. A two- story Police and Court Complex anchors the west boundary of <span class="loc">Greer</span> Station, while the new three- story <span class="loc">Greer City</span> Hall and 12- acre City Park are just two blocks to the east. City Hall includes an entire floor dedicated to public space, with a 4,500- square- foot events hall available for conventions, receptions, and galas. Just steps from the events hall, City Park includes a large fountain timed to music, an amphitheater for public concerts and ceremonies, walking trails, a picnic shelter, a pond, and ample green space for family fun. The city's events staff keeps City Park the center of recreation in <span class="loc">Greer</span>, planning concerts and family festivals throughout the year. The 2009 Fourth of <span class="date">July</span> Celebration at City Park <span class="date">July 4- 5</span> will offer <span class="date">a weekend</span> of music and fireworks not to be missed. Highway 29 extends from <span class="loc">Greenville</span> to <span class="loc">Spartanburg</span> and passes just north of <span class="loc">Greer</span>'s main business district. However, you will find nearly anything you may want on that stretch of highway in <span class="loc">Greer</span>. From fast food or fine dining to charming boutiques and chain department stores, it is a vibrant commercial corridor in the city. Home to the nation's only <span class="org">BMW</span> manufacturing plant, which offers public tours departing from an informative visitor's center, <span class="loc">Greer</span> also has been home to the <span class="loc">Michelin</span> <span class="loc">North America</span> main headquarters for almost a quarter of <span class="date">a century</span>.</p><br><br>
