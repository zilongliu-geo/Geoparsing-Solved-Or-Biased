  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Local health care providers banding together to help poor, uninsured. In the <span class="date">years</span> that area health care leaders have struggled with how to care for the uninsured -- while limiting unnecessary use of hospital emergency rooms -- the problems have only gotten worse. The <span class="date">2008</span> economic downturn rendered many jobless, without insurance and without the extra cash for medical care. Without coverage for routine doctor visits, the uninsured often wait to seek preventive care and medical treatment until they're very sick, requiring costlier care in ERs. Others use ERs as their source for primary care but can't pay the bill. Hospitals make up that uncompensated care in other areas by charging more or eliminating some services. Here's a local snapshot. - <span class="loc">Springfield</span> hospital emergency room visits by uninsured <span class="loc">Greene County</span> residents grew from 17,709 visits in <span class="date">2003</span> to 33,760 visits in <span class="date">2007</span>, the latest compiled data available. - The most common reasons for those ER visits by the uninsured were dental pain, dental/respiratory complaints, respiratory/lumbar, throat problems, alcohol/neck sprain/respiratory, and ear complaints. - The Kitchen Clinic saw 2,000 patients in <span class="date">2008</span>, or 8,000 patient visits, and turns away hundreds of people every month for lack of providers. It gave more than 47,000 free prescriptions, up from 42,000 <span class="date">the year before</span>. - CoxHealth system provided $33.5 million in bad debt and charity care in fiscal <span class="date">year 2003</span>, $64.3 million in <span class="date">2006</span>, and by <span class="date">2007</span> it increased to $93.6 million. In <span class="date">2008</span> it rose by another 13 percent, to $105.9 million. (Calculation for charity and bad debt is based on write-offs from patient charges.) The combined emergency department and urgent care visits for Cox North, South and Walnut Lawn rose from 145,000 in fiscal <span class="date">year 2007</span> to 151,000 in fiscal <span class="date">year 2008</span>. The Cox ERs, alone, saw 104,000 patients in <span class="date">2008</span>. -St. <span class="org">John's Health System</span> write-offs for bad debts and charity combined was $93.4 million in fiscal <span class="date">year 2006</span>, $117.6 million in fiscal <span class="date">year 2007</span>, and totaled $144.1 million in fiscal <span class="date">year 2008</span>. (This increase is due to an increase in the number of uninsured patients and an increase in the number of insured patients who have not met the patient portion of their co-payments and deductibles.) One out of every five patients who visit the ER does not carry insurance. St. <span class="per">John</span>'s ER visits totaled 87,600 in fiscal <span class="date">year 2008</span>, representing a 3.6 percent increase over the fiscal <span class="date">year 2007</span> ER visits of 84,500. Source: <span class="loc">Springfield</span> hospitals, <span class="org">Springfield-Greene County Health Department</span> "We all provide a significant amount of coverage for the indigent ..." said <span class="per">Kim Day</span>, president and CEO of St. <span class="per">John</span>'s Health System and a commission member. " ... The economic times, combined with the fact that funding to safety-net providers is drying up, has frankly caused us to work harder, together." "The commission's public-private partnership with the community is not a substitute for state or national reform," <span class="per">Day</span> said, "but we hope our efforts will increase access to health care services for vulnerable people, improving health outcomes in an unhealthy state and region, and reduce costs in the long run." It's patterned after the successful <span class="per">St. Louis</span> Regional Health Commission, recognized nationally for helping coordinate existing services and money to boost primary care and dental visits among the city's working poor. It's one of about 10 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> city initiatives having success increasing access, reducing chronic health problems and cutting their hospitals' charitable care load, <span class="loc">Bradshaw</span> said. A board is spearheading the commission, including Day, <span class="loc">Edwards</span>, <span class="loc">Gipson</span> and <span class="per">Miller, Brian</span> Fogle with The <span class="org">Kitchen Inc.</span>, <span class="per">John Lilly</span> with the <span class="org">Greene County Medical Society</span>, and <span class="per">Paul Taylor</span>, CEO of <span class="org">Ozarks Community Hospital</span> (formerly Doctors Hospital of <span class="loc">Springfield</span>). Others will be added from government, business and the community. In <span class="per">St. Louis</span>, a financially troubled group of primary care clinics consolidated with a <span class="loc">Jordan</span> Valley-style community health center. The once-strapped clinics became eligible for federal funding, patients had access to more federal services like disease management, and the money saved was used to hire more health care providers, <span class="per">Fruend</span> said.</p><br><br>
