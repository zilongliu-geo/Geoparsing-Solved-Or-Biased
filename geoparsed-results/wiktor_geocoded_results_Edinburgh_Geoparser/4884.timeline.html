  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Longwood</span> is a village and suburb of the town of <span class="loc">Huddersfield</span> in the English county of <span class="loc">West Yorkshire</span>. It is situated some 2.5 miles (4.0 km) west of <span class="loc">Huddersfield</span> town centre, in the valley of the <span class="loc">Longwood</span> Brook, a tributary of the <span class="loc">River Colne</span>. The village is the home of the <span class="loc">Longwood</span> Sing, an annual event, where choirs from around the area gather to sing hymns and songs. Near the amphitheatre, where the sing takes place, the folly Nab End Tower can be found. The tower was built in <span class="date">1861</span> by unemployed local woollen mill workers. In <span class="date">2008</span> it was restored by <span class="loc">Kirklees Metropolitan</span> Borough Council at a cost of Â£200,000. There are also three reservoirs that supply <span class="loc">Huddersfield</span>. They were built around <span class="date">1840</span>, although strengthening work in <span class="date">the 1930s</span> makes them appear newer. One <span class="date">now</span> covered and the lower reservoir looking more like a natural lake that is called a compensation reservoir - 'Compensation' as it was set up to compensate the mill owner for water lost from natural sources that <span class="date">now</span> went to the main reservoirs to be distributed by the water corporation under 'rates' systems - ironically the mill owner was most likely the owner of the main reservoir too.</p><br><br>
