  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Claremont</span> is a city along the eastern border of <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, 32.5 miles (52.3 km) east of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. It is located in the eastern <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Gabriel</span> Valley, at the foothills of the <span class="loc">San Gabriel Mountains</span>. The Claremont Colleges are located in the city. The population, as of the <span class="date">2014</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, is 36,054. <span class="loc">Claremont</span> is known for its many educational institutions, its tree-lined streets, and its historic buildings. In <span class="date">July 2007</span>, it was rated by <span class="org">CNN</span>/Money magazine as the fifth best place to live in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, and was the highest rated place in <span class="loc">California</span> on the list. Due to its large number of trees and residents with doctoral degrees, it is sometimes referred to as "<span class="org">The City of Trees</span> and PhDs". The city is primarily residential, with a significant portion of its commercial activity revolving around "The Village", a popular collection of street-front small stores, boutiques, art galleries, offices, and restaurants adjacent to and west of the Claremont Colleges. The Village was expanded in <span class="date">2007</span>, adding a controversial  multi-use development that includes a cinema, a boutique hotel, retail space, offices, and a parking structure on the site of an old citrus packing plant just west of Indian Hill Boulevard. Some critics say that the expansion negatively altered the original, small-town feel of The Village.</p><br><br>
