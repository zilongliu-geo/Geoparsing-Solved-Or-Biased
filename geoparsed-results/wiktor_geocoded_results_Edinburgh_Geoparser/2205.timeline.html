  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Bolivar (/ˈbɒlɪvər/, rhymes with "Oliver") is a borough in <span class="loc">Westmoreland County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The population was 501 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. Bolivar is located at 40°23′41″N 79°9′6″W (40.394788, -79.151616). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2), of which, 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) of it is land and 5.26% is water. The first settlers arrived in Bolivar about the <span class="date">year 1829</span> and settled between <span class="loc">Tubmill Creek</span> and the <span class="loc">Conemaugh River</span>. Most of the men were employed by the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Canal. The canal was located on the south side of the <span class="loc">Conemaugh River</span>. Some of the locks still may be seen west of town. Several small brickyards were started in the area, producing a red brick. Some of the houses on Second Street were constructed of these brick. They are still well-preserved <span class="date">today</span> after exposure to the elements for over <span class="date">a century</span>. The <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Railroad replaced the canal in <span class="date">1846</span>. Brickyards No. 1, and No. 2, and No. 3 were constructed between the <span class="loc">Conemaugh River</span> and the railroad. Bolivar was beginning to grow and prosper and was known as a "Brick Town". In 1863 Bolivar withdrew from <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> Township and became a borough, under the grounds that it was designed like many other boroughs of the time, in a checkerboard pattern. Bolivar borough was incorporated <span class="date">November 25, 1863</span>.</p><br><br>
