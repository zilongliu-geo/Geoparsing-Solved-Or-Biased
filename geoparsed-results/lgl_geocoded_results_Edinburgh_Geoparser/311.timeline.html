  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Snow, ice blanket <span class="loc">Kansas</span>; two dead. <span class="loc">KANSAS CITY</span>, <span class="loc">Mo</span>. â ” Tens of thousands of <span class="loc">Kansas</span> utility customers were without power <span class="date">Saturday</span> and two deaths were reported as an <span class="date">early spring</span> blizzard buried parts of <span class="loc">Kansas</span> in snow and ice. A 72-year-old man <span class="org">Hutchinson</span> man was shoveling snow and died of an apparent heart attack <span class="date">Saturday</span>, according to the adjutant general's office. On <span class="date">Friday</span>, a 58-year-old woman was killed in a car accident on icy roadways in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>. '' Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this storm,'' Gov. <span class="per">Kathleen Sebelius</span> said in a news release. '' Many roads in our state are still treacherous, so please be careful as you travel and take extra precautions when walking or working in the current conditions.'' The storm, which dropped several inches of snow around <span class="loc">Riley County</span> <span class="date">Friday night</span> and <span class="date">Saturday</span>, did little damage locally, officials said. '' We haven't had any calls,'' said Emergency Management Director <span class="per">Pat Collins</span>. '' There were no roads closed, we haven't been busy at all.'' <span class="per">Collins</span> said crews were out early to prepare roads around the county. Police officials said there were several non-serious wrecks on Interstate 70, but that drivers stayed indoors for the most part. <span class="org">Westar Energy</span> said about 12,700 customers were without power as of about 8:30 p.m. Saturday. The utility said it had restored power to more than 60,000 customers since the storm began, with some customers experiencing multiple outages. <span class="org">Kansas Electric Cooperatives Inc.</span> said five rural electric cooperatives were reporting outages to a combined 5,000 meters, which can serve multiple homes and businesses. <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> Power &amp; Light was reporting 2,300 consumers were in the dark, primarily in <span class="loc">Anderson County</span>. Most of the utility problems were in south-central <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, where up to an eighth of an inch of ice was causing tree branches to snap and knocking down power lines. Ice accumulations were from a quarter inch to an inch across the <span class="loc">Flint Hills</span> and parts of southeast <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. Much of the state was dealing with heavy snow and a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The National <span class="per">Weather Service</span> said the heaviest snow had fallen in parts of southwest <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, including 28 inches in the Pratt area with six-foot snow drifts. '' There's a good swath of our area that's covered with at least a foot of snow,'' said <span class="per">Matt Girard</span>, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in <span class="loc">Dodge City</span>. Heavy winds accompanying the snow diminished visibility in many communities to almost zero and forced authorities to close several local and state highways. Still, the storm was blamed for numerous accidents. Much of central, eastern and southeastern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> were reporting a foot and a half or less of snow but were more concerned about the freezing rain making driving even more challenging. The <span class="loc">Kansas</span> <span class="loc">Department of Transportation</span> said several highways were closed in southwest <span class="loc">Kansas</span> due to poor visibility and blowing snow, including long stretches of such major routes as <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 54, 56, 83, 160, 183, 283 and 400. Part of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 83 south out of <span class="loc">Garden City</span> was reopened, as was <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 50 west of <span class="loc">Dodge City</span>. <span class="per">Maj. Gen. Tod Bunting</span>, the adjutant general, said a guard search and rescue team in <span class="loc">Pratt County</span> reported rescuing two stranded motorists near <span class="loc">Pratt</span>. The adjutant general's office also reported that emergency crews in <span class="loc">Hutchinson</span> responded to three partially collapsed building. Partial building collapses also were reported in <span class="per">Harvey, Harper</span> and <span class="loc">Kingman counties</span>, but no injuries were reported. The Highway Patrol also sent out a plane <span class="date">Saturday</span> to fly over areas of southwest and south-central <span class="loc">Kansas</span> to look for stranded drivers. And National Guard helicopters were assisting with search and rescue efforts. The National Guard also opened armories in <span class="loc">Dodge City</span>, <span class="loc">Great Bend</span>, <span class="org">Hutchinson</span>, <span class="loc">Kingman</span>, Larned, <span class="loc">Pratt</span> and <span class="loc">West Wichita</span> <span class="date">Saturday</span> as warming stations. <span class="date">Earlier Saturday</span>, <span class="per">Sebelius</span> signed a declaration of disaster emergency for 62 counties, allowing state resources to help local officials.</p><br><br>
