<p><span class="loc">Alcantara</span> is a fifth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Romblon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. <span class="loc">Alcantara</span> was first established in 1730 as La Lauan, a barrio of Looc town by migrants from <span class="loc">Panay Island</span> led by Don Ciriaco <span class="loc">Alcantara</span>. In 1855, the barrio was annexed from <span class="loc">Looc</span> and converted into a pueblo or town. However, in 1868, it was abolished and annexed as a barrio of Guintigui-an town (renamed <span class="loc">Badajoz</span>, now <span class="loc">San Agustin</span>) after a reorganization of municipalities resulting from the creation of <span class="loc">Romblon province</span>. In 1870, due to continuous intimidation from Muslim pirates, as well as the rugged terrain, the residents of La Lauan led by a certain Gaspar Guevarra transferred from its former site in Daan Banwa (or <span class="loc">Old Town</span>) and established a new barrio down south called <span class="loc">Alcantara</span>, after Don Ciriaco <span class="loc">Alcantara</span>. In 1885, it was annexed back as a barrio of <span class="loc">Looc</span>, and would remain so until after World War II. <span class="loc">Alcantara</span> was elevated to municipality status on 16 March 1961 by virtue of Executive Order 4276 signed by then President Carlos P. Garcia. <span class="loc">Alcantara</span> lies in the southeast portion of <span class="loc">Tablas Island</span>. It is bounded to the north by the municipality of <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span>, to the west by <span class="loc">Looc</span>, to the south by <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>, and to the east by the <span class="loc">Sibuyan Sea</span>. Most of <span class="loc">Alcantara</span> lies in plains along the coast with mountains in the interior to the west.</p>
