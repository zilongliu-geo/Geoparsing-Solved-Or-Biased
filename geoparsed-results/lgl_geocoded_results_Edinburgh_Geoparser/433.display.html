<p>N.Va. murder suspect declared incompetent to stand trial. <span onClick="goto_name('MANASSAS')" class="loc">MANASSAS</span> -- A Woodbridge man charged in the abduction and death of an Alexandria woman has been declared incompetent to stand trial and is awaiting treatment at a state mental-health hospital. Keith Baskerville -- the only survivor in the Sept. 13 event -- is charged with felony murder, abduction and carjacking charges in the death of 60-year-old Barbara Bosworth. This month, a judge in Prince William County Circuit Court declared Baskerville incompetent to stand trial and ordered him sent to Western State Hospital for treatment. Baskerville appeared in court Friday, when a judge was scheduled to review his case. But his review was continued after attorneys and the judge said Baskerville had not yet received the mental-health treatment ordered by the court. Baskerville is now due back in court April 24, when a judge will review his competency. Police said Baskerville and another man, 19-year-old Lutchman Chandler, abducted Bosworth from <span onClick="goto_name('Springfield')" class="loc">Springfield</span> Mall in September and drove her to a PDQ Mart in Woodbridge, where they tried to use her ATM card to withdraw money. The men then left the store with Bosworth and crashed their car while fleeing the area. Chandler, who police said was driving the car at the time of the wreck, later died from his injuries. Judge Mary Grace O'Brien of Prince William Circuit Court said Baskerville's mental-health treatment had been delayed because she ordered him sent to Western State Hospital, though because of the nature of the crimes he is charged with, state laws require that he be sent to Central State Hospital. He had not been sent there before his court appearance Friday because of a lack of bed space at the hospital, O'Brien said. "I don't want this case to fall through the cracks," O'Brien said before setting the April 24 court date.</p>
