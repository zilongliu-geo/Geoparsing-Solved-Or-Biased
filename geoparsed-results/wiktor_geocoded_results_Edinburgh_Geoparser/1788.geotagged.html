<p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county located in the state of <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 47,746. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is the city of <span class="loc">St. Albans</span>. It borders the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Quebec</span>. The county was created in 1792 and organized in 1796. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> metropolitan area. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is one of several <span class="loc">Vermont counties</span> created from land originally ceded by the state of <span class="loc">New York</span> on January 15, 1777 when <span class="loc">Vermont</span> declared itself to be a state distinct from <span class="loc">New York</span>. The land originally was contested by <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, and New Netherland, but it remained undelineated until July 20, 1764, when King George III established the boundary between <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span> along the west bank of the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>, north of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and south of the parallel of 45 degrees north latitude. <span class="loc">New York</span> assigned the land gained to <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. On March 12, 1772 <span class="loc">Albany County</span> was partitioned to create <span class="loc">Charlotte County</span>, and this situation remained until Vermont's independence from <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Britain</span>. However, this did not end the contest.</p>
