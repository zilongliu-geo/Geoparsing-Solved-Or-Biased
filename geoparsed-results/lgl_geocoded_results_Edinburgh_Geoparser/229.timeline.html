  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Family of <span class="loc">Jordan</span> motorcyclist finds him injured in ditch. A wife’s quick action may have saved her husband’s life after his motorcycle went off the road in Sand Creek Township <span class="date">early Wednesday morning</span>. When Lori <span class="per">Whipps</span> received a call that her husband <span class="per">Roger</span> hadn’t shown up for work, she and family members immediately went looking from him. They discovered him in a ditch on Marystown Road, about one-third of a mile north of Highway 282 around 5 a.m. <span class="loc">Scott County</span> Deputy <span class="per">Sgt. Bob Mulvehill</span> said it appeared <span class="per">Roger Whipps</span>, who wasn’t wearing a helmet, lost control while going around a curve and he was ejected from his motorcycle. The <span class="loc">Jordan</span> resident was flown to North Memorial Medical Center in <span class="loc">Robbinsdale</span>, where he remains in critical condition. It is unclear what caused the man to leave the roadway. <span class="per">Mulvehill</span> said the <span class="per">Whipps</span> was still unresponsive as of <span class="date">Thursday morning</span>.</p><br><br>
