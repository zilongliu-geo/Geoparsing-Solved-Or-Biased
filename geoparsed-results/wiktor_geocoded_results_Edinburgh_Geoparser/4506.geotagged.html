<p><span class="loc">Rock Island</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Douglas County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Wenatcheeâ€“East Wenatchee Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 788 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> was officially incorporated on November 3, 1930. The area of <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> was used by Native American tribes for fishing and crossing of the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span> due to the nearby Rock <span class="loc">Island Rapids</span> prior to settlement of the <span class="loc">Washington</span> Territory. The site had been previously settled in the late 19th Century and was known as <span class="loc">Hammond</span>; early maps sometimes show the city as <span class="loc">Hammond P.O.</span> (Post Office) or <span class="loc">Power City</span>. In the teacup valley in which <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> is currently located, two men, <span class="loc">Ingraham</span> and <span class="loc">McBride</span>, opened a trading post in the early 1860s. Their patrons were local Native Americans, who often fished that stretch of the <span class="loc">Columbia</span> when the fish were running. The two pioneering men would later move their post to the mouth of the <span class="loc">Wenatchee River</span>, leaving little trace of their stay. The most notable figure in <span class="loc">Rock Island</span>'s founding is James E. Keane. As the first permanent settler to the <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> area, James Keane arrived with a crew of men in 1887. Keane planned to build a home and improve the land that he had acquired through the homestead, pre-emption, and desert acts. Four years later, the Great Northern Railroad made its first survey of the area and began construction toward the valley from the east. One half mile upriver from the well-known Rock <span class="loc">Island Rapids</span>, Mr. Keane platted a townsite he named <span class="loc">Hammond</span>.</p>
