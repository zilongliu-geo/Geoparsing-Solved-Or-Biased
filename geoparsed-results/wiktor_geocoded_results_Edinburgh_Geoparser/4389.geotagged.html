<p><span class="loc">Penza</span> (Russian: Пенза; IPA: [ˈpʲɛnzə]) is a city and the administrative center of <span class="loc">Penza Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Sura River</span>, 625 kilometers (388 mi) southeast of <span class="loc">Moscow</span>. Population: 517,311 (2010 Census); 518,025 (2002 Census); 542,612 (1989 Census). <span class="loc">Penza</span> was founded as a Russian frontier fortress-city, and to this day, remnants of the Lomovskaya sentry line built in 1640 have been preserved at the western edge of the city, and remains of earth ramparts dating from the mid-16th century are preserved in the city center. Until 1663, <span class="loc">Penza</span> was a wooden stockade with only a small settlement. Then in May 1663, the architect Yuri Kontransky arrived in <span class="loc">Penza</span> on the Tsar's orders to direct the construction of a fortress city, as part of a wider fortress building program to protect <span class="loc">Russia</span> from attacks by Crimean Tatars. The initial construction consisted of a wooden Kremlin, a village, and quarters for the nobility, small tradesmen, and merchants. In 1774, the insurgent army led by Yemelyan Pugachev occupied <span class="loc">Penza</span> after the citizens of the city welcomed the rebellious Cossacks. The first stone houses started to appear after 1801, and by 1809 Penza's population had grown to more than 13,000 people.</p>
