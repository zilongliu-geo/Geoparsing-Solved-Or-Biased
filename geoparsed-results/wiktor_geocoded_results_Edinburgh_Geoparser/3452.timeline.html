  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Berat</span> is a city and a municipality located in south-central <span class="loc">Albania</span>, and the capital of the <span class="loc">County of Berat</span>. In <span class="date">July 2008</span>, the old town (<span class="loc">Mangalem district</span>) was inscribed on the <span class="org">UNESCO World Heritage List</span>. The municipality was formed at the <span class="date">2015</span> local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities <span class="loc">Berat</span>, <span class="loc">Otllak</span>, <span class="loc">Roshnik</span>, <span class="loc">Sinjë</span> and <span class="loc">Velabisht</span>, that became municipal units. The seat of the municipality is the city <span class="loc">Berat</span>. The total population is 60,031 (<span class="date">2011</span> census), in a total area of 379.98 km2. The population of the former municipality at the <span class="date">2011</span> census was 32,606. The name of the city in Albanian is <span class="loc">Berat</span> or <span class="loc">Berati</span>, which is probably derived from the Old Bulgarian Бѣлградъ or Bel(i)grad (Белград, meaning "white city" in the <span class="loc">South Slavic</span> languages), under which name it was known in Greek, Bulgarian, <span class="per">Latin</span> and <span class="per">Slavic</span> documents during the <span class="per">High</span> and <span class="per">Late</span> Middle Ages. That name was rendered as Bellegrada (Βελλέγραδα) in Greek. It is believed to have been the site of an Ancient Macedonian stronghold, Antipatreia (Ancient Greek: Ἀντιπάτρεια "<span class="loc">city of Antipater</span>") or Antipatrea in <span class="per">Latin</span>, while during the early Byzantine Empire the name of the town was Pulcheriopolis (Greek: Πουλχεριόπολις, "<span class="loc">city of Pulcheria</span>"). In the Republic of <span class="loc">Venice</span> the city was known as Belgrad di <span class="loc">Romania</span>, while in the Ottoman Empire it was also known as Belgrad-i Arnavud (Albanian <span class="loc">Belgrade</span>) to distinguish it from <span class="loc">Belgrade</span>.</p><br><br>
