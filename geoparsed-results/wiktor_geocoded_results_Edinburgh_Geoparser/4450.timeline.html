  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Horn was a civil parish in the <span class="loc">county of Rutland</span> in the East Midlands of <span class="loc">England</span>. In <span class="date">2001</span> it had a population of 9. The parish is part of the <span class="loc">Exton</span> Hall estate of the Earls of <span class="loc">Gainsborough</span>. <span class="org">The Parish of Horn</span> with just three properties was amalgamated with <span class="loc">Exton Parish</span> in <span class="date">2015</span>. The village of Horn was mentioned in the Domesday survey, as 'Two hides in Horn of which Langfer had been tenant under Edward the Confessor were held of the king by the <span class="per">Bishop of Durham</span>'. In <span class="date">1287</span>, <span class="per">Richard</span> son of <span class="per">Richard de Seyton</span> had a manor house at <span class="loc">Horne</span> and in <span class="date">1378</span> <span class="per">Sir John Seyton</span> had his capital messuage here, although the manor was reportedly valueless in <span class="date">1376</span>. The land was turned from arable to pasture, which has been suggested as the cause of depopulation. There had been a church, dedicated to <span class="loc">All Saints</span>, but it too fell into disrepair and new rectors were installed under a thorn tree in <span class="date">1471</span>, and until the last appointment in <span class="date">1809</span>. Horn is part of the Alstoe hundred of <span class="loc">Rutland</span>. Proximity to the parish meant that the Battle of <span class="loc">Losecoat</span> Field during <span class="org">the War of the Roses</span> was once called the Battle of Hornfield.</p><br><br>
