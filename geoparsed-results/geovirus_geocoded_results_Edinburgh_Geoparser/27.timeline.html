  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The two cases in <span class="loc">Poland</span> were discovered in the northern town of Toruń, famous as the birthplace of <span class="per">Nicolaus Copernicus</span>. Two swans have been confirmed to have been carriers of the virus. Samples from the subjects have been sent to the European Union (<span class="org">EU</span>) laboratories in <span class="loc">Weybridge</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, but initial assessments have been seen as highly reliable. "Yes, we have confirmed that it is definitely H5N1," said <span class="date">Jan</span> <span class="per">Zmudzinski</span>, director of <span class="loc">Poland</span>'s national laboratory, in the town of <span class="loc">Pulawy</span>. A hygiene-security zone protected by police has been established, extending up to several hundred metres from the spot on the river bank of the Vistula river where the swans were found. <span class="loc">Boud</span>, a resident of Toruń, told Wikinews that he has observed authorities putting precautionary measures in place to attempt to slow the spread of bird flu.</p><br><br>
