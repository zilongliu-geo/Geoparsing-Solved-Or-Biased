<p><span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windham County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,964 at the 2010 census. In the mid-17th century, John Eliot, a Puritan missionary to the American Indians, established "praying towns" where Native Americans took up Christianity and were expected to renounce their religious ceremonies, traditional dress, and customs. One Praying town, called Wabaquasset (Senexet, Wabiquisset), six miles west of the <span class="loc">Quinebaug</span> River in present-day <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>, was the largest of the three northeastern <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> praying towns. In 1675, when King Philip's War broke out, some of the town's Indians, (especially in the southern part of the town) sided with the Mohegans and the English while others sided with the Indians led by Philip, rallying to arms on what is now <span class="loc">Curtis Island</span> in present Holland, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">Brimfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. During the war, the Praying town became deserted, and the English with their Indian allies marched through <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> to present day <span class="loc">Thompson</span> in the summer of 1676 burning any crops or stored corn they could find.</p>
