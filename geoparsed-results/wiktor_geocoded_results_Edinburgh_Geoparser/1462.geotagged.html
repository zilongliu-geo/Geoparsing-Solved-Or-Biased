<p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windsor County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,139 at the 2010 census. The central village is delineated as the <span class="loc">Rochester</span> census-designated place. Set on the edge of the <span class="loc">Green Mountain National Forest</span>, the town is a picturesque tourist destination. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was granted in 1780, chartered in 1781 to Dudley Chase, Asa Whitcomb and 63 others, then organized in 1788. It was first settled in the winter of 1781-1782 by David Currier and his family. <span class="loc">Rochester</span>'s boundaries later expanded when the town of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> was divided up among its neighbors. The surface of the town is mountainous and broken, but the intervales along the <span class="loc">White River</span> provided good farmland. There were sites supplying water power for mills. By 1859, when the population was 1,493, industries included one gristmill, several sawmills, one tub factory, and a variety of mechanic shops. The <span class="loc">White River</span> Railroad from Bethel opened to <span class="loc">Rochester</span> in 1900, but was abandoned in 1933 during the Great Depression. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was one of thirteen <span class="loc">Vermont</span> towns isolated by flooding caused by Hurricane Irene in 2011.</p>
