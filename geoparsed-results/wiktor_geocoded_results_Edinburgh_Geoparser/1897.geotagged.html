<p><span class="loc">Santa Teresita</span> is a city in the seaside La Costa Partido of the Province of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. Established in 1946, the town owed its initial growth to the Santa Teresita Development Association led by José Milano, who successfully lobbied provincial authorities for paved roads, a telephone exchange, power plant, and clinic (all of which had been opened by 1949). A curupay wooden pier was built by the association in 1947, and in 1972, extended to 200 m (656 ft) – though damage from a 1983 storm later led to its rebuilding in concrete. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> engineer Luther Koontz, who had stayed in <span class="loc">Argentina</span> after helping Alister MacKenzie design two golf courses for the Argentine Jockey Club, opened the Santa Teresita Golf Club in 1950, and the first lodging establishment, the Hostería <span class="loc">Santa Teresita</span>, was opened by <span class="loc">Horacio</span> Fiocco and Angel de <span class="loc">Martino</span>. Four hotels opened during the 1950s, and in 1959, the town's best known inn, the Hotel Bristol, welcomed its first guests. The 1960 Census counted 547 year-round residents. A monthly periodical, <span class="loc">Santa Teresita</span>, was started in 1958, as was Stefani Brothers, the first local home builder. Schools, cinemas, cafés, and a police department were added, and in 1965, the Jorge Newbery Airfield. The town's first local bank, the Banco de <span class="loc">Crédito Rural</span> <span class="loc">Argentino</span>, opened in 1967, though mismanagement led to its collapse in 1986.</p>
