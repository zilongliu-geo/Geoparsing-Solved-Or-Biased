<p>Weston is a village and civil parish in the English <span class="loc">county of Suffolk</span> located approximately 2 miles (3 km) south of <span class="loc">Beccles</span> in the <span class="loc">District of Waveney</span>. The parish lies either side of the A145 and is crossed by the <span class="loc">Ipswich</span> to <span class="loc">Lowestoft</span> railway line. Neighbouring villages include <span class="loc">Ellough</span>, Ringsfield, <span class="loc">Willingham</span> St Mary and Shadingfield. The village is largely dispersed with a mid-2005 population estimate for the parish of 230, measured at 257 in the 2011 Census. The village has few services and a joint parish council covers both Ringsfield and Weston. The village once had a school, on King's Lane, and a public house, the Duke of Marlborough on the main A145. Both are now closed and the major centre of population in the parish is to the west where it borders <span class="loc">Ringsfield Corner</span>. The parish church is medieval in origin and dedicated to St Peter. It has a primarily Norman core and is a Grade I listed building. The parish was combined with that of All Saints Church, <span class="loc">Ellough</span> in the 1970s. The village is named in the Domesday book as Westuna and formed part of the William the Conqueror's estate, with land also being held by Roger Bigot, Hugh de <span class="loc">Montfort</span> and Geoffrey de Mandeville. The village, which formed part of the Hundred of <span class="loc">Wangford</span>, had a population of around 30 families and paid around 2 geld in taxation.</p>
