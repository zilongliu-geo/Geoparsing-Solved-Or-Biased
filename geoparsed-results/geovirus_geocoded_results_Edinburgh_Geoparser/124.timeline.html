  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The non-governmental aid organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (<span class="org">MSF</span>), or Doctors Without Borders, warned of a humanitarian crisis developing in the eastern region of <span class="loc">Chad</span> in central <span class="loc">Africa</span>, issued a press release <span class="date">Friday</span>. <span class="loc">Chad</span>, which shares part of its eastern border with <span class="loc">Sudan</span>, has been the recipient of refugees fleeing conflict in the <span class="loc">Darfur region</span> of <span class="loc">Sudan</span>. In addition to the estimated 234,000 Sudanese refugees it manages, <span class="loc">Chad</span> <span class="date">now</span> has an estimated 150,000 internally displaced persons, or IDPs, fleeing from attacks on villages in the eastern region where the government of <span class="loc">Chad</span> has been fighting an insurgency, which it claims was supported in <span class="date">the past</span> by <span class="loc">Sudan</span>. The Chadian IDPs are set up in rudimentary camps, lacking basic necessities such as food, water and proper shelter. According to a <span class="date">May, 2007</span> report by <span class="org">MSF</span>'s research and epidemiological survey centre, 20 percent of children in camps near <span class="loc">Goz Beida</span> were suffering from acute malnutrition and "catastrophic" mortality rates. <span class="org">MSF</span> complained of obstacles encountered in their effort to provide medical assistance to the needy. "In <span class="loc">Goz Beida</span>, the IDPs receive three to eight litres of water per person per day, whereas they should have 20 litres," said Franck Joncret, <span class="org">MSF Head of Mission</span> in <span class="loc">Chad</span>. Approximately 100 children are receiving treatment for malnutrition, while <span class="org">MSF</span> estimated the number of acutely malnourished children to be greater than 2,000. "This policy of rationed aid for IDPs is unacceptable," complained <span class="loc">Joncret</span>. In April, the United Nations Office for <span class="org">the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</span> (OCHA) initiated a <span class="date">three month</span> intervention for the Chadian camps, which <span class="org">MSF</span> described as "inadequate". <span class="org">MSF</span> also complained that they have not been given approval to open a paediatric hospital in <span class="loc">Goz Beida</span> to help deal with the malnutrition. In the near term, <span class="org">MSF</span> anticipated an increase in malaria and epidemic diarrhoeal diseases along with an dramatic increase in malnutrition cases. To help avert a humanitarian crisis, <span class="org">MSF</span> pleaded for increased hospital capacity, a safe water supply for the camps, and the cooperation necessary to deal with malnutrition. "It is imperative that the emergency in eastern <span class="loc">Chad</span> be fully recognised, that aid organisations provide massive, immediate aid to the IDPs and that the Chadian authorities facilitate humanitarian aid," said <span class="per">Isabelle Defourny</span>, manager of <span class="org">MSF</span> programmes in <span class="loc">Chad</span>. The government of <span class="loc">Chad</span> has said it would agree to a <span class="org">UN</span> police presence, but not a military force, in its eastern regions.</p><br><br>
