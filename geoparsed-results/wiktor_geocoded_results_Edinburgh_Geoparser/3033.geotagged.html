<p><span class="loc">Silian</span>, originally Sulien, is a village in the valley of the <span class="loc">River Aeron</span>, <span class="loc">Ceredigion</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span>. It is located approximately two miles north-west of <span class="loc">Lampeter</span>, on a minor road connecting Pont Creuddun on the A482, and Glan Denys on the A485. In January 2014, permission was granted for a wind turbine in <span class="loc">Silian</span>, in the face of strong local opposition. The county council, deciding a site visit for an area that is home to rare red kite birds was not required, were enthusiastic to help "secure local business." <span class="loc">Silian</span> is also the name of the parish, which takes its name from Saint Sulien, to whom the village church is consecrated. Bethel Chapel was built in <span class="loc">Silian</span> in 1654, and renovated in 1952. Julian Cayo-Evans, the Welsh nationalist and leader of the Free Wales Army, was born in <span class="loc">Silian</span> in 1937. Silian Halt was on the <span class="loc">Lampeter</span>, <span class="loc">Aberayron</span> and New Quay Light Railway, opening in 1911 and closing to passengers in 1951. A local Welsh language paper, Llais Aeron, covers the area. Self-catering accommodation and B&amp;Bs are available in the village, which is conveniently situated for visiting the towns of <span class="loc">Lampeter</span>, <span class="loc">Aberaeron</span> and <span class="loc">Aberystwyth</span>.</p>
