<p><span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> is the capital city of the Cuban province of <span class="loc">Villa Clara</span>. It is located in the most central region of the province and almost in the most central region of the country. With a population near a quarter million; 242,402 people at the beginning of 2013, is the 5th largest Cuban city by population. <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> was founded by 175 people on July 15, 1689. One hundred and thirty-eight of them were represented by two large families already living in the area and, therefore, owners of the land next to the new city. The other 37 came from 7 other families, a priest and a governor, all of them originating in the coastal city of “<span class="loc">San Juan de los Remedios</span>”. The population of <span class="loc">Remedios</span> was torn between the option of leaving their city, constantly besieged by pirate attacks, or staying in place. While most of them finally decided to stay, these 37 persons traveled south and, on June 1, 1689 they arrived to the hill where they rejoined the other two existing families. A mass was given under a supposed Tamarind tree and the city was born. Since then, the place under the tree is known as “<span class="loc">Loma Del Carmen</span>” (Carmen’s Hill). A second generation church exists in a beautiful park along the place with a monument commemorating the event surrounded by a fourth generation Tamarind tree.</p>
