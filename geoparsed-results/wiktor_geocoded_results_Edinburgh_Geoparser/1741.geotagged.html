<p><span class="loc">Lafayette</span> (formerly, <span class="loc">La Fayette</span>) is a city in Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of 2011, the city's population was estimated to be 24,285. Today <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> is known for its wealthy inhabitants and pastoral rolling hills. The town is also known for excellent schools within the highly ranked Acalanes School District. In 2012, estimated median household income in <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> was over 150,000 dollars, more than double the statewide average and nearly triple the national average. Before the colonization of the region by <span class="loc">Spain</span>, <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> and its vicinity were inhabited by the Saclan tribe of the indigenous Bay Miwok. Ohlone also populated some of the areas along <span class="loc">Lafayette Creek</span>. The indigenous inhabitants' first contact with Europeans was in the late 18th century with the founding of Catholic missions in the region. These initial contacts developed into conflict, with years of armed struggle, including a battle on what is currently Lafayette soil in 1797 between the Saclan and the Spanish, and eventually resulting in the subjugation of the native population. Most of what is currently <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> was given as a Mexican land grant, Rancho Acalanes to Candelario Valencia in 1834. The name Acalanes seems to have come from the name of a native village in the area, Ahala-n.</p>
