  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Paul</span> (Cornish: Breweni) is a village in <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. It is in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Penzance</span>. The village is two miles (3 km) south of <span class="loc">Penzance</span> and one mile (1.6 km) south of <span class="loc">Newlyn</span>. The village of <span class="per">Paul</span> should not be confused with the civil <span class="loc">parish of Paul</span>, which lies west of the village and does not include the village of <span class="per">Paul</span>. Like many Cornish communities <span class="per">Paul</span> has its own community celebration. <span class="per">Paul</span> Feast is held on the <span class="date">Sunday</span> nearest <span class="date">10 October</span> every year when the village is decorated and a civic service takes place on the <span class="date">Sunday</span> of the feast itself led by the Mayor of <span class="loc">Penzance</span>. Much of the history of <span class="per">Paul</span> is connected with its parish church. The church itself is said to have been founded in 490, a very uncertain date and not documented, by <span class="per">Paul Aurelian</span>, a Welsh saint known in Brittany as Paol <span class="per">Aurelian</span> in <span class="loc">Breton</span>. There is no historical evidence to support his ever coming to West Penwith. He was founder of the cathedral at Saint-Pol-de-LÃ©on, the city named after him. However this church could have been dedicated to <span class="per">Paul</span> the Apostle, or Paulinus of <span class="loc">York</span>, there is no documentary evidence to prove any of these three <span class="loc">Saint Pauls</span> was the original dedicatee of the church. It was only named 'St. Pol-de-Leon' in <span class="date">1907</span> and is probably connected with <span class="per">Henry Jenner</span> who (with <span class="per">W C Borlase</span>) opposed alleged 'Englishness' and stamp consistent spelling of Cornish place names on OS maps.</p><br><br>
