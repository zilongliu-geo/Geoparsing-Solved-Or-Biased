<p>Arnold is a city in <span class="loc">Westmoreland County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, within the <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span> metropolitan area. The population was 5,157 at the 2010 Census. Present-day <span class="loc">Westmoreland County</span> was part of the hunting reserves of the Iroquois Indians. Americans began to penetrate the area in the 1750s, and circa 1781 Robert McCrea purchased the land on which Arnold is situated. William Jack acquired the property and later passed it on to Wilson Jack. The area around Arnold was first settled in 1852 by Major Andrew Arnold, who grew up in Kittanning. Arnold was part of <span class="loc">New Kensington</span> until it was separately incorporated as a borough in January 1896, and as a third-class city in 1939. Arnold is located on the eastern shore of the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> River, northeast of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.8 square miles (2.1 km2), of which 0.7 square miles (1.8 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (6.41%) is water. Notable landmarks in Arnold have included: <span class="loc">Arnold</span> Station, established in 1867, which was Arnoldâ€™s railroad stop. It was so named because the land on which it was built was given by the Arnold Family.</p>
