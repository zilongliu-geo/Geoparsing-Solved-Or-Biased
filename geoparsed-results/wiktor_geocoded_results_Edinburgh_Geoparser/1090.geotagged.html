<p>The <span class="loc">city of Union</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,393 at the 2010 census. It is the principal city of the Union Micropolitan Statistical Area (population 28,961 according to 2010 Census), an (MSA) which includes all of <span class="loc">Union County</span> and which is further included in the greater Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, <span class="loc">South Carolina Combined Statistical Area</span> (population 1,266,995 according to the 2010 Census). Both the <span class="loc">city of Union</span> and <span class="loc">Union County</span> received their names from the old Union Church that stood a short distance from the Monarch Mill. When it was first founded, the <span class="loc">city of Union</span> was known as <span class="loc">Unionville</span>; later the name was shortened to Union. The county’s first white settlers came from Virginia in 1749. <span class="loc">Union County</span>’s population grew the fastest between 1762 and the start of the Revolutionary War. Settlers built log cabins and cultivated tobacco, flax, corn and wheat. Union was one of the first towns settled in the area and was untouched during the Civil War because the <span class="loc">Broad River</span> flooded and turned Sherman’s troops away from the town.</p>
