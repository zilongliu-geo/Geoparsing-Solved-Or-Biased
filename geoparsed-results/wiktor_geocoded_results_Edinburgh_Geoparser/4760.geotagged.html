<p><span class="loc">Limbe</span> (1858–1982: Victoria; also spelled Limbé) is a seaside city in the South-West Region of <span class="loc">Cameroon</span>. <span class="loc">Limbe</span> was founded in 1858 on the southern slopes of Mount <span class="loc">Cameroon</span> by the British missionary Alfred Saker. At the 2005 Census, the population was 84,223. Victoria was founded by the British missionary Alfred Saker of the Baptist Missionary Society of <span class="loc">London</span> in June 1858. Due to this treaty, initially Victoria and its vicinity was not part of the new German colony <span class="loc">Kamerun</span> and remained under British administration. On May 7, 1886 <span class="loc">Great Britain</span> and <span class="loc">Germany</span> agreed to exchange Victoria and its vicinity for German rights at the <span class="loc">Forcados River</span> in <span class="loc">Nigeria</span> and St. Lucia in <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. On March 28, 1887 Victoria and its vicinity were handed over to the German administration. At the same time Swiss Presbyterian missionaries bought the land from the Baptist Missionary Society in 1887. Victoria became British again in 1915. In 1982 Victoria was renamed and is since then known as <span class="loc">Limbe</span>. <span class="loc">Limbe</span> is located on a beautiful bay against the backdrop of a major mountain range. Black sand beaches make <span class="loc">Limbe</span> one of two coastal towns (Kribi being the other) that are popular among Western tourists. The Limbe Wildlife Centre and Limbe Botanical Gardens are notable attractions. The Germans left a Bismarck tower in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Limbe</span>. <span class="loc">Limbe</span> is considered a good region in the country in terms of night life, and is considered a good tourist city in the country to visit. It is the home to the Bakweri people.</p>
