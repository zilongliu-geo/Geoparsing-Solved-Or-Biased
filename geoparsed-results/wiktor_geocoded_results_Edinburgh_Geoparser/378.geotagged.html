<p><span class="loc">La Libertad</span> (Liberty) is a municipality in the La Libertad Department of <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>. It had a population of 35,997 inhabitants in 2007 according to the official census of that year. It is one of the main tourist attractions in the country. In 1770 this area was referred to by Pedro Cortes, the Archbishop of Guatemala (1776–1779), as the "hacienda Tepeahua", one of the largest estates in the parish of <span class="loc">San Jacinto</span>. The region was known as Tepeahua, a name derived from a Nahuatl expression meaning "mountain of the oak trees", before the Congress of the Federal Republic of Central <span class="loc">America</span> authorized the name "Puerto de <span class="loc">La Libertad</span>" (Port of Freedom) on February 24, 1824. The national assembly chartered commercial trade on the Pacific coast in 1831, and the first steamboat arrived at <span class="loc">La Libertad</span> on June 7, 1857. <span class="loc">La Libertad</span> was incorporated as a village by an Executive decree of July 19, 1858, which was approved by the Congress on February 11, 1859. This was done to relieve the community's excessive dependence on the town of Huizúcar, located at a considerable distance and connected by bad roads.</p>
