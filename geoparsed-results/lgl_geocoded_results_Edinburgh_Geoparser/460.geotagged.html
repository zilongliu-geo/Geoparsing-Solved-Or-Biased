<p>Police determine details of three-vehicle crash. Law enforcement could not say for sure Friday night how a three-vehicle injury accident on KY 52 occurred, but Sgt. Sam Manley from the <span class="loc">Madison County</span> Sheriff’s Department confirmed Monday the sequence of events that sent all five people involved to the hospital with injuries. A 2005 black Ford truck being driven by Joseph Welch of <span class="loc">Richmond</span> was about to turn right (westbound) onto KY 52 heading toward <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">Manley</span> said. A 1993 brown Cadillac driven by Larry Dunaway of <span class="loc">Berea</span> was traveling westbound and struck the pickup truck in the left rear, the deputy said. That then caused the truck to do a 180-degree spin, and it was left facing east in a westbound lane, Manley said. By that time, Manley said the Cadallic was facing west in the eastbound lane resulting in a head-on collision between an eastbound 1996 Chevrolet driven by David Arvin of <span class="loc">Irvine</span>. Arvin, Dunaway and his passenger, Barton Jones of <span class="loc">Waco</span>, were treated at the University of Kentucky Medical Center and were in “critical but stable” condition, according to a <span class="loc">UK</span> spokesperson who gave the statement Saturday afternoon. Welch and his passenger Vickie Nguyen were taken to Pattie A. Clay Medical Center where they were treated for minor injuries.</p>
