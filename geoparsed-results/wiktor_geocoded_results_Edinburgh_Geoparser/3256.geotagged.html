<p>The town of <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is located in <span class="loc">Providence County</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It includes the historic villages of <span class="loc">Esmond</span>, <span class="loc">Georgiaville</span>, <span class="loc">Mountaindale</span>, <span class="loc">Hanton City</span>, <span class="loc">Stillwater</span> and <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. The population was 21,430 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is the home of Bryant University, a private four year college. The area comprising modern-day <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> was first settled in 1636 by several British colonists, including John Steere as a farming community and named after <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>, <span class="loc">London</span>. The area was within the boundaries of Providence until 1731 when <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> was incorporated as a separate town. Chief Justice Peleg Arnold lived in early <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>, and his 1690 home stands today. There was an active Quaker community in early 18th century <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> that extended along the Great Road, from what is today <span class="loc">Woonsocket</span>, north into <span class="loc">south Uxbridge</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. This Quaker community, and its members, became influential in the abolition movement, with members such as <span class="loc">Effingham</span> Capron and Abby Kelley Foster, and also gave rise to other Quaker settlements including one at <span class="loc">Adams</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> where Susan B. Anthony was born as an early member. Elizabeth Buffum Chace is a well-known person from <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> who was influential in both abolition of slavery, and the women's rights movement. In the 19th century several mills were built in the town. In the mid-19th century the towns of <span class="loc">North Smithfield</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, and Lincoln, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, became separate towns. The colonial ghost town of <span class="loc">Hanton City</span> is located within the boundaries of present-day <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>, but was a completely separate community in the eighteenth century. A Revolutionary war soldier, from the <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> side of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> border, Captain James Buxton, ended up as a <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> militiaman and Continental Army veteran, who was deeded 300 acres in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span> by Governor John Hancock. For this reason Buxton was lost to the history of <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> Revolutionary soldiers.(see <span class="loc">South Uxbridge</span> history). Buxton served at <span class="loc">Valley Forge</span> among other battles.</p>
