<p><span class="loc">Fremont</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Sandusky County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 16,734 at the 2010 census. It was the home of Rutherford B. Hayes, who served as President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> from 1877 to 1881. The Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center remains one of the focal points of <span class="loc">Fremont</span>, <span class="loc">OH</span>. The National Arbor Day Foundation designated <span class="loc">Fremont</span> as a Tree City <span class="loc">USA</span>. The area which is now <span class="loc">Fremont</span> was originally a Wyandot village. In the 1750s a French trading post was established there. In 1787 the <span class="loc">United States</span> established the Northwest Territory, and in 1803 the southeastern portion of the Territory was admitted to the Union as part of the new state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. During the early and mid 1800s a few Europeans and African Americans, predominantly runaway slaves, settled in the area, which became known as <span class="loc">Lower Sandusky</span> for its location on the <span class="loc">Sandusky River</span>. Under the terms of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s admission, <span class="loc">Lower Sandusky</span> was defined as Indian Territory, so the non-Wyandot settlements were in direct violation of the Treaty of <span class="loc">Greeneville</span>; at one point the <span class="loc">United States</span> Army considered removing the settlers by force, but did not carry out the threat. <span class="loc">Fort Stephenson</span> was built there during the War of 1812, and the Battle of <span class="loc">Fort Stephenson</span> was fought there in August 1813.</p>
