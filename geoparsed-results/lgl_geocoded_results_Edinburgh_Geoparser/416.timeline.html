  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Developer granted delay for <span class="loc">North Shore</span> projects. The city's Stadium Authority board unanimously agreed <span class="date">yesterday</span> with a Columbus developer's request to extend construction deadlines for <span class="loc">North Shore</span> hotel and amphitheater projects, though the request provoked warnings from board members. Continental Real Estate won approvals <span class="date">yesterday</span> to push back construction starting dates for a $25 million Hyatt Place hotel until <span class="date">June 30</span> and a $12 million entertainment complex until <span class="date">Aug. 1</span>. Under previous agreements with the authority, which controls the city-owned land between the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> stadiums, the developers were supposed to begin building <span class="date">next month</span>. They requested more time to secure financing and government approvals for the projects, authority staffers said. Representatives from a union-backed neighborhood group called <span class="loc">North Side</span> United -- which has been trying to negotiate a community benefits agreement with Continental -- criticized the city agency for repeatedly siding with the developers. <span class="loc">North Side</span> United and Continental have not met since <span class="date">May 2008</span>, organizers said. "You're not acting in the public's interest -- you're acting in their interest," complained John <span class="org">Canning of the Central</span> <span class="loc">North Side</span>. Though the board voted 5-0 to approve Continental's contract extensions, board members signaled some frustration and questioned whether the developers could finish the entertainment complex as promised by <span class="date">May 1, 2010</span>. "If this [approval] is given, we expect them to complete by the date we agreed to," state Rep. <span class="per">Jake Wheatley</span> said. Continental "better get on the stick, because we're kind of running out of patience. This is getting a little old for us," said the board's vice chair, <span class="per">Robert Ewanco</span>. Stadium Authority Director <span class="per">Mary Conturo</span> said it is possible for the developers to complete the amphitheater project in <span class="date">the nine months</span> projected, from <span class="date">August</span> to <span class="date">May 1, 2010</span>. "It's a tight schedule of course, but could be done," she said. Poor credit markets have affected the project, Continental Chairman Frank <span class="per">Kass</span> told the Post-Gazette <span class="date">this week</span>, and financing for the entertainment complex was impacted when Gov. <span class="per">Ed Rendell</span> cut a proposed state grant from $4 million to $2.5 million. <span class="per">Mr. Kass</span> said the outdoor construction of the amphitheater complex might be done by <span class="date">May 2010</span> but doubted the entire venue could.</p><br><br>
