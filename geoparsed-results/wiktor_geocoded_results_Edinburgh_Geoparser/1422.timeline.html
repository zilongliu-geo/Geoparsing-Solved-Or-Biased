  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is a western suburb of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is located 29 kilometres west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district and is the administrative centre for the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Fairfield</span> and is also partly in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Holroyd</span>. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is one of the most multicultural and culturally diverse cities in <span class="loc">Australia</span>, with more than half of the residents having been born overseas, mostly in non-English speaking countries. The majority of residents speak a language other than English at home, with the two most common ones being Arabic and Assyrian Neo-Aramaic. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is an ethnic enclave of Assyrians and Iraqis. For <span class="date">more than 30,000 years</span>, Aboriginal people from the Cabrogal-Gandangara tribe have lived in the <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> area. The earliest recorded visit to the <span class="loc">Fairfield District</span> by Europeans is described in <span class="per">William Bradley</span>'s Journal where he noted an expedition from <span class="loc">Rose Hill</span> to <span class="loc">Prospect Creek</span> to determine whether <span class="loc">Prospect Creek</span> led to <span class="loc">Botany Bay</span>. <span class="per">Bradley</span> described a place on the Creek where the water changed from fresh to salt with a drop of 4 feet (1.2 m). The presence of salt water confirmed <span class="loc">Prospect Creek</span>'s connection to the sea.</p><br><br>
