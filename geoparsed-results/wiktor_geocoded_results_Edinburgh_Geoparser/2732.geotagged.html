<p><span class="loc">Columbia</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Monroe</span> and St. <span class="loc">Clair counties</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, about 12 miles (19 km) south of St. Louis, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The population was 9,707 at the 2010 census. The first white settlers to come to the area of <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, were Frenchmen in the mid-17th century. They named the area in which <span class="loc">Columbia</span> was founded <span class="loc">L</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">Aigle</span>, which is French for "The Eagle." In the mid-18th century, the British took over the territory until the Revolutionary War forced them out of the area. The colonial American settlers soon arrived in the early 1780s and established the first permanent settlements in the area of <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, Fort Whiteside and Fort Piggott. Both frontier forts were of log construction and were used to protect the settlers against Indian raids. In 1820, <span class="loc">Columbia</span> was plotted out as a town and built on bluffs 500 feet above sea level to protect against the flooding of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. <span class="loc">Columbia</span> is a poetic name for the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Germans began immigrating to the area around 1833, with the majority coming in the 1840s. <span class="loc">United States</span> land agents had traveled to <span class="loc">Germany</span> to sell land to emigrating Germans. When the immigrants arrived in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, they traveled immediately to their own parcels of land.</p>
