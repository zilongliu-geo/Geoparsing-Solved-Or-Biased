<p>Stanton is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Powell County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,733 at the 2010 census. Stanton is the birthplace of Hall of Fame thoroughbred horse trainer Woody Stephens. The first post office to be located in present-day <span class="loc">Stanton</span> was established on July 7, 1849 and was named Beaver Pond, because of the settlement's proximity to a small body of water resulting from a beaver dam. In 1852, both the post office and the settlement were renamed Stanton for Richard H. Stanton, who served in Congress from 1849–1855 and later as a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> senator. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Stanton (and nearby <span class="loc">Clay City</span>) were booming logging centers for Eastern <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The city was also connected to much of the country by a railroad that went through the city and county. Since then the railroad has bee removed. The original train depot still exists and is home to the Powell County Tourism Association. Stanton is located at 37°50′51″N 83°51′33″W (37.847610, -83.859250).
