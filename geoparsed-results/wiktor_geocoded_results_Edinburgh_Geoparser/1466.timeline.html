  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, was a silver-mining town in <span class="loc">Pershing County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>, approximately 110 mi (180 km) east of <span class="loc">Reno</span>. It is <span class="date">now</span> a ghost town. <span class="loc">Lower Rochester</span> is still accessible to visitors, but was largely destroyed by a wildfire in <span class="date">2012</span>; <span class="loc">Upper Rochester</span> has been buried under mine tailings of the more recent Coeur <span class="loc">Rochester</span> open pit mine. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> is the collective name for three different sites: <span class="loc">Rochester Heights</span>, <span class="loc">Upper Rochester</span> and <span class="loc">Lower Rochester</span>, spread out along a 3 mi (4.8 km) stretch of <span class="loc">Rochester</span> Canyon. When gold was discovered here in the 1860s by immigrants from <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, there was only one camp, at the upper end of the canyon. Later this became known as <span class="loc">Rochester</span> Heights (often, along with <span class="loc">Upper Rochester</span>, called “<span class="loc">Old Town</span>”). Exploration and mining was on a fairly small scale from the 1860s, with the ore processed on a small scale, or shipped by wagon to larger towns for milling. Although there was always a presence of sorts in <span class="loc">Rochester</span> from <span class="date">1861</span> on, it was not until a discovery by <span class="per">Joseph Nenzel</span> of rich silver ore in <span class="date">1912</span> that <span class="loc">Rochester</span> became a true boom town. By <span class="date">November 1912</span>, as word of the find spread, people streamed into the area. The town expanded and <span class="loc">Upper Rochester</span> came into being, as well as the beginnings of what became known as <span class="loc">Lower Rochester</span>. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> Heights was soon lumped in with <span class="loc">Upper Rochester</span>, and those towns became collectively known as <span class="loc">Old Town</span>, with <span class="loc">Lower Rochester</span> being the new town. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> Canyon is a fairly narrow canyon, with steep slopes on either side of the narrow canyon floor, and so the camps tended to spread down the canyon, rather than outwards. As more and more people came to the area, the two camps soon boasted saloons, hotels and other businesses. Upper and <span class="loc">Lower Rochester</span> became thriving mining sites, with a population exceeding 1,500. Most of the commercial district was in <span class="loc">Upper Rochester</span>, with <span class="loc">Lower Rochester</span> having the mill and other mining support facilities. The town boasted of having The <span class="loc">Rochester</span> Philharmonic Orchestra.</p><br><br>
