<p><span class="loc">Margate</span> is a seaside town in the <span class="loc">district of Thanet</span> in <span class="loc">Kent</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies 38.1 miles (61.3 km) east-north-east of <span class="loc">Maidstone</span>, on the coast along the <span class="loc">North Foreland</span> and contains the areas of <span class="loc">Cliftonville</span>, <span class="loc">Garlinge</span>, <span class="loc">Palm Bay</span> and <span class="loc">Westbrook</span>. <span class="loc">Margate</span> was recorded as "Meregate" in 1264 and as "Margate" in 1299, but the spelling continued to vary into modern times. The name is thought to refer to a pool gate or gap in a cliff where pools of water are found, often allowing swimmers to jump in. The cliffs of the <span class="loc">Isle of Thanet</span> are composed of chalk, a fossil-bearing rock. The town's history is tied closely to the sea and it has a proud maritime tradition. <span class="loc">Margate</span> was a "limb" of <span class="loc">Dover</span> in the ancient confederation of the Cinque ports. It was added to the confederation in the 15th century. <span class="loc">Margate</span> has been a leading seaside resort for at least 250 years. Like its neighbour <span class="loc">Ramsgate</span>, it has been a traditional holiday destination for Londoners drawn to its sandy beaches. <span class="loc">Margate</span> had a Victorian pier which was largely destroyed by a storm in 1978.</p>
