  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Author to speak about <span class="loc">Neches</span> River. <span class="per">Richard Donovan</span>, author of “Paddling the <span class="per">Wild Neches</span>,” will be speaking in <span class="loc">Athens</span> on <span class="date">Monday</span> at the monthly meeting of the <span class="loc">East Texas Environmental Concerns</span> Organization. One of Texas’ last wild rivers, the <span class="loc">Neches</span> forms the eastern boundary of <span class="loc">Henderson County</span> and meanders over 400 miles from northwest of Tyler to the <span class="loc">Gulf of Mexico</span> near <span class="loc">Beaumont</span>. The <span class="loc">Neches</span> and its bottomland forests are home to a variety of wildlife -- bald eagles, deer, squirrels, otters, wood ducks, mallards, wild turkeys, and colorful songbirds. The public is invited to this event. For <span class="date">hundreds of years</span> the <span class="per">Neches</span> River Valley has nourished a succession of peoples -- <span class="per">Caddo</span> and <span class="per">Atakapa</span> Indians, then Spanish, French, and Mexican explorers, next early “Texian” settlers, finally the Anglo-Americans who came in droves to the new state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The <span class="loc">Neches</span> sustains half a million people, meeting the needs of municipalities and industries. Along the way, the river nourishes the forests of the <span class="per">Neches</span> River National Wildlife Refuge, the <span class="loc">Davy Crockett National Forest</span> with its Big Slough <span class="per">Wilderness</span> and <span class="per">Neches</span> Overlook, the <span class="loc">Angelina National Forest</span> with its <span class="loc">Upland Island Wilderness</span>, the popular <span class="per">Martin Dies Jr.</span> State Park, the famed <span class="loc">Big Thicket National Preserve</span>, and thousands of acres of private land. In <span class="date">June 2006</span>, the director of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Fish and wildlife service gave approval to the <span class="per">Neches</span> River National Wildlife Refuge on a beautiful stretch of the upper <span class="loc">Neches</span> River in <span class="per">Anderson</span> and <span class="per">Cherokee</span> counties. With the donation of the first acre of land to the refuge the following <span class="date">August</span>, the Refuge was officially established. <span class="date">Now</span> the Texas water development board and the <span class="loc">city of Dallas</span>, who want to build a reservoir on the Refuge site, are suing the <span class="org">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</span> to try and overturn the Refuge. The 25,000 acres proposed for inclusion within the proposed refuge boundary contain some of the best remaining and least disturbed bottomland hardwood forest habitat left in <span class="loc">Texas</span>, rated as “Priority 1” by the USFWS. Adding land to the <span class="per">Neches</span> River National Wildlife Refuge will protect vital habitat for wildlife, including waterfowl and migratory songbirds, provide wonderful hunting and other outdoor recreational opportunities for the public, and serve as an economic boon to surrounding communities. The 540 national wildlife refuges in the lower 48 states fueled more than $809 million in sales. With bird watching and canoeing the fastest-growing nature activities in the state, <span class="loc">East Texas</span> has much to gain from the <span class="per">Neches</span> River National Wildlife Refuge. The monthly meeting of the <span class="loc">East Texas Environmental Concerns</span> Organization will be at <span class="date">6 p.m. Monday</span> at First Presbyterian Church in <span class="loc">Athens</span>. The meeting room is in the main building inside the back door.</p><br><br>
