  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Perth</span> (/ˈpɜːrθ/; Scottish Gaelic: Peairt [ˈpʰɛuɾt̪]) is a city in central <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, located on the banks of the <span class="loc">River Tay</span>. It is the administrative centre of <span class="loc">Perth</span> and <span class="loc">Kinross</span> council area and the historic <span class="loc">county of Perthshire</span>. According to the preliminary <span class="date">2011</span> census results <span class="loc">Perth</span>, including its immediate suburbs, has a population of 50,000. <span class="loc">Perth</span> has been known as The Fair City since the publication of the story Fair Maid of <span class="loc">Perth</span> by Scottish writer <span class="loc">Sir Walter Scott</span> in <span class="date">1828</span>. During the later medieval period the city was also called <span class="per">St</span> John's <span class="loc">Toun</span> or Saint Johnstoun by its inhabitants in reference to the main church dedicated to <span class="loc">St John</span> the <span class="loc">Baptist</span>. This name is preserved by the city's football team, <span class="per">St Johnstone F.C</span>. The name <span class="loc">Perth</span> comes from a Pictish word for wood or copse. There has been a settlement at <span class="loc">Perth</span> since prehistoric times, on a natural mound raised slightly above the flood plain of the <span class="loc">Tay</span>, where the river could be crossed at low tide. The area surrounding the modern city is known to have been occupied since Mesolithic hunter-gatherers arrived <span class="date">more than 8000 years ago</span>. Nearby Neolithic standing stones and circles also exist, dating from about <span class="date">4000 BC</span>, following the introduction of farming in the area.</p><br><br>
