<p><span class="loc">Glendale</span> (Scottish Gaelic: Gleann Dail) is a community-owned estate on the north-western coastline of the <span class="loc">Duirinish</span> peninsula on the island of <span class="loc">Skye</span> and is in the Scottish council area of Highland. The estate encompasses the small crofting townships of <span class="loc">Skinidin</span>, <span class="loc">Colbost</span>, <span class="loc">Fasach</span>, <span class="loc">Glasphein</span>, <span class="loc">Holmisdale</span>, <span class="loc">Lephin</span>, <span class="loc">Hamaraverin</span>, <span class="loc">Borrodale</span>, <span class="loc">Milovaig</span> and <span class="loc">Waterstein</span>. During the unsettled times of the late nineteenth century, when the local crofters sought land reform, this area played an important part in the struggle. After the Battle of the Braes in 1882, the unrest spread to <span class="loc">Glendale</span>. The landlords refused to allow the local population to collect wood from the shore for heating, and they had to use straw to thatch the houses as they were forbidden to cut rushes. Land was in short supply as the holdings had been sub-divided 40 years earlier to provide for those cleared from better land. Led by John MacPherson, the crofters demanded the return of the common grazing land that had been taken from them. Taking direct action, they began grazing their cattle on this land, court orders for their removal notwithstanding. Police action in January 1883 proved ineffective and eventually a government official was sent to <span class="loc">Skye</span> on board the navy gunboat HMS Jackal to conduct negotiations. Five crofters including MacPherson agreed to stand in a token trial. They were sentenced to two months in jail and became known as the "Glendale martyrs", and are commemorated by a memorial in the village. It was also agreed that a Royal Commission, which became the Napier Commission, would be set up to investigate the croftersâ€™ grievances, which eventually resulted in the far-reaching Crofters Act of 1886.</p>
