  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lexington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Henderson County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Lexington</span> is midway between <span class="per">Memphis</span> and <span class="per">Nashville</span>, lying ten miles (16 km) south of Interstate 40, which connects the two cities. The population was 7,473 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Henderson County</span>. Shortly after the <span class="date">1821</span> creation of <span class="loc">Henderson County</span>, a site near its center was chosen as a site for a county seat, and was named <span class="loc">Lexington</span> in honor of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, site of the first battle of the American Revolution. The first county courthouse was built in <span class="date">1823</span>; <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1824</span> and by <span class="date">1830</span> had a population of 260. As the lead-up to the American Civil War began, <span class="loc">Henderson County</span> voted against secession. As the war progressed, both <span class="org">Union</span> and Confederate regiments were recruited in the county. The area in and around <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was the site of a skirmish on <span class="date">December 18, 1862</span>. <span class="org">Union</span> Colonel <span class="per">Robert Ingersoll</span> sent his troops to destroy a bridge over the <span class="loc">Beech Creek</span> to disallow Confederate army to move into the area. However, <span class="per">Ingersoll</span>'s troops did not destroy the bridge and General <span class="per">Nathan Bedford Forrest</span>'s troops headed into <span class="loc">Lexington</span>. <span class="per">Forrest</span>'s troops overtook the <span class="org">Union</span> soldiers, taking over 140 men, including <span class="per">Colonel Ingersoll</span>, and collected artillery and supplies left behind by <span class="org">Union</span> soldiers who escaped.</p><br><br>
