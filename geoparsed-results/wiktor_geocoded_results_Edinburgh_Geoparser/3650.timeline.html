  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Burra</span> is a pastoral centre and historic tourist town in the mid-north of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It lies east of the <span class="loc">Clare</span> Valley in the <span class="loc">Bald Hills</span> range, part of the northern Mount Lofty Ranges, and on <span class="loc">Burra Creek</span>. The town began as a single company mining township that, by <span class="date">1851</span>, was a set of townships (company, private and government-owned) collectively known as "The <span class="loc">Burra</span>". The <span class="loc">Burra</span> mines supplied 89% of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>'s and 5% of the world's copper for <span class="date">15 years</span>, and the settlement has been credited (along with the mines at <span class="loc">Kapunda</span>) with saving the economy of the struggling new colony of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. The <span class="loc">Burra</span> <span class="loc">Burra</span> Copper Mine was established in <span class="date">1848</span> mining the copper deposit discovered in <span class="date">1845</span>. Miners and townspeople migrated to <span class="loc">Burra</span> primarily from <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span> and <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The mine first closed in <span class="date">1877</span>, briefly opened again early in the 20th century and for a last time from <span class="date">1970</span> to <span class="date">1981</span>. When the mine was exhausted and closed the population shrank dramatically and the townships, for <span class="date">the next 100 years</span>, supported pastoral and agricultural activities. <span class="date">Today</span> the town continues as a centre for its surrounding farming communities and, being one of the best-preserved towns of the Victorian era in <span class="loc">Australia</span>, as a historic tourist centre.</p><br><br>
