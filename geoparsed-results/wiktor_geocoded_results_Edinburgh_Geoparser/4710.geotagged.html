<p>David (Spanish pronunciation: [daˈβið]) officially San José de David is a city and corregimiento located in the west of <span class="loc">Panama</span>. It is the capital of the <span class="loc">province of Chiriquí</span> and has an estimated population of 144,858 inhabitants as confirmed in 2013. It is a relatively affluent city with a firmly established, dominant middle class and a very low unemployment and poverty index. The Pan-American Highway is a popular route to David. The development of the banking sector, public construction works such as the expansion of the airport and the David-Boquete highway alongside the growth of commercial activity in the city have increased its prominence as one of the fastest growing regions in the country. The city is currently the economic center of the <span class="loc">Chiriqui province</span> and produces more than half the gross domestic product of the province, which totals 2.1 billion. It is known for being the third-largest city in the country both in population and by GDP and for being the largest city in Western <span class="loc">Panama</span>. David was founded in 1602, by Francisco de Gama, advisor to the governor Juan López de <span class="loc">Siqueira</span> and under his mandate. The city had been founded in the area where the Bolivar park is currently located. In those times, the city was divided into three regions, one fit for Spanish residence, and another two of lesser areas known as "<span class="loc">San Antonio</span> de <span class="loc">Padra</span>", "David" and "Nuestra Señora del <span class="loc">Rosario</span>". At the end of the 19th century, David had six streets, but only four were populated, making up the city center, in the sector currently known as Barrio Bolívar. The <span class="loc">Ermita</span> de San José, (currently the San José Cathedral) was located in that area. In March 1900, the Bolívar Park was the scene of the first battle of the "Thousand Days' War", between liberals and conservatives who would later march on towards the capital to wage war against each other.</p>
