  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Goro</span> was one of the 77 woredas in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. This woreda was named after one of the sub-groups of the Sebat Bet Gurage, the <span class="loc">Goro</span>. Part of the <span class="loc">Gurage Zone</span>, <span class="loc">Goro</span> was bordered on the south by the <span class="loc">Wabe</span> River which separates it from <span class="loc">Cheha</span>, on the west and north by the <span class="loc">Oromia Region</span>, on the farther east by Kokir Gedebano Gutazer, and on the southeast by Ezhana Wolene. The major town in <span class="loc">Goro</span> was <span class="per">Welkite</span>. <span class="loc">Goro</span> was divided for Abeshge, <span class="per">Kebena</span> and <span class="per">Welkite</span> woredas.

Based on figures published by the Central Statistical Agency in <span class="date">2005</span>, this woreda has an estimated total population of 169,000, of whom 84,033 are men and 84,967 are women; 27,775 or 16.43% of its population are urban dwellers, which is greater than the Zone average of 6.3%.
