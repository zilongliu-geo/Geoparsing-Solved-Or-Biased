  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">U.S.</span> tries to thaw chilly relationship. Over <span class="date">the past year</span>, the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Russia</span> have been drifting into a hostile relationship, driven by the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> decision to install anti-missile defences in eastern <span class="loc">Europe</span>, the war in <span class="loc">Georgia</span> <span class="date">last August</span>, and the recent fiasco over Russian natural gas supplies to <span class="loc">Europe</span>. There was nervous chatter about a new Cold War, but <span class="date">last month</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Vice-President <span class="per">Joe Biden</span> said that the <span class="per">Obama</span> administration was going to "press the reset button" in its relations with <span class="loc">Russia</span>. <span class="date">Now</span> it has done it. At the <span class="org">NATO</span> summit on <span class="date">March 5</span>, the alliance agreed to resume high-level contacts with <span class="loc">Moscow</span> in the NATO-Russia Council, which were suspended after the Georgian war. <span class="date">The following day</span>, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Secretary of State <span class="per">Hillary Clinton</span> met Russian Foreign Minister <span class="per">Sergei Lavrov</span> in <span class="loc">Brussels</span> and gave him a mock reset button. "There was a rather confrontational approach toward <span class="loc">Russia</span> in the prior administration," she explained. None of the disputes and misunderstandings between <span class="loc">Washington</span> and <span class="loc">Moscow</span> came from a hostile intent on either side. Take the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defences being built in <span class="loc">Poland</span> and the <span class="loc">Czech Republic</span>. The Bush administration said the interceptor missiles and radars of the system were there to intercept nuclear-tipped, long-range missiles fired by <span class="loc">Iran</span> and expected the Russians to believe it. Not surprising, the Russians didn't believe it, because <span class="loc">Iran</span> has neither missiles capable of reaching the <span class="loc">United States</span> nor any nuclear warheads to put on them. So <span class="loc">Moscow</span> thought the ABM system was really intended to shoot down Russian missiles and thus undermine the country's ability to deter the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Russia</span> worked itself into such a lather over the ABM missiles that President <span class="per">Dmitry Medvedev</span> announced on the day after <span class="per">Barack Obama</span>'s election victory <span class="date">last November</span> that short-range Russian missiles would be installed in <span class="loc">Kaliningrad</span>, a Russian enclave on the Polish border, to destroy those American bases on short notice. But the ABM missiles are in the wrong place to intercept Russian ICBMs, and they don't really work anyway. They have never worked properly, despite tens of billions of dollars poured into the ABM project (a.k.a. "Star Wars," National Missile Defence, etc.) during <span class="date">the past quarter</span>-century. The sole practical result of the program, over the whole of its existence, has been to pour money into the pockets of American defence contractors. But the Russians are too paranoid to accept that, and the program has such strong support in Congress that the <span class="per">Obama</span> administration is merely "reviewing" it, rather than cancelling it outright. There are belligerent minor players on both sides, but the <span class="per">Obama</span> administration seems to have sent out orders to squelch them. <span class="date">Last week</span>, for example, a couple of Russian bombers flew to within a couple of hundred kilometres of <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s Arctic coast, a mere five thousand kilometres from the Canadian capital. <span class="loc">Canada</span> scrambled fighters to "send a strong signal that they should back off and stay out of our airspace," according to Defence Minister <span class="per">Peter MacKay</span>, and Prime Minister <span class="per">Stephen Harper</span> sternly declared that <span class="loc">Canada</span> would not be intimidated. "This government has responded every time the Russians have done that," he said. "We will defend our airspace." But the Russians were not in <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s airspace. "The Russians have conducted themselves professionally," responded <span class="per">Gen. Gene Renuart</span>, the American officer who commands NORAD, the Canada-U.S. air defence alliance, in an implicit rebuke to the sabre-rattling Canadians. That is probably just what the <span class="per">Obama</span> administration wants from <span class="loc">Russia</span>: a professional relationship between two grownup countries that know and respect the rules. For a start, <span class="per">Hillary Clinton</span> and <span class="per">Sergei Lavrov</span> committed the two countries to negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by <span class="date">the end of the year</span>, but more will follow. The tide has turned. <span class="per">Gwynne Dyer</span> is an independent journalist based in <span class="loc">London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>.</p><br><br>
