  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Baldwin</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Chemung County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 832 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town name is derived from <span class="per">Thomas</span> and <span class="per">Waterman</span> <span class="loc">Baldwin</span>, two of the earliest settlers of the area. The town is east of <span class="loc">Elmira</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Elmira Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. While it is most likely that hunters and trappers passed though the area in earlier <span class="date">years</span>, <span class="loc">Baldwin</span> was first settled around <span class="date">1813</span>, credit given to <span class="per">Charles</span> and <span class="per">Warren</span> <span class="loc">Granger</span> as being the first white settlers to the area. The brothers put down roots on what was first called "<span class="per">Hammond</span> Corners" and would later become <span class="loc">North Chemung</span>. The trek to their new home would have been difficult, due in part to thick virgin forest and ravines as well as swampland thick with underbrush. Soon after the <span class="org">Granger brothers</span>, <span class="per">Henry Tice</span> came to <span class="per">Hammond</span> Corners with his family from <span class="loc">Ulster County</span> in downstate <span class="loc">New York</span> in <span class="date">1815</span>. Also in <span class="date">1815</span> came <span class="per">Jason Hammond</span> with his five sons, <span class="per">Elisha, James</span>, <span class="per">Robert, David</span> and <span class="per">Cornelius</span>. In the <span class="date">years</span> that followed many more families came from <span class="loc">New England</span>, including <span class="per">Peter McCumber</span> for whom the area known as "<span class="per">McCumber</span> Corners" is named. Other families were the <span class="loc">Whitakers</span>, Collsons, Browns, Elstons, Drakes and many more. Many of these families still reside in the township or have close ties.</p><br><br>
