<p>Upbeat mood at Obama's town hall meeting despite downbeat topics. A festive atmosphere envelopes the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> high school where the president appeared. Some tickets had been doled out by lottery, but one man arrived at 5 a.m. for a chance to get in. President Obama came to town to discuss somber subjects: the nation's distressed economy, the housing crisis and the budget deficit. But the mood at the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> high school where he held a town hall meeting Thursday was an upbeat mix of rock concert and campaign event. Vendors sold T-shirts, buttons, framed photos and baby onesies; one enterprising young woman advertised "Presidential Concessions" -- bottled water for $1. Tickets to the event at the campus just west of downtown were free and mostly given away through an online lottery. Some later ended up for sale on the Internet. Liz Bramhall's father bought her ticket on craigs list.com for $300. "I just wanted to see history," said the 20-year-old Camarillo resident. "I'll have memories to tell my kids and my grandkids." Paula Starr, 54, was visibly moved during Obama's speech.</p>
