  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Meta is a city in <span class="loc">Osage County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 229 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Jefferson City</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area and is also the world headquarters of <span class="org">Diamond Pet Foods</span>. Meta is located at 38°18′45″N 92°10′5″W (38.312471, -92.167999). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.35 square miles (0.91 km2), all of it land. The Following information is about the <span class="loc">city of Babbtown</span> and what effect the Rock Island Railroad had on the town of Meta. This area of <span class="loc">Osage County</span> was settled by German Lutherans in the 1860s, and a small catholic church, St. John's Lutheran Church, at <span class="loc">Babbtown</span> was built in <span class="date">1871</span>. The congregation still meets in the original building, which was constructed in <span class="date">1873</span>. When termites were discovered in the hewn log sills in <span class="date">the 1990s</span>, congregation members rebuilt the foundation by jacking up the walls section-by-section and cutting out and replacing the termite-riddled timbers and wall structure. By the late 19th century, the neighboring <span class="loc">city of Babbtown</span> had developed into a prominent town in the area, with a general store and post office across from the church, a blacksmith shop, and a Lutheran school, which was built in the late 1890s and held classes from <span class="date">1900</span>-<span class="date">1930</span>. The old schoolhouse was expanded in <span class="date">the 1970s</span> and again in <span class="date">the 1990s</span>, and is <span class="date">now</span> used as a parish building. Around <span class="date">1900</span>, however, the Rock Island Railroad was built through what is <span class="date">today</span> the town of Meta, and as that town grew, <span class="loc">Babbtown</span> dwindled away. The town of Meta was named after <span class="per">Meta Rowan</span>, the wife of <span class="per">Nathan</span> J. <span class="per">Rowan</span>.</p><br><br>
