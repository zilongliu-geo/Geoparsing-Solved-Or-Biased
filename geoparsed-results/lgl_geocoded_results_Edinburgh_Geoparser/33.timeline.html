  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Pool operators look to prevent another crypto outbreak. <span class="date">Last summer</span>, a crypto outbreak scared plenty of people away from public pools and water parks across <span class="loc">North Texas</span>. "No system will completely take crypto out of a pool," said <span class="per">Chris Swartz</span>, NRH{-2}O manager. "But this is state-of-the-art in recreational water management." The ultraviolet disinfection system is among the approaches cities and private water park operators are taking to address what has become a serious problem. <span class="date">Last year</span>, 476 cases of crypto were reported throughout <span class="loc">Tarrant County</span>. In <span class="date">July</span>, crypto was discovered in the water of Burger’s Lake in west <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span>; a swimmer was identified as the source of the infection. Throughout the <span class="date">summer</span>, cases of crypto were reported and linked to various public pools. Crypto cases are on the rise in <span class="loc">Texas</span> and nationwide and health officials aren’t sure why. <span class="date">Last year</span> in <span class="loc">Texas</span> there were 1,981 confirmed cases, up from 233 in <span class="date">2007</span>, according to the <span class="org">Texas Department of State Health Services</span>. The increase might be due to heightened awareness of the parasite and increased reporting, said Michele Hlavsa, an epidemiologist with <span class="org">the Centers for Disease Control</span> and Prevention. "Instead of thinking 'Where did I eat?’ people are thinking 'Where did I swim?’ " she said. What makes crypto so difficult to deal with is its resistance to normal levels of chlorine and ability to survive <span class="date">more than 10 days</span> in water. Many area cities plan to hyperchlorinate, or shock, pool water using high amounts of chorine. While that is an effective way to treat crypto, it cannot prevent an outbreak. The best thing people can do is avoid swimming if they have been sick, said <span class="per">David Jefferson</span>, environmental health manager for <span class="org">Tarrant County Public Health</span>. "What people have to remember is when you are in a swimming pool, you are in other people’s bodily fluids," he said. Even an ultraviolet system has limitations. The devices work by interfering with the DNA of a parasite, making it unable to reproduce. But the parasite must pass through the ultraviolet system, which can take six hours, before it comes back into the pool clean. "Before all the water gets treated, crypto is still sitting in the water," <span class="per">Hlavsa</span> said. Hyperchlorination does a great job of lowering the amount of crypto in a pool, but it doesn’t have a lasting effect, <span class="per">Hlavsa</span> said. Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, which had no crypto cases <span class="date">last year</span>, is among several facilities planning to hyperchlorinate its pools. "It’s the easiest and most effective thing to do," park spokeswoman <span class="per">Sharon Parker</span> said. <span class="org">Keller</span> has considered a UV system but for <span class="date">now</span> will focus on educating the public about healthy swimming habits and following the public health department’s recommendations, said <span class="per">Dona Roth Kinney</span>, director of parks and recreation. The bottom line is that it’s up to people to prevent an outbreak by avoiding public pools for <span class="date">10 days</span> if they have had gastrointestinal symptoms, <span class="per">Jefferson</span> said. "Swimmers are bringing it into the pools, and they’re the ones who can keep it out," he said. Wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers. Change diapers in a bathroom or diaper-changing area and not at poolside. Wash children thoroughly with soap and water before they go swimming.</p><br><br>
