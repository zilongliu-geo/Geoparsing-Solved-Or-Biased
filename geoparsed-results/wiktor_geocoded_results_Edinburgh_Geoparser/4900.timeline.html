  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Oak Park is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Ventura County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. When developed in the <span class="loc">Simi Hills</span> in <span class="date">the late 1960s</span>, a single road provided the only access to the community from <span class="loc">Agoura Hills</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> in neighboring <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, Oak Park had a population of 14,266, down from 14,625 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. For statistical purposes, the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau has defined Oak Park as a census-designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. Oak Park has had human occupation from about <span class="date">5500 B.C.</span> to the present day. It lies within a zone including the early Millingstone Horizon and inland Chumash Indians. Indians camped throughout the area as they collected acorns, yucca, and other food. The sites in the area include major villages, smaller camps and several rock shelters. The location of Oak Park was originally part of Rancho Simi, a Spanish land concession in Alta <span class="loc">California</span> given in <span class="date">1795</span> to <span class="per">Francisco Javier Pico</span>, a soldier of the <span class="loc">Santa Barbara</span> company, and his two brothers, <span class="loc">Patricio</span> <span class="per">Pico</span> and <span class="per">Miguel</span> <span class="per">Pico</span> by the Spanish government. Lindero Canyon Road follows the western border (lindero in Spanish) of the land grant.</p><br><br>
