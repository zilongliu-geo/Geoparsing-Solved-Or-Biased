<p>Concord is a town in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,072 at the 2010 census. The unincorporated community of Concord is located in the town. The first non-Native American settlers in the region consisted entirely of settlers from <span class="loc">New England</span> as well as settlers from Upstate <span class="loc">New York</span> whose parents had moved to that region shortly after the American Revolution. These were "Yankee" settlers, meaning they were descended from the English Puritans who settled <span class="loc">New England</span> during the colonial era. They were primarily members of the Congregational Church though due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>. The Congregational Church subsequently has gone through many divisions and some factions are now known as the Church of Christ, United Church of Christ and Church of God. When the <span class="loc">New England</span> settlers arrived in what is now Concord there was nothing but a dense virgin forest and wild prairie. New Englanders and <span class="loc">New England</span> transplants from Upstate <span class="loc">New York</span> were the vast majority of <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>'s inhabitants during the first several decades of its history. As a result of this heritage Concord, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> was named after Concord, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. On February 1, 1860, Charles Ingalls married Caroline Quiner in Concord. Their daughter was Laura Ingalls Wilder, author of the Little House on the Prairie books.</p>
