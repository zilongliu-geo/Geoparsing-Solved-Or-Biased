  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Yixing</span> (simplified Chinese: 宜兴; traditional Chinese: 宜興; pinyin: Yíxīng) is a county-level city with a population of 1.24 million administrated under the prefecture-level <span class="loc">city of Wuxi</span> in <span class="loc">southern Jiangsu province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, and is part of the Yangtze River Delta. With active modern industry as the economical fundamentals, it is more famous for traditional Yixing clay and the pottery made from that—especially the "zisha"-style teapots. It is also famous in <span class="loc">China</span> for thousands of scholars and scientists born here, among whom there are 12 academicians of <span class="org">Chinese Academy of Sciences</span> and 13 academicians of <span class="org">Chinese Academy of Engineering</span>. <span class="loc">Yixing county</span> was established in <span class="date">221 B.C.</span>(Qin Dynasty) with the name of Yangxian(阳羡). Between <span class="date">303 A.D.</span> and <span class="date">310 A.D.</span>, the local aristocrat <span class="per">Zhou Qi</span> who was the eldest son of <span class="per">General Zhou Chu</span>, suppressed rebellions three times. And then <span class="loc">Yangxian</span> was renamed Yixing( 义兴,meaning loyalty and prosperity ) to honor <span class="per">Zhou Qi</span>. In <span class="date">976 A.D.</span>,Yixing(义兴) was renamed Yixing(宜兴) as a consequence of avoiding the use of the King's name (Zhao Kuangyi, Emperor Taizong of Song).</p><br><br>
