  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Medford</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, on the <span class="loc">Mystic River</span>, 3.2 miles northwest of downtown <span class="loc">Boston</span>. In the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, Medford's population was 56,173. It is the home of <span class="org">Tufts University</span>. <span class="loc">Medford</span> was settled in <span class="date">1630</span> as part of <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>. The area was originally called "Mistick" by <span class="per">Thomas Dudley</span> (a name which persisted for <span class="date">many decades</span>), which his party renamed "Meadford". In <span class="date">1634</span>, the land north of the <span class="loc">Mystic River</span> became the private plantation of former <span class="per">Governor Matthew Cradock</span>; across the river was Ten <span class="loc">Hills Farm</span>, which belonged to <span class="per">John Winthrop</span>, Governor of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts Bay</span> colony. The name may have come from a description of the "meadow by the ford" in the <span class="loc">Mystic River</span>, or from two locations in <span class="loc">England</span> that <span class="per">Cradock</span> may have known: the hamlet of <span class="loc">Mayford</span> or Metford in <span class="loc">Staffordshire</span> near <span class="loc">Caverswall</span>, or from the <span class="loc">parish of Maidford</span> or <span class="loc">Medford</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Towcester</span>, <span class="loc">Northamptonshire</span>). In <span class="date">1637</span>, the first bridge (a toll bridge) across the <span class="loc">Mystic River</span> was built at the site of the present-day <span class="loc">Cradock</span> Bridge, which carries Main Street into Medford Square. It would be the only bridge across the Mystic until <span class="date">1787</span>, and as such became a major route for traffic coming into <span class="loc">Boston</span> from the north (though ferries and fords were also used). The bridge would be rebuilt in <span class="date">1880</span> and <span class="date">1909</span>.</p><br><br>
