  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Milas</span> (ancient Greek Mylasa Μύλασα) is an ancient city and the seat of the district of the same name in <span class="loc">Muğla Province</span> in southwestern <span class="loc">Turkey</span>. The city commands a region with an active economy, and the region is very rich in history and its remains, the whole territory of <span class="loc">Milas district</span> containing a remarkable twenty-seven archaeological sites of note. The city was the first capital of ancient <span class="loc">Caria</span> and of the Anatolian beylik of Menteşe in medieval times. There was a Jewish community. The centre of <span class="loc">Milas</span> presents the overall characteristics of a well-grown city focused on agricultural and aquacultural processing, related industrial activities, services, transportation (particularly since the opening of Milas-Bodrum Airport), tourism and culture. The center is at a distance of about twenty km from the coast and is actually closer to the airport than <span class="loc">Bodrum</span> itself, with many late arrival passengers of the high season increasingly opting to stay in <span class="loc">Milas</span> rather than in <span class="loc">Bodrum</span> where accommodation is likely to be difficult to find. <span class="loc">Milas district</span> covers a total area of <span class="date">2167</span> km2 and this area follows a total coastline length of 150 km, both to the north-west in the Gulf of Güllük and to the south along the Gulf of Gökova, and to these should be added the shores of <span class="loc">Lake Bafa</span> in the north divided between the district area of <span class="loc">Milas</span> and that of <span class="loc">Aydın district</span> of Söke.</p><br><br>
