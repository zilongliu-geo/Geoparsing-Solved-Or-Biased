  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Houston is a city in <span class="loc">Houston County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 979 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The community was named after <span class="loc">Sam Houston</span>, first president of the Republic of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. In <span class="date">1852</span>, <span class="per">William McSpadden</span> platted the original site of the Village of Houston. <span class="per">McSpadden</span> had served under <span class="loc">Sam Houston</span> in the Mexican-American War. Pioneers followed him into the area and by <span class="date">1854</span> there were stores and a school among the approximately 40 buildings in the settlement. Houston was incorporated in <span class="date">1874</span>. "Houston Hoedown <span class="date">Days</span>" is the last full <span class="date">weekend</span> in <span class="date">July</span>. The event includes tractor pulls, the <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> State Horsepull, dances and flea markets. The "International Festival of Owls" is held each year in Houston, and is the only full-weekend, all-owl event in <span class="loc">North America</span>. Houston is the eastern terminus of the <span class="loc">Root River</span> segment of the Blufflands State Trail. In <span class="date">November 2008</span> the Houston Hurricanes won the <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> 9-Man Football State Championship. They ended their season with a 14-0 mark. This is the first State Championship in school history, with the exception of five state appearances by the girls track teamâ€”which included a state title in <span class="date">2006</span>.</p><br><br>
