  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Providence was a short-lived silver mining town located in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Bernardino County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It existed between <span class="date">1880</span> and <span class="date">1886</span>. The town of Providence was located on the east slope of the <span class="loc">Providence Mountains</span>. The site is just north of the Providence Mountain State Recreation Area. Parties of prospectors from <span class="loc">Ivanpah</span> found rich silver ore along the steep slopes of the <span class="loc">Providence Mountains</span> in the <span class="date">spring of 1880</span>. The richest property turned out to be the <span class="loc">Bonanza King</span>, which was soon sold to a pair of sharps—Wilson <span class="per">Waddingham</span> and <span class="per">Thomas</span> Ewing—who had just bilked investors in a mining-stock scheme in <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. Working 150 men, the two rapidly opened up the <span class="loc">Bonanza King</span> and put up a 20-stamp mill. A post office was established in mid-1882. Since Providence was basically a company camp, its business district remained limited to 2 general stores and 3 saloons. By then, the mine had produced $1.5 million in bullion. For reasons that remain unclear, <span class="loc">Waddingham</span> and <span class="loc">Ewing</span> began to lay off workers. The mill burned in mid-1885. A 5-stamp mill was built at the nearby Perseverance Mine in <span class="date">1886</span>, but the price of silver continued to slip, and the post office closed in <span class="date">1892</span>.</p><br><br>
