  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Amherst</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hillsborough County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 11,201 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Amherst</span> is home to <span class="loc">Ponemah Bog Wildlife Sanctuary</span>, <span class="loc">Hodgman State Forest</span>, the Joe English Reservation and <span class="loc">Baboosic Lake</span>. The town center village, where 613 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Amherst</span> census-designated place. The village is also listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> as <span class="per">Amherst</span> Village Historic District. Like many <span class="loc">New England</span> towns, <span class="per">Amherst</span> was the result of a land grant given to soldiers â€“ in this case, to soldiers in <span class="date">1728</span> who had participated in <span class="per">King Philip</span>'s War. Settled about <span class="date">1733</span>, it was first called "Narragansett Number 3", and then later "Souhegan Number 3." In <span class="date">1741</span>, settlers formed the Congregational church and hired the first minister. Chartered on <span class="date">18 January 1760</span> by Colonial Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span>, the town was named for <span class="per">General Lord Amherst</span>, who commanded British forces in <span class="loc">North America</span> during the French and <span class="org">Indian War</span>. <span class="per">Lord Jeffrey Amherst</span> is also infamous for initiating the practice of giving smallpox blankets to Native Americans in a genocidal effort "to Extirpate this Execrable Race" (as quoted from his letter to Colonel <span class="per">Henry Bouquet</span> on <span class="date">July 16, 1763</span>).</p><br><br>
