<p>Hope is a village in the Derbyshire Peak District, in <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies in the <span class="loc">Hope Valley</span>, at the point where <span class="loc">Peakshole Water</span> flows into the <span class="loc">River Noe</span>. To the north, <span class="loc">Win Hill</span> and <span class="loc">Lose Hill</span> stand either side of the Noe. Traces of a Roman fort can be found in the hamlet of Brough-on-Noe, just east of the village. Its Roman name was <span class="loc">Navio</span>, and was later renamed with the Old English word for fort, brough. Edward the Elder granted lands at Hope to Uhtred, son of Eadulf of <span class="loc">Bamburgh</span>. These grants were confirmed by Ã†thelstan. There are many remains from the site in Buxton Museum. The village is also known for its well dressing. Hope has a railway station on the <span class="loc">Sheffield</span> to <span class="loc">Manchester</span> (<span class="loc">Hope Valley</span>) line. It also has a small secondary school (see below), and is the site of a large quarry and cement works, largely hidden from the village. This cement works is the location of the local volunteer mountain rescue team - Edale Mountain Rescue. The parish church has two ancient crosses in its grounds. The shaft of a sandstone cross dating from the Anglo-Saxon period stands seven feet high and is carved on all faces. The cross may well have originated in the church grounds and a possible base now supports a sundial, but from the English Civil War until 1858, it was hidden in the village school. The stump of the <span class="loc">Eccles</span> Cross, originally near Eccles House, south of Hope, is also in the graveyard. Between 2 and 28 July 2011, the church was broken into and about 15 items dating as far back as 1662, including two silver chalices and a pewter plate, were found to have been stolen.</p>
