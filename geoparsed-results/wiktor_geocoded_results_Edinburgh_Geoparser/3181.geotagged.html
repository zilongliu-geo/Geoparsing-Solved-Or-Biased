<p>Mary (Turkmen: [mar…Ø]), formerly named <span class="loc">Merv</span>, <span class="loc">Meru</span> and Margiana, is a city on an oasis in the Karakum Desert, located on the Murghab river. It is the capital <span class="loc">city of Mary</span> Province, <span class="loc">Turkmenistan</span>. In 2009, Mary had a population of 123,000, up from 92,000 in the 1989 census. In Kerait tradition, Mary, mother of Jesus, was buried here. The ancient <span class="loc">city of Merv</span> was an oasis city on the Silk Road. It was occupied by Imperial <span class="loc">Russia</span> in 1884, triggering the Panjdeh Incident between Afghan forces and the Imperial Russian Army. The modern settlement was founded later that year as a Russian military and administrative post. A force of the British Indian Army consisting of a machine gun detachment comprising 40 Punjabi troops and a British officer resisted the Bolsheviks near <span class="loc">Merv</span> in August 1918 in what was the first direct confrontation between British and Russian troops since the Crimean War. Mary was developed by the Soviet Union as a center for cotton production through the use of extensive irrigation. In 1968, huge reserves of natural gas were discovered 20 kilometers west of the city.</p>
