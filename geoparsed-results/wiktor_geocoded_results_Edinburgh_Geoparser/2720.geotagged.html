<p>Holt is an unincorporated community within <span class="loc">Delhi Charter Township</span>, <span class="loc">Ingham County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. It is a census-designated place (CDP) used for statistical purposes. The population was 23,973 at the 2010 census. The community is southeast of <span class="loc">Lansing</span>, just south of I-96 between US-127 and M-99. The <span class="loc">city of Mason</span> is about 6 miles (9.7 km) southeast and the village of <span class="loc">Dimondale</span> is about 6 miles (9.7 km) west. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 4.3 square miles (11 km2), of which 4.3 square miles (11 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) (0.46%) is water. Holt is home to an ancient, glacial esker. This esker, the longest in <span class="loc">Michigan</span> at roughly twenty miles, can be traced from south <span class="loc">Lansing</span> through Holt to just beyond Mason. The first permanent settlers of Delhi Township, John Norris and Fred Luther, arrived in 1837. In 1850, 402 settlers resided in the township. By 1857, Delhi Center (now present-day <span class="loc">Holt</span>) had a post office, hotel, tavern, and several other businesses. The post office at Delhi Center was renamed Holt in 1860 to prevent confusion with <span class="loc">Delhi Mills</span> in <span class="loc">Washtenaw County</span>. Joseph Holt was the U.S. Postmaster General during that time.</p>
