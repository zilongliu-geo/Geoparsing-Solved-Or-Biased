  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>PSC official may face $24,000 in ethics fines. <span class="loc">Georgia</span>’s newest utility regulator could face more than $20,000 in fines for state ethics violations stemming from a <span class="date">2002</span> campaign. State Public Service Commissioner <span class="per">Lauren McDonald</span> didn’t quibble with the facts behind the ethics commission allegations, which were heard by an administratitve law judge <span class="date">Monday</span>. But <span class="per">McDonald</span> said he’d corrected his campaign disclosures <span class="date">years</span> ago, according to a transcript of his <span class="date">Monday</span> remarks. He asked that the case be dismissed because of its age, and that his fine be $5,000. <span class="per">McDonald</span>’s violations happened during his <span class="date">2002</span> PSC campaign. He lost to former commissioner <span class="per">Angela Speir</span>, then won the seat back <span class="date">last fall</span>. The ethics commission said <span class="per">McDonald</span> filed one report late and filed others with missing information. He failed to properly record 80 individual contributions totaling $46,000 and 14 expenditures totaling $76,000, for instance. <span class="per">McDonald</span> amended his filings to include the missing information after a complaint filed in <span class="date">2004</span>. He believed, he said, that “I was given a clean bill of health” then and was “surprised to say the least” <span class="date">last fall</span> after learning the state was pursuing the issue. State ethics law changed in <span class="date">2005</span>. It allows fines of up to $1,000 per violation, which the commission defines as each piece of bad information in a disclosure. An ethics commission witness said <span class="per">McDonald</span>’s fines could hit $24,000, based on an internal formula that weighs the seriousness of each violation.</p><br><br>
