<p><span class="loc">Pemba</span> is a port city in <span class="loc">Mozambique</span>. It is the capital of the province of <span class="loc">Cabo Delgado</span> and lies on a peninsula in <span class="loc">Pemba</span> Bay. The town was founded by the Niassa Company in 1904 as Porto Am√©lia, after the Queen of Portugal, at the peninsula's south western tip and has grown around a port. The city is renowned for its Portuguese colonial architecture. It was renamed <span class="loc">Pemba</span> at the end of Portuguese rule, in 1975. The city's inhabitants are primarily Swahili, Makondes, Macuas and Mwanis. Local languages that are spoken are Kimwani and Macua, although Portuguese is widespread. In the centre of <span class="loc">Pemba</span>, there is an authentic local market or <span class="loc">Souk</span>, where arts and crafts, as well as traditional silverware can be bought. <span class="loc">Pemba</span> is also renowned as being a prime destination for water sport and diving enthusiasts as a coral reef lies close to the shore. <span class="loc">Pemba</span> has increasingly become a tourist destination, particularly for upper-middle class Mozambicans and South Africans. There is now a weekly flight from <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span> to <span class="loc">Pemba</span>, a hotel, the <span class="loc">Pemba</span> Beach Hotel, restaurants, and other forms of entertainment. <span class="loc">Pemba</span> is the closest major city and airport for those who wish to visit <span class="loc">Quirimbas</span> Islands and <span class="loc">Quirimbas</span> National Park.</p>
