<p>Sharon is a city in <span class="loc">Mercer County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, 75 miles (121 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. It is part of the Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, <span class="loc">OH-PA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area and is also included in the more extensive Youngstown-Warren, OH-PA Combined Statistical Area. Sharon was settled in 1795, incorporated as a borough on October 6, 1841, and incorporated as a city on December 17, 1918. The city operated under the PA third-class city charter until 2008, at which point it adopted a home rule charter under which the elected position of mayor was replaced with a hired city manager and financial officer. The founding families of Sharon first settled on a flat plain bordering the <span class="loc">Shenango</span> River (this area is situated between two hills and is the current location of Sharon's downtown business district). According to local legend, the community received its name from a Bible-reading settler who likened the location to the <span class="loc">Plain of Sharon</span> in <span class="loc">Israel</span>. Initially a center of coal mining, Sharon's economy transitioned to steelmaking and other heavy industry following the Industrial Revolution. Following the extensive national deindustrialization of the 1970s and 80's, the city's economy diversified and is now based primarily on light industry, education, health care, and social services.</p>
