  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Claims dismissed in <span class="loc">Worthington</span> immigration raid . <span class="loc">MINNEAPOLIS</span> -- A federal judge has dismissed all claims against the <span class="org">Department of Homeland Security</span> over an immigration raid at the <span class="org">Swift &amp; Co.</span> meatpacking plant in <span class="loc">Worthington</span>. The <span class="loc">U.S.</span> attorney's office says <span class="per">Judge Joan Ericksen</span> dismissed the claims <span class="date">last Friday</span>. The lawsuit was filed by 10 people who claimed their constitutional rights were violated during the <span class="date">Dec. 12, 2006</span>, enforcement action dubbed Operation Wagon Train. The raid followed a 10-month investigation into the alleged use and distribution of fraudulent identity documents by Swift employees in six states. Immigration agents arrested 239 people on immigration violations in <span class="loc">Worthington</span>, out of a total of more than 1,200. Twenty of them were also charged with identity theft or related counts. <span class="per">Ericksen</span> ruled that the government's search warrant established a sufficient basis for questioning the workers about their citizenship, and that the agents were entitled to detain people who were present there.</p><br><br>
