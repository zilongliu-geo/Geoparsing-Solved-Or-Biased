In <span class="date">February last year</span>, the Lebanese government said it would give all foreigners, including Iraqi refugees, who stayed in the country after their visas expired, a three-month period during which they could legalize their status. But it remains unclear exactly how many Iraqis regulated their status during that time. <span class="loc">BEIRUT</span>: The body of an Iraqi national was discovered on <span class="date">Saturday</span>, a police report said. <span class="per">Mohammad Abed</span> al-Wahab, born in <span class="date">1952</span>, was found dead in the town of Maameltein, Keserwan. The cause of death has not yet been confirmed, but a forensics team is investigating.</p><br><br>
