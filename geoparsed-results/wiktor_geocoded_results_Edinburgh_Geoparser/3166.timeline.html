  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lowell</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along the <span class="loc">Muskingum River</span>. The population was 549 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The first European settlers to the land that would become <span class="loc">Lowell</span> arrived in the late 18th century after the <span class="date">1787</span> Northwest Ordinance opened the territory for settlement. Soon after the Ordinance took effect, the <span class="org">Ohio Company of Associates</span> purchased 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km2) of land along the <span class="loc">Muskingum River</span> and proceeded to survey the area. The first settlement in what would become the state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span> was <span class="loc">Marietta</span>, founded in <span class="date">1788</span> near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Muskingum</span> about 14 miles (23 km) downstream from the site that would become <span class="loc">Lowell</span>. By <span class="date">1789</span>, settlement had spread north to the area where the <span class="loc">Cats Creek</span> enters the <span class="loc">Muskingum River</span>. By the 1830s the <span class="loc">Muskingum</span> Valley had long been settled, and local leaders created a plan to improve the <span class="loc">Muskingum River</span> for use as a source of power. In <span class="date">1836</span> the State Legislature approved a bill that appropriated $400,000 to create a series of locks and dams along the river as far north as <span class="loc">Dresden</span>. Between <span class="date">1837</span> and <span class="date">1841</span>, eleven dams and twelve locks were built at a cost that had ballooned to over $1.6 million. The third lock was built within a one mile (1.6 km) long canal constructed near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Cats Creek</span> to bypass a series of rapids in the <span class="loc">Muskingum</span>. Two competing companies bought land near the canal with the intentions of building a town. The first settlement was laid out on <span class="date">November 8, 1837</span> and was named <span class="loc">Lowell</span> with the idea that it would grow into a large manufacturing city similar to <span class="loc">Lowell</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. It was located along the upper end of the canal on the west side of the <span class="loc">Cats Creek</span>. The second settlement, called Buell's <span class="loc">Lowell</span>, was laid out on <span class="date">March 22, 1838</span>. The second settlement quickly grew to dominate to the point that the first settlement became known as <span class="loc">Upper Lowell</span>. In <span class="date">1850</span>, Buell's <span class="loc">Lowell</span> was incorporated as a village and in <span class="date">1889</span> officially changed its name to <span class="loc">Lowell</span>.</p><br><br>
