<p><span class="loc">Churchill</span> is a village in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Churchill and Sarsden</span> about 3 miles (5 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Chipping Norton</span>, <span class="loc">Oxfordshire</span> in the <span class="loc">Cotswolds</span> Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 663. Churchill's toponym has evolved through forms including Cercelle, Churchell, and <span class="loc">Cherchell</span>, reaching its current form was in use by 1537. The origin of the name is uncertain, though it may come from the Old English cyrc, meaning a hill, burial ground, or barrow. (The village does contain several barrows, suggesting the existence of a settlement here from prehistoric times.) However, the name may come from Cyrc-hill, literally Hill-hill â€” a common construction formed by Anglo-Saxon incomers who did not understand the meaning of a Celtic root (cf. the etymology of <span class="loc">Pendle Hill</span>). <span class="loc">Churchill</span> was originally at the foot of a hill now called Hastings Hill, but on 31 July 1684 a fire destroyed 20 houses and many other buildings, and killed four people. The village was rebuilt higher up the hill, with stone houses instead of the old timber-framed and thatched cottages. The fire was apparently caused by a baker who, to avoid chimney tax, had knocked through the wall from her oven to her neighbour's chimney. The old village can still be seen as grassy mounds in the pastures around the Heritage Centre.</p>
