<p>Weston is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) located in Franklin Township, in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the CDP's population was 1,235. Situated on the east side of the <span class="loc">Millstone River</span> north of <span class="loc">East Millstone</span> and south of <span class="loc">Zarephath</span> (which has grown to include some of the area once considered Weston), early names used for the area were Schenck's Mill, Van Neste's Mill and <span class="loc">Frogtown</span>. Historically, an area on the west side of the river in what is now part of the <span class="loc">borough of Manville</span> was also referred to as Weston. The Weston Causeway is the only bridge across the <span class="loc">Millstone River</span> between <span class="loc">East Millstone</span> and the confluence with the <span class="loc">Raritan River</span> near South Bound Brook. Heinrich/Henry Schenck built a grist mill on the east bank of the Millstone here, probably in the 1740s. His brother, Peter, built a mill upstream at Blackwells Mills about the same time and both were called Schenck's Mill. Three of Henryâ€™s sons, Abraham, John and Henry were in the second graduating class of 14 students of the newly founded Queen's College that later became Rutgers University.</p>
