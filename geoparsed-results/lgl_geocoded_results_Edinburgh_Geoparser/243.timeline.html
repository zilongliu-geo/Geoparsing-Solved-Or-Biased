  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Man recovers after 'killer bee' attack in Silverado Ranch area. A 53-year-old man remained hospitalized <span class="date">Sunday</span>, <span class="date">a day</span> after being stung "a couple thousand times" in what authorities are calling the worst bee attack around <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> in <span class="date">20 years</span>. The man accidentally disturbed a nest of Africanized honey bees, also known as "killer bees," when he overturned a boulder while operating a backhoe, <span class="org">Clark County Fire Department</span> spokesman <span class="per">Scott Allison</span> said <span class="date">Sunday</span>. The incident happened in a Silverado Ranch neighborhood near <span class="per">Spencer Street</span> and <span class="loc">Eldorado</span> Lane. He was listed in stable condition <span class="date">Sunday</span> in the intensive care unit at <span class="per">St. Rose</span> Dominican Hospital-Siena campus, hospital spokeswoman <span class="per">Kim Haley</span> said. <span class="per">Haley</span> said the man was stung a couple thousand times, and it was uncertain how long he would have to remain hospitalized. The man was stung on his face, arms, neck and back, <span class="per">Allison</span> said, and firefighters sprayed bees off him with a hose. "There were so many that they couldn't see the skin on his back when they got to him," he told The Associated Press. "They said it was a black mass of bees on his back continuing to sting him. "One of the vector control guys with the county said it was the biggest hive he had ever seen. He guessed it weighed about 50 pounds," he added. While not native to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>, killer bees are well established in southern <span class="loc">Nevada</span>. In <span class="date">2000</span>, a 77-year-old <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> woman was stung about 500 times and survived. In <span class="date">2003</span>, a horse in <span class="loc">Pahrump</span> was killed after being attacked. "I've been on the department for <span class="date">20 years</span> and don't remember an attack this bad," <span class="per">Allison</span> said. " (Responders) told me it was like something out of a horror movie." Experts urge people under attack to run as fast as possible, saying it's possible to outrun bees if one can run fast and far enough. They also urge people not to jump in swimming pools, saying bees can see people and wait for them there.</p><br><br>
