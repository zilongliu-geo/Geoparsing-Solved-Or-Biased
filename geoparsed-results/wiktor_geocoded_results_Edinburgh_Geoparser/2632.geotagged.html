<p>Logan is a city in <span class="loc">Cache County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census the population was 48,174, with an estimated population of 48,997 in 2014. Logan is the county seat of <span class="loc">Cache County</span> and the principal city of the Logan, <span class="loc">UT-ID Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which includes <span class="loc">Cache County</span> and <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. The <span class="loc">Logan metropolitan</span> area contained 125,442 people as of the 2010 census. In 2005 and 2007, Morgan Quitno declared the <span class="loc">Logan metropolitan</span> area the safest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Logan is the location of the main campus of Utah State University. The town of Logan was founded in 1859 by settlers sent by Brigham Young to survey for the site of a fort near the banks of the <span class="loc">Logan River</span>. They named their new community "Logan" for Ephraim Logan, an early fur trapper in the area. Logan was incorporated on 17 January 1866. Brigham Young College was founded here in 1878 (but later closed), and Utah State University – then called the Agricultural College of <span class="loc">Utah</span> – was founded in 1888. Logan's growth reflects settlement and post-war booms along with other changes incident to conditions in the West. Logan grew to about 20,000 in the mid-1960s, and by 2010 its population was approaching 50,000. See the population chart below in this article.</p>
