  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Langa</span> is a suburb found in Cape Town, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It was established in <span class="date">1927</span> in terms of the <span class="date">1923</span> Urban Areas Act. Similar to <span class="loc">Nyanga</span>, <span class="loc">Langa</span> is one of the many areas in <span class="loc">South Africa</span> that were designated for Black Africans before the apartheid era. It is the oldest of such suburbs in Cape Town and was the location of much resistance to apartheid. <span class="loc">Langa</span> is also where several people were killed on <span class="date">21 March 1960</span> same day as the Sharpeville massacre, during the anti-pass campaign. On <span class="date">21 March 2010</span>, <span class="date">now</span> <span class="date">50 years later</span>, a monument was unveiled by the government in remembrance of the people who lost their lives. <span class="loc">Langa</span> is bordered by <span class="date">Jan</span> Smuts Drive to the west, the N2 to the south, the N7 to the east and is served by <span class="loc">Langa</span> Railway Station. Although <span class="loc">Langa</span> literally means "sun" in Xhosa, the name of the township is derived from the name of Langalibalele - a chief and renowned rainmaker who in <span class="date">1873</span> was imprisoned on <span class="loc">Robben Island</span> for rebelling against the Natal government. Various prominent people fought for his release and he was subsequently confined to a farm called "Uitvlugt", which is on the site of present-day <span class="loc">Pinelands</span>. <span class="loc">Langa</span>, which adjoins <span class="loc">Pinelands</span>, commemorates this folk hero as it was developed in <span class="date">1898</span> on the land known as "Langalibalele's Location". Hence <span class="loc">Langa</span> is often called "Kwa-Langa" meaning "place of <span class="loc">Langa</span>".</p><br><br>
