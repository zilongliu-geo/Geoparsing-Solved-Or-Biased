<p><span class="loc">San Francisco</span> is a city located at the far east border of the <span class="loc">province of Córdoba</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, and parts of the city are beyond the border into the province of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>. In the city National Routes 19 and 158 intersect. It is the fourth most populated city in the <span class="loc">province of Córdoba</span>, with about 59,000 inhabitants, and the head city of the San Justo Department. <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> is located on <span class="loc">Cordoba</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>'s provincial borders. The city is also located in a geographic depression. Frequently during the heavy summer rains the entire city floods with up to two feet of water that covers the city's streets. The city is centered on Plaza <span class="loc">San Martin</span> which is a large brick plaza used for a variety of demonstrations and festivals. Most of the city streets are laid cobble stone that have been polished black from traffic. The town was founded on 9 September 1886 by José Bernardo Iturraspe, as part of a colonization plan of the provincial government. The current location of the city is slightly south of the original settlement and dates from 1888. Around that same time railroads of the Córdoba Central Railway reached the area. The settlement was officially declared a city in 1915. A large portion of the city's population is made up of immigrants and World War I and II refugees from <span class="loc">Europe</span>, a large concentration of them being from the region of <span class="loc">Piedmont</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>.</p>
