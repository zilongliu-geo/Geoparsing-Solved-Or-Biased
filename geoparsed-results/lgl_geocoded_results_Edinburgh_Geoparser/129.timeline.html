  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>2 from planning board vie for council seat. <span class="org">ISLE OF PALMS</span> â€” Two members of the city Planning Commission will appear on the <span class="date">May 12</span> ballot for a special election to fill Mayor Dick Cronin's unexpired City Council term. <span class="per">Barbara Bergwerf</span>, 65, commission member, and commission Chairman <span class="per">Ron Denton</span>, 46, both have filed for the seat. Concerns about the community's short-term rentals and development prompted <span class="per">Bergwerf</span>, a retired artist and photographer, to run. "I feel like I could do more for the community on the City Council than the planning commission," she said. <span class="per">Bergwerf</span> said no one, herself included, is against renting out island homes, but she is concerned with large six- to 10-bedroom homes being built within residential neighborhoods. "I'm concerned about development on the island and <span class="date">the future</span> development of the island," she said. <span class="per">Denton</span>, an architect, said he is running to unify the community. "I just want to bring cohesiveness between those who live in Wild Dunes, those who live outside Wild Dunes and a cohesive conclusion to concerns regarding short-term rentals," he said. The Planning Commission has been reviewing the city's current short-term rental ordinance to judge its effectiveness. <span class="per">Denton</span> said some people in the community would like stricter laws, but he said the law needs examination before the city makes anymore changes. <span class="per">Denton</span> said he would keep his eye on the city budget as a councilman. City officials have embarked on a number of projects, including building a new public safety building, he said. <span class="loc">Cronin</span> was elected to finish out the former mayor's term in <span class="date">February</span>. His council seat is up for re-election in <span class="date">November</span>.</p><br><br>
