  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Orange County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 3,010,232 making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">California</span>, the sixth-most populous in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, and more populous than twenty-one <span class="loc">U.S.</span> states. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span>. It is the second most densely populated county in the state, second only to <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Francisco County</span>. The county's four largest cities, <span class="loc">Anaheim</span>, <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span>, <span class="loc">Irvine</span>, and <span class="loc">Huntington Beach</span> each have populations exceeding 200,000. Several of <span class="loc">Orange County</span>'s cities are on the Pacific coast, including <span class="loc">Huntington Beach</span>, <span class="loc">Newport Beach</span>, <span class="loc">Laguna Beach</span>, and <span class="loc">San Clemente</span>. <span class="loc">Orange County</span> is included in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, <span class="loc">CA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Thirty-four incorporated cities are located in the county; the newest is <span class="loc">Aliso Viejo</span>, which was incorporated in <span class="date">2001</span>. <span class="loc">Anaheim</span> was the first city, incorporated in <span class="date">1870</span>, when the region was still part of neighboring <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>. Whereas most population centers in the <span class="loc">United States</span> tend to be identified by a major city, there is no defined urban center in <span class="loc">Orange County</span>. It is mostly suburban except for some traditionally urban areas at the centers of the older <span class="loc">cities of Anaheim</span>, <span class="loc">Fullerton</span>, <span class="loc">Huntington Beach</span>, <span class="loc">Orange</span>, and <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span>. There are several edge city-style developments such as <span class="org">Irvine Business Center</span>, <span class="org">Newport Center</span>, and South Coast Metro.</p><br><br>
