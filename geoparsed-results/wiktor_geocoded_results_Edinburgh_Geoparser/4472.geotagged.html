<p><span class="loc">Hanover</span>, a small town in the Northern Cape Province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>, is named after <span class="loc">Hanover</span> in <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The town was established in 1854. Much of the farming in the area is with Merino sheep. The Fountain, a powerful spring in town, releases about 205,000 litres of water per day. A footpath leads up to <span class="loc">Trappieskop</span> which offers panoramic views of the area. <span class="loc">Hanover</span> claims to be the country's most central place. It is equidistant from Cape Town and <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span>, centrally positioned between Cape Town and <span class="loc">Durban</span> as well as <span class="loc">Port Elizabeth</span> and <span class="loc">Upington</span> and it is the hub of an arc formed by <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">Middelburg</span> and <span class="loc">Colesberg</span>. Historic figures were at the centre of life here, people like Olive Schreiner, author and women's rights champion, and the tempestuous Rev. Thomas Francois Burgers. Among its residents were the wealthy and eccentric. The town's chief constable was the grandson of Lord Charles Somerset, the magistrate's clerk a son of Charles John Vaughan, Dean of <span class="loc">Llandaff</span>, well-known churchman and devotional writer of his day, and the local doctor was the son of a former Solicitor-General of <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>.</p>
