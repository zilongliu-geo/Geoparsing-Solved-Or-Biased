  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Clifton</span> is a small linear village and civil parish 3 miles (4.8 km) south east of <span class="loc">Penrith</span> in <span class="loc">Cumbria</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The civil <span class="loc">parish of Clifton</span> has its western boundary defined by the <span class="loc">River Lowther</span>, to the north and east lie the civil <span class="loc">parishes of Brougham</span> and <span class="loc">Great Strickland</span>, to the south is the civil <span class="loc">parish of Lowther</span>. The village of <span class="loc">Clifton</span> has a church, primary school, and a pub. Most of the hamlet of <span class="loc">Clifton Dykes</span> (on the C3047 road) also lies within the parish. The name of this was shown as Longchimney on the first edition Ordnance Survey map of <span class="date">1897</span>, and then as Clifton Dikes on the later second edition. The current spelling was settled on more recently. <span class="loc">Clifton Dykes</span> has been suggested as the (pre-Roman conquest) centre of the Carvetti, an Iron Age and Roman-period 'tribe', one that possibly led a resistance against Roman forces in <span class="date">69 A.D.</span> under the leadership of <span class="per">Venutius</span>. This is based upon the evidence of a large (c.7 acre) Iron Age enclosure discovered there, plus assumptions about its strategic importance on the <span class="loc">Eden</span> Valley communication routeway. However, this has been disputed: the Carvetii may have always been centred on <span class="loc">Carlisle</span> even before the Romans set up <span class="per">Luguvalium</span> and <span class="per">Venutius</span> may not have been Carvetiian.</p><br><br>
