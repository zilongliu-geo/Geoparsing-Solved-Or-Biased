<p>Commission OKs use of stimulus funds. The Pottawatomie County Commission Monday authorized application for $574,000 in federal "stimulus" funds for the Wam-Sag-Man Trail from <span class="loc">Wamego</span> to Manhattan. The commission specified, however, that the county would not be liable for any costs associated with the trail, as implied by the grant. "We're a little bit concerned about that...that we're sticking the county's neck out a little bit," Commission Chairman Stan Hartwich told <span class="loc">County Counselor</span> John Watt after reviewing the grant application and accompanying resolution submitted by the Wam-Sag-Man Trail Committee.</p>
