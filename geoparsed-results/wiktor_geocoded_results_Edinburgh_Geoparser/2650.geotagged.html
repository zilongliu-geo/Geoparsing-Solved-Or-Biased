<p>Douglas is a lowly populated locality and a rural centre in east <span class="loc">Taranaki</span>, surrounded by dairy, sheep and beef pastoral farming. It is situated 18 km east of <span class="loc">Stratford</span> at the intersection of <span class="loc">East Road</span>, <span class="loc">Ohura Road</span>, <span class="loc">Douglas Road South</span> and <span class="loc">Bredow Road</span>. <span class="loc">East Road</span> and <span class="loc">Ohura Road</span> meet to form State Highway 43, linking <span class="loc">Stratford</span> to the King Country town of <span class="loc">Taumarunui</span>. The <span class="loc">Stratford</span> - Okahukura Line, a secondary railway line, runs through Douglas where it veers north-east and away from the state highway for approximately 20 km. Douglas is centred on the Toko Stream adjacent to a small saddle crossed by <span class="loc">Ohura Road</span> to the east. The wider locality takes in State Highway 43 from Gordon Road in the west to Mangaotuku Road in the east. The reclaimed swamplands of the upper Toko valley are the dominant geographic feature, running from the north to the south-west of Douglas, at approximately 200m above sea level. Sandstone/greywacke ridges rise to between 300-370m altitude on each side of the valley floor. Peaks include Tarerepo trig to the north-east (366m altitude), Oruru trig to the south-east (329m) and Makuri trig to the south (327m). Crown Road provides access to farms below the Makuri trig, <span class="loc">Bredow Road</span> to farms below the Oruru trig, and Douglas Road to farms in the upper end of the valley (Tarerepo trig). Douglas Road links Douglas to <span class="loc">Huiroa</span>, <span class="loc">Te Popo</span>, <span class="loc">Kiore</span> and <span class="loc">Matau</span>.</p>
