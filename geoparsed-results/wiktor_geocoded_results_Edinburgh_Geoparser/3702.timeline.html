  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The Central District is a mostly residential district in Seattle located east of <span class="loc">Cherry Hill</span>, west of <span class="loc">Madrona</span> and Leschi, south of <span class="loc">Capitol Hill</span>, and north of Rainier Valley. Historically, the Central District has been one of Seattle's most racially and ethnically diverse neighborhoods, and is the center of Seattle's black community. The culture and demographics of the Central District have changed repeatedly throughout <span class="date">many years</span>. It started out as a predominantly Jewish neighborhood. Jewish residents built <span class="per">Temple De Hirsch</span> on <span class="loc">Union Street</span> in <span class="date">1907</span>; <span class="per">Temple De Hirsch</span> <span class="loc">Sinai</span> on the opposite corner of the same block is a successor to that congregation; the original <span class="per">Temple De Hirsch</span> is largely demolished, though some fragments remain. Other former synagogues in the neighborhood are the former Sephardic Bikur Holim synagogue (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Tolliver Temple</span>), Herzl Congregation synagogue (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="org">Odessa Brown Clinic</span>), and Chevra Bikur Cholim (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="org">Langston Hughes Performing Arts Center</span>). <span class="date">A few decades later</span>, the Central District became a home to Japanese-Americans in Seattle. The blocks between 14th and 18th <span class="per">Avenues</span> and <span class="per">Yesler</span> <span class="per">Way</span> and <span class="per">Jackson</span> Street still retain a strong Japanese presenceâ€”the Buddhist Church, Seattle Koyasan Church, <span class="loc">Konko</span>, <span class="loc">Wisteria</span> Park, Japanese Congregational Church, <span class="org">Keiro Nursing Home</span>, and the <span class="org">Kawabe Memorial House</span>. During World War II, presidential Executive <span class="per">Order</span> 9066 made possible the removal of American citizens of Japanese descent from the West Coast. All Japanese residents were immediately taken out of their homes and sent to internment camps. This and many race-restricted covenants to the north and south paved the way for many African Americans to find a new home in the Central District. By <span class="date">the 1970s</span>, Central District became largely an African-American neighborhood and the center of the civil rights movement in Seattle. In <span class="date">1970</span>, Blacks made up nearly 80% of the neighborhood's population [1] However, it also marked the neighborhood's decline into poverty and crime for another <span class="date">two decades</span>.</p><br><br>
