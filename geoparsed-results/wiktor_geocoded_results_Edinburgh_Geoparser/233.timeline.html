  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hamilton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Caldwell County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,809 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is known as the hometown of <span class="per">James Cash Penney</span>, the business entrepreneur and philanthropist, and the hometown of <span class="per">Jenny Doan</span> who has built a large quilting-related business called <span class="org">Missouri Star Quilt Co</span>. <span class="per">Hamilton</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> owes its existence largely to the <span class="loc">Hannibal</span> &amp; <span class="per">St. Joseph</span> Railroad. Prior to <span class="date">1854</span> the area around <span class="per">Hamilton</span> was unsettled prairie land belonging to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Government. With the coming of the railroad, the <span class="org">Hamilton Town Company</span> was formed to develop a tract of land along the rails. At first the name <span class="loc">Prairie City</span> was intended for the new community. However <span class="per">Albert Gallatin</span> <span class="per">Davis</span>, a key member of the Town Company, chose <span class="per">Hamilton</span> instead, in honor two early Americans, Founding Father and first Treasury Secretary <span class="per">Alexander Hamilton</span>, as well as <span class="per">Joseph Hamilton</span>, a notable early American lawyer and military leader killed at the Battle of the <span class="loc">Thames</span> during the War of <span class="date">1812</span>. The first house in <span class="per">Hamilton</span>, fittingly, was built by <span class="per">Mr. Davis</span> in the <span class="date">summer of 1855</span> as well as the first business, a general store, in <span class="date">1857</span>. The store would serve as <span class="per">Hamilton</span>'s first Post Office and <span class="per">Davis the first</span> Postmaster in <span class="date">1858</span>. The <span class="loc">Hannibal</span> &amp; <span class="per">St. Joseph</span> was finally completed on <span class="date">Valentine's Day</span>, <span class="date">February 14, 1859</span> and it proved <span class="date">a sweet day</span> indeed for <span class="per">Hamilton</span> as the first train arrived <span class="date">that day</span> as well. A railroad depot was constructed by <span class="date">Fall, 1859</span> with <span class="per">Albert Gallatin</span> <span class="per">Davis</span> appointed the first railroad and express agent.</p><br><br>
