  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kingston</span> is a Canadian village in <span class="loc">Kings County</span> on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Annapolis River</span> in the <span class="loc">Annapolis Valley</span> of <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. As of <span class="date">2011</span>, the population was 5,174. This village is home to Clairmont Provincial Park. It is a small picnic park near the Fundy Shore. This parkâ€™s picnic area is situated under a stand of red pine, providing a cool oasis away from the valley heat. <span class="loc">Kingston</span> remains as a major service centre for the apple growing industry in the area of western <span class="loc">Kings County</span> and has a growing retail district, owing to its access to Highway 101. The land which <span class="loc">Kingston</span> sits on <span class="date">today</span> was originally owned by <span class="per">Bishop Inglis</span>, the first <span class="loc">Anglican</span> <span class="per">Bishop of Nova Scotia</span>, granted to him in <span class="date">1790</span>. By the early 1800s he had sold off most of the land along the <span class="loc">Annapolis River</span>, converted into farm lots. The small community centered on these farms was at first called "Bloomfield", but the name "<span class="loc">Kingston</span> Station" was given to it in <span class="date">1868</span> when the Halifax-Yarmouth main line of the Dominion Atlantic Railway was built and passed through the community, with its station being meant to serve the neighboring communities of <span class="loc">Kingston</span> Village (<span class="date">now</span> known as Greenwood) and <span class="loc">North Kingston</span>. After the arrival of the railway, <span class="loc">Kingston</span> Station developed into a local service and light manufacturing centre.</p><br><br>
