<p>Dayton is a city and county seat in <span class="loc">Rhea County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 7,191. The <span class="loc">Dayton Urban</span> Cluster, which includes developed areas adjacent to the city and extends south to <span class="loc">Graysville</span>, had 10,174 people in 2010. Dayton was the site of the Scopes Trial in 1925 dealing with the creationâ€“evolution controversy. The community was originally settled circa 1820 as Smith's Crossroads. In 1877, the town was renamed Dayton, after Dayton, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The town was incorporated in 1903. Early industry included manufacture of pig iron. In 1925, the famous Scopes Trial was held in Dayton and, for a period of time, filled the town with hucksters of every description and journalists from around the world. The participants included William Jennings Bryan in the role of prosecutor and Clarence Darrow as the principal defense counsel. The trial was over the issue of whether evolution should be taught in public schools. John T. Scopes, the defendant in the trial, was a local science teacher who was recruited by George Rappleyea to begin to teach evolution in his science class, despite it being against <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> law at that time. Rappleyea believed that this conflict would create an enormous amount of publicity for the town, and he was absolutely right. The town bustled with activity as people began to flock from near and far to hear the verdict on this controversial issue.</p>
