  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Columbia</span> is a planned community comprising 10 self-contained villages, located in <span class="loc">Howard County</span>, Marylandâ€”the second wealthiest county in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, according to <span class="date">2013</span> <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> figures. It began with the idea that a city could enhance its residents' quality of life. Creator and developer James W. Rouse saw the new community in terms of human values, rather than merely economics and engineering. Opened in <span class="date">1967</span>, <span class="org">Columbia</span> was intended to not only eliminate the inconveniences of then-current subdivision design, but also eliminate racial, religious, and class segregation. <span class="org">Columbia</span> has consistently ranked in the top ten of <span class="org">CNN</span> Money's Best Places to Live in <span class="loc">America</span>. <span class="org">Columbia</span> proper consists only of that territory governed by the <span class="org">Columbia Association</span>, but larger areas are included under its name by the <span class="org">U.S. Postal Service</span> and the Census Bureau. These include several other communities which predate <span class="org">Columbia</span>, including <span class="loc">Simpsonville</span>, <span class="loc">Atholton</span>, and in the case of the census, part of <span class="loc">Clarksville</span>. The census-designated place had a population of 103,683 according to <span class="date">2013</span> Census estimates, making it the most populous community in <span class="loc">Maryland</span> after <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>.</p><br><br>
