  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> is a neighborhood in the northwestern quadrant of <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span>, the capital of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The neighborhood is bounded by Rock Creek Park to the north and west; and <span class="loc">Harvard Street</span>, <span class="loc">NW</span>, and the <span class="loc">Adams</span> <span class="org">Morgan</span> neighborhood to the south; and Sixteenth Street, <span class="loc">NW</span>, and the <span class="loc">Columbia Heights</span> neighborhood to the east. The neighborhood is home to about 10,000 people. In <span class="date">1727</span>, <span class="per">Charles Calvert</span>, 5th <span class="per">Lord Baltimore</span> (then governor of the <span class="loc">Maryland</span> Colony) awarded a land grant for present-day <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> to <span class="per">James Holmead</span>. This estate included the territory of present-day <span class="loc">Adams</span> <span class="org">Morgan</span>, <span class="loc">Columbia Heights</span>, and <span class="loc">Pleasant Plains</span> neighborhoods. <span class="per">James</span>'s son, <span class="per">Anthony</span>, inherited the estate in <span class="date">1750</span> and named it <span class="loc">Pleasant Plains</span>. After the <span class="loc">United States</span> Congress created the <span class="loc">District of Columbia</span> in <span class="date">1791</span>, <span class="loc">Pleasant Plains</span> estate became part of <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, a section of the District lying between what <span class="date">now</span> is <span class="loc">Florida Avenue</span> and the <span class="loc">Maryland</span> border. The Holmeads gradually sold off all tracts of the <span class="loc">Pleasant Plains</span> estate. In the 21st century, the family name is preserved in <span class="per">Holmead</span> Place, a short street located west of Thirteenth Street between Spring and Park Roads <span class="loc">NW</span>, in what <span class="date">now</span> is <span class="loc">Columbia Heights</span>. During <span class="date">1794</span> and <span class="date">1796</span>, <span class="per">Robert Peter</span>, Georgetown's pioneer businessman, conducted title descriptions. He created maps for tracts of some of his land in <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> for transactions with commissioners of the city.</p><br><br>
