<p>Alameda (/ælᵻˈmiːdə/ or /ælᵻˈmeɪdə/; Spanish: [ala'meða]) is a city in <span class="loc">Alameda County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located on <span class="loc">Alameda Island</span> and <span class="loc">Bay Farm Island</span>, and is adjacent to and south of <span class="loc">Oakland</span> and in eastern <span class="loc">San Francisco Bay</span> across from <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>, on the <span class="loc">San Francisco Bay</span> Area. <span class="loc">Bay Farm Island</span>, a portion of which is also known as "Harbor Bay Isle", is not actually an island, and is part of the mainland adjacent to the Oakland International Airport. The city's estimated 2014 population was 75,988. Alameda is a charter city, rather than a general law city, allowing the city to provide for any form of government. Alameda became a charter city and adopted a council–manager government in 1916, which it retains to the present. The island Alameda occupies what was originally a peninsula connected to <span class="loc">Oakland</span>. Much of it was low-lying and marshy, but on higher ground the peninsula and adjacent parts of what is now downtown <span class="loc">Oakland</span> were home to one of the largest coastal oak forests in the world. The area was therefore called <span class="loc">Encinal</span>, Spanish for "forest of evergreen oak". Alameda is Spanish for "grove of poplar trees" or "tree-lined avenue", and was chosen in 1853 by popular vote.</p>
