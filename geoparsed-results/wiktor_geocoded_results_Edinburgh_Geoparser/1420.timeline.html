  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,735 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town includes <span class="org">Fairfield Center</span>, <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> village and <span class="loc">Hinckley</span>, and borders the <span class="loc">city of Waterville</span> to the south. It is home to the Good Will-Hinckley School, <span class="org">Lawrence High School</span> and <span class="per">Kennebec</span> Valley Community College. The area was territory of the Canibas tribe of Abenaki Indians residing at Taconnet village, once located downriver at the confluence of the <span class="per">Sebasticook</span> and <span class="per">Kennebec</span> rivers in what is <span class="date">today</span> <span class="loc">Winslow</span>. In <span class="date">1692</span> during <span class="per">King William</span>'s War, the village was burned, so the Canibas tribe abandoned the area. The French and Indian Wars finally ended in <span class="date">1763</span>, leaving the region open for English colonization. Fairfield Plantation, named for its fair aspect, was first settled in <span class="date">1774</span>. <span class="per">Benedict Arnold</span> and his troops rested and re-provisioned here in <span class="date">1775</span> during their march up the <span class="loc">Kennebec River</span> to the Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. Following the Revolutionary War, Fairfield Plantation developed as a trade and agricultural town, with farms producing hay, grain and potatoes. It was noted for the number and quality of its cattle. On <span class="date">June 18, 1788</span>, it was incorporated as <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>. By <span class="date">1790</span>, the community had 492 inhabitants. In <span class="date">1837</span>, it produced 11,531 bushels of wheat and a large quantity of wool.</p><br><br>
