  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pella</span> is an oasis in <span class="loc">Namakwa</span> (<span class="loc">Bushmanland</span>) in the Northern Cape province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. Earlier known as Cammas Fonteyn, the spring was used by a nearby stronghold of <span class="per">San</span> people. In <span class="date">1776</span> a South African Dutch farmer called Coenraad Feijt settled there and lived in harmony with the <span class="loc">San</span> despite their fondness for raiding the cattle of the Dutch farmers in the <span class="loc">Hantam</span>. A nearby farm called <span class="loc">Aggeneys</span> later became the site of the modern mining town of that name. In <span class="date">1814</span> a missionary called <span class="per">Christian Albrecht</span> moved with his assistants and converts to Cammas Fonteyn, having left <span class="loc">Namibia</span> where the Orlam Chief, <span class="per">Jager Afrikaner</span>, had been persecuting them. He founded a mission station and renamed it <span class="loc">Pella</span> after the ancient town in that became a refuge for persecuted Christians from the Romans. Other famous missionaries that visited <span class="loc">Pella</span> during the early <span class="date">years</span> were <span class="per">John Campbell</span>, Heinrich Schmelen and <span class="per">Robert Moffat</span>. The tenure of the <span class="org">London Missionary Society</span> (LMS) at <span class="loc">Pella</span> was intermittent and the mission station was abandoned on numerous occasions. This was largely because of the extremely harsh desert conditions, but on one occasion the LMS abandoned the mission station after one of the priests had been murdered by the <span class="loc">San</span>. During these periods of abandonment, the <span class="per">Basters</span> and <span class="per">San</span> continued to use the oasis.</p><br><br>
