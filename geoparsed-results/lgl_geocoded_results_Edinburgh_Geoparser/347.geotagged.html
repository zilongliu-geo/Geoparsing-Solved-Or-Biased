<p>Local mayors hit streets with Meals on Wheels. FREMONT — Violet Stubblefield had a look of surprise when she opened the door Wednesday morning. On a typical day, the 96-year-old Fremont woman receives a lunch delivery from Linda Wasserman, a 16-year volunteer with <span class="loc">Fremont</span>-based LIFE ElderCare Meals on Wheels. But on this day, Wasserman brought along a special guest — her husband, Bob, the city's mayor. "Hi, nice to meet you," the mayor said, extending his hand for a handshake. "It's nice to meet you, too "... I read about you all the time," said Stubblefield, who later joked that she would have worn her Oakland A's hat had she known the mayor would be coming. Wasserman was a big A's supporter when the team proposed moving to <span class="loc">Fremont</span>. Wasserman was one of three local mayors to go into their communities Wednesday to deliver meals to senior citizens as part of the annual Mayors for Meals Day. Mayors David W. Smith of Newark and Michael <span class="loc">Sweeney</span> of Hayward also delivered food to their constituents, joining more than 1,000 mayors across the country in the effort. Each day, 2,200 homebound seniors in <span class="loc">Alameda County</span> receive food from one of six regionally run Meals on Wheels programs. For these seniors, the visits are more than just a meal delivery service; they're a chance to talk to someone. "It does put you in touch with reality," he said. Wasserman said he enjoyed the experience and opportunity to get into the community. He said he also appreciates the efforts of the everyday volunteers — the 225 in the Tri-City area — who work together to deliver some 350 meals a day, 90,000 annually.
