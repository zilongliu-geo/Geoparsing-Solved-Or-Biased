<p>Tuba is a first class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Benguet</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 42,874 people. The town is known as the "Gateway to <span class="loc">Baguio</span>", as the three major highways that give access to the adjacent <span class="loc">city of Baguio</span> are largely traversed in the municipality. Tuba was originally a barrio of the township of <span class="loc">Baguio</span> in the early 1900s under the American Occupation of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It was separated from <span class="loc">Baguio</span> upon the latter's conversion into a chartered city on September 1, 1909, and became part of the township of <span class="loc">Twin Peaks</span> in <span class="loc">Benguet</span>. <span class="loc">Twin Peaks</span> was abolished as a township on December 11, 1911 with the issuance of Executive Order No. 77 by American Governor General William Cameron Forbes, creating the township of Tuba. On June 25, 1963, President Diosdado Macapagal issued Executive Order No. 42 and by operation of Section 2 of Republic Act No. 1515, the municipal <span class="loc">District of Tuba</span> was converted into a regular municipality. Tuba is situated in the south-western tip of the Central Cordillera Mountain Range that extends from the north-western tip of <span class="loc">Luzon</span> towards <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>. South of the municipality lies the <span class="loc">province of Pangasinan</span> and to the west lies the Ilocos rolling hills of the province of <span class="loc">La Union</span>. It is hemmed in by the municipalities of <span class="loc">Sablan</span> and <span class="loc">La Trinidad</span> on the north; the <span class="loc">city of Baguio</span> and the municipality of <span class="loc">Itogon</span> on the east; and the municipalities of <span class="loc">Sison</span> and <span class="loc">San Manuel</span> on the south.</p>
