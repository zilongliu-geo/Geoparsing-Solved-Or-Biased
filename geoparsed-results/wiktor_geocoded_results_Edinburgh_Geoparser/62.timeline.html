  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Aurora</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Brookings County</span>, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 532 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Aurora</span> was platted in <span class="date">1880</span>. It was named after <span class="per">Aurora</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, by a settler from that place. <span class="per">Aurora</span> is located at 44°17′0″N 96°41′10″W (44.283215, -96.686048). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.46 square miles (1.19 km2), all of it land. <span class="per">Aurora</span> has been assigned the ZIP code 57002, and the FIPS place code 02780. The sole two sports teams in <span class="per">Aurora</span> are both baseball teams, American Legion Baseball Post 230 &amp; the <span class="per">Aurora</span> A's. Both exist under the <span class="org">Aurora Baseball Association</span> and play their home games at <span class="per">Aurora Field</span>, located two blocks west of the city water tower. Although Post 230 is classified as a district 1A team (explained below), it plays the majority of its games against "B" division opponents. However, if it wishes to compete at the district tournament, it must compete against its intra-district 1 opponents, which are <span class="loc">Brookings</span>, <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span>, <span class="loc">Watertown</span>, and <span class="loc">Huron</span>. The reason Post 230 is considered a district 1A team is because it plays within the area designated as district 1 and obtains at least a portion of its players from neighboring <span class="org">Brookings High School</span> (a school possessing an "A" enrollment status under <span class="loc">American Legion</span> by-laws). The team has been an installation in <span class="per">Aurora</span> since <span class="date">2002</span> and its colors are blue and white, gray, and/or black.</p><br><br>
