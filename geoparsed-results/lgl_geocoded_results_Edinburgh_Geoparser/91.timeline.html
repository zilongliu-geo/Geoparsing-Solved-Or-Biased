  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Shingleton</span> planning to run for re-election. <span class="loc">CROMWELL</span> — The third Democrat to enter the race for first selectman, <span class="per">Jeremy J. Shingleton</span>, has announced his intention to run for re-election. He joins two candidates: finance board member <span class="per">John Flanders</span> and Police Chief <span class="per">Anthony J. Salvatore</span>, who have each said they plan to run. No Republicans have announced plans to run in the <span class="date">November</span> election. <span class="per">Shingleton</span> opened up his campaign headquarters over <span class="date">the weekend</span> at 319 Main St., where volunteers spent <span class="date">Saturday</span> cleaning and painting. “As part of our downtown revitalization project, we are trying to bring as many people downtown as possible, so I thought a good way to do that is to set up campaign headquarters,” <span class="per">Shingleton</span> said.</p><br><br>
