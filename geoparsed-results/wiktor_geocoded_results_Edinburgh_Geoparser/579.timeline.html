  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Milton is a district in the Scottish <span class="loc">city of Glasgow</span>, situated north of the <span class="loc">River Clyde</span>. The housing scheme is about 2.5 miles north of <span class="loc">Glasgow City</span> Centre. The construction of Milton started in <span class="date">the late 1940s</span> as a part of a general post-war construction programme by <span class="org">Glasgow Corporation</span> to deal with the housing shortages and slum clearances. The district is bordered to the south and east by Ashgill Road. It is also bordered by <span class="loc">Liddesdale</span> Road, which had previously connected <span class="loc">Colston</span> to <span class="loc">Balmore</span> Road. The new streets were named after the Scottish islands: <span class="loc">Berneray</span>, <span class="loc">Birsay</span>, <span class="loc">Castlebay</span>, <span class="loc">Cathay</span>, <span class="loc">Egilsay</span>, <span class="loc">Longay</span>, <span class="loc">Mingulay</span>, <span class="loc">Ornsay</span>, <span class="loc">Raasay</span>, Ronaldsay, <span class="loc">Scalpay</span>, Scaraway, Shilay Skerray, <span class="loc">Stornoway</span>, <span class="loc">Torogay</span>, <span class="loc">Vallay</span> and <span class="loc">Westray</span>. The area had only a few private homes (in <span class="loc">Liddesdale</span> Road/<span class="loc">Birsay</span> <span class="per">Road</span> and <span class="per">Loskin</span> Drive) prior to the new development. The scheme was completed in <span class="date">1952</span>, but further housing was added in later <span class="date">years</span>, including high-rise flats in <span class="loc">Castlebay</span> Drive in <span class="date">the late 1960s</span>. Housing styles varied from gray stone apartment houses with back and front doors, to brown or white clad pre-fabricated apartment housing, and 4 storey flats of 8 units each, some with open verandas. All housing was rented social housing.</p><br><br>
