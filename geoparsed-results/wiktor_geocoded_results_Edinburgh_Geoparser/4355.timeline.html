  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Soho</span> is an area on the borders of Central <span class="per">Birmingham</span> and <span class="per">Smethwick</span>, approximately 2 miles north west of <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> city centre on the A41. The name is an abbreviation of <span class="loc">South House</span>, denoting that it was located to the south of <span class="loc">Handsworth</span>. The section of the A41 separating <span class="loc">Handsworth</span> from <span class="loc">Winson Green</span> is known as <span class="loc">Soho</span> Road. <span class="loc">Soho</span> expanded dramatically during the 19th century with the construction of numerous houses and factories, and immigration from the Commonwealth was centred in these homes during <span class="date">the 1950s and 1960s</span>. Most of the immigrants who settled in <span class="loc">Soho</span> were of Indian origin. Further housebuilding took place by the local council during <span class="date">the 1960s and 1970s</span>. <span class="loc">Soho</span> falls partly in the <span class="loc">Soho ward</span> of the <span class="loc">City of Birmingham</span> and partly in the <span class="loc">Soho</span> and <span class="loc">Victoria ward</span> of the <span class="loc">Borough of Sandwell</span>. The <span class="date">2001</span> Population Census found that 25,634 people were living in <span class="loc">Soho</span> with a population density of 5,369 people per km² compared with 3,649 people per km² for <span class="per">Birmingham</span>. <span class="loc">Soho</span> covers an area of 4.8 km². The ward is a very ethnically diverse area with ethnic minorities making up 76.2% (19,522) of the ward's population, compared with 29.6% for <span class="per">Birmingham</span>.</p><br><br>
