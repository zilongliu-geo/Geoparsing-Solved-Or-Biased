<p>Congo is a village in Eurobodalla Shire on the South Coast of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>. Congo is located 315 km south of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, and 10 km south of <span class="loc">Moruya</span>. The population of Congo and the surrounding area was 225 at the 2011 census. <span class="loc">Congo Creek</span> flows to the <span class="loc">Tasman Sea</span> at the northern end of the village. Congo's beach is noted as a good location for surfing, with a colloguial name "The Suck". Beach safe classes the hazard of the unpatrolled Congo beach as 6/10 "Moderately hazardous". Congo is a village surrounded by Eurobodalla National Park on three sides, and the ocean (<span class="loc">Tasman Sea</span>) on the east. Congo campground is situated on <span class="loc">Congo Creek</span> within the national park. It is a good base for walking the 14 km Bingi Dreaming track described by the National Parks and Wildlife sservice as "a coastal walk that traces the ancient Song Lines of the Yuin Aboriginal people". Aborigines have occupied the area for over 6000 years, prior to the sea reaching current levels. Eurobodalla Coast Tourism notes that the Congo area was a major source of silcrete, used to make stone tools. Silcrete was widely traded throughout the region.</p>
