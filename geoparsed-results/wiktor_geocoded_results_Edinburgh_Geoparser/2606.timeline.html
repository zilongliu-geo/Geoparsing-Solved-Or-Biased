  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> is a small town and locality of the <span class="loc">Moreton Bay Region</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is 60 kilometres (37 mi) north of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, the state capital. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, its population was 461. The closest major population centre is <span class="loc">Caboolture</span>, 20 kilometres (12 mi) to the west. The town name was approved by the <span class="org">Queensland Place Names Board</span> on <span class="date">1 October 1975</span>. The name appears to be derived from a corroboree site, or because of fights amongst oyster gatherers at <span class="date">weekend</span> camps. The town started out as a small fishing community but has since developed into a minor tourist destination. <span class="org">Pumicestone Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">1 August 1958</span>. It was renamed <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> in <span class="date">1976</span>. In <span class="date">1985</span>, an unsealed road running along the waterfront was named <span class="per">Grant Lane</span> after <span class="per">Robert Grant</span> (<span class="date">1895</span> â€“ <span class="date">15 November 1991</span>) for his 90th birthday, a popular local who everyone knew as "Pop". <span class="date">A few years later</span> the road was sealed after he had complained for <span class="date">years</span> of the dust produced by all the passers-by. Sand mining and sewerage works have recently been proposed for the area.</p><br><br>
