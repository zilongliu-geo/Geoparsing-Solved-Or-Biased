<p><span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> is a small unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Steuben Township</span>, <span class="loc">Warren County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. <span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> was platted July 8, 1874 by John R. Johnson, Senior, near <span class="loc">Sumner</span> Station. A post office was established there on December 2, 1875, with George W. Johnson as postmaster. As of September 1875 there were said to be about 50 people living in the town; there were several businesses including a dry goods store and a tan yard that produced leather. The town also had a druggist, a doctor, a lawyer, a blacksmith, a grain dealer, a railway agent, a tinker, and a boarding-house. As of 1913, the population was about 80. The town was established at the intersection of two rail lines: the existing <span class="loc">Toledo</span>, <span class="loc">Wabash</span> and Western Railroad and the new Coal Branch of the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Danville</span> and <span class="loc">Vincennes Railroad</span> (the branch being known as the "Pumpkin Vine" Railroad), which was laid down in 1872. The well-chosen location favored the town's success, but trains had stopped running on the Pumpkin Vine by 1880, just six years after the town was formally established; and when the rails were removed shortly thereafter, the site's importance was diminished, and the town began to dwindle. The post office closed on August 31, 1907.</p>
