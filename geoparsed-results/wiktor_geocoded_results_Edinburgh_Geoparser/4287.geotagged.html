<p>Kirkwood is an inner-ring suburb of St. Louis located in St. <span class="loc">Louis County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city's population was 27,540. Founded in 1853, the city is named after James P. Kirkwood, builder of the Pacific Railroad through that town. It was the first planned suburb located west of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. Plans for a new community close to St. Louis began following the St. Louis Fire (1849) and the 1849 cholera outbreak that killed a tenth of the residents of downtown St. Louis. Kirkwood was the first suburban municipality built outside of the St. <span class="loc">Louis City</span> boundaries. <span class="loc">Hiram</span> W. Leffingwell and Richard Smith Elliott bought land 14 miles (23 km) from downtown in 1850 at about the same time James P. Kirkwood was laying out a route for the Pacific Railroad. Kirkwood was platted in 1852, and named for James P. Kirkwood, chief engineer of the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Pacific Railroad. When the railroad reached the community in 1853, the developers sold lots for the Kirkwood Association. Other Leffingwell developments were to include the construction of <span class="loc">Grand Avenue</span> and the establishment of <span class="loc">Forest Park</span>.</p>
