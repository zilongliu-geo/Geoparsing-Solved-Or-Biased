  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>State's action may cost <span class="loc">Richmond</span> new business, new jobs. By Bill Engle Staff Writer <span class="date">March 27, 2009</span> Luminous Electronics Recycling, a <span class="loc">Denver</span>-based company, was near announcing plans to open a new facility in <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, promising a $1.5 million initial investment in an existing building with hopes of hiring 50 to 70 workers within <span class="date">three years</span>. “We’ve actually identified a facility and negotiated a lease,” Luminous company <span class="per">president Steve Fuelberth</span> said <span class="date">Friday</span> from <span class="loc">Denver</span> headquarters. “But part of our plan was to be able to access what the state of <span class="loc">Indiana</span> had to offer. “Once the program was dropped it caused us to step back and re-evaluate the exact location of that facility,” he said. The <span class="org">Indiana Department of Environmental Management</span> decided to stop funding the grant and loan program in <span class="date">January</span>, saying that cash-strapped local governments and businesses might not be able to provide matching dollars. <span class="per">Valerie Shaffer</span>, manager of business attraction for the Economic Development Corporation of <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, said she is still working with company officials to bring them here but admitted “they were discouraged when they heard the grant program had been frozen.” <span class="per">Fuelberth</span> agreed the deal is not dead but added that he will investigate incentives offered by surrounding states.</p><br><br>
