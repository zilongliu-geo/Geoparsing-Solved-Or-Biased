<p><span class="loc">Cornwall</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Lebanon County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>, <span class="loc">PA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 3,486 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> was founded by Peter Grubb in 1737. Peter, a <span class="loc">Chester County</span> stonemason, came to <span class="loc">Lancaster County</span> around 1734 in search of building materials. First building his house and then a store, he discovered very high quality magnetite iron ore nearby and decided to mine for it, acquiring 300 acres (1.2 km2) by 1737 and over 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) by 1739 when mining was initiated. He called it the <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> <span class="loc">Iron Mines</span> after his father's birthplace in <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> <span class="loc">Iron Mines</span>, also known as <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> Banks, turned out to be the largest <span class="loc">United States</span>' iron deposit east of <span class="loc">Lake Superior</span>, and were once the largest open-pit iron mine in the world. They were mined continuously until 1973, totaling 234 uninterrupted years of production. Finding the necessary components nearby for making iron (water, limestone and timber for charcoal), Grubb built the <span class="loc">Cornwall Iron Furnace</span> and began production in 1742. The operation also included the Hopewell Forges on nearby Hammer Creek. Peter Grubb did not stay long to run the operation, but leased it out in 1745 for 20 years and returned to <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>, <span class="loc">Delaware</span>. In 1765 Peter's sons Curtis and Peter Jr. took over the operation, and in 1798 it passed to Robert Coleman and his family. <span class="loc">Cornwall Furnace</span> was in production from 1742 until 1883, and appears today much as it was when production ended. In 1932 the Coleman family deeded the property to the Commonwealth of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and it is now a designated National Historic Landmark open to the public.</p>
