  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Five deaths from cholera have been reported in <span class="date">the past week</span> in the Zimbabwean provinces of <span class="loc">Mashonaland West</span> and Midlands, raising fears that the onset of the rains could lead to a repeat of the cholera epidemic that claimed thousands of lives in <span class="date">the past year</span>. The five deaths resulted from 117 cases reported in the <span class="loc">Mashonaland West</span>, <span class="per">Manicaland</span> and <span class="per">Midlands</span> provinces since <span class="date">last month</span>. The <span class="loc">provinces of Masvingo</span> province has also reported cases. The Zimbabwean Health and Child Welfare Secretary, <span class="per">Gerald Gwinji</span>, said on <span class="date">Tuesday</span> that most of the deaths and cases occurred among religious sects that do not accept medical treatment. "Most of the cases were recorded [...] among religious objectors, who for <span class="date">a long time</span> have been reluctant to seek medical attention," he said. Health experts have warned that with the rainy season just beginning around the country, cholera could get out of hand if safe water is not made widely available. Aid agencies have been warning that another outbreak of the disease was very likely, as the heavy <span class="date">summer</span> rains cause cholera, which is water-borne, to be transmitted more easily. “The fundamentals of the last epidemic are still there. Water is only sporadically available, and sewerage reticulation and refuse collection are only partially working,” a spokeswoman for <span class="org">the UNICEF</span> said. Officials from aid agencies predicted that the number of current cholera infections in <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span> will decline to around 60,000. “It’s not the catastrophe that it was <span class="date">last year</span> but it’s still a big epidemic of an easily preventable disease that should never have been allowed to happen,” an unnamed agency doctor said. The decrease has been anticipated after large amounts of water purification tablets, communal water tanks, and boreholes were installed in water systems as part of an operation to make water safer to drink. Spokeswoman <span class="per">Tsitsi Singizi</span> of the United Nations Children's Fund told the <span class="loc">Voice of America</span> news agency that the government and international or non-governmental aid agencies have been doing all they can to prevent a repeat of <span class="date">last year</span>'s deadly epidemic. A recent cholera epidemic in <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span> claimed 4,288 lives from <span class="date">late 2008</span> to mid-2009, the worst outbreak seen on the African continent for <span class="date">fifteen years</span> after the collapse of sanitation and water systems throughout the country.</p><br><br>
