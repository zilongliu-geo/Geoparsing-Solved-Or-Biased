<p><span class="loc">Magna</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) and township in Salt <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 26,505 at the 2010 census, a moderate increase over the 2000 figure of 22,770. Settlement of the area began in 1851 shortly after the Mormon pioneers reached the Salt Lake Valley. Early farmers settled in 1868 at the base of the northern <span class="loc">Oquirrh Mountains</span> and called their community <span class="loc">Pleasant Green</span>. By 1900, there were about 20 families in the area. One of the first <span class="loc">Pleasant Green</span> pioneers was Abraham Coon, who established a livestock ranch and settlement called “Coonville” in a canyon mouth at about 5400 South. The canyon is now known as Coon Canyon, and <span class="loc">Coon Creek</span> flowing out of it, is one of the major Oquirrh Mountain drainages. <span class="loc">Coon Creek</span> flows north and west through <span class="loc">Magna</span> to the <span class="loc">Great Salt Lake</span>. In 1897, the first <span class="loc">ward of The Church</span> of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Pleasant <span class="loc">Green Ward</span>, was constructed. The <span class="loc">Pleasant Green</span> Cemetery located in the Oquirrh foothills, at about 3500 South, where many community pioneers are buried, was established in 1883. In 1890, in response to a law requiring all children to receive free public education, the first school was built in the community.</p>
