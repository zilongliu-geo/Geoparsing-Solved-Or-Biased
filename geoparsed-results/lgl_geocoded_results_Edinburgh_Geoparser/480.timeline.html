  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Eight Alleged Plotters Detained in <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. TBILISI, <span class="loc">Georgia</span> — A Georgian court ruled <span class="date">Wednesday</span> that eight opposition supporters accused of plotting a coup and terrorist acts should remain in custody for <span class="date">two months</span> as they await trial. Police released video recordings <span class="date">this week</span> allegedly showing the men trying to buy weapons with the intent of causing violence during opposition protests <span class="date">next month</span>. Most of those sent to detention are supporters of the party of Nino <span class="org">Burdzhanadze</span>, a former parliamentary speaker who once was one of President <span class="per">Mikheil Saakashvili</span>’s closest allies. <span class="org">Burdzhanadze</span> broke with <span class="per">Saakashvili</span> <span class="date">last year</span> and <span class="date">now</span> is one of the key figures in the call for big rallies on <span class="date">April 9</span> that will demand that <span class="per">Saakashvili</span> step down. The saga has echoes of <span class="date">2007</span>, when the government accused opposition figures, based partly on video evidence, of trying to stage a coup during opposition protests that were smashed by police. On <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, officials released more recordings of alleged coup plans by opposition members. One recording purportedly shows a member of <span class="org">Burdzhanadze</span>’s party, Roina Bukhrashvili, as saying that a civil war would be in the party’s interests. Dissatisfaction with <span class="per">Saakashvili</span> has grown since a brief but devastating war with <span class="loc">Russia</span> <span class="date">last August</span>.</p><br><br>
