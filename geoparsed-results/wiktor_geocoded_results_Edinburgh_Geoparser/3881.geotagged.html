<p><span class="loc">Linton</span> is a village in rural <span class="loc">Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, on the border with <span class="loc">Essex</span>. It has been expanded much since the 1960s and is now one of many dormitory villages around <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>. The railway station was on the Stour Valley Railway between <span class="loc">Shelford</span> and <span class="loc">Colchester</span>, closed since 1967. The <span class="loc">Rivey Hill</span> overlooks the village, with its famous water tower. The <span class="loc">River Granta</span> runs through the village. Linton Zoo is on the southern edge of <span class="loc">Linton</span>, whilst <span class="loc">Chilford</span> Hall and its vineyards are to the north side, beyond Linton's best-known feature, Rivey Tower. The A1307 passes through the village. The <span class="loc">Icknield Way Path</span> passes through the village on its 110 mile journey from <span class="loc">Ivinghoe Beacon</span> in <span class="loc">Buckinghamshire</span> to <span class="loc">Knettishall Heath</span> in <span class="loc">Suffolk</span>. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes through the village. Many businesses are based in <span class="loc">Linton</span>, with several around the trading estate at The Grip and along the High Street. Spread evenly along the High Street are the three public houses. The Crown has an attached restaurant. The Dog and Duck focusses on fresh Italian-influenced food and is styled internally on a contemporary European bistro theme. Near the fire station is the Waggon and Horses, which has been resurrected by a new landlord. Although it has been closed for several years, The Bell probably remains Linton's most famous pub.</p>
