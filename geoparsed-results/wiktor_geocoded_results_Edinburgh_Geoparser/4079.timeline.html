  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Altoona</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and is a part of the Des Moinesâ€“West <span class="org">Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area</span>. The population was 14,541 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Altoona</span> is home of Adventureland, an amusement park, Prairie Meadows, a horse racing track and casino, and a Bass Pro Shops retail store, the first one in central <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. <span class="per">Anthony Yant</span> first settled in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Altoona</span> in <span class="date">1854</span>, the same year that <span class="per">Gilbert T. Taylor</span> settled there. The land was originally surveyed in <span class="date">1847</span> and put up for sale by the <span class="loc">US</span> government in <span class="date">1848</span>, but it took <span class="date">six years</span> to sell. After many different sales between different families, the Davis family ended up with the land on <span class="date">February 1, 1868</span>. The <span class="loc">Davises</span> hired surveyor Juian <span class="per">B. Bausman</span> to lay out the city for them. He is also credited for giving the city the current name. <span class="loc">Altoona</span> is named for the Latin word for "high," altus, after surveyor <span class="per">Julian B. Bausman</span> discovered that <span class="loc">Altoona</span> was the highest point on the <span class="loc">Des Moines</span> Valley Railroad between <span class="loc">Des Moines</span> and <span class="loc">Keokuk</span>.</p><br><br>
