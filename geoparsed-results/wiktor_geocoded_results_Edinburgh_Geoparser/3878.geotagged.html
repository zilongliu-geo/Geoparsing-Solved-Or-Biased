<p><span class="loc">Malham</span> is a village and civil parish in the Craven district of <span class="loc">North Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Before 20th century boundary changes, the village was part of the Settle Rural District, in the historic <span class="loc">West Riding</span> of <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span>. In the Domesday Book, the name is given as Malgun, meaning "settlement by the gravelly places". The parish has a population of approximately 150. including <span class="loc">Malham Moor</span> at the 2011 Census and increasing to 238. <span class="loc">Malham</span> lies at the upper end of the valley of the <span class="loc">River Aire</span>, known above <span class="loc">Airton</span> as Malhamdale, in the Yorkshire Dales. The surrounding countryside is well known for its limestone pavements and other examples of limestone scenery. Tourist attractions include <span class="loc">Malham Tarn</span>, <span class="loc">Malham Cove</span>, <span class="loc">Gordale Scar</span> and the Dry Valley. The village hosts an annual agricultural and horticultural show on the Saturday before the August Bank Holiday. Known as the Malham Show, it has competitions for everything from <span class="loc">Lego</span> models to fell running. Another major annual event is the Malham Safari, when the villagers and particularly the local school build sculptures around the village. This event attracts many tourists and stalls are put up on the green.</p>
