  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Beaumont</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Northside</span>. It lies within the postal district <span class="loc">Dublin</span> 9, sometimes known as D9. The name derives from the French for "beautiful mount". ( named by <span class="per">Olivia Whitemore</span> and <span class="per">Arthur Guinness</span> in <span class="date">1764</span>) <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> sits at the top of a considerable ascent from <span class="loc">Fairview</span> and Georgian Dublin Coastlines. Its clean Air and <span class="loc">Northside</span> views across Georgian <span class="loc">Dublin</span> to Wicklow mountains inspired the name. From <span class="date">1764</span> <span class="per">Olivia Whitmore</span> and <span class="per">Arthur Guinness</span> made their new family home in <span class="org">Beaumont House</span>. <span class="org">Beaumont House</span> is a protected structure and can be visited <span class="date">today</span> <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> was originally a farm in the Civil Parish of <span class="loc">Coolock</span>, between the townlands of <span class="loc">Kilmore Big</span> and <span class="loc">Kilmore Little</span>. It is the former home of the <span class="per">Guinness</span> family from 1764-1855. The original <span class="date">1764</span> lease between <span class="per">Charles Gardiner</span> and <span class="per">Arthur Guinness</span> can still be seen in the National Library of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. <span class="per">Guinness</span> took 51 acres (210,000 m2) "more or less situate in the <span class="loc">Parish of Coolock</span>" on a lease for the longer of <span class="date">31 years</span> or three lives, and built a house "at <span class="loc">Kilmore</span>" ; it is apparent that he later named the property "Beaumont". His rent was Â£93 p.a.</p><br><br>
