<p>Picton is an unincorporated community located in Prince Edward County in South Eastern <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, roughly 160 km east of <span class="loc">Toronto</span>. It is the County's largest community and former seat. Picton is located at the south-western end of <span class="loc">Picton</span> Bay, a branch of the <span class="loc">Bay of Quinte</span>, which is along the northern shoreline of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span>. The town is named for General Sir Thomas Picton, second in command to Wellington at the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. It was formerly incorporated as a town. Picton is home to the Picton Pirates of the Empire B Junior C Hockey League in the Ontario Hockey Association. Picton, originally named <span class="loc">Hallowell</span>, was first settled in the 1780s by Loyalists from the <span class="loc">America</span>'s Thirteen Colonies. Prior to its incorporation in 1837, the modern-day town of Picton consisted of two separate villages, <span class="loc">Hallowell Bridge</span> and <span class="loc">Picton</span>, which occupied the opposite sides of <span class="loc">Picton</span> Bay. Named for General Sir Thomas Picton, Wellington's second-in-command at the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>, the Town of Picton has a profound and rich history. It was here that Sir John A. Macdonald managed a law office for his uncle, <span class="loc">Lowther</span> P. MacPherson.</p>
