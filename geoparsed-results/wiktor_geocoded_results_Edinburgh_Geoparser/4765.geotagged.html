<p><span class="loc">Martin County</span> is a county located in the Treasure Coast region in the state of <span class="loc">Florida</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 146,318. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Stuart. <span class="loc">Martin County</span> is included in the Port St. <span class="loc">Lucie</span>, <span class="loc">FL</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Port St. <span class="loc">Lucie</span>, <span class="loc">FL</span> Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Martin County</span> was created in 1925 with the northern portion coming from St. <span class="loc">Lucie County</span> and southern portion coming from Palm <span class="loc">Beach County</span>. It was named for John W. Martin, Governor of <span class="loc">Florida</span> from 1925 to 1929. When the county was created, the western contour followed the shore of <span class="loc">Lake Okeechobee</span>, as did the borders of Glades, Okeechobee, and <span class="loc">Hendry counties</span>. Palm <span class="loc">Beach County</span> had historically claimed all of the surface of the lake as part of its area, to its benefit for the distribution of state and federal highway funds. The state representative of <span class="loc">Martin County</span>, William Ralph Scott of Stuart, initiated a bill to divide the lake among its adjacent counties, creating a more equitable distribution of state funds for road creation and maintenance. All bordering counties confirmed the justice of this change and supported its ratification, with the exception of Palm <span class="loc">Beach County</span>. Representatives from Palm <span class="loc">Beach County</span> later presented Representative William Scott with a jug of water, signifying "all the water Bill Scott left Palm <span class="loc">Beach County</span>." The jug is in the possession of Stuart Heritage.</p>
