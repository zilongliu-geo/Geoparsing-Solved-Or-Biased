  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Churchill</span> is a village and civil parish in <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is located in the unitary authority of <span class="loc">North Somerset</span>, on the western edge of the <span class="loc">Mendip Hills</span> about 8 miles (12.9 km) east of <span class="loc">Weston-super-Mare</span>. The parish, which includes the village of <span class="loc">Lower Langford</span> and the hamlet of <span class="loc">Upper Langford</span> has a population of 2,235. The village has a post office with shop and tea rooms, a fish and chip shop, a memorial hall, a doctor's surgery, a hotel, a number of bed and breakfasts, a sports centre with swimming pool, a dry ski slope and outdoor pursuits centre and four pubs: The <span class="org">Crown</span> Inn, The Nelson Arms, The <span class="per">Stag</span> and <span class="per">Hounds</span> and <span class="per">The Churchill</span> Inn. The <span class="per">Churchill</span> family, who gave rise to the first <span class="per">Duke of Marlborough</span> and later Sir <span class="per">Winston Churchill</span>, derives its name from the parish. They had historical connections with it. The village is around the junction of the A38 and A368 and is overlooked by <span class="loc">Dolebury Warren</span>, a biological <span class="org">Site of Special Scientific Interest</span> (SSSI) which has evidence of occupation of the site during the Iron Age, and Romano-British materials. In addition to the remains of double ramparts of an Iron Age hill fort still being visible there is also evidence of a medieval rabbit warren. At Dinghurst south of the village is the site of an Iron Age univallate hill fort and Roman fort.</p><br><br>
