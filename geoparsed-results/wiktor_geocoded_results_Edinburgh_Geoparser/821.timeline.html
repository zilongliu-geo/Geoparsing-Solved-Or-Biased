  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Guernsey County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies in southeastern <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, in the Appalachian Plateau of the Appalachian Mountains. The population was 11,129 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the principal city of the <span class="org">Cambridge Micropolitan Statistical Area</span> and is located adjacent to the intersection of Interstates 70 and 77. The Motto is "That's as Good as It's Gonna Get." <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is well-known among glass collectors as being the location for the <span class="loc">Cambridge Glass</span>, <span class="loc">Boyd Glass</span> and <span class="loc">Mosser Glass</span> plants. The <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> area is also noted for its "S" shaped bridges, dating back to the building of the National Road in <span class="date">1828</span>. In <span class="date">1796</span>, <span class="per">Col. Ebenezar Haase</span> received funds to blaze a road suitable for travel by horse through the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> wilderness from a point on the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> opposite <span class="per">Wheeling, Virginia</span> (<span class="date">now</span> Wheeling, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>) to another point opposite <span class="loc">Maysville</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. Where this road, known as Zane's Trace, crossed <span class="loc">Wills Creek</span>, a ferry was established in <span class="date">1798</span>. This was followed by the first bridge authorized by the legislature of the Northwest Territory, built in <span class="date">1803</span>. The land on which part of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> stands was granted to <span class="per">Zaccheus</span> <span class="per">Biggs</span> and <span class="per">Zaccheus</span> <span class="loc">Beatty</span> by the government in <span class="date">1801</span>. A settlement grew up at the creek crossing. The town of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> was platted there in <span class="date">1806</span>. Both <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> have been speculated by historians as having inspired the naming of the town. Also in <span class="date">1806</span>, another group of early settlers from the <span class="loc">Isle of Guernsey</span> in the English Channel pitched camp in <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, reportedly because the women in the party refused to move on. The county for which <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> serves as the county seat was later named in honor of its many settlers from <span class="loc">Guernsey</span>.</p><br><br>
