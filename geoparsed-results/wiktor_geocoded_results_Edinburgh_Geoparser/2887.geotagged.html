<p><span class="loc">Hata</span> (波田, <span class="loc">Hata</span>) was a town located in <span class="loc">Higashichikuma District</span>, Nagano Prefecture, <span class="loc">Japan</span>. Before <span class="loc">Hata</span> became a town, it was three villages: Kami-Hata (上波多), Shimo-Hata (下波多), and Samizo (三溝). In 1973, these three villages merged into a town under the enforcement of the town system. On March 31, 2010, <span class="loc">Hata</span> (波田町; -machi) was merged into the expanded city <span class="loc">Matsumoto</span>. Originally, <span class="loc">Hata</span> was written as 波多 (Hata) in kanji. 波 means "wave" and 多 means "much". The name meant "many waves", reflecting the abundance of clean water the town had. In 1932, the name was changed from 波多 to the current 波田. 田 means "rice paddies" and reflected the town's hope for abundant water and rice cultivation. Hata's main industry is farming and produces various vegetables and fruits, including watermelons, corn, apples, peaches, and so on. <span class="loc">Hata</span> is built on a river terrace. The town's slogan is "A Fascinating Town on a <span class="loc">River Terrace</span>" reflects this.</p>
