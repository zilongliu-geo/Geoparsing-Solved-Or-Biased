  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Xinjiang</span> (Uyghur: شىنجاڭ‎, ULY: Shinjang; Mandarin pronunciation: [ɕíntɕjɑ́ŋ]; Chinese: 新疆; pinyin: Xīnjiāng), officially the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, is an autonomous region of <span class="loc">China</span> in the northwest of the country. It is the largest Chinese administrative division, the 8th largest country subdivision in the world, spanning over 1.6 million km2. It contains the disputed territory of <span class="loc">Aksai Chin</span> administered by <span class="loc">China</span>. Xinjiang borders the countries of <span class="loc">Mongolia</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, <span class="loc">Kazakhstan</span>, <span class="loc">Kyrgyzstan</span>, <span class="loc">Tajikistan</span>, <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>, <span class="loc">Pakistan</span> and <span class="loc">India</span>. The extremely rugged Karakoram, <span class="loc">Kunlun</span>, and <span class="loc">Tian Shan</span> mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, as well as its western and southern regions. <span class="loc">Xinjiang</span> also borders <span class="loc">Tibet Autonomous Region</span> and the <span class="loc">provinces of Gansu and Qinghai</span>. The most well-known route of the historical Silk Road ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border. In recent <span class="date">decades</span>, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in <span class="loc">Xinjiang</span>, and it is currently <span class="loc">China</span>'s largest natural gas-producing region. It is home to a number of ethnic groups including the Uyghur, <span class="loc">Han</span>, Kazakhs, Tajiks, <span class="loc">Hui</span>, <span class="loc">Kyrgyz</span>, and Mongols. More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are in <span class="loc">Xinjiang</span>. Older English-language reference works often refer to the area as "Chinese <span class="loc">Turkestan</span>". <span class="loc">Xinjiang</span> is divided into the <span class="loc">Dzungarian Basin</span> in the north and the <span class="loc">Tarim Basin</span> in the south by a mountain range. Only about 4.3% of Xinjiang's land area is fit for human habitation.</p><br><br>
