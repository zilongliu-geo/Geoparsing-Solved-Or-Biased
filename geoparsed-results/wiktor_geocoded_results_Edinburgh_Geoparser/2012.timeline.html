  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Kole</span> is a rather remote town in central <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> on the <span class="loc">Lukenie</span> River. It is the administrative center of the <span class="per">Kole</span> Territory, which in turn is part of the <span class="loc">Sankuru District</span> of the <span class="loc">Kasai-Oriental Province</span>. <span class="per">Kole</span> is sometimes designated "<span class="per">Kole Sur</span> <span class="loc">Lukenie</span>" to distinguish it from other "Koles" in the DRC. According to local Ministry of Health officials, the population of the town in <span class="date">2007</span> was about 10,060 persons (the total for the territoire is said to be 71,040). The settlement consists of a few score stuccoed brick buildings, many of them left over from the <span class="date">now</span> defunct cotton plantations of the area. The majority of residents, however, live in very simple wattle and daub houses of their own construction. The people of <span class="per">Kole</span>, and for tens of kilometers around the town, belong to a subtribe of the <span class="loc">Nkutu</span> (or Okutshu) known as the <span class="loc">Elembe</span> (also called Ohindu or Ohendo). They speak a dialect (Kihindo) which is mutually intelligble with other <span class="loc">Nkutu</span> tongues, as well as with that of their other near neighbors (and relatives), the <span class="loc">Tetela</span>. The <span class="loc">Elembe</span> are traditionally settled farmers in contrast to other <span class="loc">Nkutu</span> groups which are traditional hunting communities. All of these peoples (the <span class="loc">Elembe</span>, other <span class="loc">Nkutu</span> and the <span class="loc">Tetela</span>) are members of the Bantu <span class="loc">Mongo</span> "super-tribe". (Additional, smaller <span class="loc">Nkutu</span> subtribes/dialects in the area include the <span class="loc">Ngongo</span>, the <span class="loc">Hamba</span> and the <span class="loc">Saka</span>.) Most (perhaps 80 to 90%) tribespeople around <span class="per">Kole</span> also speak <span class="loc">Lingala</span>, a few speak French, and a very few speak English.</p><br><br>
