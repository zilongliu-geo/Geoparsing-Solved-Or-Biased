<p><span class="loc">Aksu</span> (<span class="loc">Kazakh</span>: Ақсу / Aqsw), literally meaning the white river, formerly known as <span class="loc">Yermak</span> (Russian: Ермак, until 1993), is a city in <span class="loc">Kazakhstan</span>, in <span class="loc">Pavlodar Region</span>, located 50 km to the south of <span class="loc">Pavlodar</span> on the left bank of the <span class="loc">Irtysh</span> River. The municipality borders <span class="loc">Aktogay District</span> in the north, <span class="loc">Bayanaul District</span>, May District, <span class="loc">Lebyazhye District</span> in the south, <span class="loc">Pavlodar District</span> in the west, and <span class="loc">city of Ekibastuz</span> in the east. Population of the municipality: 67,665 (2009 Census results); 73,165 (1999 Census results). Population of the town: 41,677 (2009 Census results); 42,264 (1999 Census results). History of <span class="loc">Yermak</span> is related to discovery of coal deposits in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Ekibastuz</span>. In 1897, construction of a 110 km railroad from <span class="loc">Ekibastuz</span> commanced. The Voskresensk railroad crossed the area of the future town. A wharf was erected where the railroad reached the <span class="loc">Irtysh</span> River, and two settlements appeared: an administrative settlement and a workers settlement. The newcomers had to build their houses using local materials: clay, reed and thatch. In this way, at the turn of the 20th century a small village made of wattle-and-daub houses arose close to <span class="loc">Kazakh</span> Aul No. 5 in the Kyzyl-Shyrpy Stow. The village was known under the name of <span class="loc">Glinka</span> (from Russian 'глина' - clay). The population of <span class="loc">Glinka</span> gradually increased, most intensively after the riots of 1906, when out-migrants poured into the <span class="loc">Kazakh</span> and Siberian steppe.</p>
