  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>City Named One of <span class="loc">America</span>’s Most Accessible. Once again, Alexandria is a finalist for the National Organization on Disability’s (NOD) Accessible <span class="loc">America</span> Competition. The city is one of seven finalists from across the country. The award “recognizes communities that have made extraordinary efforts to create an accessible environment for people with disabilities,” according to an NOD press release. The winning community will receive a $25,000 cash prize. The other finalists, <span class="loc">Denver</span>, <span class="loc">Indianapolis</span>, <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, Ky., <span class="loc">New Haven</span>, <span class="loc">Conn.</span>, <span class="loc">Sioux Falls, S.D.</span> and Surprise, Ariz., were picked from an application pool that had towns with as few as 300 people or cities with as many as 700,000 inhabitants. Any city or town was eligible to take part in the contest. Alexandria was a finalist for the award in <span class="date">2006</span> and <span class="date">2007</span>; <span class="loc">Indianapolis</span>, <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">New Haven</span> and <span class="loc">Sioux Falls</span> are also repeat finalists in the competition <span class="date">this year</span>. “The finalists are a very impressive group that are going far beyond the requirements of the law and are truly thinking outside the box to set new and inspiring examples of livable communities for all,” said AARP Livable Community Portfolio Director Brewster Thackeray. AARP sponsors the competition. The towns and cities selected as finalists had to show their efforts to include disabled people from all areas in everyday life, the NOD press release said.</p><br><br>
