  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pontevedra</span> (Galician: [ˌponteˈβɛ.ðɾa], Spanish: [ponteˈβeðɾa]) is a Spanish city in the north-west of the <span class="loc">Iberian Peninsula</span>. It is the capital of both the <span class="loc">Comarca</span> (County) and <span class="loc">Province of Pontevedra</span>, and of the <span class="loc">Rias</span> <span class="loc">Baixas</span> in <span class="loc">Galicia</span>. It is also the capital of its own municipality which is, in fact, often considered as an extension of the actual city. <span class="loc">Pontevedra</span> is the provincial district court seat. <span class="loc">Pontevedra</span> has transformed into one of the most accessible cities and has been awarded for its urban quality international prizes like the European prize, "Intermodes" in <span class="loc">Brussels</span> in <span class="date">2013</span>, the "ONU-Habitat" prize in <span class="loc">Dubai</span> in <span class="date">2014</span> and the "Excellence Prize" of the <span class="org">Center for Active Design</span> in <span class="loc">New York</span> in <span class="date">2015</span>. The name of the city is likely a Latin composite of pons, pontis (bridge) and veter, vetera, veterum (old, long established). In <span class="loc">Galicia</span>, Latin pons, a masculine word, became feminine, hence Vulgar Latin Ponte Vetera, which became by the 13th century the modern Galician language toponymy <span class="loc">Pontevedra</span>, "the old bridge", in reference to an old Roman bridge across the Lérez river, which had been located near the 12th century <span class="loc">Burgo</span> Bridge that remains in place <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
