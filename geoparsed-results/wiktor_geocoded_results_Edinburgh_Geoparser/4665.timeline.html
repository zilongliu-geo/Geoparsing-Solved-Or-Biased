  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Buto</span> (Greek: Βουτώ, Arabic: بوتو‎, <span class="loc">Butu</span>), Butus (Greek: Βοῦτος, Boutos), or Butosus, <span class="date">now</span> Tell al-Fara'in (Pharaohs' Mound) near the <span class="loc">city of Desouk</span> (Arabic: دسوق‎), was an ancient city located 95 km east of Alexandria in the <span class="loc">Nile Delta</span> of <span class="loc">Egypt</span>. The city stood on the Sebennytic arm of the <span class="loc">Nile</span>, near its mouth, and on the southern shore of the <span class="loc">Butic</span> Lake (Greek: Βουτικὴ λίμνη, Boutikē limnē). It is the modern Kem Kasir. <span class="loc">Buto</span> originally was two cities, <span class="per">Pe</span> and <span class="per">Dep</span>, which merged into one city that the Egyptians named Per-Wadjet. The goddess Wadjet was its local goddess, often represented as a cobra, and she was considered the patron deity of <span class="loc">Lower Egypt</span>. Her oracle was located in her renowned temple in that city. An annual festival held in the city celebrated Wadjet. The city also contained a sanctuary of <span class="loc">Horus</span> and much later, became associated with Isis. The city was an important site in the Predynastic era of Ancient <span class="loc">Egypt</span> that includes the cultural developments of <span class="date">ten thousand years</span> from the Paleolithic to <span class="date">3100 BC</span>. Archaeological evidence shows that Upper Egyptian culture replaced the Buto-culture at the delta when Upper and <span class="loc">Lower Egypt</span> were unified, and the replacement is considered important evidence for the unification of the two portions of <span class="loc">Egypt</span> into one entity. At that time Wadjet joined Nekhbet, who was represented as a white vulture and held the same position as the patron of <span class="loc">Upper Egypt</span>, and together they were known as the two ladies [4] who were the patrons of the unified <span class="loc">Egypt</span>. The image of Nekhbet joined Wadjet on the Uraeus that would encircle the crown of the pharaohs who ruled the unified <span class="loc">Egypt</span>.</p><br><br>
