  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Santiago is a fourth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Agusan del Norte</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 20,955 people. Santiago is politically subdivided into 9 barangays. <span class="loc">Curva</span> <span class="loc">Jagupit</span> <span class="loc">Lapaz</span> <span class="loc">Poblacion</span> <span class="per">I San</span> Isidro Tagbuyacan Estanislao Morgado <span class="loc">Poblacion</span> II Pangaylan IP In the later part of <span class="date">1898</span>, a group of natives fleeing from the municipality of <span class="loc">Jabonga</span> settled in a place recognized by the municipality of <span class="loc">Cabadbaran</span> as barrio Santiago, However, in <span class="date">1924</span> the <span class="loc">Aciga</span> River swelled its banks, destroying all properties, crops and animals along it. This forced the inhabitants of Santiago, <span class="loc">Cabadbaran</span> to transfer to barrio <span class="loc">Jagupit</span>. In <span class="date">1936</span>, the same <span class="loc">Aciga</span> River wrought damage which made the inhabitants decide to transfer at the foot of the hill, particularly at Sitio Paypay, which was inhabited by two groups of natives-the Manobos and the Mamanwas, then. The construction of the national highway, which passes thru sitio <span class="loc">Paypay</span>, lured more people to settle in the place. Towards <span class="date">the end of 1936</span>, thru a bill sponsored by the late Congressman Calo, the name <span class="loc">Paypay</span> was changed to Santiago in honor of Senior Santiago or <span class="loc">Saint James</span>.</p><br><br>
