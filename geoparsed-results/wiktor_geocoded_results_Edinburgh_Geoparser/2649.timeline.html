  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Douglas (Irish: Dúglas or Dúbhglas, meaning "dark stream") is a suburb of <span class="loc">Cork city</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span> and the name given to the Roman Catholic, Church of <span class="loc">Ireland</span> and Civil parish in which it is contained. As its borders are ill-defined and it straddles the boundary between <span class="loc">Cork city</span> and <span class="loc">County Cork</span>, it is difficult to ascertain the exact population. The CSO gives a figure of 19,787  for the parts of Douglas that lie within <span class="loc">Cork County</span>. No figure is provided for the parts within <span class="loc">Cork City</span>, although the combined population of the Tramore A, Tramore B, Tramore C and Browningstown electoral divisions, which lie in Douglas, is 5,868. This suggests a total population of 25,655. Douglas was first mentioned in documents in <span class="date">1251</span>. By the mid-seventeenth century, it had a population of 308 people (of whom 33 were English) and consisted of a number of large farms. The area began to develop as an urban settlement in the early eighteenth century with the opening of Donnybrook Mills in <span class="date">1726</span>. The mills produced sail-cloth and supplied sails to the Royal Navy amongst other clients. Huguenot weavers and textile workers, such as the <span class="per">Bernard</span> and <span class="per">Pollock</span> brothers from <span class="loc">Belfast</span>, came to work in the area, along with skilled workers from <span class="loc">Ulster</span> and <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. Further textile mills opened in the nineteenth century, including Lane’s <span class="per">Corn</span> and <span class="per">Hemp</span> Mills (<span class="date">1845</span>), O’Brien’s Brothers (St Patrick’s Woollen Mills, <span class="date">1882</span>) and Conroy’s <span class="per">Rope</span> and <span class="per">Twine</span> Mills (<span class="date">1892</span>). Most of the mills ceased to operate in the early twentieth century, although St. Patrick's Woollen Mills and Donnybrook Mills continued to operate until <span class="date">the 1970s</span>.</p><br><br>
