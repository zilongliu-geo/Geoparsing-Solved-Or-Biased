  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Sanford</span> rejects aid after second rebuff. <span class="loc">COLUMBIA</span> --- <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> Gov. <span class="per">Mark Sanford</span> said <span class="date">Friday</span> he won't spend $700 million in federal stimulus cash, an announcement unlikely to affect whether the state gets the money and one that came after the Republican was twice rebuffed by the White <span class="org">House</span> in his attempts to use the cash to pay off state debt. "We're obviously disappointed by the White <span class="org">House</span>'s decision, because it cuts against the notion of federalism and the idea of each state having the flexibility to act in a manner that best suits its needs," <span class="per">Mr. Sanford</span> said. "As a result, we will not be seeking the use of these federal funds for the way they put our state even further into an unconscionable level of debt." <span class="per">Mr. Sanford</span> has become a prominent voice in opposing federal bailouts. He contends that stimulus money won't increase employment and will merely add to federal debt that will lead to higher taxes. On <span class="date">Thursday</span>, Alaska Gov. <span class="per">Sarah Palin</span> said she would reject nearly a third of an estimated $930 million that could flow to her state. <span class="per">Mr. Sanford</span>, who is in <span class="loc">Nevada</span> for Air Force Reserve training, released a statement about an hour after White <span class="org">House</span> budget chief <span class="per">Peter Orszag</span> denied his request to use a portion of federal stimulus money to pay off school construction debt. <span class="per">Mr. Orszag</span> sent <span class="per">Mr. Sanford</span> a letter <span class="date">Friday</span> saying the money can't be used on debt payments and instead needs to restore funding cuts from state budgets and help aid schools. One of the goals of the $787 billion stimulus package is "to make critical investments in long-term economic growth, such as providing every child the chance for a world-class education," <span class="per">Mr. Orszag</span> wrote. In all, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> is to get about $2.8 billion in federal stimulus money over <span class="date">two years</span>. The state's mayors had implored <span class="per">Mr. Sanford</span> to take all the money he could, and the Republican-dominated Legislature has already made plans to spend the portion the governor balked on. In <span class="date">January</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> had the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation and officials had to cut $1 billion from a $7 billion budget as the recession dampened revenue collections. The <span class="org">House</span> <span class="date">last week</span> passed a $6.6 billion budget patched together with $1 billion in stimulus cash. <span class="per">Mr. Sanford</span>'s anti-bailout stance was one of the things that led <span class="org">House</span> Majority Whip <span class="per">James Clyburn</span>, D-S.C., to insert language into the bill allowing state legislators to override governors, a move that has raised constitutional concerns. <span class="per">Mr. Clyburn</span> disagrees. "For one, nobody is sidestepping the governor. The governor is taking himself out of the game," <span class="per">Mr. Clyburn</span> said. Senate Finance Committee Chairman <span class="per">Hugh Leatherman</span>, R-Florence, said taking the money over <span class="per">Mr. Sanford</span>'s objections raises the likelihood of a lawsuit that would delay the state's ability to use it.</p><br><br>
