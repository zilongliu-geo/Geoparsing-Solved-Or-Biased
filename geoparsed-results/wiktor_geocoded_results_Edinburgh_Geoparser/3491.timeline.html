  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Clinton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located on the South Branch of the <span class="loc">Raritan River</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the town's population was 2,719, reflecting an increase of 87 (+3.3%) from the 2,632 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 578 (+28.1%) from the 2,054 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. When the <span class="per">Clinton</span> post office was established in <span class="date">1829</span>, it was named for <span class="per">DeWitt Clinton</span>, Governor of <span class="loc">New York</span> and the primary impetus behind the then-newly completed <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal. <span class="per">Clinton</span> was incorporated as a town by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on <span class="date">April 5, 1865</span>, within portions of <span class="per">Clinton, Franklin</span> and Union Townships. <span class="per">Clinton</span> gained full independence from its three parent townships in <span class="date">1895</span>. The town is perhaps best known for its two mills which sit on opposite banks of the <span class="loc">South Branch Raritan River</span>. The Red Mill, with its historic village, dates back to <span class="date">1810</span> with the development of a mill for wool processing. Across the river sits the Stone Mill, home of the <span class="org">Hunterdon Art Museum for Contemporary Craft and Design</span>, located in a former gristmill that had been reconstructed in <span class="date">1836</span> and operated continuously until <span class="date">1936</span>. In <span class="date">1952</span>, a group of local residents conceived of a plan to convert the historic building into an art museum, which is still in operation <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
