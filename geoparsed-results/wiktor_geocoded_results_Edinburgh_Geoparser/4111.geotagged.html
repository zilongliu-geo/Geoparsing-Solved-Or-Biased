<p><span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 39,451. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Prestonsburg. The county, founded in 1800, is named for Colonel John Floyd (1750â€“1783). On December 13, 1799, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation to form <span class="loc">Floyd County</span> as the 40th <span class="loc">county of Kentucky</span>. The county was made from parts of <span class="loc">Fleming</span>, <span class="loc">Montgomery</span>, and <span class="loc">Mason County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The legislation became effective on June 1, 1800. The county was named for James John Floyd, a pioneer surveyor who helped lay out the <span class="loc">city of Louisville</span>. The county seat was Preston's Station, later renamed Prestonsburg. The first court house burned down on April 8, 1808, destroying all the early records, so the earliest records of government activity do not date prior to 1808. Prestonsburg was used as a Confederate stronghold during the Civil War and two battles took place nearby, the Battle of <span class="loc">Ivy Mountain</span> on November 8, 1861 and the Battle of <span class="loc">Middle Creek</span> on January 10, 1862. Both were Union victories. In 1958, the county was the site of one of the deadliest bus accidents in <span class="loc">U.S.</span> history.</p>
