  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Davenport (English pronunciation: /ˈdævənpɔːrt/) is the largest city located along the <span class="loc">Mississippi River</span> in <span class="loc">Scott County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Davenport is the county seat of and largest city in <span class="loc">Scott County</span>; it is also the largest of the <span class="loc">Quad Cities</span>, a metropolitan area with a population estimate of 382,630 and a CSA population of 474,226, making it the 90th largest CSA in the nation. Davenport was founded on <span class="date">May 14, 1836</span> by <span class="per">Antoine LeClaire</span> and was named for his friend, <span class="per">George Davenport</span>, a colonel during the Black Hawk War stationed at nearby <span class="loc">Fort Armstrong</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a population of 99,685 (making it <span class="loc">Iowa</span>'s third-largest city). However, the city is currently appealing this figure, arguing that the Census Bureau missed a section of residents that would place the total population over 100,000, and indeed, even the Census Bureau's own estimate for Davenport's <span class="date">2011</span> population is 100,802. Located approximately half way between <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and <span class="loc">Des Moines</span>, Davenport is on the border of <span class="loc">Iowa</span> and <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The city is prone to frequent flooding due to its location on the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. There are two main universities: <span class="org">Saint Ambrose University and Palmer College of Chiropractic</span>, which is where the first chiropractic adjustment took place. Several annual music festivals take place in Davenport, including the <span class="loc">Mississippi Valley Blues Festival</span>, The <span class="loc">Mississippi Valley Fair</span>, and the <span class="loc">Bix</span> <span class="org">Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival</span>. An internationally known 7-mile (11 km) foot race called the <span class="loc">Bix</span> 7 is run during the festival. The city has a Class A minor league baseball team, the <span class="loc">Quad Cities</span> River Bandits. Davenport has 50 plus parks and over 20 miles (32 km) of recreational paths for biking or walking.</p><br><br>
