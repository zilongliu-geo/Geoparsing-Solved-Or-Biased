<p><span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is a rural-suburban town in the eastern central portion of <span class="loc">Essex County</span> in <span class="loc">eastern Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the 2010 census, it had a population of 7,764. Currently the town has no manufacturing industry and no industrially-zoned land. Its location on the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> provides easy access to the Atlantic seashore with its reservations, beaches and boating. The town includes many historic houses, pastoral landscapes, and old stone walls that accompany winding tree-lined roads. It also has a rich equestrian heritage, which remains strong due to the influence of the many horse farms and of Myopia Hunt Club, which holds frequent equestrian events, including polo most Sunday afternoons. (Myopia also hosts a Thanksgiving Day fox hunt each year that the public may attend.) Thus, the visitor to <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> may well share the secondary roads with horse and pony riders. <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is closely tied to neighboring <span class="loc">Wenham</span>, sharing a school system, library, recreation department, commuter rail station and newspaper. In 2010, the community of Hamilton-Wenham was listed among the "Best Places to Live" by Boston Magazine.</p>
