  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Linton</span> is a village in rural <span class="loc">Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, on the border with <span class="loc">Essex</span>. It has been expanded much since <span class="date">the 1960s</span> and is <span class="date">now</span> one of many dormitory villages around <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>. The railway station was on the Stour Valley Railway between <span class="loc">Shelford</span> and <span class="loc">Colchester</span>, closed since <span class="date">1967</span>. The <span class="loc">Rivey Hill</span> overlooks the village, with its famous water tower. The <span class="loc">River Granta</span> runs through the village. <span class="org">Linton Zoo</span> is on the southern edge of <span class="loc">Linton</span>, whilst <span class="loc">Chilford</span> Hall and its vineyards are to the north side, beyond Linton's best-known feature, Rivey Tower. The A1307 passes through the village. The <span class="loc">Icknield Way Path</span> passes through the village on its 110 mile journey from <span class="loc">Ivinghoe Beacon</span> in <span class="loc">Buckinghamshire</span> to <span class="loc">Knettishall Heath</span> in <span class="loc">Suffolk</span>. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes through the village. Many businesses are based in <span class="loc">Linton</span>, with several around the trading estate at The Grip and along the High Street. Spread evenly along the High Street are the three public houses. The <span class="org">Crown</span> has an attached restaurant. The <span class="per">Dog</span> and <span class="per">Duck</span> focusses on fresh Italian-influenced food and is styled internally on a contemporary European bistro theme. Near the fire station is the <span class="per">Waggon</span> and <span class="per">Horses</span>, which has been resurrected by a new landlord. Although it has been closed for <span class="date">several years</span>, The Bell probably remains Linton's most famous pub.</p><br><br>
