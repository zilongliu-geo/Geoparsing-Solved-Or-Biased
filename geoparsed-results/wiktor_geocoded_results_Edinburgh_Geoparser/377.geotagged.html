<p>The Town of Limon is the Statutory Town that is the most populous municipality in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Limon is located immediately east of <span class="loc">Elbert County</span>. The population was 1880 at the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. Limon has been called the "<span class="loc">Hub City</span>" of Eastern <span class="loc">Colorado</span> because Interstate 70, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highways 24, 40, and 287, and State Highways 71 and 86 all pass through the town. The Limon Correctional Facility is part of the Colorado Department of Corrections system and is a major employer in the area with employment of roughly 350. Limon is listed as the official AASHTO control city for signs on Interstate 70 between <span class="loc">Denver</span> and <span class="loc">Hays</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, although westbound signs in both <span class="loc">Colorado</span> and <span class="loc">Kansas</span> often omit Limon and list the larger <span class="loc">city of Denver</span>. Limon is the western terminus of the Kyle Railroad and it is here the shortline interchanges with the Union Pacific Railroad. Trains previously stopped at Limon Railroad Depot. The town was named for John Limon, meaning lemon in Spanish, a railroad construction supervisor. Limon was the site of one of the most gruesome lynchings in American history on November 16, 1900. Preston Porter Jr, who had confessed to the murder of a white girl, was led by rope through town, and then tied to a stake and burned to death. He screamed out to be shot, but onlookers only heaped on more fuel, according to an article in the November 17, 1900, edition of The New York Times.</p>
