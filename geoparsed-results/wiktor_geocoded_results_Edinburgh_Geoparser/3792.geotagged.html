<p><span class="loc">Peterborough</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hillsborough County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,284 at the 2010 census. The central settlement in town, with 3,103 people at the 2010 census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Peterborough</span> census-designated place (CDP) and is located along the <span class="loc">Contoocook River</span> at the junction of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 202 and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 101. The community is 38 miles (61 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Manchester</span> and 72 miles (116 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Boston</span>. Granted by <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> in 1737, it was first permanently settled in 1749. The town suffered several attacks during the French and Indian War. Nevertheless, by 1759, there were fifty families settled. Incorporated on January 17, 1760 by Governor Benning Wentworth, it was named after Lieutenant Peter Prescott (1709â€“1784) of Concord, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, a prominent land speculator. The <span class="loc">Contoocook River</span> and <span class="loc">Nubanusit</span> Brook offered numerous sites for watermills, and <span class="loc">Peterborough</span> became a prosperous mill town. In 1810, the first cotton factory was established. By 1859, when the population was 2,222, there were four additional cotton factories, plus a woolen mill. Other industries included two paper mills, an iron foundry, a machine shop, a carriage factory, a basket manufacturer, a maker of trusses and supporters, a boot and shoe factory, seven sawmills, and three gristmills.</p>
