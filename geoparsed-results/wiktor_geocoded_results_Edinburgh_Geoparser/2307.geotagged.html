<p><span class="loc">Stanford</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is one of the oldest settlements in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, having been founded in 1775. Its population was 3,487 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>. <span class="loc">Stanford</span> is part of the Danville Micropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Stanford</span> was founded in 1775 by Benjamin Logan as Logan's Fort, alternately known as <span class="loc">St. Asaph</span>, the name given it by Logan. The site of the fort is about one mile west of the courthouse at the center of town. The name "<span class="loc">Fort Logan</span>" is still used to this day by local businesses, including the Fort Logan Hospital and Standing Fort Collectibles. The main street was built on what was originally a buffalo trail. The name <span class="loc">Stanford</span> may have come from "Standing Fort", which <span class="loc">Fort Logan</span> became known as because it survived multiple attacks by British-led Native Americans during the American Revolution. Alternately, it may have been named for <span class="loc">Stamford</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Although it was one of the smaller pioneer forts, it never fell to an attack. In 1781, the original settlement expanded when Benjamin Logan donated part of his own land as the site for a courthouse.</p>
