<p>Ocampo is a 3rd class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 43,523 people. Historical documents revealed that the municipality of Ocampo, known before as Mabato-bato, was existing since 1735. Mabato-bato started as a sitio which was described as abounding with rocks and boulders of various sizes which were scattered over the place. Since the early 1900s, the town of Ocampo had been a part of Pili though it separated years later, in 1949, and became an independent municipality. August 13, 1949, marked a major event in the history of the town as this was the inauguration date of Ocampo's elevation into a municipality. It was also during this day when the name <span class="loc">Matobato</span> was officially changed into Ocampo, in honor of the late Don Julian Ocampo, then the governor of <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span>. Ocampo is the place where Governor Luis Villafuerte chose to build a sprawling deer sanctuary where at present houses different deer species from both local and foreign origins. This has served both for tourist attraction and commercial purposes.</p>
