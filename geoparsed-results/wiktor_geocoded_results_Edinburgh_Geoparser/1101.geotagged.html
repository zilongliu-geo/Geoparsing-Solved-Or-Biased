<p><span class="loc">Kamo</span> is a small township north of <span class="loc">Whangarei</span>, approximately five minutes drive from the <span class="loc">Whangarei</span> CBD. The name is a MƒÅori word meaning "eyelash", but has also been said to mean "to bubble up", referring to hot springs in the area. Mount Parakiore is a volcanic dome rising 391 m to the northwest of the town. It is about one million years old, and part of the Harbour Fault which also includes <span class="loc">Mount Hikurangi</span> near <span class="loc">Hikurangi</span>, and <span class="loc">Parahaki</span> in <span class="loc">Whangarei</span>. The population was 7,038 in the 2013 Census. Coal mining was an early industry in the area. Tunnelling first started in 1875, but it was not practical to carry the coal over the unmetalled roads to <span class="loc">Whangarei</span> wharf. In 1882 a short railway line was completed between <span class="loc">Kamo</span> and <span class="loc">Whangarei</span> to carry the coal. This was one of Northland's first railways. The railway still exists as part of the <span class="loc">North Auckland Line</span>. The mine closed in 1955, with the seams worked out. <span class="loc">Limonite</span> was also quarried at <span class="loc">Kamo</span>. A Wesleyan church was built in 1881, the Anglican All Saints Church in 1886, and a Presbyterian church in 1911. The first Roman Catholic church in the <span class="loc">Whangarei</span> area opened in <span class="loc">Kamo</span> about 1881.</p>
