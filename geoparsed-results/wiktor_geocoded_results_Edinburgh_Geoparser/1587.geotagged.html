The city was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Additionally, <span class="loc">Fortaleza</span> was one of the host cities of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Fortaleza's history began on February 2, 1500, when Spaniard Vicente Pinzón landed in Mucuripe's cove and named the new land <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> de la Consolación. Because of the Treaty of <span class="loc">Tordesillas</span>, the discovery was never officially sanctioned. Colonisation began in 1603, when the Portuguese Pero Coelho de Souza constructed the Fort of São <span class="loc">Tiago</span> and founded the settlement of <span class="loc">Nova Lisboa</span> (<span class="loc">New Lisbon</span>). After a victory over the French in 1612, Martins Soares Moreno expanded the Fort of São <span class="loc">Tiago</span> and changed its name to Forte de São Sebastião.</p>
