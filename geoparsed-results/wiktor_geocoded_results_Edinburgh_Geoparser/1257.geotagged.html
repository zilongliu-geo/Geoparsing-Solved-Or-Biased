<p>Tapa is a town in <span class="loc">Lääne-Viru County</span>, <span class="loc">Estonia</span>. Located at the junction of the country's Tallinn–Narva (west–east) and Tallinn–Tartu–Valga (north–south) railway lines, it is an important centre of transit for freight (mainly Russian oil and timber) as well as rail passengers (mostly Estonian commuters). A home to soldiers since the 1930s, Tapa also plays an important role in training young men and women in the Estonian Defense Forces. The Valgejõgi River passes Tapa on its northeastern side. Tapa developed as a village probably in the 13th–14th centuries. It was first mentioned in 1482, and the Tapa knight manor (Taps) in 1629. Tapa was officially recognized as a town in 1926. In October 2005, the town merged with the municipalities of <span class="loc">Lehtse Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Saksi Parish</span>, and <span class="loc">Jäneda Parish</span> to form Tapa Parish. Tapa Museum was opened on 10 June 2004. The museum, in a 1934, two-storey house, collects and exhibits objects, including photos and documents, related to the history and culture of Tapa. All of the objects in the museum reflect the soul of Tapa's citizens, past and present. Temporary exhibits celebrate notable days in Tapa's history and feature hobbies of the town's residents. The permanent collection presents Tapa as a railway, military, and sausage town.</p>
