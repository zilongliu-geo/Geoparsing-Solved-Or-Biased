  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> is located between <span class="loc">Middleton</span> (in the <span class="loc">Annapolis</span> Valley) and <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> (on the <span class="loc">South Shore</span>). <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is in the centre of western <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> located on Trunk 10, 140 km west of <span class="loc">Halifax</span>. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> lies within the Atlantic Upland. Springfield's economic development has been shaped largely by the forestry industry, but farming has also been an important occupation in this area. Most of the forests are privately owned, and many can best be called farm woodlots, or Balsam fir <span class="date">Christmas</span> tree farms. Many of the <span class="date">Christmas</span> trees are shipped to other eastern Canadian provinces or to the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The largest sawmill in <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> once was located in nearby <span class="loc">Hastings</span>. The mill was started in <span class="date">1902</span> and began operating under the name the <span class="org">Davison Lumber Company</span> in <span class="date">1903</span>. They built numerous railway lines in the area to haul logs which were connected to the <span class="loc">Halifax</span> and South Western Railway running between <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> and <span class="loc">Middleton</span>. One rail line connected with <span class="loc">Lake Pleasant</span> and to the remote mill area of <span class="loc">Crossburn</span>, and as far east as South river Lake near <span class="loc">Lake George</span>. evidence of the old rail lines can still be found <span class="date">today</span>. In <span class="date">1905</span>, the company built 30 houses, a large three-story cookhouse, an office, and a school. In <span class="date">1914</span>, <span class="per">Hastings</span>, (the mill site was named after owner <span class="per">John M. Hastings</span> of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>) continued to boom with more houses, a warehouse, a store, a doctor's office, and a large clubhouse (which contained a bowling alley, two pool tables, a dressing room and a dance hall). The mill went bankrupt in <span class="date">the 1920s</span> and a fire destroyed the mill in <span class="date">1928</span>. The fire consumed all the mill buildings and 35 of the remaining 55 houses. On <span class="date">September 10, 2005</span>, a history book was launched in <span class="loc">Springfield</span> and a monument at the old lumber mill site was unveiled.</p><br><br>
