  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gela</span> (Italian pronunciation: [ˈdʒɛːla]; Ancient Greek: Γέλα), is an ancient town (among the oldest continually inhabited in southern <span class="loc">Italy</span>) and comune in the <span class="loc">province of Caltanissetta</span> in the <span class="loc">south of Sicily</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>. The city is located about 84 kilometres (52 miles) from the <span class="loc">city of Caltanissetta</span>, on the <span class="loc">Mediterranean Sea</span>. The city has a larger population than the provincial capital, and ranks second in land area. As of <span class="date">2014</span> its population was 76,723. The city was founded around <span class="date">688 BC</span> by colonists from <span class="loc">Rhodes</span> and <span class="loc">Crete</span>, <span class="date">45 years</span> after the founding of <span class="loc">Syracuse</span>. The city was named after the river <span class="loc">Gela</span>. The Greeks had many colonies in the south of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Italy</span>, and for <span class="date">many centuries</span> the Greeks had a major influence on the area. <span class="loc">Gela</span> flourished and, after only <span class="date">a century</span>, a group of Geloi founded the colony of <span class="loc">Agrigento</span>. The expansion, however, led to economic and social strain, which led the plebs to leave the city and settle in nearby Maktorion. However, the revolt was opposed by the high priest of Diana and the exiled plebs returned to <span class="loc">Gela</span>.</p><br><br>
