<p><span class="loc">Varna</span> (Bulgarian: Варна, pronounced [ˈvarnɐ]) is the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> Coast and the third largest city in <span class="loc">Bulgaria</span> with a population of 335,949. It is also the fourth largest city on the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span>. Often referred to as the marine (or summer) capital of <span class="loc">Bulgaria</span>, <span class="loc">Varna</span> is a major tourist destination, a starting point for all the resorts in the northern Bulgarian <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> Coast, a business and university centre, seaport, and headquarters of the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In April 2008, <span class="loc">Varna</span> was designated seat of the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> Euro-Region (a new regional organization, not identical to the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> Euroregion) by the Council of Europe. The oldest golden jewelry in the world, belonging to the <span class="loc">Varna</span> culture, was discovered in the <span class="loc">Varna</span> Necropolis, located in the present <span class="loc">city of Varna</span>; it consists of jewelry dating to 4200-4600 BC. Theophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name <span class="loc">Varna</span>, as the city came to be known with the Slavic conquest of the <span class="loc">Balkans</span> in the 6th–7th century. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> for many years, reaching <span class="loc">Constantinople</span> in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of 'värn' is 'shield', 'defense' - hence <span class="loc">Varna</span> is a defended, fortified place. The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from Proto-Indo-European root we-r- (water) (see also <span class="loc">Varuna</span>), or from Proto-Slavic root varn (black), or from Iranian bar or var (camp, fortress: see also Etymological list of <span class="loc">provinces of Bulgaria</span>). According to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached the so-called <span class="loc">Varna</span> near Odyssos  [sic] (τὴν λεγομένην Βάρναν, πλησίον Ὀδυσσοῦ) and the midlands thereof. Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name <span class="loc">Varna</span> was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians in the 970's, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name <span class="loc">Odessos</span>. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.</p>
