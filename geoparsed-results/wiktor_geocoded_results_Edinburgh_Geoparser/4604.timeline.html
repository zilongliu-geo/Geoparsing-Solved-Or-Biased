  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bradford</span> is a village and civil parish in the local government <span class="loc">district of Torridge</span>, <span class="loc">Devon</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The parish, which lies about six miles east of the town of <span class="loc">Holsworthy</span> has part of its eastern boundary formed by the <span class="loc">River Torridge</span>, and it is surrounded clockwise from the north by the parishes of <span class="loc">Milton Damerel</span>, <span class="loc">Shebbear</span>, <span class="loc">Black Torrington</span>, <span class="loc">Ashwater</span>, <span class="loc">Cookbury</span> and <span class="loc">Thornbury</span>. In <span class="date">2001</span> its population was 359, compared to 280 in <span class="date">1901</span>. The parish church, dedicated to <span class="loc">All Saints</span>, is in the village of <span class="loc">Bradford</span> and mostly dates from the early 14th century although it has a Norman doorway and baptismal font. By the 19th century the church was in poor condition and was restored twice, in <span class="date">1869</span> and in <span class="date">1875</span>â€“89. Within the parish are several former manors mentioned in the Domesday book of <span class="date">1086</span>: <span class="loc">Bradford</span>, <span class="loc">Dunsland</span>, <span class="loc">Henscott</span> and <span class="loc">Lashbrook</span>. <span class="loc">Dunsland</span> was the home of several notable <span class="loc">Devon</span> families and the fine house had just been extensively renovated by the National Trust when it was destroyed by fire in <span class="date">1967</span>. Hengist the Saxon is said to have camped at <span class="loc">Bradford</span>.</p><br><br>
