<p><span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> is an industrial city in eastern <span class="loc">Contra</span> <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> in the <span class="loc">East Bay</span> region of the San Francisco Bay Area. The population was 63,264 at the 2010 census. In 1849, Colonel Jonathan D. Stevenson (from <span class="loc">New York</span>) bought the <span class="loc">Rancho</span> <span class="loc">Los Medanos</span> land grant, and laid out a town he called <span class="loc">New York of the Pacific</span>. By 1850, this venture failed. With the discovery of coal in the nearby town of <span class="loc">Nortonville</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, the place became a port for coaling, and adopted the name <span class="loc">Black Diamond</span>, after the mining firm that built the <span class="loc">Black Diamond</span> Coal Mining Railroad from there to <span class="loc">Nortonville</span>. Because of the industrial potential of the site, a name change to <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> was proposed in 1909. <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span>, originally settled in 1839, was called first "New <span class="loc">York</span> Landing", then "<span class="loc">Black Diamond</span>", before citizens voted on "Pittsburg" on February 11, 1911. The name "Pittsburg" has at least two origins. First, it was the name of a coal mining company that built a railroad in 1865 on the eastern edge of what is now the city. Second, some citizens wanted to honor <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, (without the "H"), because of the city's relations with the steel building industry, which was first established by the Columbia Geneva Steel Company. The original town site fronts on the Sacramento/San Joaquin River Delta, reflecting its origins as a deep water channel river port. (As of January 1, 2007, state legislation [Assembly Bill 2324] enabled the city to manage its own riverfront for commercial development and subsequent port operations).</p>
