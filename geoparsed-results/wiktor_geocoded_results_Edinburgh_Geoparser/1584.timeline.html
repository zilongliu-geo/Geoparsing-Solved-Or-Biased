  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Miami</span> is a community in <span class="loc">southern Manitoba</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> which was formed in <span class="date">1885</span>. It supports a K-12 school and has a curling rink and a skating rink. It lies 100 kilometres southwest of <span class="loc">Winnipeg</span> in the Rural Municipality of <span class="loc">Thompson</span>. <span class="loc">Miami</span> also has a well trained fire department. Members of the department are trained to a minimum Level I fire fighting certification with the <span class="org">Office of the Fire Commissioner</span>. The <span class="org">Miami Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service</span> has about 24 active members. The town also has a well trained and well equipped EMS Unit that works in conjunction with the surrounding hospitals. In <span class="date">2005</span>, the town was the victim of a mass street sign theft. All of the town's signs, a total of 44, were stolen just before <span class="date">Christmas Day</span>; total replacement cost was about $7,000 CAD. It just so happened that same night a house fire was reported and no street signs were available for directions. Most of the streets in the community are named after prominent past residents or pioneers. <span class="loc">Miami</span> was used in a controversial prank contest by Winnipeg radio station Classic Rock 97.5 FM (CJKR) morning man <span class="per">Scruff Connors</span> in <span class="date">1995</span>. The radio station ran a contest for an all expenses paid trip to <span class="loc">Miami</span> to watch the Super Bowl, but did not mention that they were referring to <span class="loc">Miami</span>, <span class="loc">Manitoba</span> and not the one in <span class="loc">Florida</span>. Local media reported that some participants had considered lawsuits over the prank. Because of the negative backlash of the prank, CJKR terminated <span class="per">Connors</span>' contract within <span class="date">days</span> of the incident.</p><br><br>
