  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Brewster</span> /ˈbruːstər/ is a town in <span class="loc">Barnstable County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="loc">Barnstable County</span> being coextensive with Cape Cod. The population of <span class="per">Brewster</span> was 9,820 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Brewster</span> is twinned with the town of <span class="loc">Budleigh Salterton</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. <span class="per">Brewster</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1656</span> as a northeastern parish of the town of <span class="loc">Harwich</span>. The town separated from <span class="loc">Harwich</span> as the northern, more wealthy parish in <span class="date">1693</span>, and was officially incorporated as its own town in <span class="date">1803</span> when the less wealthy citizens of <span class="loc">Harwich</span> were upset that the town's institutions were all on <span class="per">Brewster</span>'s main street (<span class="date">now</span> Route 6A), including the town hall and churches. <span class="per">Brewster</span> was named in honor of Elder <span class="per">William Brewster</span>, the first religious leader of the Pilgrims at <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span>. The town's history grew around <span class="loc">Stony Brook</span>, where the first water-powered grist and woolen mill in the country was founded in the late 17th century. There were many rich sea captains in the town, who built many of the mansions and stately homes which <span class="date">now</span> constitute the town's inns and bed-and-breakfasts. Most notable of these are the <span class="loc">Crosby</span> Mansion on <span class="loc">Crosby</span> Lane by <span class="loc">Crosby</span> Beach, which is currently undergoing renovations to allow for more weddings and other functions, and the <span class="per">Captain Freeman Inn</span> on Breakwater Road.</p><br><br>
