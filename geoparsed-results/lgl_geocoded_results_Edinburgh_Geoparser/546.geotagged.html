<p><span class="loc">Lamar County</span> sales tax still booming. Paris and Roxton continue to reap sales tax benefits from the construction of natural gas pipelines through <span class="loc">Lamar County</span> and a compressor station near <span class="loc">Howland</span>. Paris showed a 22.83 percent increase in January sales tax collections compared to a year ago and Roxton showed a 48.84 percent increase, according to a report on March sales tax distributions Friday by Texas Comptroller Susan Combs. Local entities receive half of the sales taxes collected on materials purchased for the pipeline with the municipalities where purchases are made receiving half. Both Sun Valley and <span class="loc">Toco</span> showed gains in March distributions on taxes collected in January. Sun Valley’s March check for $5,039 was up 15.92 percent from March 2008 while <span class="loc">Toco</span> received $4,365.75, an increase of 18.88 percent. Combs delivered $433.4 million in March sales tax payments to <span class="loc">Texas cities</span>, counties, transit systems and special purpose taxing districts, down 0.6 percent compared to March 2008. But for the calendar year, local sales tax allocations remain up 2.2 percent compared to the first three months of 2008. “State sales tax collections declined in February as important sectors such as retail trade and construction continue to struggle,” Combs said. “While state sales tax revenue has grown 2.8 percent through the first half of fiscal 2009, further declines are expected as the economy continues to weaken.” Paris collected $597,667.29 in March based on January sales taxes compared to $486,559.61 in 2008. Year to date the city has received $2,104,006.98 compared to $1.623,427.54 in 2008. (See accompanying chart.)</p>
