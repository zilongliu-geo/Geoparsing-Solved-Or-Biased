  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Warren County</span> is a county located in the central part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 39,839. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is McMinnville. <span class="loc">Warren County</span> comprises the McMinnville, <span class="org">TN Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Warren County</span> was created by European Americans in <span class="date">1807</span> from a portion of <span class="loc">White County</span>, and named for <span class="per">Joseph Warren</span> (<span class="date">1741</span>–<span class="date">1775</span>), a solder in the American Revolution. The revised Tennessee State Constitution of <span class="date">1834</span> stated that no new county could be within 12 miles (19 km) of the county seat of the county from which it was formed. The boundaries of five counties formed from <span class="per">Warren</span>— <span class="loc">Grundy</span>, <span class="loc">Van Buren</span>, <span class="loc">Cannon</span>, <span class="loc">Coffee</span> and <span class="loc">DeKalb</span>— were exactly 12 miles from <span class="per">Warren</span>'s county seat, McMinnville, giving the county its distinctive round shape. Historically dominated by yeomen farmers who owned few or no slaves, <span class="loc">Warren County</span> was the site of several saltpeter mines. <span class="loc">Saltpeter</span> is the main ingredient of gunpowder and was obtained by leaching the earth from several local caves. <span class="loc">Hubbards</span> Cave, near <span class="loc">Camp Woodlee</span>, was a major operation. <span class="loc">Henshaw</span> Cave on <span class="loc">Cardwell Mountain</span> (<span class="date">now</span> part of Cumberland Caverns) and Solomon <span class="loc">Saltpeter Cave</span> on <span class="loc">Ben Lomond Mountain</span> were relatively small mining operations. Most saltpeter mining occurred during the War of <span class="date">1812</span> and the Civil War.</p><br><br>
