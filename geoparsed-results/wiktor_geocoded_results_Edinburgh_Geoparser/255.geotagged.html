<p>Luna is a third class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">La Union</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 35,380 people. Luna is politically subdivided into 40 barangays. Luna's poblacion (town center) consists of the four barangays: Victoria, <span class="loc">Salcedo</span>, <span class="loc">Alcala</span>, and <span class="loc">Magallanes</span>. Luna was once called "Namacpacan", which is an Ilocano word meaning “one who feeds". As early as 1587, Namacpacan was recorded as a visita (satellite mission, whose church is manned by non-resident clergy based in the cabecera) of <span class="loc">Purao</span> (now <span class="loc">Balaoan</span>). It was a settlement along the camino real (national road) from <span class="loc">Vigan</span> to Manila, and travellers stopped there to refresh themselves. Since restaurants was not yet in vogue, local families offered the travellers food and lodging, hence the name. On 18 October 1906, during the terms of Governor Joaquin Luna and Mayor Primitivo Resurrección Novicio, the town was renamed Luna by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1543. It was the first town that altered its name since the creation of the province in 1850. The change was to honour the famous Luna brothers: Revolutionary General Antonio and Spoliarium painter Juan; their mother, Doña Laureana Novicio Luna, was a native of Namacpacan.</p>
