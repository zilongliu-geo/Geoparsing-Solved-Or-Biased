<p><span class="loc">Greene County</span> is a county located on the eastern border of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 68,831. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Greeneville</span>, and the current county mayor is David Loy Crum (R). <span class="loc">Greene County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Greeneville</span>, <span class="loc">TN</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Greene County</span> developed from the "Nolichucky settlement," established by pioneer Jacob Brown on land leased in the early 1770s from the Cherokee people. The Nolichucky settlement was aligned with the Watauga settlement, centered in modern Elizabethton. After the <span class="loc">United States</span> became independent, <span class="loc">Greene County</span> was formed in 1783 from the original <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, part of the former <span class="loc">Washington District</span>. The county is named for Major General Nathanael Greene (1742-1786), a major general in the Continental Army from <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. John Crockett, father of Davy Crockett, and his wife settled in the county near Limestone. Davy was born there in 1786. At the time, the area was part of the extra-legal state Franklin. <span class="loc">Greene County</span> is the home of Tusculum College, the oldest college in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>; the state's oldest Methodist congregation (the Ebenezer Methodist Church, near <span class="loc">Chuckey</span>), and the state's second oldest continuously cultivated farm (<span class="loc">Elmwood Farm</span>, part of the Earnest Farms Historic District). Revolutionary War veteran, and state legislator, Col. Joseph Hardin made <span class="loc">Greene County</span> his home for a period of time, serving as justice of the peace and as one of the original trustees of <span class="loc">Tusculum</span> (then <span class="loc">Greeneville</span>) College.</p>
