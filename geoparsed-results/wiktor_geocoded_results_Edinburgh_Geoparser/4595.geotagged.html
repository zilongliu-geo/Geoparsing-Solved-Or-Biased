<p><span class="loc">Butler County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 14,867. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Allison. The county was organized in 1854 and named for General William O. Butler. <span class="loc">Butler County</span> was formed on January 15, 1851 from open land. It was named after Kentucky native William Orlando Butler, a general and hero of the Mexicanâ€“American War, who ran as Vice President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> in 1848. Until 1854, the county was governed by other counties. Only at this time did it have enough inhabitants to establish its own local government. The first court proceedings were conducted in a small log cabin of a settler. In 1858, the first courthouse was completed in <span class="loc">Clarksville</span>. After it was sold shortly thereafter to the local school district, it was used as a schoolhouse from 1863 until 1903. <span class="loc">Clarksville</span> was the first county seat, from 1854 to 1860, after which Butler Center became the seat. Because locals became disenchanted with Butler Center (partially because of its inaccessibility during the winter), Allison was made the county seat on January 10, 1881.</p>
