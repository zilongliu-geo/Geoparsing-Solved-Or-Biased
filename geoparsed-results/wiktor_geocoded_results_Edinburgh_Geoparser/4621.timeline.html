  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Eltham</span> (/ˈɛltəm/) is a suburban district of <span class="loc">south east London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, in the Royal Borough of <span class="loc">Greenwich</span>. It is centred 8.7 miles (14.0 km) east south-east of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. The area is identified in the <span class="org">London Plan</span> as one of 35 major centres in <span class="loc">Greater London</span>. <span class="loc">Eltham</span> developed along part of the road from <span class="loc">London</span> to <span class="loc">Maidstone</span> and lies 3 miles (4.8 km) almost due south of <span class="loc">Woolwich</span>. <span class="loc">Mottingham</span>, to the south, became part of the parish on the abolition of all extra-parochial areas, which were rare anomalies in the parish system. <span class="org">Eltham College</span> and other parts of <span class="loc">Mottingham</span> were even before the 1860s therefore not considered within Eltham's boundaries. From the 6th century <span class="loc">Eltham</span> was in the ancient Lathe of <span class="loc">Sutton at Hone</span>. In the <span class="date">1086</span> Domesday Book its hundred was named Gren[u/v]iz (Greenwich), which by the <span class="date">1166</span> was renamed Blachehedfeld (<span class="loc">Blackheath</span>) because it had become the location of the annual or more frequent hundred gathering. <span class="loc">Eltham</span> lies in the hundred of <span class="loc">Blackheath</span>, at the distance of eight miles from <span class="loc">London</span>, on the road to <span class="loc">Maidstone</span>. The parish is bounded by <span class="loc">Woolwich</span>, Plumsted, and the extraparochial hamlet of Kidbrook, on the north; by <span class="loc">Bexley</span> on the east and south east; by <span class="loc">Chislehurst</span> on the south; by the extraparochial hamlet of <span class="loc">Mottingham</span>, on the south-west, and by Lee on the west. It contains about 2,880 acres (11.7 km2): of which about 360 are woodland; about 60 waste; about three fifths of the cultivated land are arable. ....This place had formerly a market on Tuesdays, and two fairs; one at the festival of the <span class="loc">Holy Trinity</span>, and the other at that of <span class="per">St. Peter</span> and <span class="per">St. Paul</span>; both of which have been long discontinued.</p><br><br>
