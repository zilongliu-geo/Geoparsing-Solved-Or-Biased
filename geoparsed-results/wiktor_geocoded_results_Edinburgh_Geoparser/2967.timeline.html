  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Andara</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Mukwe Constituency</span>, <span class="loc">Kavango East</span>, <span class="loc">Namibia</span>. Located 200km east of <span class="loc">Rundu</span>, it is inhabited primarily by the Hambukushu people. Catholic fathers of the organization Missionary <span class="per">Oblates of</span> Mary Immaculate founded the <span class="org">Andara Mission</span> in <span class="date">1913</span>. Possibilities for this were examined already in <span class="date">1903</span> and <span class="date">1907</span>, and in <span class="date">January 1908</span> fathers <span class="per">Franz</span> <span class="per">Krist</span> and <span class="per">Franz</span> <span class="per">Lauer</span> together with lay brother <span class="per">Georg Kurz</span> founded the mission. <span class="per">Father Krist</span> left back for <span class="loc">Grootfontein</span> after <span class="date">a few weeks</span>, but he died along the way. When a new expedition arrived in <span class="loc">Andara</span>, they only found two graves. <span class="per">Lauer</span> and <span class="per">Kurz</span> had meanwhile died of blackwater fever. The new expedition also ran into difficulties, when one its members misfired his gun and <span class="per">King Libebe of</span> the Hambukushu turned hostile to the missionaries. They <span class="date">now</span> had to move to the Gcirikus, to <span class="per">King Nyangana</span> in a place that was also called <span class="per">Nyangana</span>. <span class="per">King Libebe</span> soon became reconciled with the missionaries, and the German fathers re-established <span class="loc">Andara</span> in <span class="date">1913</span>. The second attempt was done under leadership of father <span class="per">Joseph Gotthardt</span>, who later became <span class="per">Archbishop of South West Africa</span>.</p><br><br>
