<p>Kole is a rather remote town in central <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> on the <span class="loc">Lukenie</span> River. It is the administrative center of the Kole Territory, which in turn is part of the <span class="loc">Sankuru District</span> of the <span class="loc">Kasai-Oriental Province</span>. Kole is sometimes designated "Kole Sur <span class="loc">Lukenie</span>" to distinguish it from other "Koles" in the DRC. According to local Ministry of Health officials, the population of the town in 2007 was about 10,060 persons (the total for the territoire is said to be 71,040). The settlement consists of a few score stuccoed brick buildings, many of them left over from the now defunct cotton plantations of the area. The majority of residents, however, live in very simple wattle and daub houses of their own construction. The people of Kole, and for tens of kilometers around the town, belong to a subtribe of the <span class="loc">Nkutu</span> (or Okutshu) known as the <span class="loc">Elembe</span> (also called Ohindu or Ohendo). They speak a dialect (Kihindo) which is mutually intelligble with other <span class="loc">Nkutu</span> tongues, as well as with that of their other near neighbors (and relatives), the <span class="loc">Tetela</span>. The <span class="loc">Elembe</span> are traditionally settled farmers in contrast to other <span class="loc">Nkutu</span> groups which are traditional hunting communities. All of these peoples (the <span class="loc">Elembe</span>, other <span class="loc">Nkutu</span> and the <span class="loc">Tetela</span>) are members of the Bantu <span class="loc">Mongo</span> "super-tribe". (Additional, smaller <span class="loc">Nkutu</span> subtribes/dialects in the area include the <span class="loc">Ngongo</span>, the <span class="loc">Hamba</span> and the <span class="loc">Saka</span>.) Most (perhaps 80 to 90%) tribespeople around Kole also speak <span class="loc">Lingala</span>, a few speak French, and a very few speak English.</p>
