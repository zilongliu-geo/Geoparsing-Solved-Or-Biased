  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Nearly <span class="date">a week</span> after tsunami waves scoured the coasts of multiple countries in southern <span class="loc">Asia</span>, the confirmed death count is over 120,000. <span class="loc">Indonesia</span> reports it is no longer counting bodies, but merely struggling to deal with the aftermath and prevent a massive outbreak of typhoid. Near the epicenter of the earthquakes and tsunami, <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>'s <span class="loc">Aceh province</span> alone may have as many as 80,000 death. Entire villages are gone, with no evidence left of their prior existence. Still, other countries are continuing to report the numbers of dead as best they can: <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> - approximately 28,500, <span class="loc">India</span> - more than 7,700. More than 300 were killed in <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>, <span class="loc">Myanmar</span>, <span class="loc">Bangladesh</span>, the <span class="loc">Maldives</span>, <span class="loc">Somalia</span>, <span class="loc">Tanzania</span> and <span class="loc">Kenya</span>. As many as 10,500 foreign nationals are missing in the region, most of them tourists. <span class="loc">Sweden</span> has 17 confirmed dead, but more than 2,500 are still missing.</p><br><br>
