<p>Area woman sentenced for mortgage fraud. CORSICANA — A <span onClick="goto_name('Henderson County')" class="loc">Henderson County</span> woman was sentenced to 99 years in prison for her role in a mortgage fraud scheme on Monday. On March 17, a <span onClick="goto_name('Navarro County')" class="loc">Navarro County</span> jury found the defendant, Kandace Yancy Marriott, 52, of <span onClick="goto_name('Gun Barrel City')" class="loc">Gun Barrel City</span>, guilty of engaging in organized criminal activity. According to prosecutors, evidence presented at the punishment stage showed Marriott received monthly mortgage payments from her clients, failed to remit those payments to the mortgage lender, embezzled the homeowners’ funds, and therefore caused her clients to default on their home loans. Marriott’s conviction stems from her involvement in a complex mortgage fraud scheme that defrauded the federal government. The scheme’s principal operators were the defendant and her husband, Darrell L. Marriott, 54, who sold manufactured homes through their company, One Way Home &amp; Land. However, the defendants’ daughter, Kally Marriott, and Mrs. Marriott’s sister, Karen Hayes, have also been indicted for their role in the scheme. All four defendants face separate charges for related criminal conduct in <span onClick="goto_name('Kaufman County')" class="loc">Kaufman County</span>. According to state investigators, the defendants illegally forged home buyers’ signatures, inaccurately completed loan applications, and falsified supporting documents, including the buyers’ rent payment verification statements, proof of employment, and Social Security Administration benefits data, among other items. Court documents filed by the state indicate that the defendants conduct was intended to ensure that unqualified home buyers loans were approved by mortgage lenders. The scheme involved predominantly low-income purchasers whose residential loans were guaranteed by the <span onClick="goto_name('U.S.')" class="loc">U.S.</span> <span onClick="goto_name('Department of Housing and Urban Development')" class="loc">Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>. As a result, when the unqualified buyers defaulted on their home loans, their mortgage lenders did not suffer financial losses. Instead, HUD — and therefore the taxpayers — had to cover the default costs. Investigators believe the defendants’ scheme cost the taxpayers more than $3 million. The defendants closed the One Way Home &amp; Land after litigation and investigations ensued in late 2005. As a result, they opened a <span onClick="goto_name('Kaufman County')" class="loc">Kaufman County</span> firm under the assumed name, Torenia. Additional criminal charges in <span onClick="goto_name('Kaufman County')" class="loc">Kaufman County</span> stem from the defendants’ Torenia operation. The Office of the Attorney General received assistance from the <span onClick="goto_name('Navarro County')" class="loc">Navarro County</span> Criminal District Attorney’s Office, Corsicana Police Department and HUD Office of Inspector General. Attorney General Abbott’s Criminal Prosecutions Division is leading the prosecution of the four defendants with the cooperation of district attorneys’ offices in <span onClick="goto_name('Navarro')" class="loc">Navarro</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Henderson')" class="loc">Henderson</span> and <span onClick="goto_name('Ellis counties')" class="loc">Ellis counties</span>.
