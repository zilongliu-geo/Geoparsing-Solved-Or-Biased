  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lisse</span> ( pronunciation ) is a town and municipality in the western <span class="loc">Netherlands</span>, in the province of <span class="loc">South Holland</span>. The municipality covers an area of 16.05 km2 (6.20 sq mi) of which 0.36 km2 (0.14 sq mi) is water. Its population was 22,400 in <span class="date">2014</span>. Located within the municipal boundary is also the community <span class="loc">De Engel</span>. The history of <span class="loc">Lisse</span> is closely related and similar to the neighboring towns of <span class="loc">Hillegom</span> and <span class="loc">Sassenheim</span>. Based on a document from <span class="date">1198</span> which makes official mention of the town's name, <span class="loc">Lisse</span> celebrated its 800-year anniversary in <span class="date">1998</span>, although there is an indication that there was already a settlement there in the 10th century. In the Middle Ages, <span class="loc">Lisse</span> was a small settlement; there were only 50 houses in <span class="date">1500</span>. Because of prolonged warfare (particularly the wars of Charles the Bold and <span class="date">the Eighty Years</span>' War), poverty was prevalent. Its population lived from agriculture, animal husbandry, and peat harvesting. In the 17th and 18th <span class="date">centuries</span>, <span class="loc">Lisse</span> was, like <span class="loc">Hillegom</span>, home to many estates of rich merchants and nobility. The forests and gardens of the <span class="loc">Keukenhof</span>, Meerenburg, Wildlust, <span class="loc">Zandvliet</span>, Overduin en Akervoorde, <span class="loc">Wassergeest</span>, <span class="loc">Grotenhof</span>, Ter Specke, Dubbelhoven, <span class="loc">Rosendaal</span>, <span class="loc">Veenenburg</span> en <span class="loc">Berkhout</span>, <span class="loc">Middelburg</span>, <span class="loc">Ter Beek</span>, and Uytermeer estates all added to the town's beauty and glory.</p><br><br>
