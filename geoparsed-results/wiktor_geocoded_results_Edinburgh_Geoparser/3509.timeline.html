  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Greenfield</span> (formerly, <span class="per">Clarke</span> Colony) is a city in <span class="loc">Monterey County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="per">Greenfield</span> is located in the Salinas Valley, 33 miles (53 km) southeast of Salinas, at an elevation of 289 feet (88 m). The city was the fastest growing in the county during the 2000s, the population was 12,583 in <span class="date">2000</span>, increasing to 16,330 in the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Its most well-known public event is the annual Harvest Festival. <span class="per">Greenfield</span> is a member of the <span class="org">Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments</span>. <span class="per">John S. Clarke</span> and other promoters laid out the town from <span class="date">1902</span> to <span class="date">1905</span> on part of the Rancho Arroyo <span class="loc">Seco</span> Mexican land grant, created by a subdivision of 4,000 acres. The <span class="loc">Clark Colony</span> Water Company, which became the organization for water distribution, filled the city with water from the nearby Arroyo <span class="loc">Seco</span> AVA was formed in <span class="date">April 1905</span>. The organized water canal system and ideal growing conditions attracted people of Danish, Swiss and other nationalities from surrounding areas to settle in <span class="per">Greenfield</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, the <span class="loc">Clark Colony</span> Water Company still holds <span class="date">1916</span> Prior Rights guaranteeing delivery to its members a certain amount of water from the Arroyo <span class="loc">Seco</span> River before any other agencies. In <span class="date">1906</span>, the district purchased a lot from <span class="per">Edward Greenfield</span> along with two adjacent to the <span class="org">Arroyo Seco Development Company</span>. <span class="loc">Clark Colony</span> evolved into <span class="loc">Clark City</span> and was eventually renamed <span class="per">Greenfield</span>, in honor of Mr. Greenfield., after the <span class="loc">United States</span> Postal Service informed the City that there were too many "<span class="loc">Clark Cities</span>" in the state. <span class="per">Greenfield</span> was recognized as a municipality by the State legislature and incorporated on <span class="date">January 7, 1947</span>. <span class="per">Greenfield</span>'s first Mayor was <span class="per">Tom Rogers</span>.</p><br><br>
