  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Prospect is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. It lies along Oregon Route 62 on the <span class="loc">Rogue River</span>, in the <span class="loc">Rogue River</span> â€“ <span class="loc">Siskiyou National Forest</span>. Prospect began as a logging town; its first sawmill began operating in <span class="date">1870</span>. Prospect had a post office established in <span class="date">1882</span> that was first named "Deskins" after the first postmaster. In <span class="date">1888</span>, there was a mill named Deskins Sawmill. The name of the community was changed to "Prospect" in <span class="date">1889</span> because of plans made to run a railroad up the <span class="loc">Rogue River</span>, which would ostensibly improve the community's prospects. The Prospect Hotel, which opened in <span class="date">1892</span>, was listed in <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> in <span class="date">1980</span>. As of <span class="date">2013</span>, the population of the community was 650. On the <span class="date">Saturday</span> of <span class="date">Memorial Day</span> <span class="date">weekend</span>, Prospect holds the Mill Creek Memorial festival. It honors veterans with a parade, a flag retirement ceremony, live music and games for children. All the proceeds go to a fund to help veterans. In <span class="date">July</span> Prospect hosts an airplane "fly-in" that helps support the <span class="org">Jackson County Search and Rescue</span>, and in <span class="date">August</span> a jamboree and timber carnival (a festival that includes lumberjack contests such as log rolling) are held.</p><br><br>
