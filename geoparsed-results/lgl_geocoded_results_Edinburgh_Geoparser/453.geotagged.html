<p>11 Years for 1 Life. The verdict is in and the jurors have had their say. All that’s left is the actual sentencing of Ethan Parrish, the man who stands convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Powhatan High School student Tahliek Taliaferro. What do you think of the 11-year sentencing recommendation? What about the involuntary manslaughter charge, which was reduced from first-degree murder (and a life-imprisonment sentence)? Do you think last summer’s shooting death of 18-year-old Taliaferro was cold-blooded murder or simply the scare tactics of a couple of young men gone terribly wrong? Was justice served in <span class="loc">Powhatan County</span> today? Leave your reaction in the comments section below.</p>
