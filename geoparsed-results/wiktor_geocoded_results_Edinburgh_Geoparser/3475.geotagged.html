<p>Hudson is a city located along the west border of <span class="loc">Columbia County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 6,713. The city is named after the adjacent <span class="loc">Hudson River</span> and ultimately after the explorer Henry Hudson. Hudson is the county seat of <span class="loc">Columbia County</span>. Hudson is sister city with <span class="loc">Pallisa</span>, <span class="loc">Uganda</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.3 square miles (6.0 km2). 2.2 square miles (5.6 km2) of it is land and 0.15 square miles (0.4 km2), or 7.38%, is water. Hudson is located on what began as a spit of land jutting into the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span> between the <span class="loc">South Bay</span> and <span class="loc">North Bay</span>, now both largely filled in. Across the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span> lies the town of <span class="loc">Athens</span> in <span class="loc">Greene County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>; a ferry connected the two municipalities during much of the 19th century. Between them lies <span class="loc">Middle Ground Flats</span>, a former sandbar that grew due to both natural silting and also from dumping the spoils of dredging; today it is inhabited by deer and a few occupants of quasi-legal summer shanties. The town of Greenport borders the other three sides of the city.</p>
