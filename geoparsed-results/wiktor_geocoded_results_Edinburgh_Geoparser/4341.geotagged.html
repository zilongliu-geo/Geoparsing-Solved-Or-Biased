Located near the county seat of <span class="loc">Belton</span>, Temple lies in the region referred to as Central <span class="loc">Texas</span> and is a principal city in the Killeen–Temple–Fort Hood Metropolitan Statistical Area. Located off Interstate 35, Temple is 65 miles (105 km) north of Austin and 34 miles (55 km) south of <span class="loc">Waco</span>. Temple has developed as a small city with a number of arts and retail amenities not typically associated with a smaller community. The primary economic drivers are the extensive medical community (mostly due to Scott &amp; White Memorial Hospital) and goods distribution based on its central location and proximity to larger cities. Temple was founded as a railroad town in 1881, by the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad. It was incorporated in 1882. The town was named after a Santa Fe Railroad official, Bernard Moore Temple. Temple was a civil engineer and former surveyor with the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Company.</p>
