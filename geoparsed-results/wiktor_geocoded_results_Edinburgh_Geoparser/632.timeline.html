  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Poro</span> is a fourth income class municipality on <span class="loc">Camotes Islands</span> in the <span class="loc">province of Cebu</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 23,498. In the <span class="date">2013</span> election, it had 14,629 registered voters. <span class="loc">Poro</span>, along with the municipality of <span class="loc">Tudela</span>, is located on <span class="loc">Poro Island</span> of the <span class="loc">Camotes Islands</span>. The patronal feast of <span class="loc">Poro</span> is celebrated on the third <span class="date">Friday</span> of <span class="date">January</span>, in honour of the Santo Niño de <span class="loc">Cebu</span>. <span class="loc">Poro</span> comprises 17 barangays: The town's name is derived from the Waray-Waray word puro meaning "island". This how <span class="loc">Camotes</span> Island is called by Warays and Leyteños. Before the first municipality to be established in <span class="loc">Camotes</span>, puro meant the name of all the islands. Aside from <span class="loc">Visayan</span> languages, Filipino, and English, the townsfolk also speak the local Porohanon language. Also known as <span class="loc">Camotes</span> <span class="loc">Visayan</span>, the language is mutually intelligible with other Visayan languages (e.g. <span class="loc">Cebuano</span>) spoken in the rest of the <span class="loc">Camotes Islands</span>, <span class="loc">Cebu</span>, other parts of the <span class="loc">Visayas</span>, and Northern <span class="loc">Mindanao</span>. Porohanon is distinguished by the way the locals substitute /j/ sounds with /ʒ/, for instance Cebuano maayong buntag ("good morning") vocalised as maazong buntag in Porohanon. (Possibly occasions too a handover from the yeísmo phenomenon in Spanish.) Other dialectical variations include the Porohanon ara dira instead of the standard Cebuano na-a diha.</p><br><br>
