  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Govan</span> /ˈɡɒvən/ is a town in the <span class="loc">province of Saskatchewan</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> located 111 kilometres north of Regina on Highway 20. In <span class="date">2011</span> the town had 216 residents. The first settlers made their homes along the shores of <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> (<span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Last Mountain Lake</span>), at places close to McKillops's Landing, Arlington Beach, and Taylorboro. The original settlers used the waters of <span class="loc">Last Mountain Lake</span>, which is 93 kilometres long, as a means of transportation. Supplies for the farmers were brought north up the lake and all the grain was taken down the lake in boats, then stored in elevators at the <span class="loc">East End</span>. This lake transportation system was abandoned when the early extension of the Canadian Pacific Railway Kirkella branch from <span class="loc">Bulyea</span> to <span class="loc">Lanigan</span> and on to <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span> was built, opening up more of the country to the settlers. The first house to be built within a five-mile radius of <span class="loc">Govan</span> was erected in <span class="date">1903</span> by <span class="per">Oscar Landstrom</span>, on the southeast quarter of Section 32, Township 27, Range 22 west of the second meridian. Some of the settlers came north from Craven, through <span class="loc">Bulyea</span> and <span class="loc">Strasbourg</span> districts. Others came up the waters on <span class="loc">Long Lake</span>.</p><br><br>
