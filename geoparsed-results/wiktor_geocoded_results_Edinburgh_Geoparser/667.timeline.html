  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Incorporated in <span class="date">1653</span>, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is the oldest town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the town population was 8,055. <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is home to many great wilderness recreation areas with its hills, rivers, lakes, and forests. For geographic and demographic information on the village of <span class="loc">South Lancaster</span>, please see the article <span class="loc">South Lancaster</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> was first settled as "Nashaway" (after the local Nashaway Indian tribe) in <span class="date">1643</span>. It was officially incorporated and renamed "Lancaster on the <span class="loc">Nashua</span>" in <span class="date">1653</span>. Until it was cut down due to safety concerns, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> boasted the largest oak tree in the state, called the Beaman Oak, named after settler Gamaliel Beaman (<span class="date">1623</span>–<span class="date">1677</span>). <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> boasts being the official "mothertown" to all of central <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Towns such as <span class="loc">Harvard</span>, <span class="loc">Stow</span>, <span class="loc">Bolton</span>, <span class="loc">Hudson</span>, <span class="loc">Marlborough</span>, <span class="loc">Leominster</span>, <span class="loc">Clinton</span>, <span class="loc">Berlin</span>, <span class="loc">Sterling</span>, and <span class="loc">Boylston</span> were all once considered part of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>. Supporters of Lancaster's founder, <span class="per">John Prescott</span> (<span class="date">1604</span>–<span class="date">1681</span>), wished to name the new settlement <span class="loc">Prescottville</span>, but the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> considered such a request from a common freeman presumptuous, given that at that time, not even a governor had held the honor of naming a town after himself. Instead, they decided to use <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, the name of his home town in <span class="loc">England</span>.</p><br><br>
