<p><span class="loc">Ely</span> (Welsh Trelái tref town + Elái <span class="loc">River Ely</span>) is a community primarily dominated by council housing in western <span class="loc">Cardiff</span>, capital of <span class="loc">Wales</span>. In Roman times, <span class="loc">Ely</span> was the site of a Roman villa, near the old racecourse. There is also thought to have been a Roman road near the site linking to <span class="loc">Cardiff</span> Roman Fort and eastwards to <span class="loc">Newport</span>. In 1855, the first horse race took place at <span class="loc">Ely</span> Racecourse, which took over from the <span class="loc">Great Heath</span> racecourse. The Ordnance Survey map from the early 1880s shows just how isolated the ancient <span class="loc">Ely</span> village was from the rest of <span class="loc">Cardiff</span>. Reports about travelling along the main road over <span class="loc">Ely</span> Common to <span class="loc">Cardiff</span> talk of pot holes and no shelter and a terrible journey on foot. Most of <span class="loc">Ely</span> was still farmland feeding <span class="loc">Cardiff</span>'s population. A railway station had only recently been constructed, and this gave the surrounding area further potential for mass housing development. The 'Ely Industrial School' on Cowbridge Road East was home to orphaned children originally from <span class="loc">Cardiff</span>. It had been set up to accommodate "pauper children" from 1863. It was very much a product of the Victorian age, and workhouse mentality, increased social awareness and responsibility saw it closing in 1903 and converted to additional workhouse accommodation for adults (though never used for that purpose), known as <span class="loc">Ely</span> Lodge. The children lived in what became as <span class="loc">Ely</span> Homes. The school was demolished some years later and an infectious diseases isolation unit was built on the same site.</p>
