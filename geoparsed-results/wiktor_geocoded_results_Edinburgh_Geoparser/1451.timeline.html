  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">York</span> is the oldest inland town in Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, situated 97 kilometres (60 mi) east of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, and is the seat of the Shire of <span class="loc">York</span>. The <span class="loc">York district</span> and town taking its name from <span class="loc">York County</span>, Western <span class="loc">Australia</span> (in turn named after <span class="per">Prince Frederick</span>, <span class="loc">Duke of York</span> and <span class="loc">Albany</span>), was first settled in <span class="date">1831</span>, <span class="date">two years</span> after <span class="loc">Perth</span> was settled in <span class="date">1829</span>. A town was established in <span class="date">1835</span> with the release of town allotments and the first buildings were erected in <span class="date">1836</span>. With the increasing population of the <span class="org">Swan</span> River Settlement in <span class="date">1830</span>, it became evident that suitable land would have to be discovered for the growing of crops needed to provide necessary food. Ensign <span class="per">Robert Dale</span>, a 20-year-old officer of the 63rd Regiment, led a small party in the first exploratory journey over the Darling Range during the <span class="date">winter</span> <span class="date">months</span> of <span class="date">1830</span>, into what was later to become known as the <span class="loc">Avon</span> Valley. As a result, Lieutenant-Governor Stirling decided that the new district should be thrown open for selection and this was done by Government Notice on <span class="date">11 November 1830</span>. By <span class="date">December 1830</span>, 250,000 acres had been allotted, and in <span class="date">January 1831</span>, 80,000 acres. Before <span class="date">the end of 1831</span> a further 6,030 acres in small lots had been taken up.</p><br><br>
