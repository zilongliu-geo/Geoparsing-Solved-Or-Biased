  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Goa</span> is a second class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 58,503 people. The current municipal mayor is Hon. Antero Silos Lim. <span class="per">Goa</span> is politically subdivided into 34 barangays. The town of <span class="per">Goa</span> was originally situated at <span class="per">Barangay</span> <span class="per">Salog</span> which was then known as “<span class="per">Visita de Salog</span>”, comprising the barrios of <span class="loc">Lalud</span> (<span class="date">now</span> known as barangay <span class="loc">Salog</span>), Himagaan, <span class="loc">Matacla</span>, and <span class="loc">Payatan</span>. <span class="loc">Lalud</span> is found along the banks of <span class="loc">Cagaycay</span> River and is about five kilometers away from the present site of the town center. The “visita” was established in <span class="date">1701</span> by Franciscan Missionary Fr. <span class="per">Matias de Valdesoto</span> and was attached to the <span class="loc">parish of Manguiring</span>, <span class="loc">Calabanga</span>. By <span class="date">1729</span>, it was declared independent and was later converted into a pueblo. The settlement center was later transferred to the present site because a disastrous flood swept the houses down the river and the inhabitants needed more land for planting. The original settlers found in the new site a wide stretch of plain land with brooks and rivers. There were scattered areas of swampland where “GAJO”, a native slender cane plant the locals used for arrow shafts, grow in wild profusion. They believed that the place was ideal for rice farming. In <span class="date">1777</span>, Franciscan Friar Fr. <span class="per">Juan Abalay</span>, from the Portuguese colony of <span class="loc">Goa</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>, came to administer the parish. It was on his arrival that the village was converted into a town with the official name of <span class="per">Pueblo de Goa</span>. Fr. <span class="per">Abalay</span> was instrumental in naming the town <span class="per">Goa</span>, motivated presumably for two reasons: to perpetuate the memory of his birthplace and to give official confirmation to the name which the place has been known for some time corrupted allegedly by the Spaniards from “gajo”. On arrival, Fr. <span class="per">Abalay</span> found <span class="per">Gregorio de los Reyes</span> as Pueblo <span class="per">Headman</span> and <span class="per">Santiago</span> <span class="per">Evangelista, Juan</span> de los <span class="per">Santos, Pedro</span> <span class="per">Paraiso, Francisco</span> <span class="per">Jacinto, Andres</span> de la <span class="per">Trinidad</span> and <span class="per">Lucas</span> <span class="loc">Delfin</span> as council members. Fr. <span class="per">Abalay</span> named <span class="per">Pedro de los Reyes</span> son of the reigning <span class="per">Headman</span>, “<span class="per">Cabeza de Barangay</span>” in the cabeseria <span class="per">De Barangay del Pueblo</span> <span class="per">De</span> <span class="per">Goa</span>. The German traveler, Feodor Jagor, found <span class="per">Goa</span> a thriving municipality in <span class="date">1863</span> when he scouted for guides who could accompany him climb Mt. Isarog. In about the same year, the parish started the gigantic project of building a stone church and convent. The church, of Roman Gothic design and the convent, half stone and half wood, were completed in <span class="date">1887</span>. It took <span class="date">almost two decades</span> of hard labor and involved every man, woman and child who was old enough to carry a piece of stone (known as cellar) to finish the project. A school building of stone was constructed soon across the street on the right side of the convent, to house the classes of the “primera enseñanza”. Another structure of the “segunda enseñanza was added about the time the Revolution broke out in <span class="date">1896</span>. For the duration of the revolution and until the arrival of the Americans in <span class="date">1900</span>, <span class="per">Goa</span> was governed by a local detachment of the revolutionary forces. The inhabitants called this period “Gobierno Filipino”. They elected the first “presidente” upon the implementation of the <span class="per">Maura Law</span>. <span class="per">Jose</span> Perfecto, headed the civil authorities with the “<span class="per">Cabezas de Barangay</span>”, <span class="date">the past</span> “Capitanes Municipales” serving as the local town council. Since its creation, various local chief executives have contributed to the progress of the municipality. Laureano Pan was the first to serve as the local executive (<span class="date">1901</span>-<span class="date">1903</span>) in <span class="per">Goa</span> during the American occupation. The establishment of the first American school was hastened by the unexpected capture of “Commandante” Faustino Perfecto, in-charge of a contingent of KKK troops stationed at <span class="loc">Panagan River</span>, by the American troops on the road to <span class="loc">Naga</span>. The American school opened in <span class="date">1902</span> with <span class="per">Samuel D. Broadley</span> as the supervising teacher. The first three American teachers were <span class="loc">Stickney</span>, Cappage, and Tabor, a colored American. Evidently, the Americans realized as early as then, the strategic location and prominence of the town in Partido area. From <span class="date">1904</span> up to <span class="date">the end of the decade</span>, <span class="per">Goa</span> was one of only four places in Ambos Camarines (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span> and <span class="loc">Camarines Norte</span>) with intermediate classes up to grade seven. The others were <span class="loc">Nueva Caceres</span> (<span class="loc">Naga City</span>), <span class="loc">Daet</span> and <span class="loc">Iriga</span>. The national road connecting <span class="per">Goa</span> to <span class="loc">Naga</span> via <span class="loc">Anayan</span> was constructed in <span class="date">1917</span>. It was also in <span class="date">1917</span> when the construction of the Municipal Hall was started which was completed in <span class="date">1922</span>. With the first automobile that traveled the Naga-Partido road, modernization slowly flowed in. In <span class="date">1925</span>, <span class="per">Jose Centenera</span>, installed the first electric generator that lighted the town until the Japanese occupation. In the same year, he also opened a movie house, which featured serialized silent movies. In <span class="date">1926</span>, <span class="per">Goa</span> had a modern concrete market pavilion and abattoir to replace the old market building. The traditional Open Market day on <span class="date">Sunday</span>, was initiated in <span class="date">1945</span>, though this is no longer true <span class="date">today</span> since as the trade &amp; commercial center in the 3rd District of <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span>, everyday is already a market day. It was also in <span class="date">1946</span> that <span class="per">Goa</span> donated parcels of land to the <span class="loc">Province of Camarines Sur</span> for the establishment of <span class="org">Partido High School</span> (converted to <span class="org">Partido National High School</span>, then to <span class="org">Partido State College</span> and <span class="date">now</span> as <span class="org">Partido State University</span>). Telecommunication service by telegraph was provided in1950. The <span class="per">Goa</span> Civic Square, an open park surrounded by huge acacia trees where the locals of <span class="per">Goa</span> held almost all public activities – from amateur singing contest to political fora, benefit dances, fiesta celebrations, <span class="date">summer</span> basketball competitions, etc., was constructed between <span class="date">1952</span>-<span class="date">1954</span>. Next was the construction of the <span class="org">ABC</span> Building between <span class="date">1968</span>-<span class="date">1971</span> under <span class="org">ABC</span> <span class="per">President Alberto A. Din</span>. The Camp Jovi <span class="loc">Fuentebella</span> in <span class="loc">Lamon</span> became the National Jamboree site in <span class="date">1983</span>. There was a trend of constructing covered basketball courts in majority of the municipalities in the country in <span class="date">the early nineties</span>. By <span class="date">1993</span>, the <span class="per">Goa</span> Civic Square was converted to become the covered <span class="org">Goa Sports Complex</span> that <span class="date">now</span> exists in front of the <span class="per">Goa</span> Municipal Hall.</p><br><br>
