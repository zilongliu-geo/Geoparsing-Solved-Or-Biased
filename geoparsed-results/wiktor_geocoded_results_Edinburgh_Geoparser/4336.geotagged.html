<p><span class="loc">Xinzhou</span> (Chinese: 忻州; pinyin: Xīnzhōu) is a prefecture-level city occupying the north-central section of <span class="loc">Shanxi province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. <span class="loc">Xinzhou</span> has numerous public schools, including <span class="loc">Xin</span> Zhou Yi Zhong Xue (<span class="loc">Xin</span> Zhou Number One High School), which is considered the most prestigious of public high schools in the region. Another public high school of interest is the nearby laboratory high school. It functions as an extension of the Xin Zhou Teacher's University. A third type of high school is the <span class="loc">Xin</span> <span class="loc">Zhou</span> <span class="loc">Shi</span> <span class="loc">Yan</span> Zhong Xue (Xin Zhou Experimental High School). This school was initiated as a public-private partnership. The school is partially funded by the Chinese government, follows national educational standards, and maintains close ties (and even joint faculty) with <span class="loc">Xin</span> Zhou Yi Zhong Xue; however, it maintains a greater independence from the government than traditional public schools. The experimental school also runs a small primary school program (generally only one class per grade level) which is populated almost exclusively by the children of Yi Zhong Xue and Shi Yan Zhong Xue faculty members.</p>
