  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the southern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 38,827. The county seat is <span class="loc">Mount Vernon</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Mount Vernon</span>, <span class="loc">IL</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. It is located in the southern portion known locally as "<span class="loc">Little Egypt</span>". The western border of the county adjoins the Greater <span class="per">St. Louis</span> consolidated metropolitan statistical area, the Metro-East region, and the <span class="per">St. Louis</span> commuter region and market and viewing area. The first settler in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is believed to have been <span class="per">Andrew Moore</span>. In <span class="date">1810</span>, he settled near the southeast corner of the county, near where the <span class="loc">Goshen</span> Road emerges from the forest of <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> into what is <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="per">Moore</span>'s Prairie. It is interesting that <span class="per">Moore</span> arrived from the <span class="loc">Goshen</span> Settlement, near <span class="loc">Edwardsville</span>. His migration was therefore retrograde, from the west toward the interior of the State. In <span class="date">1814</span>, <span class="per">Andrew Moore</span> departed with his eight-year-old son for <span class="loc">Jordan</span>'s settlement, a journey from which he never returned. A skull that was believed to have been <span class="per">Moore</span>'s was found <span class="date">several years later</span> about two miles from his cabin. <span class="loc">Jordan</span>'s Settlement, also called <span class="loc">Jordan</span>'s Fort, was southeast of modern <span class="loc">Thompsonville</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, about twenty miles south of <span class="loc">Moore</span>'s cabin. This episode occurred during the War of <span class="date">1812</span> when many of the Indian tribes were allied with the British.</p><br><br>
