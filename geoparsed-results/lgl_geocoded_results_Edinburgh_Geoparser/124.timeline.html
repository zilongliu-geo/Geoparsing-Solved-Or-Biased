  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">House</span> rejects attempt to force vote on marriage amendment. On <span class="date">Monday</span>, Republicans in the <span class="org">House of Delegates</span> tried to advance a bipartisan resolution that would define marriage in the state constitution, but the Democratic majority blocked their attempts. The "Marriage Protection Amendment" resolution (HJR5) introduced <span class="date">last month</span> calls for a statewide referendum on whether to amend the constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman. The measure has been stuck in the <span class="org">House</span> Constitutional Revision Committee. On <span class="date">Monday</span>, <span class="org">House</span> Minority Leader <span class="per">Tim Armstead</span> tried bring the resolution to the floor for a vote by moving to discharge it from committee. "The overwhelming majority of West Virginians have let us know in no uncertain terms they want us to take action on this issue," the <span class="loc">Kanawha County</span> Republican said, adding that 30 other states have approved constitutional amendments on marriage. "It's time for us to listen to the people we represent." Since <span class="date">2000</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> has had a <span class="org">Defense of Marriage Act</span>, which bars the state from recognizing same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. But <span class="per">Armstead</span> said recent events in other states dictated the state should amend its constitution. "I think we've seen over <span class="date">the past few years</span> why it's so urgent," he said. He pointed to legal challenges to Proposition 8 in <span class="loc">California</span> and the recognition of gay marriage in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. "This is an urgent issue," <span class="per">Armstead</span> said. "It's an issue that needs to be addressed. It's an issue we feel very strongly about." But the <span class="org">House</span> voted 67-30 -- almost entirely along party lines -- to postpone <span class="per">Armstead</span>'s motion indefinitely, meaning the resolution can't be considered again this session. Delegates also passed a motion to cut off debate on the issue. The only comments from Democrats came from <span class="org">House</span> Majority Leader Brent <span class="per">Boggs, D</span>-Braxton, a sponsor of the resolution. <span class="per">Boggs</span> said the legislative process had to take precedence over delegates' personal feelings on the issue. "It's not good public policy to bypass the committee process," he said, reading from a prepared speech. Besides <span class="per">Armstead</span> and <span class="per">Boggs</span>, other sponsors of the resolution are Delegates <span class="per">Harold Michael</span>, D-Hardy; <span class="per">Ricky Moye</span>, D-Raleigh; <span class="per">John Overington</span>, R-Berkeley; <span class="per">Linda Sumner</span>, R-Raleigh; and <span class="per">Clif Moore</span>, D-McDowell. <span class="date">Earlier this month</span>, a telephone campaign by the Family Policy Council of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> targeted <span class="org">House</span> Judiciary Chairwoman <span class="per">Carrie Webster</span>, D-Kanawha, and <span class="org">House</span> Constitutional Revision Chairwoman <span class="per">Barbara Fleischauer</span>, D-Monongalia. The council claimed the two delegates were blocking a ban on gay marriage, since their committees would have to approve the resolution. Webster, whose committee never saw the bill, said the campaign led to the harassment of her staff.</p><br><br>
