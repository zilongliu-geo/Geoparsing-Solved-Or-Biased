  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fuxin</span> (Chinese: 阜新; pinyin: Fùxīn) is a prefecture-level city in <span class="loc">northwestern Liaoning province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. The total population of the prefecture at the <span class="date">2010</span> census is 1,819,339, of whom 669,317 are resident in the built up area, which comprises four urban districts, collectively known as '<span class="loc">Fuxin City</span>'. <span class="loc">Fuxin</span> has direct administration over 7 county-level divisions: 5 districts, 1 county and 1 autonomous county: <span class="loc">Fuxin</span> has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen <span class="loc">Dwa</span>), with long, cold but dry winters and hot, humid summers. A majority of the annual precipitation falls in <span class="date">July</span> and <span class="date">August</span> alone. <span class="loc">Fuxin</span> is a mining center in an agricultural region, producing mostly coal and agate. <span class="loc">Fuxin</span> is known as <span class="loc">China</span>'s 'Agate City', with 50% of the nation's known deposits of the mineral being located there. The city also accounts for more than 90% of the country's agate products. The city suffers from the over-mining of coal, which is low in supply while fundamental to Fuxin's economy. As the coal mines run dry, <span class="loc">Fuxin</span> is trying to find other industries to keep its economy going. Measures taken have included the development of a part of the city as a 'Special Economic Zone', by which the city hopes to attract international investment.</p><br><br>
