  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">York County</span> is a county located in the state of <span class="loc">Maine</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 197,131, making it the second-most populous county in <span class="loc">Maine</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Alfred. Founded in <span class="date">1636</span>, it is the oldest county in <span class="loc">Maine</span> and one of the oldest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">York County</span> is part of the Portlandâ€“South <span class="loc">Portland</span>, <span class="loc">ME</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. In the 1650s the nearby <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span> asserted territorial claims over what is <span class="date">now</span> southern <span class="loc">Maine</span>, and by <span class="date">1658</span> had completely absorbed what is <span class="date">now</span> southwestern <span class="loc">Maine</span> into <span class="loc">York County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The first known and recorded deed for a purchase of land in <span class="loc">York County</span> is in <span class="date">1668</span>, when <span class="per">Francis Small</span> traded goods with the Newichewannock tribe of this area. Their Chief <span class="per">Wesumbe</span>, also known as <span class="per">Captain Sandy</span>, was friendly with Small and warned him of a plot against his life. A group of renegade tribesmen planned on murdering Small instead of paying him with the furs that were owed to him. Small escaped after watching his house in what is <span class="date">now</span> Cornish, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, burn to the ground. Small returned and rebuilt. The Chief made up the loss by selling Small all the lands bounded by the Great and Little Ossipee Rivers, the <span class="loc">Saco River</span>, and the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> border. Known <span class="date">now</span> as the five Ossipee towns, the tract included all of <span class="loc">Limington</span>, <span class="loc">Limerick</span>, <span class="loc">Cornish</span> (formerly named Francisborough), <span class="loc">Newfield</span> and <span class="loc">Parsonsfield</span>.</p><br><br>
