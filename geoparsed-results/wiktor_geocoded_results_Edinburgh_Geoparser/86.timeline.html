  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [la espeˈɾansa]) is the capital city and a municipality of the same name of the department of Intibucá, <span class="loc">Honduras</span>. The city of <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> is merged indistinguishably with the <span class="loc">city of Intibucá</span>, the head of the neighboring municipality of Intibucá. Intibucá is the older of the two cities and was originally a <span class="per">Lenca</span> community, while <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> is the newer ladino community. The two cities, often called the twin cities, while distinct with separate municipal governments, are generally referred to jointly as <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> and are separated only by a street that crosses town. <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> is famous for having the coolest climate in <span class="loc">Honduras</span> and also for being the heart of the Ruta <span class="per">Lenca</span>, a region of <span class="per">Lenca</span> ethnic influence that spans <span class="loc">Honduras</span> from <span class="loc">Santa Rosa de Copan</span> to <span class="loc">Choluteca</span>. The area was originally occupied by <span class="per">Maya</span> and <span class="per">Lenca</span> people from pre-Columbian times who formed two settlements called <span class="per">Eramani</span> and <span class="per">Lentercala</span>. In <span class="date">1647</span>, Mayor Francisco de <span class="loc">La Cerda</span> was appointed by the Spanish throne to officially demarcate the territory of the indigenous population. He divided the land into two jurisdictions, not corresponding to the <span class="per">Eramani</span> and <span class="per">Lentercala</span> sites, and created boundaries and names for the surrounding small communities. Over time, the two jurisdictions developed a rivalry, especially over land. The cities grew in population especially in the 1800s and <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> was named a villa on <span class="date">September 22, 1848</span>. <span class="loc">La Esperanza</span> officially became a city in <span class="date">1883</span> when the department of Intibucá was formed by separating from the neighboring department of Lempira, then called <span class="loc">Gracias</span>.</p><br><br>
