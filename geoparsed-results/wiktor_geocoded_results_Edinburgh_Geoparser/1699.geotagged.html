<p><span class="loc">Sare</span> (Basque: Sara) is a village in the traditional <span class="loc">Basque province</span> of <span class="loc">Labourd</span>, now a commune in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department in south-western <span class="loc">France</span> on the border with <span class="loc">Spain</span>. It is backed by the Pyrenean mountain range, which forms a basin around the village open to the east and the north. Its geological history explains the formation of caves that were occupied by the Aurignacian. The bronze age left a number of funerary monuments on the slopes and mountain plateaus of the region. Today, it's territory forms an enclave in the <span class="loc">Navarre</span>, a region of <span class="loc">Spain</span>, with which it shares a 25 km border. This in particular has had significant consequences on the history of the village, with centuries of pastoral agreements with neighbouring Spanish villages. During the Peninsular War the Anglo-Portuguese Army led by the future Duke of Wellington breached the frontier and repelled the French troops who had stationed themselves in forts on <span class="loc">La Rhune</span>. The village contains many old buildings with around 283 houses identified by as dating partially as far back as the 15th century. The traditional architecture of these buildings, their exterior decorations and the orientation defines the archetype of the rural house that exists in the popular image of the "Basque House". The population of <span class="loc">Sare</span> has remained stable for 200 years. Since 1793 the only real development that has occurred began in 1990, and the population reached more than 2500 people in the 2010s. Agricultural activity remains are constant element of the town's economy, even though the location has hosted mining industries since the middle ages, and more recently a wool treatment mill. The proximity of the border with <span class="loc">Spain</span> and the configuration of the terrain and the roadways as well as the shared Basque languages have given birth to a local economy shared between <span class="loc">Spain</span> and <span class="loc">France</span> characterised by smuggling.</p>
