<p><span class="loc">Kalashnikovo</span> (Russian: Кала́шниково) is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) in <span class="loc">Likhoslavlsky District</span> of <span class="loc">Tver Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>. Population: 5,001 (2010 Census); 5,198 (2002 Census); 5,572 (1989 Census). <span class="loc">Kalashnikovo</span> was first mentioned in 1779 as a village belonging to the selo of Yegoryevskoye. At the time, it belonged to Novotorzhsky Uyezd of Tver Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was transformed to Tver Governorate. The village has grown considerably after the railway construction was completed in 1851, and even more after the glass factory has been constructed in 1886—1887. In 1918, the factory was nationalized. On July 12, 1929 the governorates and uyezds were abolished. <span class="loc">Likhoslavlsky District</span>, with the administrative center in Likhoslavl, was established within Tver Okrug of <span class="loc">Moscow Oblast</span>. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. In 1932, <span class="loc">Kalashnikovo</span> was granted urban-type settlement status. On January 29, 1935 <span class="loc">Kalinin Oblast</span> was established, and <span class="loc">Likhoslavlsky District</span> was transferred to <span class="loc">Kalinin Oblast</span>. On July 9, 1937 <span class="loc">Likhoslavlsky District</span> was included into Karelian National Okrug, which was established as a Tver Karelians autonomy. On February 7, 1939 the okrug was abolished. In February 1963, during the abortive administrative reform by Nikita Khrushchev, <span class="loc">Likhoslavlsky District</span> was merged into <span class="loc">Torzhoksky District</span>, but on March 4, 1964 it was re-established. In 1990, <span class="loc">Kalinin Oblast</span> was renamed <span class="loc">Tver Oblast</span>.</p>
