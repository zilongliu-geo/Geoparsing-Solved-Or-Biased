  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Sanyi Township (Chinese: 三義鄉; pinyin: Sānyì Xiāng) is a rural township in <span class="loc">southern Miaoli County</span>, <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>. It is famous for its mudiao (woodcarving) industry earning it the name the Woodcarving Kingdom of <span class="loc">Taiwan</span> (台灣木雕王國). <span class="loc">Sanyi</span> is located in the mountains of northwestern <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>. On its northeastern boundary is <span class="loc">Sanjiao</span> Mountain at 567 meters, and to the east lies <span class="loc">Huoyan</span> Mountain at 602 meters. Early exploitation of the Sanyi township area was for timber and hides. Later tung oil was extracted from the abundant tung trees and camphor from the camphor trees. Concurrently the wood carving industry developed. At one point over 80% of local families were employed in wood carving. At the end of the 20th century <span class="loc">Sanyi</span> began developing a tourist industry. <span class="loc">Shengxing</span> Station, completed in <span class="date">1905</span> and was the highest station (402 meters) in <span class="loc">Taiwan</span> built along the "Old Mountain Railway". It was built entirely of wood, using wooden pegs and no nails and took <span class="date">five years</span> to complete. The last train stopped at the station on <span class="date">23 September 1987</span>, because the steep route of the "Old Mountain Railway" could not accommodate the newer, larger trains. Nearby is a 726-meter train tunnel built in <span class="date">1905</span>. It has successfully withstood a large number of earthquakes, including the quake of <span class="date">21 September 1999</span> (921). At the tunnel entrance are some old troop barracks where during World War II local troops were stationed to protect the railway.</p><br><br>
