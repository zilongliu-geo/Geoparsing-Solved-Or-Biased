<p><span class="loc">Suha</span> (pronounced [ˈsuːxa]; German: <span class="loc">Zauchen</span>) is a village just outside Škofja <span class="loc">Loka</span> in the Upper <span class="loc">Carniola region</span> of <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. It is an old settlement, with its earliest mention in documents dating to 973 AD. There are a number of interesting architectural monuments in the centre of the village, but <span class="loc">Suha</span> is best known for its parish church (until 1975 belonging to the Parish of Škofja <span class="loc">Loka</span>) dedicated to John the <span class="loc">Baptist</span>. It has a Gothic star-vaulted chancel. Frescos from the mid-15th century survive, painted by the unnamed painter known as the Master of <span class="loc">Suha</span>, known to have worked in a number of other local churches, but named after his work in this church because it is one of the best examples of his work. There are also 16th-century frescos by <span class="loc">Jernej</span> of <span class="loc">Loka</span> in the church. The well-preserved frescos are some of the most important in <span class="loc">Slovenia</span> and the church has been listed as a monument of national importance. Notable people that were born or lived in <span class="loc">Suha</span> include: Andrej Glavan (1943–), the Bishop of Novo Mesto, the first parish priest of the <span class="loc">Parish of Suha</span></p>
