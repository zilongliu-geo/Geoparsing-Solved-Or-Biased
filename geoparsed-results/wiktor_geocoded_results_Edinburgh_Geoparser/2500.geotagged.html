<p>Reading /ˈrɛdɪŋ/ is a city in <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 10,385 at the 2010 census. It is a suburb of <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>. In 1794, a German immigrant by the name of Abraham Voorhees moved his family from their home near <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>, building a large double log cabin along the west bank of the <span class="loc">Millcreek</span> in Sycamore Township. Shortly after, a visitor from Reading, PA (Harvey Redinbo) was pleased with the land that Voorhees had acquired and purchased his own land, in the area of Hunt Road and Columbia Avenue. This early settlement (1797) was known as Voorhees-Town, but was changed to Reading in the honor of Redinbo’s hometown, and the birthplace of his father-in-law (<span class="loc">William Penn</span>, founder of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> – born in Reading, <span class="loc">England</span>). Reading was incorporated as a village in 1851. Reading is located at 39°13′22″N 84°26′21″W (39.222709, -84.439036). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.89 square miles (7.49 km2), all land. Reading's public school system includes two neighborhood schools, Central Elementary and Hilltop Elementary, which both serve Pre-K through fifth grade. Reading Middle School is co-located with Central Elementary and houses grades 6-8. Reading High School serves grades 9-12 and is the home of the 2003 division III state boys basketball champions.</p>
