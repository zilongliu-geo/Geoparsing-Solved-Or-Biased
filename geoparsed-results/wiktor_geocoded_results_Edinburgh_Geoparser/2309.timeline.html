  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Stanford</span> is a deserted village and civil parish in the English <span class="loc">county of Norfolk</span>. It is situated some 7.5 miles (12.1 km) north of the town of <span class="loc">Thetford</span> and 25 miles (40 km) south-west of the <span class="loc">city of Norwich</span>. The village became deserted when it was taken over by the <span class="org">British Army</span> during the Second World War as part of the <span class="org">Stanford Battle Area</span>, an infantry training area that is still in use <span class="date">today</span>. The village and most of the parish are within a prohibited area and access is not allowed without special permission from the <span class="org">Army</span>. The parish church of <span class="loc">All Saints</span>, like the other surviving churches within the training area, is fitted with blast-proof sheeting to protect the structure, and wire fencing surrounds the church and churchyard to protect from military manoeuvres. The civil parish has an area of 5.26 square miles (13.6 km2) and in the <span class="date">2001</span> census had a population of 8 in 4 households. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the <span class="loc">district of Breckland</span>.
