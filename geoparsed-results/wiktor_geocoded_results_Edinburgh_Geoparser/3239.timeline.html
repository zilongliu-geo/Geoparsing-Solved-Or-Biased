  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Charlestown</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,585 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> was established in <span class="date">1808</span>, named after one of its surveyors, <span class="per">Charles Beggs</span>, upon 300 acres (1.2 km2), of which 3 acres (12,000 m2) was designated for a town square. It was established one mile (1.6 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Springville</span>, and was responsible for Springville's demise. Milling was important to the town, as the first mill was built in the area, on <span class="loc">Fourteen Mile Creek</span>, in <span class="date">1804</span>. This mill would be abandoned when John Work built a mill by use of a tunnel in <span class="date">1814</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, that mill is part of the Tunnel Mill Scout Reservation. From 1811-1878 <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> was the county seat of <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, but as <span class="loc">Jeffersonville</span> had surpassed it economically, the county seat reverted to <span class="loc">Jeffersonville</span> in <span class="date">1878</span>. In <span class="date">1818</span> the first <span class="org">Grand Lodge of Free</span> &amp; Accepted Masons in <span class="loc">Indiana</span> met in <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>, due to <span class="per">Jonathan Jennings</span>' influence. In <span class="date">1940</span> the population of <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> was 900, but it swelled to 13,400 due to the building and operation of the <span class="org">Indiana Army Ammunition Plant</span> (INAAP). This created a housing problem, as chicken, wood, and wash houses had to house all the new residents who flocked to the area for the jobs created by the INAAP. Additional problems caused by the rapid influx of new residents was improper sanitation at restaurants, inefficient sewers, gambling, panhandling, and diseases such as typhoid and malaria.</p><br><br>
