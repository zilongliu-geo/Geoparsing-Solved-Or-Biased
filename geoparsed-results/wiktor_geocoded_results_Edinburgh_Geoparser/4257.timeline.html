  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Croydon</span> is a large town in <span class="loc">south London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, the principal settlement of the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Croydon</span>. It is located 9.5 miles (15.3 km) south of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. It is one of the largest commercial districts outside of Central London, bearing one of the largest shopping districts and a developed night-time economy. It is identified in the <span class="org">London Plan</span> as one of 11 metropolitan centres in <span class="loc">Greater London</span>. It has a population of 52,104 in the <span class="date">2011</span> census, comprising the <span class="loc">Addiscombe</span>, <span class="loc">Broad Green</span> and <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> wards. Historically a part of <span class="loc">Surrey</span>, at the time of the Norman conquest of <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">Croydon</span> had a church, a mill, and around 365 inhabitants, as recorded in the Domesday Book of <span class="date">1086</span>. <span class="loc">Croydon</span> expanded during the Middle Ages as a market town and a centre for charcoal production, leather tanning and brewing. The Surrey Iron Railway from <span class="loc">Croydon</span> to <span class="loc">Wandsworth</span> opened in <span class="date">1803</span> and was the world's first public railway. Later nineteenth century railway building facilitated <span class="loc">Croydon</span>'s growth as a commuter town for <span class="loc">London</span> (including the <span class="loc">City of London</span>). By the early 20th century, <span class="loc">Croydon</span> was an important industrial area, known for car manufacture, metal working and its airport. In the mid 20th century these sectors were replaced by retailing and the service economy, brought about by massive redevelopment which saw the rise of office blocks and the <span class="org">Whitgift Centre</span>, for <span class="date">many decades</span> the largest shopping centre in <span class="loc">London</span> until <span class="date">2008</span>. <span class="loc">Croydon</span> was amalgamated into <span class="loc">Greater London</span> in <span class="date">1965</span>.</p><br><br>
