<p><span class="loc">Boca</span> is a former settlement in <span class="loc">Nevada County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It is situated at an elevation of 5,528 ft (1,685 m) above sea level. <span class="loc">Boca</span> is located on the Southern Pacific Railroad, 6.5 miles (10.5 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Truckee</span>. The place was named by the Central Pacific Railroad Boca (Spanish for "mouth" and "river mouth") in 1867 because it was near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Little Truckee River</span>. It had a post office during the period of 1872 through 1945. In 1880, the population was 200. <span class="loc">Boca</span> has a fairly typical climate for its region, a continental Mediterranean climate (Köppen Dsb), with dry summers that feature hot days and cold nights, and cold, snowy winters. Snowfall is less heavy than <span class="loc">Truckee</span> and <span class="loc">Tahoe</span> city due to the rain shadow effect of the <span class="loc">Sierra Nevada</span>, but depths can still reach to 90 inches (2.29 m), and in recent times 70 inches (1.78 m) of snow was on the ground at the end of February 1993. On January 20, 1937, the temperature at <span class="loc">Boca</span> fell to −45 °F (−42.8 °C), the lowest temperature ever recorded in <span class="loc">California</span>, though on average only a dozen nights will fall below 0 °F (−17.8 °C) and 256 days exceed 50 °F (10 °C). Nightly frosts are common even in summer, and only 93 nights per year fail to fall below 32 °F (0 °C).</p>
