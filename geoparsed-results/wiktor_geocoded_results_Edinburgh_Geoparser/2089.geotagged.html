<p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 6,472. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Waurika. The county was created at statehood and named in honor of President Thomas Jefferson. In the 1750s, the Taovaya Indians, a Wichita tribe, established twin villages along the <span class="loc">Red River</span>, in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> and across the river near present-day Spanish Fort, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The village became “a lively emporium where Comanches brought Apache slaves, horses and mules to trade for French packs of powder, balls, knives, and textiles and for Taovaya-grown maize, melons, pumpkins, squash, and tobacco.” In 1759, in response to the destruction of the San Saba Mission, the Spanish led an expedition against the Taovaya and their allies and attacked the twin villages. The Indians defeated the Spanish army. (See Battle of the Twin Villages) The Taovaya villages were abandoned before 1841 as the Taovaya had been decimated by smallpox and encroachment by other Indians and Anglo-Americans. In the 1830s, the Choctaw tribe acquired more than two-thirds of the land now covered by <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, and the closely related Chickasaw tribe began to relocate there. In 1855, the two tribes formally divided and this area became part of the Chickasaw Nation. The western part of the present county became part of the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Reservation, created by the 1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty. That area was opened to settlement by non-Indians by the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Opening in 1901.</p>
