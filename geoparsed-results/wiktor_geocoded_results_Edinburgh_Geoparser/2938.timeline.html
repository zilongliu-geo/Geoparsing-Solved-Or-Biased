  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Leshan</span> (simplified Chinese: 乐山; traditional Chinese: 樂山; pinyin: Lèshān; literally: "Happy mountain"; Sichuanese Pinyin: No2san1; local pronunciation: [nʊʔ˧sã˥]) is a prefecture-level city located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Dadu</span> and Min rivers in <span class="loc">Sichuan Province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>. <span class="loc">Leshan</span> is located on the southwestern fringe of the <span class="loc">Red Basin</span> in southern Sichuan, about 120 km (75 mi) from <span class="loc">Chengdu</span>. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, its population was 3,235,759 whom 662,814 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of <span class="loc">Shizhong district</span>, as <span class="loc">Wutongqiao</span> and <span class="loc">Jinkouhe</span> districts are not conurbated yet. In <span class="date">1996</span>, the Mount <span class="org">Emei Scenic Area</span>, including the Leshan Giant Buddha, the largest stone-carved buddha in the world, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Mount Emei is located within the county-level <span class="loc">city of Emeishan</span>, which is under the administrative jurisdiction of <span class="loc">Leshan</span>. The ancestral home of Chinese writer, academic and politician <span class="per">Guo Moruo</span> is preserved in the <span class="loc">Shawan District</span> of <span class="loc">Leshan</span>. The Leshan dialect, part of the Southern linguistic system, is very different from the dialects of other cities in the <span class="loc">province of Sichuan</span>, which belong to the Northern system. Some researchers say the pronunciation of Leshan dialect represents an archaic form of Chinese pronunciation.</p><br><br>
