  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Riverside is an affluent, suburban village in <span class="loc">Cook County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. A significant portion of the village is in the Riverside Landscape Architecture District, designated a National Historic Landmark in <span class="date">1970</span>. The population of the village was 8,875 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is a suburb of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, located roughly 9 miles (14 km) west of downtown <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and 2 miles (3 km) outside city limits. Riverside is arguably the first planned community in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, designed in <span class="date">1869</span> by <span class="per">Calvert Vaux</span> and <span class="per">Frederick Law Olmsted</span>. The village was incorporated in <span class="date">1875</span>]. The Riverside Landscape Architecture District, an area bounded by 26th Street, <span class="loc">Harlem</span> and <span class="loc">Ogden</span> avenues, the <span class="loc">Des Plaines</span> River, and Golf Road, was designated a National Historic Landmark in <span class="date">1970</span>. In <span class="date">1863</span> the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and Quincy Railroad was built heading southwest from downtown <span class="loc">Chicago</span> to Quincy, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, passing through what is <span class="date">now</span> the Near West Suburban area of <span class="loc">Chicago</span> in a western-southwestern direction. This new access to transportation and commerce brought about a significant housing and construction boom in what was once farmland far from the bustle of the <span class="loc">city of Chicago</span>.</p><br><br>
