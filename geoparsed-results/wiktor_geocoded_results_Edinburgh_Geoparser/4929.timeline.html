  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Antioch</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Sheridan County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located approximately 15 miles east of Alliance on <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> Highway 2, the town was once nicknamed "the potash capital of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>." The location of the town near several major alkali lakes among the <span class="loc">Sandhills</span> of western <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> made <span class="loc">Antioch</span> the logical home of five potash reduction factories: the American, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, Alliance, National, and Western potash companies. All these companies were major suppliers of potash during World War I. As a late boomtown, <span class="loc">Antioch</span> sprang out of the war-driven needs. According to one historian, the year before the <span class="loc">United States</span> became involved in WWI, the town only had one schoolhouse, a church, and a store. With the advent of a method to distill potash from western <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>'s alkali lakes by University of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> scientists, by <span class="date">1917</span> <span class="loc">Antioch</span> was "a small city." <span class="loc">Antioch</span> quickly had five large-scale potash plants, and within <span class="date">months</span> the town had more than 5,000 residents. Following the war the population left again. When <span class="loc">Germany</span> resumed trade with the <span class="loc">United States</span> in <span class="date">1921</span>, the potash trade was decimated. The factories immediately closed. The machinery was sold for scrap; the factories were demolished for the salvage value of the building materials; and the company housing was torn down or moved. Only the foundations of the factories and of some of the larger houses remained. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Antioch</span> has fewer than 25 residents.</p><br><br>
