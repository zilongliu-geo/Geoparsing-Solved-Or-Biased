<p><span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> is a small town and locality of the <span class="loc">Moreton Bay Region</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is 60 kilometres (37 mi) north of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, the state capital. At the 2011 census, its population was 461. The closest major population centre is <span class="loc">Caboolture</span>, 20 kilometres (12 mi) to the west. The town name was approved by the Queensland Place Names Board on 1 October 1975. The name appears to be derived from a corroboree site, or because of fights amongst oyster gatherers at weekend camps. The town started out as a small fishing community but has since developed into a minor tourist destination. Pumicestone Post Office opened on 1 August 1958. It was renamed <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> in 1976. In 1985, an unsealed road running along the waterfront was named Grant Lane after Robert Grant (1895 â€“ 15 November 1991) for his 90th birthday, a popular local who everyone knew as "Pop". A few years later the road was sealed after he had complained for years of the dust produced by all the passers-by. Sand mining and sewerage works have recently been proposed for the area.</p>
