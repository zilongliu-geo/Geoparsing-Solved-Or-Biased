<p>Milton is a city and suburb in <span class="loc">Fulton County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Incorporated on December 1, 2006, it was created out of the entire unincorporated northwestern part of northern <span class="loc">Fulton County</span>. It is a highly affluent community with an average household income within the zip code 30004 of $99,412. According to the 2010 Census, Milton's population is 32,661. Milton is named in honor of the former <span class="loc">Milton County</span>, which was named after Revolutionary War Hero John Milton. The portion of <span class="loc">North Fulton</span>, generally north of the <span class="loc">Chattahoochee River</span>), comprises most of the territory of the former <span class="loc">Milton County</span>. A citizens' committee was formed in 2005 to help determine the viability of incorporating unincorporated northwest <span class="loc">Fulton County</span>. After debate, the Georgia State House and Senate approved a bill creating the <span class="loc">city of Milton</span> on March 9, 2006. On March 28, Governor Sonny Perdue signed the bill into law. In July 2006, voters approved a ballot referendum on July 18 by more than 86%. On August 4, 2006, Governor Sonny Perdue appointed a five-person commission to serve as the interim government of Milton.</p>
