  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Sidney</span> is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Cheyenne County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,757 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city was named for <span class="per">Sidney Dillon</span>, president of the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific Railroad. It was founded in <span class="date">1867</span> by the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific and grew up around the military base of <span class="per">Fort Sidney</span> (also known as <span class="per">Sidney</span> Barracks), where soldiers were stationed to guard the transcontinental railroad from potential Indian attacks. The town became the southern terminus of the <span class="per">Sidney</span> Black Hills Stage Road which used Clarke's Bridge (near <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>) to allow military and civilian traffic to reach <span class="loc">Fort Robinson</span>, Red Cloud Agency, Spotted Tail Agency, <span class="loc">Custer</span>, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>, and Deadwood, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span> in the late 1870s and 1880s. <span class="per">Sidney</span> is home to one of the Old West's Boot Hill cemeteries; many of those interred there were soldiers from the fort. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.93 square miles (17.95 km2), all of it land. <span class="per">Sidney</span> is toward the western edge of the midwestern wheat-growing region. West of the city, the land is increasingly used for cattle ranching. <span class="per">Sidney</span> is located along <span class="loc">Lodgepole Creek</span>, which is along present-day Interstate 80.</p><br><br>
