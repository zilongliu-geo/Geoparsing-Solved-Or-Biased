  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Barga</span> is a medieval town and comune of the <span class="loc">province of Lucca</span> in <span class="loc">Tuscany</span>, central <span class="loc">Italy</span>. It is home to around 10,000 people and is the chief town of the "Media Valle" (mid valley) of the <span class="loc">Serchio</span> River. <span class="loc">Barga</span> lies 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of the provincial capital, <span class="loc">Lucca</span>. It is overlooked by the village of <span class="loc">Albiano</span>, a localit√† of <span class="loc">Barga</span>, which in the 10th century was the site of a castle protecting the town. <span class="loc">Pania della Croce</span>, a mountain of the <span class="loc">Apuan Alps</span>, dominates the surrounding chestnut trees, grape vines and olive groves. In the 9th century, <span class="loc">Barga</span> is mentioned as a family feud of the Lombard family of Rolandinghi. In the 11th century, <span class="loc">Barga</span> obtained from Matilda of <span class="loc">Tuscany</span> broad privileges including tax exemptions. However, formally <span class="loc">Barga</span> was still subordinate to <span class="loc">Lucca</span>. When Matilda died, she left all her properties, including the <span class="loc">Serchio</span> Valley, to the Church, which was not really a popular decision, and caused a war. Despite the war, <span class="loc">Barga</span> was not looted, apparently, because of the presence of the nuncius, sent to the valley by the <span class="per">Pope Gregory IX</span>. As the result of the war, the <span class="loc">diocese of Lucca</span> was abolished and split between several parties, including <span class="loc">Pisa</span>. <span class="loc">Barga</span> took advantage of it, and in the 13th century helped <span class="loc">Pisa</span> against <span class="loc">Lucca</span>, but in <span class="date">1236</span> was finally subordinated to <span class="loc">Lucca</span>. After these events, <span class="loc">Barga</span> has developed as an important trade city which had connections with <span class="loc">Modena</span> over mountain roads. The city grew as a castle surrounded by a line of walls, of which two gates (<span class="per">Porta</span> <span class="per">Reale</span> and <span class="per">Porta</span> Macchiaia) have survived. The town was well known during the Middle Ages for the manufacture of silk threads which were exported to major centres such as <span class="loc">Florence</span>, its mills powered by the hydraulic power of the nearby creeks. In the Middle Ages, <span class="loc">Lucca</span> and <span class="loc">Pisa</span> battled frequently to conquer the wealthy town and the surrounding territory, and for a time <span class="loc">Barga</span> was part of the Florentine dominion, later <span class="org">Duchy and Grand Duchy</span> of <span class="loc">Tuscany</span>. Between <span class="date">1331</span> and <span class="date">1859</span> <span class="loc">Albiano</span> owed its allegiance to the Florentine State. It became part of the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Italy</span> in <span class="date">1861</span>. Since <span class="date">1923</span> <span class="loc">Barga</span> is part of the <span class="loc">province of Lucca</span>.</p><br><br>
