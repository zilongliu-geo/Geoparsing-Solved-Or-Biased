  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Thornton</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, originally called Texas Siding, is a townsite founded in <span class="date">1917</span> and exists <span class="date">today</span> as a township of <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. <span class="per">Thornton</span> was named in honor of <span class="per">William Ezra Thornton</span>, who had been prominent in the establishment of the townsite, and who also was for a time <span class="per">Thornton</span>'s Postmaster. <span class="per">Thornton</span> once thrived as "an enterprising center of commerce." <span class="per">Thornton</span> is <span class="date">now</span> primarily a rural community and is home to a potato warehouse and the original <span class="per">Thornton</span> Merc convenience store. <span class="per">Thornton</span>'s original store was "The Country Store" which was owned by <span class="per">William Ezra Thornton</span> &amp; ran by <span class="per">William</span> &amp; his wife, <span class="per">Wilhemina Hansas Lyman Thornton</span>. At one time, <span class="per">Thornton</span> "boasted of two fine general mercantile stores". <span class="per">Thornton</span>'s store was owned in <span class="date">the early 1900s</span> by <span class="per">George Marler</span>. A competing store in <span class="per">Thornton</span> was owned by <span class="per">C. L. Galbraith</span>. In <span class="date">1971</span> the <span class="per">Thornton</span> Merc, which had replaced the two prior mercantile stores was operated by <span class="per">Mrs. Geraldine Evans</span>. As of <span class="date">2010</span> it is still in operation, and "<span class="per">Marler</span>" can still be seen faintly painted on the north side. Descendants of the <span class="per">Marler</span> family still own property in <span class="per">Thornton</span>.</p><br><br>
