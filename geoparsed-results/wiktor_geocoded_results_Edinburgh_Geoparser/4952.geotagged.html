<p><span class="loc">Cabo Blanco</span> is a fishing village in northwestern <span class="loc">Peru</span>, 3 km northwest from <span class="loc">El Alto</span>, <span class="loc">Talara</span>, <span class="loc">Piura</span>. It was famous in the past among big-game fishermen and today is a noted surf break. The village takes its name from the light coloured nearby mountains. In the 1950s and 1960s, fishermen traveled to <span class="loc">Cabo Blanco</span> to hunt big marlin. Ernest Hemingway stayed more than a month at the famous "Cabo Blanco Fishing Club" and caught a 700 pound marlin while filming the motion picture based on his novel, The <span class="loc">Old Man</span> and the Sea. In 1953, Alfred Glassell Jr. caught the IGFA all tackle world record black marlin, weighing 1560 pounds. In 1979, Peruvian surfer Gordo Barreda discovered the wave when he visited the village to check the surf in the area. The wave is a hollow powerful left and is reckoned the "Peruvian Pipeline", referring to the <span class="loc">Banzai Pipeline</span> in <span class="loc">Hawaii</span>. Swell from <span class="loc">Hawaii</span> does in fact go on to reach <span class="loc">Peru</span>; in the 1990s the best way to get a surf forecast was to phone <span class="loc">Hawaii</span> and whatever swell they had would arrive about 5 days later.</p>
