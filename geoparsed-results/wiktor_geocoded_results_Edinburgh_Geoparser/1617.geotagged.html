<p>Newport is a town in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Sullivan County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is 43 miles (69 km) west-northwest of Concord. The population was 6,507 at the 2010 census. A covered bridge is in the northwest. The area is noted for maple sugar and apple orchards. The central settlement in town, where 4,769 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Newport</span> census-designated place (CDP) and is located next to the <span class="loc">Sugar River</span> at the junction of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> routes 10 and 11. The town also includes the villages of Kelleyville and Guild. Granted in 1753 by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, the town was named Grenville after George Grenville, Prime Minister of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> and brother-in-law of William Pitt. But ongoing hostilities during the French and Indian War, as close as the Fort at Number 4 at <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>, delayed settlement. Nevertheless, in 1761 the town would be incorporated as Newport, for Henry Newport, a distinguished English soldier and statesman. It was first settled in 1763 by pioneers from <span class="loc">North Killingworth</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. Absalom Kelsey was one of the earliest settlers. The first blow in clearing the forests was struck by Absalom Kelsey on the D.F. Pike farm at the foot of <span class="loc">Claremont Hill</span>, <span class="loc">Newport</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. At that time, the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> was the only route for travel, until a road was cut through the wilderness to <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> in 1767. The following year, the first gristmill was established. But dissatisfied with treatment by the state government far beyond the mountains, Newport in 1781 joined 33 other towns along the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> and seceded from <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> to join <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, however, would dissolve their union with <span class="loc">Vermont</span> in 1782, and the towns rejoined <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>.</p>
