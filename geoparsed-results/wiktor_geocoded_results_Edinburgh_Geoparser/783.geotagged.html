<p><span class="loc">Trujillo</span> is a city and a municipality on the northern Caribbean coast of the Honduran department of Colón, of which the city is the capital. The municipality has a population of about 30,000 (2003). The city is located on a bluff overlooking the Bay of <span class="loc">Trujillo</span>. Behind the city rise two prominent mountains, Mount Capiro and Mount Calentura. Three Garifuna fishing villages—Santa Fe, <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>, and Guadelupe—are located along the beach. <span class="loc">Trujillo</span> has received plenty of attention as the potential site of a proposed Honduran charter city project, according to an idea originally advocated by American economist Paul Romer. Often referred to as a <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> in <span class="loc">Honduras</span>, and advocated by among others the Trujillo-born Honduran president Porfirio Lobo Sosa, the project has also been met with skepticism and controversy, especially due to its supposed disregard for the local Garifuna culture. Christopher Columbus landed in <span class="loc">Trujillo</span> on August 14, 1502, during his fourth and final voyage to <span class="loc">the Americas</span>. Columbus named the place "Punta de Caxinas". It was the first time he touched the Central American mainland. He noticed that the water in this part of the Caribbean was very deep and therefore called the area <span class="loc">Golfo de Honduras</span>, i.e., The Gulf of the Depths (see: <span class="loc">Bay of Honduras</span>).</p>
