<p><span class="loc">Govan</span> (/ˈɡʌvən/ GUV-ən; Scottish Gaelic: <span class="loc">Baile</span> a' Ghobhainn) is a district, parish, and former burgh now part of southwest City of <span class="loc">Glasgow</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is situated 2.5 miles (4.0 km) west of <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> city centre, on the south bank of the <span class="loc">River Clyde</span>, opposite the mouth of the <span class="loc">River Kelvin</span> and the <span class="loc">district of Partick</span>. Historically it was part of the <span class="loc">County of Lanark</span>. According to medieval legend, Constantine, a 7th-century King of Strathclyde, founded a monastery under the rule of Columbanus in <span class="loc">Govan</span>. During the Middle Ages, <span class="loc">Govan</span> was the site of a ferry which linked the area with <span class="loc">Partick</span> for seasonal cattle drovers. In the 18th and 19th centuries, textile mills and coal mining were important; in the early 19th century shipbuilding emerged as Govan's principal industry. In 1864, <span class="loc">Govan</span> gained burgh status, and was <span class="loc">Scotland</span>'s fifth largest burgh. It was incorporated into the <span class="loc">city of Glasgow</span> in 1912. Recent studies of the archaeology of old <span class="loc">Govan</span> have revealed the presence of an ancient Christian church. Two associated Christian burials are radiocarbon dated to the 5th or 6th centuries, making <span class="loc">Govan</span> the earliest known Christian site in the region. <span class="loc">Govan</span> is believed to have then been part of a kingdom ruled from <span class="loc">Dumbarton</span> Rock, known as Alt Clut, the rock on the <span class="loc">Clyde</span>. During the Viking Age, perhaps following the sack of <span class="loc">Dumbarton</span> Rock in 878, <span class="loc">Govan</span> is believed to have been one of the major centres of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. According to John of Fordun, Constantine, a 7th-century king of Strathclyde, founded a monastery at <span class="loc">Govan</span>, where he died and was buried. In 1855, an elaborately carved sandstone sarcophagus was found during digging in the churchyard. It is now kept inside the church. It may have been used to contain the body or relics of Constantine, although the style of carving indicates an origin in the 10th or 11th centuries. This King Constantine is first mentioned in the 12th-century Life of St. Kentigern by Jocelyn of <span class="loc">Furness</span>, where he is said to have been son of Riderch Hael. He is likely a literary invention. The early church in <span class="loc">Govan</span> is dedicated to a Saint Constantine, about whom nothing else is known.</p>
