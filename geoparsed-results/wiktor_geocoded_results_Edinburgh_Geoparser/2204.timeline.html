  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bolivar</span> is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 10,325. <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> began as a settlement around Keeling Spring, with the majority of settlers being from <span class="loc">Hardeman County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The settlement became part of <span class="loc">Greene County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> when that county was organized in <span class="date">1833</span>. After the northern part of <span class="loc">Greene County</span> was ceded to form <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, the <span class="org">Polk County Court</span> proclaimed the settlement as a city, named it <span class="loc">Bolivar</span>, and designated it as the county seat on <span class="date">10 November 1835</span>. <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> was re-organized as a fourth-class city <span class="date">15 February 1881</span>. <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> experienced growth in <span class="date">1884</span> when the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway was extended to that point. The name <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> was proposed by <span class="per">John Polk</span> Campbell and his brothers William St. <span class="per">Clair</span> and <span class="per">Ezekiel</span> <span class="org">Madison</span>. The name is after <span class="loc">Bolivar</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> where their grandfather and Continental Army Colonel <span class="per">Ezekiel Polk</span> had lived. In the 1830s, both <span class="loc">Polk</span> and <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> were names locally associated with liberation. As such, <span class="loc">Bolivar</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> is an indirect namesake of <span class="per">Simón Bolívar</span>.</p><br><br>
