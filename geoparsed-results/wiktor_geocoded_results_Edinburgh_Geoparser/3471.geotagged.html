<p><span class="loc">Dura</span> (Arabic: دورا‎) is a Palestinian town located eleven kilometers southwest of <span class="loc">Hebron</span> in the <span class="loc">Hebron</span> Governorate in the southern <span class="loc">West Bank</span>. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the town had a population of over 28,268 in 2007. The current mayor is Saeed M. Awawdeh. Some believe Noah, the tenth of the pre-flood Patriarchs, as the story of <span class="loc">Noah's Ark</span> is told in the Hebrew Bible, is buried in <span class="loc">Dura</span>. The city was fortified by Rehoboam (974 BC – 913 BC), King of the United Monarchy of <span class="loc">Israel</span> and later the King of the Kingdom of Judah, who was a son of Solomon and a grandson of David, according to 2 Chron. 11.9. The city was called <span class="loc">Adora</span> in the First Book of Maccabees (1 Macc. 13.20). In 1517, the village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of <span class="loc">Syria</span>. After the British Mandate, in the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, <span class="loc">Dura</span> was occupied by <span class="loc">Jordan</span> and came under Jordanian rule. <span class="loc">Dura</span> was established as a municipality on January 1, 1967, five months before it was occupied by <span class="loc">Israel</span> during the Six-Day War.</p>
