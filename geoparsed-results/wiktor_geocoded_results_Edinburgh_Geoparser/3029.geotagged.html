<p><span class="loc">Yala</span> (Thai: ยะลา, pronounced [jáʔlaː] or  [jálaː]) is a city and seat of Mueang <span class="loc">Yala District</span> and <span class="loc">Yala Province</span>, southern <span class="loc">Thailand</span>. The provincial and district capital, it is 137 kilometres by road south-east of <span class="loc">Hat Yai</span>. The eastern part of the city is part of the neighboring tambon of Sateng Nok. As of 2010 the tambon had a total population of 76,853, up from 65,503 people reported in 2005. It lies on the border with <span class="loc">Pattani Province</span> in the north of <span class="loc">Yala Province</span>. It lies along <span class="loc">Thailand</span> Route 4106, south of <span class="loc">Khao Tum</span> and north of Krong Pinang and has a railway station on the Yala Railway. <span class="loc">Yala</span> is approximately 1,100 km south of <span class="loc">Bangkok</span>. <span class="loc">Yala</span> used to be part of the Pattani kingdom. When <span class="loc">Ayutthaya</span> was captured by the Burmese, <span class="loc">Yala</span>, along with other southern colonies, became independent. <span class="loc">Yala</span> was again included as part of <span class="loc">Thailand</span> about 41 years later. In September 1977, the King and Queen of <span class="loc">Thailand</span> narrowly avoided assassination after a bomb exploded nearby during a visit. On 9 October, policemen from the 12th Provincial Police Headquarters and the Yala Provincial Police Headquarters arrested <span class="loc">Abdun</span> <span class="loc">Romae</span> <span class="loc">Haron</span>, <span class="loc">Mae</span> Prachu and Choning <span class="loc">Saing</span> on charges of conspiring with the escaped convicts Hayi Masae, <span class="loc">Choya</span> Samae and Abdun <span class="loc">Romae</span> in attempting to kill the monarchs.</p>
