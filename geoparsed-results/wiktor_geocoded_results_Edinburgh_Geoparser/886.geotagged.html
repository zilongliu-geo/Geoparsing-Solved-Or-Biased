<p>Montgomery /mɒntˈɡʌməri/ is the capital of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alabama</span> and is the county seat of <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>. Named for Richard Montgomery, it is located on the <span class="loc">Alabama River</span>, in the <span class="loc">Gulf Coastal Plain</span>. As of the 2010 Census, Montgomery had a population of 205,764. It is the second-largest city in <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, after <span class="loc">Birmingham</span>, and the 103rd largest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The <span class="loc">Montgomery Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area had a 2010 estimated population of 374,536. It is the fourth-largest in the state and 136th among <span class="loc">United States</span> metropolitan areas. The city was incorporated in 1819, as a merger of two towns situated along the <span class="loc">Alabama River</span>. It became the state capital in 1846, representing the shift of power to the south-central area with the growth of cotton as a commodity crop of the Black Belt and Mobile's rise as a mercantile port. In February 1861, Montgomery was selected as the first capital of the Confederate States of <span class="loc">America</span>, until the seat of government moved to <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, in May of that year. During the mid-20th century, Montgomery was a major site of events in the Civil Rights Movement, including the <span class="loc">Montgomery Bus Boycott</span> and the <span class="loc">Selma</span> to Montgomery marches.</p>
