<p>Augusta native had a 'distinguished career'. Joyce Shelby, an award-winning New York Daily News reporter who began her professional career in her hometown at the Augusta Herald, died March 19. She was 62. Keith Claussen, a longtime friend and a onetime co-worker at the former Augusta afternoon newspaper, called her "one of the brightest, funniest, most down-to-earth people I've ever had the privilege of knowing." "Joyce had a distinguished career in journalism. She taught journalism at Columbia University, but she told me her first love was being a reporter -- getting the story and making a difference in people's lives," Ms. Claussen said. She said Ms. Shelby, the first black reporter hired by the Herald in the late 1960s, was always popular. "She had a wonderful, easy-going personality, and she could make connections with people," Ms. Claussen said. "That's what earned her the respect of her colleagues, her friends and the people she wrote about." Ms. Shelby's career accomplishments were considerable, friends said. She was the editor of Georgetown University's alumni magazine from 1974-75, adjunct professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism from 1975-81 and an assistant professor there from 1981-87. She was a reporter for the New York Daily News from 1987 until her death, according to the newspaper. Mallory Millender, a longtime Augusta educator, met Ms. Shelby at Columbia University. "She was extremely competent in her field and respected by the students and the professors," Dr. Millender said. "She was also well-liked and a fun person. She liked to joke. "At the same time, she was a very real person. Even if you didn't know her, the first time you met her she treated you as if she'd known you all her life." Ms. Shelby is survived by her mother, Prudence Young, formerly of <span class="loc">Augusta</span>; and her children, Gail Shelby and Clayborn Shelby III, both of New <span class="loc">York City</span>.</p>
