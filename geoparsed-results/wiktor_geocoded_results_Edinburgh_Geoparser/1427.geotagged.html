<p><span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is an area of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>, in <span class="loc">Merseyside</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, encompassing streets between <span class="loc">Tuebrook</span> and <span class="loc">Kensington</span> and stretching to <span class="loc">Old Swan</span>. It consists of a variety of houses; there are some traditional red-brick terraces, larger Victorian villas and also the notable and rather wonderful 300-year-old Georgian Fairfield Crescent which is off the equally old and wonderful <span class="loc">Prospect Vale</span>. Hidden gems in a conservation area which were they located in a different part of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> would be worth considerably more. The area also contains the Victorian <span class="loc">Newsham Park</span>, for which the area is notable. Friends of <span class="loc">Newsham Park</span> meet with council officers regularly at the <span class="loc">Newsham Park</span> park forum to discuss improvements to the park and are currently anticipating the start on site of the building of a new pavilion. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is now also home to the new shopping development on Prescot Road, which brings much needed retail stores like <span class="loc">Iceland</span>, Tesco, Greggs and other shops into this once neglected neighbourhood centre. Another new facility is the community fire station on Beech Street which was opened in 2010 by the Duchess of Gloucester. It has been named "<span class="loc">Kensington</span>" Fire Station, despite being just inside the <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> border. Residents of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> with its 300 year old history are often cross when their area is referred to as "<span class="loc">Kensington</span>", and will write letters of complaint to the Liverpool Echo. They are fiercely proud of their history. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is paired with <span class="loc">Kensington</span> to form a <span class="loc">Liverpool City</span> Council Ward.</p>
