  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>In what the Food and Drug Administration is characterizing as one of the largest recalls in recent history, numerous types of products containing peanuts are being recalled in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The FDA issued a recall on <span class="date">Wednesday</span> on food items with peanut paste and other peanut products made after <span class="date">January 1, 2007</span> at a <span class="org">Peanut Corp.</span> of <span class="loc">America</span> (PCA) center in <span class="loc">Blakely</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. The recall affects over 430 products containing peanut paste or peanut butter from the PCA plant. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> federal inspectors stated salmonella was found in 12 instances at the plant. So far the incident has been linked to eight deaths, with over 500 individuals sickened from the tainted products. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Congressman <span class="per">Henry Waxman</span> (D-<span class="org">CA</span>) has announced he will hold a Congressional hearing <span class="date">February 11</span> before the <span class="org">House</span> Energy and Commerce Committee to investigate the matter. According to an FDA report, peanut products from the <span class="loc">Georgia</span> plant returned to the <span class="loc">United States</span> after being exported were prevented from reentering the country in <span class="date">September</span> due to containing "filthy, putrid or decomposed substance, or is otherwise unfit for food," but the products were not tested by federal inspectors. According to the FDA, peanut products were shipped from the PCA facility though the company knew they were contaminated. PCA asserted it was unaware products were contaminated before being shipped, and released a statement saying it had "taken extraordinary measures to identify and recall all products that have been identified as presenting a potential risk". The PCA plant has since been shut down after state and federal inspectors discovered mold, roaches, a leaky roof, and other issues at the facility. Multiple members of Congress have made critical statements about the FDA regarding the incident. "The FDA failing to follow up after this incident, does that mean that products that are not good enough for a foreign country are still good enough for the <span class="loc">USA</span>?" said Senator <span class="per">Tom Harkin</span> (D-IA), Chairman of <span class="org">the Senate</span> Agriculture Committee. "If the FDA discovered that there was an issue with this product inspection, why didn't they follow up on it? Why didn't they take a closer look at this facility?" asked Representative <span class="per">Rosa DeLauro</span> (D-CT). Representative <span class="per">DeLauro</span> called the actions of PCA "reprehensible and criminal". <span class="per">Beth Falwell</span>, daughter of PCA's founder <span class="per">Hugh Parnell</span>, told WSLS-TV, the NBC affiliate in <span class="loc">Roanoke</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, in a statement <span class="date">Thursday</span> that her brother <span class="per">Stewart Parnell</span> who currently runs the company would not knowingly harm his customers. She believes the FDA report documenting poor conditions at the PCA facility contains inaccuracies. <span class="per">Stewart Parnell</span> did not respond to repeated attempts by The News &amp; Advance for a comment. Consumers can find out more information at the website of the FDA, www.fda.gov, which lists the peanut products affected. The FDA list of items containing recalled peanut products is 35 pages long. Individuals can also find out more information about the incident by calling <span class="org">the Centers for Disease Control</span> and Prevention, at 1-800-CDC-INFO.</p><br><br>
