  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Milton is a village just <span class="loc">north of Cambridge</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> with a population of approximately 4,679 (<span class="date">2011</span> census), up from 4,275 in the <span class="date">2001</span> census. Milton grew from a population of 31 peasants in <span class="date">1086</span>, growing slowly up to 170 people making up 40 families in <span class="date">1728</span>. The population expanded to around 740 then remained fairly static in the period of <span class="date">the 1910s</span> to <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, the parish then grew more rapidly to greater than 1,700 in <span class="date">1971</span>. Milton expanded considerably in <span class="date">the late 1980s</span> when two large housing estates were built between the bypass and the village. This resulted in a doubling of the population between the <span class="date">1981</span> and 1991 censuses. The latest expansion started in <span class="date">2012</span> with the development of the <span class="loc">North Lodge Park</span> consisting of 88 homes, two football pitches, pavilion and car park, with the first residents moving in <span class="date">April 2014</span>. The A10 bypass was built between <span class="date">1976</span> and <span class="date">1978</span> around the west edge of village, splitting <span class="loc">Butt Lane</span> into two parts. As part of the Great Eastern Railway the Cambridge-Ely line was opened in <span class="date">1845</span> bypassing the village to the east but with no station. The nearest station is to the north in the village of <span class="loc">Waterbeach</span>, until the Cambridge Science Park railway station opens (due to be operational by <span class="date">2016</span>).</p><br><br>
