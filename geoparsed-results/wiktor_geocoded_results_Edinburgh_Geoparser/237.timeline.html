  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is an abandoned mining town located in the <span class="loc">White Pine</span> Range, in western White <span class="loc">Pine County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> rapidly came into being after discovery of rich silver ore in the area. The first settlers found shelter in local caves, which were numerous. By <span class="date">May 1868</span>, the settlement, then known as "<span class="loc">Cave City</span>" was formed. The town boomed following the discovery of rich silver deposits nearby. By <span class="date">that winter</span>, it had approximately 600 inhabitants. It was soon renamed for mine promoter W.H. Hamilton. The post office first opened for business on <span class="date">August 10, 1868</span> while the community was still part of <span class="loc">Lander County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>. <span class="loc">White Pine</span> county was formed in <span class="date">March 1869</span> and <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> was selected as the first county seat. By its peak during the <span class="date">summer of 1869</span>, Hamilton's population was estimated at 12,000. There were close to 100 saloons, several breweries, 60 general stores, and numerous other businesses. There were also theaters, dance halls, skating rinks, a Minersâ€™ <span class="loc">Union Hall</span>, and a fraternal order located in the thriving community. Close to 200 mining companies were operating in the area.</p><br><br>
