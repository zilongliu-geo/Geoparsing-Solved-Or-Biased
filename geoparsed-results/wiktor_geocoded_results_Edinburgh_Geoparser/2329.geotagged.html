<p>Dayton is a city in <span class="loc">Liberty County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,242 at the 2010 census. Dayton, on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 90 six miles west of Liberty in southwestern <span class="loc">Liberty County</span>, was first called <span class="loc">West Liberty</span> and was considered part of the original town of Liberty, founded in 1831. The <span class="loc">Trinity River</span> divided the two parts of the town: Liberty was on its east bank, and <span class="loc">West Liberty</span> was on a hill three miles west of the river. A new road and a ferry directly connected the two. Both parts of the town were located on the four-league Mexican land grant appropriated for the capital of the old municipality of Sant√≠sima Trinidad de la Libertad, which later became known as Liberty. The postmaster of <span class="loc">West Liberty</span> from March 25, 1839, through September 15, 1841, was A. Thouvenin, probably the same man as <span class="loc">Arnold</span> Thouvenin, who obtained a quarter-league Mexican land grant in <span class="loc">Polk County</span> in April 1835. The <span class="loc">West Liberty</span> post office was apparently discontinued after a few years. Land was designated for a school in 1847. The schoolhouse was accepted on December 31, 1853, by the board of trustees of the Corporation of the Town of Liberty. Also in 1853, A. N. B. Thompson was authorized to survey and plat the town of <span class="loc">West Liberty</span>. During the Civil War, thirty-three ladies of <span class="loc">West Liberty</span> wrote to Governor Francis R. Lubbock in January 1863, petitioning him to relieve Mr. Sol Andrews of his military duties so that he might continue his vocation of manufacturer of looms and spinning wheels, as cloth for clothing was desperately needed.</p>
