<p><span class="loc">Madalena</span> (Portuguese pronunciation: [mɐðɐˈlenɐ]) is a municipality along the western coast of the island of <span class="loc">Pico</span>, in the Portuguese <span class="loc">Azores</span>. The population in 2011 was 6,049, in an area of 147.12 km². The municipality is fronted by the stratovolcano <span class="loc">Pico</span> in the eastern frontier, and the Faial Channel which divides <span class="loc">Pico</span> from the island of Faial seven kilometers away. It is encircled almost entirely by the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> except in the east, where it is bordered by São João (<span class="loc">Lajes do Pico</span>) in the southeast, and Santo António (São Roque do <span class="loc">Pico</span>) in the northeast. The settlement of the island of <span class="loc">Pico</span> occurred much later than most islands, partly due to greater interest shown in the other islands of the Central Group. For a time, only small herds, deposited by property-owners from Faial and Terceira, along with their caretakers (some of whom were slaves), were the only inhabitants of the island. It was not until the Infanta Beatriz proceeded to reorganize island administration and promote a greater colonization of the islands of the Central Group (between 1470 and 1480) that this changed. In 1483, <span class="loc">Faial</span> and <span class="loc">Pico</span> were integrated into one Captaincy, under the Flem Josse van Huerter, and settlers were encouraged to colonize the island of <span class="loc">Pico</span>. But even still, the area of <span class="loc">Madalena</span>, with its rocky coastal plain, did not attract many new settlers and the community did not expand significantly until the municipality was created in 1723.</p>
