  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Virginia (/vərˈdʒɪnjə/ vər-JIN-yə, <span class="loc">UK</span> /vərˈdʒɪniə/ vər-JIN-ee-ə), officially the Commonwealth of Virginia, is a state located in the <span class="loc">South Atlantic region</span> of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Virginia is nicknamed the "<span class="loc">Old Dominion</span>" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British <span class="loc">America</span>, and "<span class="org">Mother of Presidents</span>" because eight <span class="loc">U.S.</span> presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the <span class="loc">Blue Ridge Mountains</span> and the <span class="loc">Chesapeake Bay</span>, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is <span class="loc">Richmond</span>; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and <span class="loc">Fairfax County</span> is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population as of <span class="date">2014</span> is over 8.3 million. The area's history begins with several indigenous groups, including the <span class="loc">Powhatan</span>. In <span class="date">1607</span> the <span class="org">London Company</span> established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent <span class="org">New World</span> English colony. Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution and joined the Confederacy in the American Civil War, during which <span class="loc">Richmond</span> was made the Confederate capital and Virginia's northwestern counties seceded to form the state of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly <span class="date">a century</span> following Reconstruction, both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia.</p><br><br>
