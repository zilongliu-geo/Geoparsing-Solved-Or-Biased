  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Easton is a village and civil parish in <span class="loc">Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Easton lies approximately 6 miles (10 km) west of <span class="loc">Huntingdon</span>, between the villages of <span class="loc">Ellington</span> and <span class="loc">Spaldwick</span>. Easton is situated within <span class="loc">Huntingdonshire</span> which is a non-metropolitan <span class="loc">district of Cambridgeshire</span> as well as being a historic <span class="loc">county of England</span>. There is a church and a small park. At the time of the <span class="date">2001</span> census, the parish's population was 162: 80 males and 82 females in 60 households.  However, by <span class="date">2011</span>, the population had increased only slightly to 169 people. Easton was mentioned in the Domesday Book. Easton is a hamlet which the Anglo Saxons settled in and the church was erected in the 14th century. In <span class="date">1085</span> William the Conqueror ordered that a survey should be carried out across his kingdom to discover who owned which parts and what it was worth. The survey took place in <span class="date">1086</span> and the results were recorded in what, since the 12th century, has become known as the Domesday Book. Starting with the king himself, for each landholder within a county there is a list of their estates or manors; and, for each manor, there is a summary of the resources of the manor, the amount of annual rent that was collected by the lord of the manor both in <span class="date">1066</span> and in <span class="date">1086</span>, together with the taxable value.</p><br><br>
