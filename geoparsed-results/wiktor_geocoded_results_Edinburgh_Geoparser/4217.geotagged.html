<p><span class="loc">Honduras</span> (/hɒnˈdʊərəs/; Spanish: [onˈduɾas]), officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Honduras</span> (Spanish: República de <span class="loc">Honduras</span>), is a republic in Central <span class="loc">America</span>. It was at times referred to as Spanish <span class="loc">Honduras</span> to differentiate it from <span class="loc">British Honduras</span>, which became the modern-day state of <span class="loc">Belize</span>. <span class="loc">Honduras</span> is bordered to the west by <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>, to the southwest by <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>, to the southeast by <span class="loc">Nicaragua</span>, to the south by the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> at the <span class="loc">Gulf of Fonseca</span>, and to the north by the <span class="loc">Gulf of Honduras</span>, a large inlet of the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span>. <span class="loc">Honduras</span> was home to several important Mesoamerican cultures, most notably the Maya, prior to being conquered by <span class="loc">Spain</span> in the sixteenth century. The Spanish introduced Roman Catholicism and the now predominant Spanish language, along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous culture. <span class="loc">Honduras</span> became independent in 1821 and has since been a republic, although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability, remaining one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. <span class="loc">Honduras</span> has the highest murder rate in the world.</p>
