<p><span class="loc">Columbus</span> /kəˈlʌmbəs/ is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Bartholomew County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 44,061 at the 2010 census. In its built environment, the relatively small city has provided a unique place for noted Modern architecture. Located about 40 miles (64 km) south of <span class="loc">Indianapolis</span>, on the east fork of the <span class="loc">White River</span>, it is the state's 20th largest city. It is also the principal city of the <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses all of <span class="loc">Bartholomew County</span>. National Geographic Traveler ranked <span class="loc">Columbus</span> 11th on its historic destinations list in late 2008, describing the city as "authentic, unique, and unspoiled." <span class="loc">Columbus</span> won the national contest "<span class="loc">America</span> in Bloom" in 2006, and in 2004 it was named one of "The Ten Most Playful Towns" by Nick Jr. Family Magazine. The July 2005 edition of GQ magazine named <span class="loc">Columbus</span> one of the "62 Reasons to Love Your Country". <span class="loc">Columbus</span> is the headquarters of the engine company Cummins, Inc. The land which is now <span class="loc">Columbus</span> was bought by General John Tipton and Luke Bonesteel in 1820. Tipton built a log cabin on <span class="loc">Mount Tipton</span>, a small hill overlooking <span class="loc">White River</span> and the surrounding flat, heavily forested and swampy valley. The town was known as <span class="loc">Tiptonia</span>, named in honor of Tipton. The town's name was changed to <span class="loc">Columbus</span> on March 20, 1821. General Tipton was upset by the name change and decided to leave the newly founded town. He later became the highway commissioner for the State of <span class="loc">Indiana</span> and was assigned to building a highway from <span class="loc">Indianapolis</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> to <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. When the road reached <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">Tipton</span> constructed the first bypass road ever built; it detoured south around the west side of <span class="loc">Columbus</span> en route to <span class="loc">Seymour</span>.</p>
