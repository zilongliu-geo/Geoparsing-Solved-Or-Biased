<p>Bago (formerly spelt <span class="loc">Pegu</span>; Burmese: ပဲခူးမြို့; MLCTS: pai: khu: mrui., IPA: [bəɡó mjo̰]; <span class="loc">Mon</span>: ဗဂေါ, [həkɜ̀]; Thai: พะโค, rtgs: Pha-kho), formerly known as Hanthawaddy (Burmese: ဟံသာဝတီ ; <span class="loc">Mon</span>: ဟံသာဝတဳ Hongsawatoi; Thai: หงสาวดี, rtgs: Hongsawadi; meaning "She Who Has Swans"), is a city and the capital of the <span class="loc">Bago Region</span> in <span class="loc">Burma</span>. It is located 50 miles (80 km) north-east of <span class="loc">Yangon</span>. The Gulf of <span class="loc">Martaban</span> was colonized by <span class="loc">Mon</span> people from the Thaton Kingdom, who established Bago. In 825, the twin brothers Samala and Vimala founded <span class="loc">Pegu</span>. The earliest mention of Bago in history is by the Arab geographer ibn Khordadbeh around 850 AD. At the time, the <span class="loc">Mon</span> capital had shifted to <span class="loc">Thaton</span>. The area came under rule of the Burmese from <span class="loc">Bagan</span> in 1056. After the collapse of <span class="loc">Bagan</span> to the Mongols in 1287, the <span class="loc">Mon</span> regained their independence. In Lower <span class="loc">Burma</span>, a <span class="loc">Mon</span> dynasty established itself first at Mottama and then at Bago. During the reign of King Razadarit, Bago and Ava Kingdom were engaged in the Forty Years' War. The peaceful reign of Queen Shin Sawbu came to an end when she chose the Buddhist monk Dhammazedi (1472–1492) to succeed her. Under Dhammazedi, Bago became a centre of commerce and Theravada Buddhism.</p>
