<p><span class="loc">Wau</span> (Arabic: واو Wāw; also Wow or <span class="loc">Waw</span>) is a city in northwestern <span class="loc">South Sudan</span>, on the western bank of the <span class="loc">Jur</span> River, in <span class="loc">Wau County</span>, Western <span class="loc">Bahr</span> el Ghazal State. It lies approximately 650 kilometres (400 mi) northwest of <span class="loc">Juba</span>, the capital and largest city in that country. <span class="loc">Wau</span> was initially established as a zariba (fortified base) by slave-traders in the 19th century. During the time of condominium rule, the city became an administrative center. Burr and Collins in 1994 described <span class="loc">Wau</span>: as follows: No one has ever been “at home” in <span class="loc">Wau</span>. It is surrounded by a host of disorganized and diverse peoples . . . It was and remains a town belonging to no single ethnic group, deriving its importance only from its position as a commercial and administrative center . . . Located in the midst of the vast Nilotic plain hundreds of miles from nowhere, it was miserable under the best of circumstances . . . During the Second Sudanese Civil War, it was a garrison town of the <span class="loc">Khartoum</span>-based Sudanese Armed Forces, and was the scene of extensive fighting in the spring of 1998. Battles erupted again in the town in the spring of 2007, killing several hundred people.</p>
