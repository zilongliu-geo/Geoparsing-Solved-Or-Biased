  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Sultan is a city in <span class="loc">Snohomish County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located where the <span class="loc">Sultan River</span> flows into the <span class="loc">Skykomish</span>. The population was 4,651 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. There is an annual 3-day street fair held in <span class="date">July</span>, known as the 'Sultan Shindig'. <span class="org">Carnival</span> rides, street vendors and logging games are a popular part of the fair. As well as this, the Shindig's loggers practice in Spring with logs that they are allowed to cut into a variety of wooden sculptures. Sultan was originally settled around <span class="date">1880</span>, but not officially incorporated until <span class="date">June 28, 1905</span>. Both the <span class="loc">Sultan River</span> and the town of Sultan were named by prospectors for the chief of a Snohomish sub-tribe who lived on the <span class="loc">Skykomish River</span> in the 1870s. His name as Tsul-tad or Tseul-tud, which was anglicized by the miners into Sultan. For generations Sultan remained a small logging community. In <span class="date">1968</span>, the town was visited by more than 20,000 hippies during The Sky River Rock Festival and Lighter Than Air Fair, one of the first outdoor rock festivals. The event took place on a farm near town. The line-up included Santana, <span class="per">Grateful Dead</span>, <span class="per">Country Joe McDonald</span>, <span class="loc">Muddy Waters</span>, Buffy <span class="per">St. Marie</span>, guitarist <span class="per">John Fahey</span>, and many others. Also on hand was the young comedian <span class="per">Richard Pryor</span>.</p><br><br>
