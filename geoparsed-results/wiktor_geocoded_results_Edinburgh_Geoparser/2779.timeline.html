  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ibi</span> is a town and administrative district in <span class="loc">Taraba State</span>, <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. The town is located on the south bank of the <span class="loc">Benue</span> River, opposite the influx of the much smaller <span class="loc">Shemankar River</span>. Both the <span class="loc">Taraba River</span> and the <span class="loc">Donga River</span> flow into the <span class="loc">Benue</span> within the LGA. <span class="loc">Ibi</span> is one of the sixteen local government areas of <span class="loc">Taraba State</span>, and is governed by an elected chairman. <span class="loc">Ibi</span> was located where the traditional land trade route of eastern Igboland crossed the river trade route of the <span class="loc">Benue</span> River. It was part of the Jukon kingdom (<span class="date">1720</span>-<span class="date">1815</span>) whose capital, Kororofa, was 35 miles east (up river). After the Fulani invasion <span class="loc">Ibi</span> became part of the <span class="loc">Muri</span> Emirate (<span class="date">1817</span>-<span class="date">1892</span>). Like the rest of <span class="loc">Muri</span> it was under the French governor <span class="per">Louis Mizon</span> from 1892-1893. By <span class="date">1899</span> the <span class="org">Niger Company</span> established a trading station at <span class="loc">Ibi</span>, and by <span class="date">1901</span> telegraph service to <span class="loc">Lokoja</span> had been established. The British took control in <span class="date">1900</span> and established <span class="loc">Ibi</span> as the administrative headquarters of western <span class="loc">Muri</span>. As cotton was one of the major crops of the area, steam powered cotton gins were established in <span class="loc">Ibi</span> in <span class="date">the early 1920s</span>.</p><br><br>
