  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lismore</span> (Scottish Gaelic: <span class="loc">Lios</span> Mòr, pronounced [ʎis̪ moːɾ] possibly meaning "great enclosure", or "garden") is an island of some 2,351 hectares (9.1 sq mi) in the <span class="loc">Inner Hebrides</span> of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. The climate is damp and mild, with over 166 centimetres (65 in) of rain recorded annually. This fertile, low-lying island was once a major centre of Celtic Christianity, with a 6th-century monastery associated with Saint Moluag and later became the seat of the medieval <span class="per">Bishop of Argyll</span>. There are numerous ruined structures including a broch and two 13th-century castles. During the 19th century various new industries were introduced, including lime quarrying. During the early <span class="date">decades</span> of <span class="date">this century</span> the population exceeded 1,000 followed by a lengthy decline. Although resident numbers are <span class="date">now</span> less than 200, there was a small increase from <span class="date">2001</span> to <span class="date">2011</span>. About a third of the population were recorded as Gaelic speaking at the former date. The modern economy is largely based on farming, fishing and tourism and the largest settlement is Achnacroish. Various shipwrecks have been recorded in the vicinity.</p><br><br>
