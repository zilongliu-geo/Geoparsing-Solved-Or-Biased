<p><span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is an incorporated village municipality in the <span class="loc">Comox</span> Valley on <span class="loc">Vancouver Island</span> in British Columbia, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The village was originally named Union, British Columbia after the Union Coal Company, which was in turn named in honour of the 1871 union of British Columbia with <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The town was renamed after <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> in <span class="loc">Great Britain</span> by James Dunsmuir in 1891. Robert Dunsmuir had the town built in 1888. The Union Coal Company was begun in 1871 to exploit a coal discovery made the previous year on <span class="loc">Coal Creek</span> which flows into <span class="loc">Comox Lake</span>. By 1874 the company had built a tramway and a road to <span class="loc">Comox</span> Harbour at what is now <span class="loc">Royston</span> but after this initial work, the high cost of opening a mine proved too high for the original partners and work stopped. In 1884, the same year he received the land grant related to the <span class="loc">Esquimalt</span> and <span class="loc">Nanaimo Railway</span>, Robert Dunsmuir bought the Union Coal Company. He bought the nearby Perseverance Mine at what is now <span class="loc">Union Bay</span> in 1888 and the Baynes Sound Mine in 1881. Two slopes were open at the Union Mine by 1893. By 1897 the mine was producing 700 to 1000 tons per day, employed 600 men and supported a town of 3000. In 1946, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake demolished chimneys of houses in <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>.</p>
