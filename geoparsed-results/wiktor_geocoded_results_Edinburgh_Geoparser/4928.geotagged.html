<p><span class="loc">Antioch</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">Antioch</span> Township of <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 14,430 at the 2010 census. It is the suburb of <span class="loc">Chicago</span> that is farthest from the city. Due north of <span class="loc">Antioch</span> is <span class="loc">Kenosha County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, meaning that is not <span class="loc">Chicago</span> suburban, and the suburbs south of <span class="loc">Antioch</span> are suburbs of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. The Pottawatomi Indian Tribe, semi-nomadic hunters who lived in wigwams, inhabited <span class="loc">Antioch</span> when white men began to arrive. They fought with the British in the War of 1812 and then with the American settlers in the Blackhawk War of 1832. It was in 1832 that the American Indians began to leave the area, although arrowheads and other remnants of their history can still be found today if one knows where to look. The winding Highway 173 was once an Indian trail and Highway 83 was the <span class="loc">Muquonago</span> Trail. The first permanent white settlement in <span class="loc">Antioch</span> was the Gage Brothers' cabin on <span class="loc">Sequoit Creek</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Fox River</span>. In 1839, Hiram Buttrick built a sawmill along the creek, making <span class="loc">Antioch</span> a center of commerce. A replica of the mill has been built a few hundred feet downstream from where it once stood.</p>
