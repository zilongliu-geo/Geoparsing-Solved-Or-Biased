  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Ngoma</span>, <span class="loc">Zambia</span> is the only settlement in the south of <span class="loc">Kafue National Park</span>. It is a short way south of <span class="per">Itezhi-Tezhi</span> Dam. <span class="per">Ngoma</span> is the home of the head warden for the south half of the park, and for around 200 game wardens and their families employed by <span class="loc">ZAWA</span> (<span class="org">Zambian Wildlife Authority</span>). There is a small information centre about the local wildlife, and in the village is <span class="org">Ngoma Basic School</span>. <span class="per">Ngoma</span> lodge shut down <span class="date">many years ago</span>, when poaching killed most of the animals in the area. The numbers of animals are <span class="date">now</span> at least stable, if not increasing, thanks to the efforts of the underpaid game wardens, and the lodge may <span class="date">one day</span> re-open. <span class="per">Ngoma</span> has a limited electricity supply. This electricity is hooked up to some homes, but the main use is to power the water pump. <span class="per">Ngoma</span> has a borehole so the water does not need boiling or purifying. It can be obtained by a manual pump at any time or by taps spaced around the village when the electricity is working. The roads to <span class="per">Ngoma</span> and <span class="per">Itezhi-Tezhi</span> are awful; once they were well graded in gravel but <span class="date">now</span> they have many potholes. To add to the inevitable bumpiness there are huge swarms of tsetse flies that have very painful bites and spread sleeping sickness, and will attack at any opportunity. There is an airstrip just south of <span class="loc">Ngoma</span> to save this unpleasant journey.</p><br><br>
