<p>Fire exposes possible <span class="loc">Grand Ledge</span> meth lab. <span class="loc">Grand Ledge</span> Police Officers Chris Chester and Jason Barber responded to a report of a fire on the fifth floor of Serenity Place apartments, a senior citizen apartment complex at 216 S. Clinton Avenue, at 12:45 a.m. The officers arrived ahead of the responding fire engine and entered the building to start warning residents of the fire and assist them in evacuating. The fire was brought under control quickly, and a search of the apartment revealed equipment and materials consistent with the manufacture of methamphetamine, police said. Other similar materials were found adjacent to the site outside, officials said. <span class="loc">Grand Ledge</span> investigators interviewed the resident of the apartment and are looking for other people who may have been in the apartment at the time the fire started. State police units responded to the scene with specialized personnel and equipment to handle the hazardous materials. The scene has been turned over to state health officials to determine when displaced residents can return to the building. The <span class="loc">Red Cross</span> is assisting residents who have been displaced. This senior citizen residence in <span class="loc">Grand Ledge</span> was the scene of a criminal investigation when firefighters responding to a fire shortly after midnight discovered what appeared to be a meth lab.</p>
