  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Zamora</span> (formerly, Black's, Blacks, Black's Station, Blacks Station, and Prairie) is an unincorporated community in rural <span class="loc">Yolo County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">U.S.</span>, on Interstate 5 due west of Knights Landing. Its ZIP code is 95698 and its area code 530. It is in the northern part of the county. "<span class="loc">Zamora District</span> is bordered by County Road 10 to the north and County Road 16 to the south, County Road 85 on the west and Highway 113 on the east...In <span class="date">1879</span> <span class="loc">Zamora District</span> included the areas of <span class="loc">West Grafton</span>,the eastern portion of <span class="loc">Fairview</span> and a small strip of East grafton. The <span class="loc">Zamora District</span> encompasses Oat Valley, along Oat Creek in the northwestern part of the districtand Hungry Hollow which is in an area along the foothills west of <span class="loc">Zamora</span>." <span class="loc">Zamora</span> "was once a thriving little town with a hotel, two stores, a jail, blacksmith shops, a barbershop, a butcher shop, a medical office, a railroad depot, telegraph office, town hall, IOOF building, post office and six warehouses. There were schools and churches there, too. In <span class="date">1949</span> and 1969 modern highways rolled through cutting the heart from the town. What was left was a town with 'no services', only a rebulit IOOF building, a rebuilt town hall, the planing mill and <span class="loc">St Agnes</span> catholic Church, the school building plus a few houses. But the pulse of the community does not stop with the removal of its heart."</p><br><br>
