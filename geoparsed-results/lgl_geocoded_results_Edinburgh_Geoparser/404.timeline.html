  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Lipscomb</span> student from <span class="loc">Paris</span> devotes spring break to mission work. <span class="per">A Lipscomb</span> University student from <span class="loc">Paris</span> didn’t spend her spring break lounging on the beach or sleeping late. <span class="per">Kelsey Dunkerson</span>, <span class="per">Lipscomb</span> biology major and daughter of <span class="per">Mike</span> and Betty <span class="per">Dunkerson</span> of <span class="loc">Paris</span>, is one of 300 <span class="per">Lipscomb</span> students who traveled to 23 locations around the globe to carry out mission work during spring break <span class="date">last week</span>. <span class="per">Dunkerson</span> traveled to <span class="loc">Chicacao</span>, <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>. The team mi nistered to the Quiche Indians on the coast and hosted daily medical clinics in rural villages. Annual spring break mission trips, largely coordinated and carried out by students, are one of the various projects that earned <span class="org">Lipscomb University</span> in <span class="loc">Nashville</span> a spot on the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll With Distinction in <span class="date">2009</span>, a group of just 83 universities around the nation who have met the criteria for this national honor. Mission teams do everything from working with a <span class="per">Boys</span> and <span class="per">Girls</span> Club and conducting a vacation Bible school, to manual labor projects for <span class="org">Habitat for Humanity</span> and providing food and medical supplies, all the while outreaching and evangelizing. <span class="date">This year</span>’s participants traveled to 12 countries, including <span class="loc">Honduras</span>, <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> and <span class="loc">Guatemala</span> — and five states within the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Twelve more missions trips are in the works for <span class="date">summer</span>, involving more than 500 students in benevolent mission work in the 2008-09 school year.</p><br><br>
