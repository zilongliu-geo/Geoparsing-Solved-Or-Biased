<p>Bail set for suspect in Ravenel cocaine case. A federal judge set $250,000 bail Tuesday for a French national charged with lying during the drug investigation of former <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> state Treasurer Thomas Ravenel. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Magistrate Judge Robert Carr ruled during a detention hearing that Pascal Etcheber, 45, could be released from jail, but must have electronic monitoring, surrender his passport, undergo drug screening and maintain legal status in this country. Etcheber, 45, was arrested last week and charged with one count of lying to authorities during the investigation of Ravenel, who pleaded guilty to buying cocaine for himself and to share with friends. Ravenel completes his 10-month prison sentence Friday.</p>
