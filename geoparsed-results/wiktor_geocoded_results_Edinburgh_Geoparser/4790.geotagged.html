<p><span class="loc">Princeton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Scott County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 886 at the 2010 census. The first known settlers in Princeton Township were brothers Giles and Haswell <span class="loc">Pineo</span> in about 1836. By 1838, <span class="loc">Elizabeth City</span> – the predecessor to Princeton – had its first store, ferry across the nearby <span class="loc">Wapsipinicon</span> River, mill and distillery were in operation. The city now known as <span class="loc">Princeton</span> was platted and recorded in 1852, and the city was incorporated in 1860. Rail service to <span class="loc">Chicago</span> began in 1860. Samuel Porter was the first elected mayor in 1858, for a population of less than 500. The population has fluctuated several times through the years, and today stands at less than 900 residents. The city's mainstay businesses for many years were Farmers Savings Bank, chartered in 1908, and Boll's General Store, founded by Henry "Heinie" Boll in 1922. Farmers Savings Bank is now part of <span class="loc">Milan</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>-based Blackhawk Bank &amp; Trust, while Boll's Store continued until 1997. Boll's storefront is now the Community Center. Education of the area’s children started in a log cabin, moved to a converted barn and then, in 1866, to a stone building. <span class="loc">Princeton</span> became part of the North Scott Community School District in 1956, and is now served by Virgil Grissom Elementary School, which opened in 1967.</p>
