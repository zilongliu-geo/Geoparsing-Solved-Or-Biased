<p>Phoenix (/ˈfiːnɪks/) is the capital, and largest city, of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. With 1,445,632 people (as of the 2010 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census), Phoenix is the most populous state capital in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, as well as the sixth most populous city nationwide. Phoenix is the anchor of the <span class="loc">Phoenix metropolitan</span> area, also known as the Valley of the Sun, which in turn is a part of the Salt River Valley. The city is the 13th largest metro area by population in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, with approximately 4.3 million people in 2010. In addition, Phoenix is the county seat of <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span> and is one of the largest cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span> by land area. Settled in 1867 as an agricultural community near the confluence of the Salt and Gila Rivers, Phoenix incorporated as a city in 1881. Located in the northeastern reaches of the <span class="loc">Sonoran Desert</span>, Phoenix has a subtropical desert climate. Despite this, its canal system led to a thriving farming community, many of the original crops remaining important parts of the Phoenix economy for decades, such as alfalfa, cotton, citrus and hay (which was important for the cattle industry). In fact, the "Five C's" (Cotton, Cattle, Citrus, Climate, and Copper), remained the driving forces of Phoenix's economy until after World War II, when high tech industries began to move into the valley.</p>
