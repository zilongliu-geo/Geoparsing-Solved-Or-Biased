<p><span class="loc">Longmen</span> (simplified Chinese: 龙门镇; traditional Chinese: 龍門鎮; pinyin: Lóngmén Zhèn) is a town of 7000 in <span class="loc">northwestern Zhejiang province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, located 17 kilometres (11 mi) south of the <span class="loc">city of Fuyang</span>, which administers it. The town lies south of the <span class="loc">Fuchun</span> River, at the foothills of the Xianxia Range, and oversees 11 administrative villages. Over 90% of its people are surnamed Sun. According to tradition, the Suns of <span class="loc">Longmen</span> are descendants of the third century warlord Sun Quan, who became emperor of the Three Kingdoms state of Wu. Sun Quan himself is said to have been born a short distance from <span class="loc">Longmen</span>, on an islet in the <span class="loc">Fuchun</span> River. A 1939 genealogy traces their lineage continuously back twenty six generations to a Song Dynasty official. In the past, the Suns of <span class="loc">Longmen</span> were divided into ten sub-lineages and held joint grand ceremonies honouring their ancestors every spring and autumn, but this practice stopped after 1949. Fifty years ago there were some sixty heritage buildings in <span class="loc">Longmen</span>, and about half of those are still standing today. Among them are ancestral halls, homes, pagodas and memorial arches - most of which have a history of over three hundred years. These structures are good examples of classical southern architecture and feature intricate wood carvings from <span class="loc">Zhejiang</span> folklore. The favourite decorative motifs used are from Three Kingdoms stories popular since the Song Dynasty. ` The local theatrical performances, called the "Bamboo Horse Dance" are unique for their portrayal of Sun Quan as a hero. In traditional Three Kingdoms folklore, Sun Quan is normally seen as an ambivalent and often frustrated leader who is time and again bested by Liu Bei and his cunning strategist Zhuge Liang. At <span class="loc">Longmen</span>, the favourite plays are "Burning <span class="loc">Red Cliffs</span>", showing Sun Quan's defeat of <span class="loc">Cao Cao</span> at the Battle of <span class="loc">Red Cliffs</span> and "Burning the Linked Encampments", showing Sun Quan's defeat of Liu Bei at the Battle of <span class="loc">Yiling</span>.</p>
