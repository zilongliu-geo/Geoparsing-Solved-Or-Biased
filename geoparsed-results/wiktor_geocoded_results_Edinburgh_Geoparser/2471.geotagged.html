<p><span class="loc">Montenegro</span> (/ˌmɒntᵻˈneɪɡroʊ/ MON-tən-AYG-roh or /ˌmɒntᵻˈniːɡroʊ/ MON-tən-EEG-roh or /ˌmɒntᵻˈnɛɡroʊ/ MON-tən-EG-roh; Montenegrin: <span class="loc">Crna Gora</span> / Црна Гора [t͡sr̩̂ːnaː ɡɔ̌ra], meaning "<span class="loc">Black Mountain</span>") is a sovereign state in Southeastern <span class="loc">Europe</span>. It has a coast on the <span class="loc">Adriatic Sea</span> to the south-west and is bordered by <span class="loc">Croatia</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Bosnia and Herzegovina</span> to the northwest, <span class="loc">Serbia</span> to the northeast, and <span class="loc">Albania</span> to the south-east. Its capital and largest city is <span class="loc">Podgorica</span>, while <span class="loc">Cetinje</span> is designated as the Prijestonica, meaning the former Royal Capital City. In the 9th century, there were three principalities on the territory of <span class="loc">Montenegro</span>: <span class="loc">Duklja</span>, roughly corresponding to the southern half, Travunia, the west, and Rascia, the north. In 1042, archon Stefan Vojislav led a revolt that resulted in the independence of <span class="loc">Duklja</span> and the establishment of the Vojislavljević dynasty. <span class="loc">Duklja</span> reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, Mihailo (1046–81), and his grandson <span class="loc">Bodin</span> (1081–1101). By the 13th century, Zeta had replaced <span class="loc">Duklja</span> when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern <span class="loc">Montenegro</span> (Zeta) came under the rule of the Balšić noble family, then the Crnojević noble family, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as <span class="loc">Crna Gora</span> (Venetian: monte negro). Large portions fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1496 to 1878 (Between 1454 (For <span class="loc">Niksic</span>) and 1878 for Old Herzegovina). Parts were controlled by Venice and First French Empire and Austria-Hungary, its successors. From 1515 until 1851 the prince-bishops (vladikas) of <span class="loc">Cetinje</span> were the rulers. The House of Petrović-Njegoš ruled until 1918. From 1918, it was a part of <span class="loc">Yugoslavia</span>. On the basis of an independence referendum held on 21 May 2006, <span class="loc">Montenegro</span> declared independence on 3 June of that year.</p>
