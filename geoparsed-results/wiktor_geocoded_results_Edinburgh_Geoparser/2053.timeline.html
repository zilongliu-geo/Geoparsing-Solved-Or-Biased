  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Richland</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Keokuk County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 584 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Richland</span> is located at 41°11′6″N 91°59′38″W (41.184899, -91.993871). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.77 square miles (1.99 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Richland</span> had its own elementary and secondary school, which was constructed in <span class="date">the 1920s</span>. In <span class="date">1959</span>, after much local controversy, <span class="loc">Richland</span> was incorporated into the Pekin Community School System. The high schools in <span class="loc">Richland</span>, <span class="loc">Ollie</span>, <span class="loc">Packwood</span>, and <span class="loc">Farson</span> were closed, although the buildings associated with them continued to be used for elementary and junior high school students. All the high school students from these four towns, along with all the rural areas which had been associated with these separate school systems, were then educated at a new building located near Pekin. In <span class="date">1970</span>, a further consolidation eliminated the local junior high schools and replaced them with a consolidated middle school in <span class="loc">Packwood</span>: all students in grades six through eight began to go to <span class="loc">Packwood</span>, and, thereafter, the <span class="loc">Richland</span> school building was used only for elementary students (kindergarten through fifth grade) from <span class="loc">Richland</span> and its associated rural areas, including <span class="loc">Rubio</span>. Elementary students from elsewhere in the district went to <span class="loc">Ollie</span>, and the <span class="loc">Farson</span> school was closed. In this consolidation, all middle school students went to <span class="loc">Packwood</span>.</p><br><br>
