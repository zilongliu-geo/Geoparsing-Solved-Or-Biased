<p><span class="loc">Newport</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Cocke County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,945 at the 2010 census, down from 7,242 at the 2000 census. The estimated population in 2014 was 6,880. It is located along the <span class="loc">Pigeon River</span>. The Great Indian Warpath passed through what is now <span class="loc">Newport</span> en route to the ancient <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> hunting grounds of northeastern <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The Warpath crossed the <span class="loc">Pigeon River</span> at a point approximately 0.2 miles (0.3 km) east of the McSween Memorial Bridge (US-321), in an area where the river is normally low enough to walk across. The first European traders to the area, arriving in the mid-18th century, called this point along the <span class="loc">Pigeon River</span> the "War Ford". During the American Revolution, the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> aligned themselves with the British, and launched sporadic attacks against early Euro-American settlers in the Holston valley. In the waning months of the conflict in 1782, a detachment led by Gen. Charles McDowell of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> crossed the mountains into what is now <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> to join up with Col. <span class="loc">John Sevier</span>'s local forces and initiate an aggressive campaign against the hostile <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>. In August of that year, <span class="loc">Sevier</span> crossed the Pigeon at War Ford, attacking and killing several <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> camped along the river's banks. This assault was one of the final engagements of the Revolution.</p>
