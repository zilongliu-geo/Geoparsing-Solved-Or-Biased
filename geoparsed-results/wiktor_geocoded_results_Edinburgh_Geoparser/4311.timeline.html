  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is a small unincorporated community located within Maurice River Township in <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> contains only a few hundred households, concentrated primarily on Route 49 and Hesstown/Port Elizabeth-Cumberland Road. The village is bordered by <span class="loc">Millville</span> and <span class="loc">Port Elizabeth</span> in <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span> and <span class="loc">Estell</span> Manor in <span class="loc">Atlantic County</span>. <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is almost exclusively a residential and rural community with only two retail storefronts and several cottage industries. Most residents commute to nearby <span class="loc">Millville</span>, <span class="loc">Vineland</span>, <span class="loc">Bridgeton</span>, or one of the county's three prisons for employment. The greater part of <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is <span class="org">Peaslee Wildlife Management Area</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>'s second-largest game reserve. <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is also the home to <span class="org">Cumberland United Methodist Church</span> and graveyard, a station of the state of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Department of Roads and Highways, and the <span class="org">Cumberland Volunteer Fire Company</span>. Like all of the small communities located within Maurice River Township, Cumberland's exact boundaries are unspecified. It does not possess its own ZIP code and is processes it mail through the 08332 <span class="org">Millville United States Post Office</span>. As a result, it is frequently omitted from maps. For this reason, and due to its remote rural location and lack of retail businesses, many lifelong residents of <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span> are unaware of the existence of the village of <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>. In informal interview with the Maurice River Township Municipal Vital Statistics and Assessors offices in <span class="date">2008</span>, it was determined that the exact population of <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is unknown because the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau does not delineate the populations of the various towns within Maurice River Township. The MRT Assessor's office also confirmed the precise number of homes in <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is unknown. Extensive research of historical deeds and other documents located at the <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span> <span class="loc">Court House</span> dating back several hundred <span class="date">years</span> would be necessary in order to establish the exact boundaries of the town. The Assessor's office indicated that the <span class="org">Cumberland Volunteer Fire Company</span> services district F-04, which includes <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> and portions of <span class="loc">Milmay</span>. Based on the number of houses located in that district, the assessor estimated the number of households in <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is 200.</p><br><br>
