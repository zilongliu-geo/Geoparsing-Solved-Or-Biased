<p><span class="loc">Grafton</span> is a ghost town, just south of <span class="loc">Zion National Park</span> in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Said to be the most photographed ghost town in the West, it has been featured as a location in several films, including 1929's In Old Arizona—the first talkie filmed outdoors—and the classic Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The nearest inhabited town is <span class="loc">Rockville</span>. The site was first settled in December 1859 as part of a southern <span class="loc">Utah</span> cotton-growing project ordered by Brigham Young (see <span class="loc">Utah</span>'s Dixie). A group from Virgin led by Nathan Tenney established a new settlement they called Wheeler. Wheeler didn't last long; it was largely destroyed on the night of January 8, 1862 by a weeks-long flood of the <span class="loc">Virgin River</span>, part of the Great Flood of 1862. The rebuilt town, about a mile upriver, was named New <span class="loc">Grafton</span>, after <span class="loc">Grafton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The town grew quickly in its first few years. There were some 28 families by 1864, each farming about an acre (0.4 hectare) of land. The community also dug irrigation canals and planted orchards, some of which still exist. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> was briefly the county seat of <span class="loc">Kane County</span>, from January 1866 to January 12, 1867, but changes to county boundaries in 1882 placed it in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>.</p>
