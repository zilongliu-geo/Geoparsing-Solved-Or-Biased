  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Sewer line repaired after spill into <span class="loc">Flat Creek</span> tributary. A wastewater overflow within the Gainesville sewer system caused about 5,400 gallons to flow into a tributary of <span class="loc">Flat Creek</span> this afternoon. According to the <span class="org">Gainesville Public Utilities</span> department, the spill was noticed at about 1:45 p.m. by an attendant at the Orchard Brook apartments in the <span class="date">2900</span> block of McEver Road. Utility workers found debris blocking a sewer line and repaired the problem in about an hour. After cleaning up the area, they posted warning signs and contacted <span class="org">Hall County Environmental Health</span> and the <span class="org">Georgia Environmental Protection Division</span>. The spill is not considered major, but the EPD has a zero-tolerance policy for wastewater overflows that affect <span class="loc">Lake Lanier</span>'s watershed. For more information, contact <span class="per">Horace Gee</span>, <span class="org">Gainesville Environmental Services</span> administrator, at 770-532-7462.</p><br><br>
