<p>Alexandria, also called The <span class="loc">City of Alexandria</span>, is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 139,966, and in 2014, the population was estimated to be 150,575. Located along the western bank of the <span class="loc">Potomac River</span>, Alexandria is approximately 7 miles (11 km) south of downtown <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C</span>. Like the rest of Northern Virginia, as well as Central Maryland, modern Alexandria has been shaped by its proximity to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> capital. It is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> military, or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the federal government. One of Alexandria's largest employers is the U.S. Department of Defense. Another is the Institute for Defense Analyses. In 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office moved to Alexandria. The historic center of Alexandria is known as <span class="loc">Old Town</span>. With its concentration of boutiques, restaurants, antique shops and theaters, it is a major draw for tourists. Like <span class="loc">Old Town</span>, many Alexandria neighborhoods are compact, walkable, high-income suburbs of <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C</span>. It is the 7th largest and highest-income independent city in Virginia.</p>
