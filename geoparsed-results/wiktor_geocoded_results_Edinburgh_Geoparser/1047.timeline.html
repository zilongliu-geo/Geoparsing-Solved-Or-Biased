  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Marion</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,042 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Marion County</span>. It is named for <span class="per">Francis Marion</span>, a Brigadier General from <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> in the American Revolutionary War. The <span class="org">Marion High School</span>, <span class="loc">Marion County</span> <span class="loc">Court House</span>, <span class="org">Marion County Library</span>, <span class="org">Marion County Museum</span> and <span class="per">Marion</span> Historic District are listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. Some <span class="date">sixty years</span> after the first permanent settlement in <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, a group of English settlers sent out by <span class="org">the Lords</span> Proprietors landed in <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> and moved up the <span class="loc">Pee Dee River</span> to the junction of the <span class="loc">Little Pee Dee River</span> about half way between <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> and the present town of <span class="per">Marion</span>. Among these families were <span class="per">Brittons, Davis</span>, <span class="per">Flaglers, Giles</span>, <span class="per">Graves</span> and <span class="per">Tyler</span>. At about the same time, and maybe on the same ship from <span class="loc">England</span>, came <span class="per">Captain John Godbold</span>, a retired English sea captain. He moved farther up the Big <span class="loc">Pee Dee</span> and settled on <span class="loc">Catfish Creek</span>. The creek is southwest of and very near to the present city limits of <span class="per">Marion</span>.</p><br><br>
