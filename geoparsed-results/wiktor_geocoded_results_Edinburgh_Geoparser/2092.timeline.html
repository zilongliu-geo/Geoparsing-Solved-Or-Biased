  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. As of <span class="date">2010</span>, the population was 32,428. The county seat is <span class="org">Madison</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was formed in <span class="date">1811</span>. It was named for <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span>, principal draftsman of the Northwest <span class="per">Ordinance</span> and <span class="per">President</span> of the <span class="loc">United States</span> from <span class="date">1801</span> through <span class="date">1809</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was one of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>'s first counties and many important early Hoosiers came from <span class="org">Madison</span>, including <span class="per">William Hendricks</span>. Throughout the early history of the state, <span class="org">Madison</span> was one of the leading cities competing with <span class="loc">Vincennes</span> and later <span class="loc">New Albany</span> to be the largest city in the state. The county fell into economic decline after the American Civil War, as industry began to shift from southern <span class="loc">Indiana</span> to the northern part of the state. On the <span class="date">evening of May 20, 2009</span> the county courthouse caught fire. The fire began in the steeple of the courthouse, which was under reconstruction for <span class="org">Madison</span>'s bicentenary. The roof of the dome had just been painted gold. Fire departments from across southern <span class="loc">Indiana</span> and northern <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> arrived to put out the fire which burned for several hours, destroyed much of the inside of the building and the county records. The fire forced the evacuation of the nearby county jail, and effectively shut down the downtown area of the city. It was later determined the fire was accidentally started by workers who were welding on the metal roof dome.</p><br><br>
