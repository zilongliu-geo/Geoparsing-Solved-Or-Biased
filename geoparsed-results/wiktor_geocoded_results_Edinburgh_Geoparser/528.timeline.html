  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Alexandria</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Campbell County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Along with <span class="loc">Newport</span>, it is one of the dual seats of the county. The population was 8,477 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is believed that the area that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Alexandria</span> was first settled by <span class="per">Frank Spilman</span> and his family c.â€‰<span class="date">1793</span>. The <span class="per">Spilman</span> family was from King <span class="loc">George County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, and they may have named their settlement after <span class="loc">Alexandria</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. The family had begun developing and selling lots in the settlement by <span class="date">1819</span>, the year the first post office was established. On <span class="date">February 22, 1834</span>, <span class="loc">Alexandria</span> was formally established by an act of the state assembly. When the <span class="org">Kentucky General Assembly</span> formed <span class="loc">Kenton County</span> from part of <span class="loc">Campbell County</span> in <span class="date">1840</span>, they moved Campbell's county seat from <span class="loc">Newport</span> to <span class="loc">Alexandria</span>, which was closer to the center of the redrawn county. The citizens of <span class="loc">Alexandria</span> quickly constructed a county courthouse but, because the majority of the county's population lived in <span class="loc">Newport</span>, the move was not a popular one and it took a court order and a visit from the sheriff to get the county clerk to move.</p><br><br>
