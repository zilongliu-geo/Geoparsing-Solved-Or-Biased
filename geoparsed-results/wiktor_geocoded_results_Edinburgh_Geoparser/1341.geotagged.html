<p><span class="loc">Lake County</span> is a county in the south-central region of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 7,895. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Lakeview. The county is named for the many lakes found within its boundaries, including <span class="loc">Lake Abert</span>, Summer Lake, <span class="loc">Hart Lake</span>, and <span class="loc">Goose Lake</span>. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> is in the high desert region known as the Oregon Outback, on the northwestern edge of the <span class="loc">Great Basin</span>. The county is generally divided between the communities around Lakeview and Paisley to the south and the communities around Christmas Valley, Fort Rock, and <span class="loc">Silver Lake</span> to the north. Its economy consists largely of agriculture and natural resource management and extraction. It is home to many large cattle ranches, hay farms, and timber holdings (both public and private), as well as several frontier towns and early 20th-century homesteads. Although lumber was once a primary economic driver in <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, today only one mill remains, at Lakeview. Pre-Clovis era coprolites found in the Paisley Caves in northern <span class="loc">Lake County</span> in 2007 have been radiocarbon dated to 14,300 calendar years before present. DNA extracted from these human remains bears certain genetic markers found only in Native American populations. Luther Cressman found prehistoric artifacts in the Fort Rock Caves of northern <span class="loc">Lake County</span> in 1938, including basketry, stone tools, and a cache of woven sagebrush bark sandals which have been dated to more than 10,000 years ago.</p>
