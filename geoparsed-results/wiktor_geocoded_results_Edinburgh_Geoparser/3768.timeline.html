  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> is a hamlet located in the towns of <span class="loc">Pittstown</span> and <span class="loc">Schaghticoke</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. It was named for its settler, <span class="per">William Johnson</span>. <span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> is considered a "railroad town" due to the importance of the railroad in the history of the area; however, it was an important industrial area even before the coming of railroad. Due to its close proximity to the <span class="loc">Hoosic</span> River, the largest estuary of the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>, many factories sprung up along the river banks: flour, grist and lumber mills; axe factories; and other types of industry. The Johnsonville Axe Factory was once the largest axe factory in the world. The coming of the railroad in <span class="date">1830</span> made it much easier for these factories to market and transport their products, and contributed to the industrial growth of the hamlet. Although no passenger trains stop in <span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> anymore, the <span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">Maine Railroad</span>'s mainline continues to run through <span class="loc">Johnsonville</span>, transporting freight between <span class="loc">New England</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span>. "The B&amp;M" is <span class="date">now</span> owned by Pan Am Railways. The station house has long since been closed and <span class="date">today</span> is a multi-unit apartment dwelling.</p><br><br>
