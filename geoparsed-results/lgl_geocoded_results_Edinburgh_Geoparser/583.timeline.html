  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Alleged assault victim lives with man's ex-wife. The man who claims that former Epsom police chief <span class="per">Henry Farrin</span> assaulted him is the roommate of <span class="per">Farrin</span>'s former wife. <span class="per">Farrin</span>, 43, was arrested <span class="date">March 11</span> on a charge of simple assault for allegedly attacking <span class="per">Howard Brown</span>, 27, in the restroom of the American Legion Post 31 in <span class="loc">Penacook</span>. In a stalking petition filed with <span class="org">Concord District Court</span>, Brown wrote that <span class="per">Farrin</span> choked him and lifted him off his feet. When the charges were first publicized, neither the police nor <span class="per">Farrin</span>'s attorney, <span class="per">Tony Soltani</span>, would say what the connection was between the two men. Since then, <span class="per">Brown</span> has told the Monitor that he is a friend of <span class="per">Farrin</span>'s ex-wife. "That's what I think his beef is with me," <span class="per">Brown</span> said. <span class="per">Brown</span> said he became friends with <span class="per">Farrin</span>'s former wife when he lived in an apartment next to the one where she was staying while going through her divorce. Brown later moved to a two-bedroom apartment and told <span class="per">Farrin</span>'s ex-wife that she could rent a room from him if she needed a place to stay. "I never even sneezed in this guy's direction my entire life," <span class="per">Brown</span> said. According to Brown's account, Brown, <span class="per">Farrin</span> and <span class="per">Farrin</span>'s ex-wife were all at the <span class="loc">American Legion</span>, with separate groups of friends, on the <span class="date">night of March 6</span>. Brown is not a member of the Legion, but he said he came with a colleague who is a member. <span class="per">Brown</span> said he went to the bathroom, and <span class="per">Farrin</span> walked in after him. As Brown was about to leave the bathroom, <span class="per">Farrin</span> started speaking to him. "All of a sudden I hear the guy say something: 'How does it feel to be a chump?' " <span class="per">Brown</span> said. " (I said) 'Excuse me? If anyone's a chump, it's you.' " <span class="per">Brown</span> said <span class="per">Farrin</span> walked toward him and asked Brown to repeat himself, which he did. "He instantly looks at me, pins me up against a wall, picks me up off my feet," <span class="per">Brown</span> said. <span class="per">Brown</span> said he knew <span class="per">Farrin</span> was a former police officer, so he did not hit him back, although he did insult <span class="per">Farrin</span> verbally. "I never touched him," <span class="per">Brown</span> said. At that point, <span class="per">Brown</span> said, a woman standing outside the door heard the scuffle and opened the door enough to see Brown pinned up against the wall. She called for help, and several men rushed into the bathroom and separated <span class="per">Farrin</span> and <span class="per">Brown</span>. <span class="per">Brown</span> said he decided to file for a restraining order and press charges with the police because he was scared <span class="per">Farrin</span> would <span class="date">one day</span> hurt him or someone else. "He's an ex-chief of a police department," <span class="per">Brown</span> said. "What's he doing grabbing a guy in a men's room? He called me a chump." <span class="per">Soltani</span> said he plans to bring witnesses to contradict Brown's account and will try to discredit him.</p><br><br>
