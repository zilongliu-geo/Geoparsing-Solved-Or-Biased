  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Colombo</span> (Sinhala: කොළඹ, pronounced [ˈkəlɐmbɞ]; <span class="loc">Tamil</span>: கொழும்பு) is the commercial capital and largest city of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>.

It is located on the west coast of the island and adjacent to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, the legislative capital of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>. <span class="loc">Colombo</span> is often referred to as the capital since Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is within the urban area of, and a satellite city of, <span class="loc">Colombo</span>.

It was the legislative capital of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> until <span class="date">1982</span>. Due to its large harbour and its strategic position along the East-West sea trade routes, <span class="loc">Colombo</span> was known to ancient traders <span class="date">2,000 years ago</span>. It was made the capital of the island when <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> was ceded to the British Empire in <span class="date">1815</span>, and its status as capital was retained when the nation became independent in <span class="date">1948</span>. In <span class="date">1978</span>, when administrative functions were moved to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, <span class="loc">Colombo</span> was designated as the commercial capital of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>.</p><br><br>
