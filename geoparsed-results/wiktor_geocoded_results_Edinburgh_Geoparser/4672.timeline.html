  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bagol</span> is a village located in the Desuri tehsil in the <span class="loc">Pali district</span> of Rajasthan, <span class="loc">India</span>. It was established by Keshu <span class="per">Das</span> and <span class="per">Bheek</span> <span class="loc">Singh</span>. It is located near Sadri town on state highway SH 62 between <span class="per">Ganthi</span> and <span class="per">Magartalav-Kolar</span>, in a valley on the western side of the Aravalli Range. <span class="loc">Bagol</span> is easily accessed by road from <span class="per">Jojawar</span> and <span class="per">Khinwara</span> to <span class="loc">Desuri</span>. <span class="loc">Falna</span>, Rani, <span class="loc">Somesar</span>, phulad and <span class="loc">Marwar</span> Junction are the nearest railway stations to reach <span class="loc">Bagol</span>. Around <span class="date">1910</span>, <span class="loc">Bagol</span> initially was the only Railway station on proposed Udaipurâ€“Fulad Railway line by <span class="loc">Bombay</span>, <span class="loc">Baroda</span> and Central <span class="loc">India</span> Railway (BB&amp;CI). Unfortunately due to some Government planning the work of extending the railway line via <span class="loc">Bagol</span> was stopped. The interesting fact is that the railway building still exists in <span class="loc">Bagol</span> which is <span class="date">now</span> under Forest Department. Shri Chintamani Parshvanath Temple in <span class="loc">Bagol</span> is one of the special Jain temple famous for its ancient and historical sculpture of Chintamani Parshwanath. The speciality of this murthi (idol) is that if it is closely watched it may appear to be a common statue but this statue includes many such features as not contained by any other idol. The most prominent and obvious variation of the statue is that it is enhanced by stand of Shesh Nag on each of its shoulders. In general an idol includes only one snake placed overhead.</p><br><br>
