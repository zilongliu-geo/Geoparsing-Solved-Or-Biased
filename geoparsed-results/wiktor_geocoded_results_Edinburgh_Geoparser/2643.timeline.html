  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Douglas (Manx: Doolish) is the capital and largest town of the <span class="loc">Isle of Man</span>, with a population of 27,938 people (<span class="date">2011</span>). It is located at the mouth of the <span class="loc">River Douglas</span>, and on a sweeping bay of two miles. The <span class="loc">River Douglas</span> forms part of the town's harbour and main commercial port. Douglas was a small settlement until rapid growth occurred as a result of links with the English port of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> in the 18th century. Further population growth came in <span class="date">the following century</span>, resulting during the 1860s in a staged transfer of the High Courts, the Lieutenant Governor's residence, and finally the seat of the legislature, <span class="loc">Tynwald</span>, to Douglas from the ancient capital, <span class="loc">Castletown</span>. The town serves as the Island's main hub for business, finance, legal services, shipping, transport, shopping, and entertainment. The annual <span class="loc">Isle of Man TT</span> motorcycle races start and finish in Douglas. In the absence of any archaeological data, it is possible that the origins of the town may be revealed by analysis of the original street and plot pattern. The discovery of a bronze weapon in central Douglas, and the large Ballaquayle <span class="org">Viking</span> treasure hoard on the outskirts, both in the 1890s, hint at the early importance of the site <span class="date">now</span> occupied by Douglas. Scholars agree that the name of the town derives from Early Celtic 'Duboglassio' meaning 'black river'. Douglas is twice referred to in the Monastic '<span class="org">Chronicle of the Kings</span> of Man and the Isles'; first in <span class="date">1192</span>, when the monks of St Mary's Abbey at Rushen, were transferred there for a four-year stay, then again in <span class="date">1313</span>, when Robert (Bruce), <span class="per">King of Scotland</span>, spent the night at the 'monastery of Duglas' on his way to seize <span class="loc">Castle Rushen</span>. These may be references to the site of the later Nunnery, a little upstream from the port.</p><br><br>
