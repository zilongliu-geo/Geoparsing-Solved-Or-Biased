  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Trenton is a city in <span class="loc">Gibson County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The population was 4,264 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Gibson County</span>, and its third largest city. Trenton is located at 35°58′25″N 88°56′30″W (35.973627, -88.941569). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.6 square miles (15 km2), of which 5.5 square miles (14 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (0.90%) is water. Trenton is most famous for its collection of rare antique porcelain veilleuses, donated by the late <span class="per">Dr. Frederick C. Freed</span> in <span class="date">1955</span>. The teapots are unique because the candle's glow illuminates the pot's exterior, thus serving as a night light. None of the 525 teapots in this collection are alike, and some are designed as palaces or people in unique still-life castings. The town celebrates its collection with an annual "Teapot Festival" held each spring since <span class="date">1981</span>. Trenton is also known for its unusual speed limit of 31 miles per hour (50 km/h), established by the city in <span class="date">the 1950s</span> and posted by signs throughout the town.</p><br><br>
