<p>Duncan is a village in <span class="loc">Platte County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 351 at the 2010 census. The transcontinental railroad reached the site of Duncan in 1866. Among the first settlers in the area were Polish and Swiss immigrants. In June 1869, the post office of <span class="loc">Cherry Hill</span> was established on the site. In October 1871, the townsite of Jackson was laid out by officials of the Union Pacific Railroad. Jackson was chosen in 1879 as the southern terminus of the <span class="loc">Omaha</span>, <span class="loc">Niobrara</span>, and Black Hills Railroad, a Union Pacific subsidiary, purportedly because Jay Gould was angry at <span class="loc">Columbus</span> for promoting a rival railroad in the region. In 1880, the settlement's name was changed to Duncan, owing to the existence of another Jackson in <span class="loc">Dakota County</span>. The new name honored General Wood B. Duncan, a prominent onetime local resident. In the following year, an ice jam destroyed the <span class="loc">Omaha</span>, <span class="loc">Niobrara</span>, and Black Hills Railroad bridge across the <span class="loc">Loup River</span>; the line was later moved to branch off the main line of the Union Pacific at <span class="loc">Columbus</span>.</p>
