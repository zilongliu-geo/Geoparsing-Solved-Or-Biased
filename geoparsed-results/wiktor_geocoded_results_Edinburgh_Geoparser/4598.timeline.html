  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bradford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Orange County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,797 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Bradford</span> is located on the county's eastern border, bordering both the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, and is a commercial center for some of its surrounding towns. The first settler was <span class="per">John Hosmer</span> in <span class="date">1765</span>. Originally called Waits Town or <span class="loc">Waits River</span> Town after Joseph Wait, it was changed to <span class="loc">Mooretown</span> when 3,000 acres (1200 hectares) were granted on <span class="date">May 3, 1770</span> by <span class="loc">New York</span> patent to Sir <span class="per">Henry Moore</span>, 1st Baronet, who in turn conveyed them to 30 settlers. The remainder of the land was appropriated by squatters. In <span class="date">1788</span>, the name was changed by the <span class="org">Vermont General Assembly</span> to <span class="loc">Bradford</span>. Although the chief occupation of the town was farming, mills developed at falls on the <span class="loc">Waits River</span>. On <span class="date">October 10, 1848</span>, the <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> &amp; Passumpsic Rivers Railroad formally opened to <span class="loc">Bradford</span>. By <span class="date">1859</span>, when the town's population was 1,723, industries included a foundry and machine shop, two gristmills, three sawmills, a paper mill and whetstone factory. <span class="loc">Bradford</span> also manufactured farm implements, wooden ware and tinware.</p><br><br>
