  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dera</span> is one of the woredas in the <span class="loc">Amhara Region</span> of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. Part of the Debub Gondar Zone, <span class="loc">Dera</span> is bordered on the south by the <span class="loc">Abbay</span> River which separates it from the Mirab Gojjam Zone, on the west by <span class="loc">Lake Tana</span>, on the north by <span class="loc">Fogera</span>, on the northeast by Misraq Este, and on the east by Mirab Este. Towns in <span class="loc">Dera</span> include <span class="loc">Amba Same</span>, <span class="loc">Arb Gebeya</span>, <span class="loc">Hamusit</span>, and Qorata. Points of interest include the Tis Issat falls of the <span class="loc">Abbay</span>, and the old Portuguese bridge over the same river at <span class="loc">Alata</span>. A survey of the land in this woreda shows that 46% is arable or cultivable, 6% pasture, 1% forest or shrubland, 25% covered with water and the remaining 25.9% is considered degraded or other. Teff, corn, sorghum, cotton and sesame are important cash crops. The woreda of <span class="loc">Dera</span> was heavily affected by the flash floods in <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span> that started <span class="date">6 September</span> and receded by <span class="date">26 September 2006</span>. The heavy rain caused <span class="loc">Lake Tana</span> to overflow its banks, making thousands of people homeless. "Thousands of heads of cattle, whole silos of grain, and significant tracts of grazing and farmland have been washed away," according to <span class="loc">IRIN</span>.</p><br><br>
