  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Alexandra</span>, informally abbreviated to Alex, is a township located in the <span class="loc">Gauteng province</span> of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It forms part of the <span class="loc">city of Johannesburg</span> and is located near the upper-class suburb of <span class="loc">Sandton</span>. <span class="per">Alexandra</span> is bounded by <span class="loc">Wynberg</span> on the west, <span class="per">Marlboro</span> and <span class="per">Kelvin</span> on the north, <span class="loc">Kew</span>, <span class="loc">Lombardy West</span> and <span class="loc">Lombardy East</span> on the south. It is commonly known as "Gomorrah" among local residents. <span class="per">Alexandra</span> is one of the poorest urban areas in the country. <span class="per">Alexandra</span> is situated on the banks of the <span class="loc">Jukskei</span> River. In addition to its original, reasonably well-built houses, it also has a large number (estimated at more than 20,000) of informal dwellings or "shacks". <span class="per">Alexandra</span> was established in <span class="date">1912</span>, on land originally owned by a farmer, a <span class="per">Mr Papenfus</span>, who tried to establish a white residential township there, naming it after his wife, <span class="per">Alexandra</span>. However, because it was (at the time) a considerable distance from the center of <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span>, this was not a great success. Consequently, in <span class="date">1912</span>, <span class="per">Alexandra</span> was proclaimed as a so-called "native township". Because the township was proclaimed before the South African <span class="date">1913</span> Land Act, it was one of the few urban areas in the country where black people could own land under a freehold title.</p><br><br>
