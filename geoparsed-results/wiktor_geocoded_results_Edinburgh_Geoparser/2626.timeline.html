  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alexandra is a town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Located at the junction of the Goulburn Valley Highway (B340) and Maroondah Highway (B360), 26 kilometres west of <span class="loc">Eildon</span>, in the Shire of <span class="loc">Murrindindi</span> local government area. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, Alexandra had a population of 2,656. The town was settled in the late 1860s, with a Post Office opening on <span class="date">15 March 1867</span> (known until <span class="date">24 April 1867</span>) as <span class="loc">Redgate</span>. The town was originally known as <span class="loc">Redgate</span>, or Red Gate Diggings. The current name either derives from Alexandra of <span class="loc">Denmark</span> when the shire was given a statue of her, or from three men named <span class="per">Alexander</span> (Alesander, <span class="per">McGregor, Alexander Don</span>, and <span class="per">Alexander Luckie</span>) who discovered gold in the area in <span class="date">1866</span>. The railway to Alexandra arrived as a branch line of the <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> railway line in <span class="date">1909</span>, and closed on <span class="date">18 November 1978</span>. In <span class="date">2012</span>, the closed rail line was used as part of the route for the 134 km long Great Victorian Rail Trail. The <span class="loc">Rubicon</span> Tramway connected Alexandra with the village of <span class="loc">Rubicon</span>, at the junction of the <span class="loc">Rubicon</span> and <span class="loc">Royston Rivers</span>.</p><br><br>
