<p>Norfolk /ˈnɒrfɒrk/ or /ˈnɒrfoʊk/ is a city in <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, 113 miles northwest of <span class="loc">Omaha</span> and 83 miles west of <span class="loc">Sioux City</span> at the intersection of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Routes 81 and 275. The population was 24,210 at the 2010 census, making it the ninth-largest city in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. It is the principal city of the Norfolk Micropolitan Statistical Area. In late 1865 three scouts were sent from a German Lutheran settlement near <span class="loc">Ixonia</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, to find productive, inexpensive farmland that could be claimed under the Homestead Act. From the Omaha area they followed the <span class="loc">Elkhorn River</span> upstream to <span class="loc">West Point</span>. Finding that area too crowded, they continued up the river. On September 15, they reached the junction of the <span class="loc">Elkhorn</span> and its North Fork, and chose that area as a settlement site. On May 23, 1866, a party of 124 settlers representing 42 families from the <span class="loc">Ixonia</span> area set out for northeast <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> in three wagon trains. They arrived at the new site on July 15. A second group of settlers from <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> arrived in July 1867.</p>
