<p>Batang Town (Standard Tibetan: འབའ˙ཐང; Chinese: 巴搪 or 八搪; <span class="loc">Pinyin</span>: Bātáng), or Xiaqiong Town (Chinese: 夏邛镇; <span class="loc">Pinyin</span>: Xiàqióng Zhèn), is a town in <span class="loc">Batang County</span>, Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, <span class="loc">Sichuan Province</span>, in the <span class="loc">China</span> on the main route between <span class="loc">Chengdu</span> and <span class="loc">Lhasa</span>, <span class="loc">Tibet</span>, and just east of the <span class="loc">Jinsha</span> ('Golden Sands') River, or Upper <span class="loc">Yangtse</span> River. It is at an elevation of 2,700 metres (8,900 feet). The name is a transliteration from Tibetan meaning a vast grassland where sheep can be heard everywhere (from ba - the sound made by the sheep + Tibetan tang which means a plain or steppe). According to one source the name in Chinese is 八搪, <span class="loc">Pinyin</span>: Bātáng, but, according to The Contemporary Atlas of <span class="loc">China</span> (1988), it should be written 巴搪, which also is rendered Bātáng in <span class="loc">Pinyin</span>. It is alternatively known as Xiaqiong. 'The plain of <span class="loc">Batang</span>, which runs east and west, is some 2 1⁄2 miles [4.0 km] in length, with a breadth of from three-quarters of a mile to a mile [1.2 to 1.6 km]. In the high mountains surrounding it there are three openings—the valley of the Hsiao-pa-chung River to the south-east by which we entered, and two valleys to the north-east and south-west by which the <span class="loc">Batang River</span> obtains ingress and egress. Three roads lead along these valleys—to <span class="loc">Litang</span>, to the State of Dergé, whose frontier is a couple of days' march distant, and to <span class="loc">Tibet</span> and <span class="loc">Yunnan</span> respectively."</p>
