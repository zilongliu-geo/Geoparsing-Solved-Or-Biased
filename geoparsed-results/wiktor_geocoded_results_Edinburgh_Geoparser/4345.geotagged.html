<p><span class="loc">Pierce County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Washington</span>. As of the 2010 Census, the population was 795,225, making it the second-most populous county in <span class="loc">Washington</span> behind <span class="loc">King County</span>. The county seat and largest city is <span class="loc">Tacoma</span>. Formed out of <span class="loc">Thurston County</span> on December 22, 1852, by the legislature of Oregon Territory, it was named for <span class="loc">U.S.</span> President Franklin Pierce. <span class="loc">Pierce County</span> is included in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, <span class="loc">WA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Pierce County</span> is notable for being home to <span class="loc">Mount Rainier</span>, the tallest mountain and a volcano in the Cascade Range. Its most recent recorded eruption was between 1820 and 1854. There is no imminent risk of eruption, but geologists expect that the volcano will erupt again. If this should happen, parts of <span class="loc">Pierce County</span> and the <span class="loc">Puyallup Valley</span> would be at risk from lahars, lava, or pyroclastic flows. The <span class="loc">Mount Rainier</span> Volcano Lahar Warning System was established in 1998 to assist in the evacuation of the <span class="loc">Puyallup River</span> valley in case of eruption. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,806 square miles (4,680 km2), of which 1,670 square miles (4,300 km2) is land and 137 square miles (350 km2) (7.6%) is water. The highest natural point in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">Mount Rainier</span> at 14,410 feet (4,392 m), is located in <span class="loc">Pierce County</span>.</p>
