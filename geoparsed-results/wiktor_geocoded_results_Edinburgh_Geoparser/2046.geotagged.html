<p>Hobart (/ˈhoʊbɑːt/) is the capital and most populous city of the Australian island state of <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>. Founded in 1803 as a penal colony, Hobart is <span class="loc">Australia</span>'s second oldest capital city after <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>. The city is located in the state's south-east on the estuary of the <span class="loc">Derwent River</span>, making it the most southern of <span class="loc">Australia</span>'s capital cities and its harbour forms the second-deepest natural port in the world. In June 2013, the city had a greater area population of approximately 217,973. Its skyline is dominated by the 1,271-metre (4,170 ft) <span class="loc">Mount Wellington</span>, and much of the city's waterfront consists of reclaimed land. It is the financial and administrative heart of <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, serving as the home port for both Australian and French Antarctic operations and acting as a major tourist hub, with over 1.192 million visitors in 2011/2012. The metropolitan area is often referred to as Greater Hobart, to differentiate it from the <span class="loc">City of Hobart</span>, one of the five local government areas that cover the city. The first settlement began in 1803 as a penal colony at Risdon Cove on the eastern shores of the <span class="loc">Derwent River</span>, amid British concerns over the presence of French explorers. In 1804 it was moved to a better location at the present site of Hobart at Sullivans Cove. The city, initially known as <span class="loc">Hobart Town</span> or <span class="loc">Hobarton</span>, was named after Lord Hobart, the Colonial Secretary.</p>
