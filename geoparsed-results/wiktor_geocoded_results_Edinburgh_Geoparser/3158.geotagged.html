<p>See Posta and Poşta for disambiguation. <span class="loc">Posta</span> (Bengali: পোস্তা) (also known as Posta Bazar) is a neighbourhood in central Kolkata, earlier known as <span class="loc">Calcutta</span>, in the Indian state of <span class="loc">West Bengal</span>. Once a citadel of <span class="loc">Bengali</span> mercantile aristocracy, it is now an extension of the whole sale market in neighbouring Burrabazar, dominated by Marwaris. The wholesale market features a wide range of products such as edible oil, salt, cereals, spices, food grains, sugar, and vanaspati products. The neighbourhood acquired its name from <span class="loc">Posta</span> Ghat, a paved stairway in the <span class="loc">Hooghly River</span>. The area was earlier occupied by Bengali merchants and bankers, whose riches were legendary. One such merchant was Nuku Dhar, or Lakshmikanta Dhar, who came from <span class="loc">Hooghly</span> when it was in decline and settled in Sutanuti. He is believed to have lent the English rulers nine lakh rupees during their campaign against the Marathas. He used to lend money to Robert Clive regularly. It is said that when Nabakrishna Deb approached him for a job, he introduced him to the English and they took him in.</p>
