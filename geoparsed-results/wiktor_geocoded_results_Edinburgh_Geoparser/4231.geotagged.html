<p><span class="loc">Bangor</span> (from Irish: Beannchar [ˈbʲaːn̪ˠəxaɾˠ]) is a large town in <span class="loc">County Down</span>, <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>. It is a seaside resort on the southern side of <span class="loc">Belfast Lough</span> and within the <span class="loc">Belfast Metropolitan</span> Area. In 2007 the town was voted by UTV viewers as the most desirable place to live in <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>. It functions as a commuter town for the Greater Belfast area, which it is linked to by the A2 road and a direct railway line, usually known as the Bangor Line. <span class="loc">Bangor</span> is situated 13.6 miles (22 km) east from the heart of Belfast, not far from George Best Belfast City Airport. <span class="loc">Bangor</span> is part of the <span class="loc">North Down</span> area. Tourism is important to the local economy, particularly in the summer months, and plans are being made for the long-delayed redevelopment of the seafront; a notable historical building in the town is Bangor Old <span class="loc">Custom House</span>. The largest plot of private land in the area, the Clandeboye Estate, which is located a few miles from the town centre, belongs to the Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava. <span class="loc">Bangor</span> hosts the Royal Ulster and Ballyholme Yacht clubs. Bangor Marina is one of the largest in both <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span> and <span class="loc">Republic of Ireland</span>, and holds Blue Flag status. The town is twinned with <span class="loc">Bregenz</span> in <span class="loc">Austria</span> and Virginia Beach in the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p>
