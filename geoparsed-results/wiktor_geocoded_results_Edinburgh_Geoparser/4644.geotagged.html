<p><span class="loc">Estanzuela</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [estanËˆswela]) is a municipality in the Guatemalan department of <span class="loc">Zacapa</span>. It is a small town. <span class="loc">Estanzuela</span> was a passing place for Spaniards looking to go farther west to the ocean. A group of these Spaniards decided to rest for a while, and thought <span class="loc">Estanzuela</span> to be the perfect location. As they went through the surroundings they saw that it was good land to harvest, so they decided to stay. At first it was called "<span class="loc">La Estancia</span>". It is said that its second name was "La Estanzuelita," a Spanish diminutive of Estancia, which is translated to a resting place. Later, the name developed to today name <span class="loc">Estanzuela</span>. Estanzuela's weather is warm, and mostly dry. People are friendly. Most individuals work in agriculture, while others devote themselves to making "Artesanias" or in English, old-styled clothing, and arts. A popular local craft is hand-embroidered cloth and clothing, using a style that ties fabric threads into decorative designs. <span class="loc">Estanzuela</span> is also home to a modest museum of archeology.</p>
