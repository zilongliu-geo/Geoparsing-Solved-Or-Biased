The Moratuc tribe of American Indians was living in a large settlement on <span class="loc">Welch Creek</span> near the current Domtar pulp mill site in 1585 when the area was explored by English settlers.

The Moratuc were probably an Algonquian tribe, but there is debate that they may have been <span class="loc">Iroquois</span>. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> was established in 1787 by Arthur Rhodes on 100 acres (0.40 km2) of his <span class="loc">Brick House</span> plantation he subdivided into 172 lots.
