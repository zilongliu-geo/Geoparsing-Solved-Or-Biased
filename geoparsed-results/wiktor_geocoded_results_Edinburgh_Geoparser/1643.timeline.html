  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">El Alto</span> (Spanish for The Heights) is the second-largest city in <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>, located adjacent to <span class="loc">La Paz</span> in <span class="per">Pedro Domingo</span> <span class="loc">Murillo Province</span> on the Altiplano highlands. <span class="loc">El Alto</span> is <span class="date">today</span> one of <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>'s fastest-growing urban centers, with a population of 974,754 in <span class="date">2011</span>. <span class="loc">El Alto</span> is the highest major metropolis in the world, with an average elevation of 4,150 m (13,615 ft). The El Alto-La <span class="loc">Paz metropolitan</span> area, formed by the cities of <span class="loc">El Alto</span>, <span class="loc">La Paz</span>, and <span class="loc">Viacha</span>, constitutes the most populous urban area of <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>, with a population of 2.3 million inhabitants (greater than the metropolitan area of the country's largest city of <span class="loc">Santa Cruz de la Sierra</span>). The dry and inclement plain above <span class="loc">La Paz</span> was uninhabited until <span class="date">1903</span>, when the newly built railways from <span class="loc">Lake Titicaca</span> and <span class="loc">Arica</span> reached the rim of the canyon, where the <span class="loc">La Paz</span> terminus, railyards and depots were built along with a settlement of railway workers (a spur line down into the canyon opened in <span class="date">1905</span>). In <span class="date">1925</span> the airfield was built as base for the new air force, which attracted additional settlement. In <span class="date">1939</span> <span class="loc">El Alto</span>'s first elementary school opened. <span class="loc">El Alto</span> started to grow tremendously in <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, when the settlement was connected to <span class="loc">La Paz</span>' water supply (before that all water had to be transported from <span class="loc">La Paz</span> in tanker vehicles) and building land in the canyon became more and more short and expensive. In an administrative reform on <span class="date">March 6, 1985</span> the district of <span class="loc">El Alto</span> and surroundings was politically separated from the City of <span class="loc">La Paz</span> (this date is officially referred to and celebrated as the city's "founding day"). In <span class="date">1987</span> <span class="loc">El Alto</span> was formally incorporated as a city. In <span class="date">1994</span>, the city became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="loc">El Alto</span>.</p><br><br>
