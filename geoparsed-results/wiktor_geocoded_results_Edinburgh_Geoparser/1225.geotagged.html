<p><span class="loc">Jamestown</span>, also known as Webersvallei ("Weber's Valley"), is a quiet rural settlement on the southern outskirts of <span class="loc">Stellenbosch</span> in the Cape <span class="loc">Winelands District</span> of the Western Cape province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It is situated next to Blaauwklippen Vineyards, on the eastern side of route R44 from <span class="loc">Stellenbosch</span> to <span class="loc">Somerset West</span> and the Strand coastal resort. The main access from the R44 is via Webersvallei Road, the main road in <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> with watererven – long, narrow agricultural plots on the south bank of <span class="loc">Blouklip</span> River – on the north side of the road and residential plots on the south side of the road. Over time, <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> has transformed from a subsistence farming village into a primarily residential area as residents have sought work elsewhere in order to survive. A heritage committee was established in 2010 to document the history of <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> for the benefit of future generations, to restore old buildings and to facilitate increased involvement in local festivals and commemorative events. The village was named after James Rattray (1859–1938), a <span class="loc">Stellenbosch</span> businessman who owned a butchery in <span class="loc">Dorp</span> Street. He was the grandson of Scottish teacher James Rattray (c. 1795–1864) who immigrated to the <span class="loc">Cape Colony</span> in 1822, one of several British people recruited to the colony by Scottish missionary George Thom at the request of the governor Lord Charles Somerset. In 1902 Rattray and Rhenish missionary Jacob Weber (1856–1937), who was born in <span class="loc">Lennep</span> in <span class="loc">Germany</span> and sent to <span class="loc">Stellenbosch</span> in 1882, acquired a portion of the Blaauwklippen farm. The land was divided into plots and sold to coloured families, and most of the associated debt was paid off within twenty years. Street names such as Everbearing, Festival, Nared, <span class="loc">Pajaro</span>, <span class="loc">Rolinda</span>, Tiobelle, Titan, <span class="loc">Torrey</span>, Tribute and Whiteheart in the residential area are based on strawberry varieties, after the main crop grown there since 1902. Other crops grown there include beans, lettuce, potatoes and tomatoes.</p>
