  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Grant County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 7,445. The county seat is <span class="loc">Canyon City</span>. It is named for President <span class="per">Ulysses S. Grant</span>, who served as an army officer in the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Territory, and at the time of the county's creation was a Union general in the American Civil War. <span class="loc">Grant County</span> is included in the 8 county definition of Eastern <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. <span class="loc">Grant County</span> was established on <span class="date">October 14, 1864</span>, from parts of old <span class="loc">Wasco</span> and old <span class="loc">Umatilla counties</span>. Prior to its creation, cases brought to court were tried in The <span class="loc">Dalles</span>, county seat of the vast <span class="loc">Wasco County</span>. The great distance to The <span class="loc">Dalles</span> made law enforcement a difficult problem, and imposed a heavy burden on citizens who had a need to transact business at the courthouse. In <span class="date">1889</span>, more than half of the southern part of the original <span class="loc">Grant County</span> was taken to form <span class="loc">Harney County</span>. Also in <span class="date">1899</span>, a small part of northwestern <span class="loc">Grant County</span> was taken (along with parts of <span class="per">Crook</span> and <span class="per">Gilliam</span> counties) to form <span class="loc">Wheeler County</span>.</p><br><br>
