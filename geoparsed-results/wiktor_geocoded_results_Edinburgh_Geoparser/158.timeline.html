  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Vicente</span> is a fifth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 11,720 people. The municipality is known for its production of beautiful furniture made from narra and other tropical hardwoods, even from old wood previously used in wooden sugarcane crushers and old houses to make reproduction antiques. <span class="loc">San Vicente</span> is politically subdivided into 7 barangays. <span class="loc">Bantaoay</span> <span class="loc">Bayubay</span> <span class="loc">Norte</span> <span class="loc">Bayubay</span> <span class="loc">Sur</span> <span class="loc">Lubong</span> <span class="loc">Poblacion</span> <span class="loc">Pudoc</span> <span class="date">San Sebastian</span> The municipality's name came from the name of <span class="loc">Saint Vincent Ferrer</span>, whose winged statue was found inside a box entangled in fishing nets. The fishermen consulted this matter to the friars in Villa Fernandina (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Vigan</span>), who identified the person depicted by the statue. The statue was carried to the town's center, where a church was built. From then on, the town formerly known as Tuanong (sometimes called <span class="loc">Taonan</span>) became <span class="loc">San Vicente</span>. In tracing the history of <span class="loc">San Vicente</span>, one always has to start from <span class="loc">Vigan</span>. <span class="loc">Vigan</span> was established by the Spanish colonizer, <span class="per">Juan de Salcedo</span> on <span class="date">June 13, 1573</span> up to <span class="date">1582</span>, there were only 800 residents.</p><br><br>
