  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Touba</span> (Hassaniya: Ṭūbā "Felicity") is a city in central <span class="loc">Senegal</span>, part of <span class="loc">Diourbel Region</span> and <span class="loc">Mbacké district</span>. With a population of 529,176 in <span class="date">2010</span>, it is the second most populated Senegalese city after <span class="loc">Dakar</span>. It is the holy <span class="loc">city of Mouridism</span> and the burial place of its founder, Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke. Next to his tomb lies a large mosque, completed in <span class="date">1963</span>. Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, commonly known as "Cheikh <span class="per">Amadou Bamba</span>" (<span class="date">1853</span>-<span class="date">1927</span>), is said to have founded <span class="loc">Touba</span> under a large tree when, in a moment of transcendence, he experienced a cosmic vision of light. In Arabic, ṭūbā means "felicity" or "bliss" and evokes the sweet pleasures of eternal life in the hereafter. In Islamic tradition, Ṭūbā is also the name of the tree of Paradise. In Sufism, this symbolic tree represents an aspiration for spiritual perfection and closeness to God. Aamadu Bàmba founded <span class="loc">Touba</span> in <span class="date">1887</span>. The holy site remained a tiny, isolated place in the wilderness until his death and burial at the site of the <span class="loc">Great Mosque</span>, <span class="date">40 years later</span>. The <span class="loc">Great Mosque</span> was finally completed in <span class="date">1963</span> and since its inauguration the city has grown at a rapid pace: from under 5,000 inhabitants in <span class="date">1964</span>, the population was officially estimated at 529,000 in <span class="date">2007</span>. Along with the neighboring town of Mbacké (founded by Aamadu Bàmba's great-grandfather in <span class="date">1796</span>), the Mouride conurbation is <span class="loc">Senegal</span>'s second largest urban area, after the capital region of <span class="loc">Dakar</span>.</p><br><br>
