<p><span class="loc">Windsor</span> (/ˈwɪnzər/), <span class="loc">Ontario</span> is the southernmost city in <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is located on the southern shore of the <span class="loc">Detroit River</span>, directly across the river from <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. <span class="loc">Windsor</span> is a major contributor to <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s automotive industry and has much to offer by means of a storied history and a diverse culture. Prior to European exploration and settlement, the <span class="loc">Windsor</span> area was inhabited by the First Nations and Native Americans. <span class="loc">Windsor</span> was settled by the French in 1749 as an agricultural settlement. It is the oldest continually inhabited European settlement in <span class="loc">Canada</span> west of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>. The area was first named Petite Côte ("Little Coast" – as opposed to the longer coastline on the <span class="loc">Detroit</span> side of the river). Later it was called La Côte de Misère ("Poverty Coast") because of the sandy soils near <span class="loc">LaSalle</span>. Windsor's French Canadian heritage is reflected in many French street names, such as <span class="loc">Ouellette</span>, <span class="loc">Pelissier</span>, <span class="loc">François</span>, <span class="loc">Pierre</span>, <span class="loc">Langlois</span>, <span class="loc">Marentette</span>, and <span class="loc">Lauzon</span>. The current street system of <span class="loc">Windsor</span> (a grid with elongated blocks) reflects the Canadien method of agricultural land division, where the farms were long and narrow, fronting along the river. Today, the north-south street name often indicates the name of the family that at one time farmed the land where the street is now located. The street system of outlying areas is consistent with the British system for granting land concessions. There is a significant French-speaking minority in <span class="loc">Windsor</span> and the surrounding area, particularly in the <span class="loc">Lakeshore</span>, <span class="loc">Tecumseh</span> and <span class="loc">LaSalle</span> areas.</p>
