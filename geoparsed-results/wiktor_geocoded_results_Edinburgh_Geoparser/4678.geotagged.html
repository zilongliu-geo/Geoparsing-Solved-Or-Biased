<p>The municipality has 353 inhabitants (2012). 239 of these people are living in <span class="loc">Sumba</span>. The other villages in the Municipality of <span class="loc">Sumba</span> are: <span class="loc">Lopra</span> (88 inns.), <span class="loc">Akrar</span> (26 inns.), Víkarbyrgi (0 inns.). <span class="loc">Sumba</span> is known for several things, e.g. its beauty, for the high bird cliff Beinisvørð and the skills of the local people regarding Faroese chain dance. They are very good dancers and have a long tradition for singing long songs along with the chain dance. <span class="loc">Poul</span> F. Joensen (born 1898 - died 1970) is one of the most famous Farose poets; he was born in <span class="loc">Sumba</span> and grew up there. Later he got married and moved to Froðba. Residents of the village are known as Sumbingar. The name <span class="loc">Sumba</span> or Sunnba is from the old name of the village which was Sunnbø/ba or Sunnbøur which means the southern-most village, but over the years misspellings by Danish rulers have led to the name <span class="loc">Sumba</span>. High mountains separate the village from the other settlements of the island. The village lies on the west coast as the only one on the island except from Fámjin. <span class="loc">Sumba</span> is said to be one of the oldest villages in the <span class="loc">Faroe Islands</span>. Excavations have shown traces from people from the 7th century. <span class="loc">Sumba</span> is an impressive village in its natural setting. The church in <span class="loc">Sumba</span> is from 1887.</p>
