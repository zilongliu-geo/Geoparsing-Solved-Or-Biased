  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bali</span> is an island and <span class="loc">province of Indonesia</span>. The province includes the island of <span class="loc">Bali</span> and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably <span class="loc">Nusa Penida</span>, <span class="loc">Nusa Lembongan</span>, and <span class="loc">Nusa Ceningan</span>. It is located at the westernmost end of the <span class="loc">Lesser Sunda Islands</span>, between <span class="loc">Java</span> to the west and <span class="loc">Lombok</span> to the east. Its capital of <span class="loc">Denpasar</span> is located at the southern part of the island. With a population of 3,890,757 in the <span class="date">2010</span> census, and 4,225,000 as of <span class="date">January 2014</span>, the island is home to most of <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>'s Hindu minority. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, 83.5% of Bali's population adhered to Balinese Hinduism, followed by 13.4% Muslim, Christianity at 2.5%, and Buddhism 0.5%. <span class="loc">Bali</span> is a popular tourist destination, which has seen a significant rise in tourists since <span class="date">the 1980s</span>. It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The <span class="org">Indonesian International Film Festival</span> is held every year in <span class="loc">Bali</span>. <span class="loc">Bali</span> is part of the <span class="org">Coral Triangle</span>, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species. In this area alone over 500 reef building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about 7 times as many as in the entire Caribbean. There is a wide range of dive sites with high quality reefs, all with their own specific attractions. Many sites can have strong currents and swell, so diving without a knowledgeable guide is inadvisable. Most recently, <span class="loc">Bali</span> was the host of the <span class="date">2011</span> ASEAN Summit, <span class="date">2013</span> APEC and Miss World <span class="date">2013</span>.</p><br><br>
