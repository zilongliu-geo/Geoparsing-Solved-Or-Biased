<p><span class="loc">La Carlota</span>, officially City of <span class="loc">La Carlota</span>, is a fourth class city in the central Philippine province of <span class="loc">Negros Occidental</span>. According to the 2010 official census, it has a population of 63,852. Until two years after its foundation in 1871, it was known as <span class="loc">Simancas</span>, a barrio under the jurisdiction of the neighboring town of <span class="loc">San Enrique</span>, which was led by a Spaniard who was married to a woman named <span class="loc">Carlota</span>. Legend has it that she was well-loved by the natives for her social works so that they named their settlement after her when it was created as a municipality near the end of the Spanish colonial era in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. In line with the Spanish practice of adding an article before a proper noun, “<span class="loc">La Carlota</span>” became its official name. On June 19, 1965, by virtue of Republic Act No. 4585, <span class="loc">La Carlota</span> was granted a city charter, becoming the only landlocked city in the island province. In 2011, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) awarded the city with a "seal of good housekeeping" for its efforts in advancing accountability and transparency in local governance. In the same year, it was also named as one of the top performing local government units in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, ranking eighth in the component cities category. On December 29, 2011, the city was nominated for excellence in local governance, an honor given by the provincial government under its Pagpasidungog Awards .</p>
