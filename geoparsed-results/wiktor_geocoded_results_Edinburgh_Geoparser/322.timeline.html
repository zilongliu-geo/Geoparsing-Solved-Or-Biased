  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Wellington</span> is the name of a north <span class="loc">Nanaimo</span>, <span class="loc">British Columbia</span> neighbourhood, which was once the town of <span class="per">Wellington</span>. The community was named for <span class="per">Arthur Wellesley</span>, 1st <span class="per">Duke of Wellington</span>. Since amalgamation with <span class="loc">Nanaimo</span>, <span class="loc">Wellington District</span> is often referred to as "<span class="loc">North Nanaimo</span>" with the former townsites collectively keeping the neighbourhood name of "<span class="per">Wellington</span>". <span class="per">Wellington</span> is located in a shared portion of the traditional territories of the <span class="per">Sneneymuxw</span> and <span class="per">Nanoose</span> First Nations. Both nations are Coast Salish and use the Halkomelem language. WIth their heavy seaworthy canoes, both groups were highly mobile traders and many would have used Chinook Jargon as a trading language. Early photographs of Europeans standing for photo-ops in the distinctive Salish canoes on <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> show that the first nations and the Europeans coexisted in the <span class="per">Wellington</span> area. Prior to <span class="date">1869</span> a small number of settlers had established farms around Diver Lake, <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> and <span class="loc">Brannen</span> Lake. The neighbourhood had a saloon and was connected to <span class="loc">Nanaimo</span> by a trail. With extensive marshes and lakes, the area was frequented by <span class="loc">Nanaimo</span> residents for fishing and hunting. In <span class="date">1869</span> <span class="per">Robert Dunsmuir</span> discovered a thin surface seam coal on the roots of a fallen tree while visiting Diver Lake. <span class="per">Dunsmuir</span> was a coal miner with a keen interest in operating his own mine and immediately investigated the coal seam. By <span class="date">1871</span> <span class="per">Dunsmuir</span> had discovered the <span class="per">Wellington</span> coal seam which underlaid his initial discovery. Once <span class="per">Dunsmuir</span> determined the Coal was of good quality and significant quantity, he established a company so that he could get a land grant for the area. This first grant covered most of what is <span class="date">today</span> known as the <span class="per">Wellington</span> Land District. Initially the town grew up along the crest of land which is <span class="date">now</span> Jingle Pot Road.</p><br><br>
