<p><span class="loc">Lisse</span> ( pronunciation ) is a town and municipality in the western <span class="loc">Netherlands</span>, in the province of <span class="loc">South Holland</span>. The municipality covers an area of 16.05 km2 (6.20 sq mi) of which 0.36 km2 (0.14 sq mi) is water. Its population was 22,400 in 2014. Located within the municipal boundary is also the community <span class="loc">De Engel</span>. The history of <span class="loc">Lisse</span> is closely related and similar to the neighboring towns of <span class="loc">Hillegom</span> and <span class="loc">Sassenheim</span>. Based on a document from 1198 which makes official mention of the town's name, <span class="loc">Lisse</span> celebrated its 800-year anniversary in 1998, although there is an indication that there was already a settlement there in the 10th century. In the Middle Ages, <span class="loc">Lisse</span> was a small settlement; there were only 50 houses in 1500. Because of prolonged warfare (particularly the wars of Charles the Bold and the Eighty Years' War), poverty was prevalent. Its population lived from agriculture, animal husbandry, and peat harvesting. In the 17th and 18th centuries, <span class="loc">Lisse</span> was, like <span class="loc">Hillegom</span>, home to many estates of rich merchants and nobility. The forests and gardens of the <span class="loc">Keukenhof</span>, Meerenburg, Wildlust, <span class="loc">Zandvliet</span>, Overduin en Akervoorde, <span class="loc">Wassergeest</span>, <span class="loc">Grotenhof</span>, Ter Specke, Dubbelhoven, <span class="loc">Rosendaal</span>, <span class="loc">Veenenburg</span> en <span class="loc">Berkhout</span>, <span class="loc">Middelburg</span>, <span class="loc">Ter Beek</span>, and Uytermeer estates all added to the town's beauty and glory.</p>
