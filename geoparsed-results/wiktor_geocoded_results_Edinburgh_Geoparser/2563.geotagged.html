<p>Amelia is a town and comune of the <span class="loc">province of Terni</span>, in the <span class="loc">Umbria region</span> of central <span class="loc">Italy</span>. It grew up around an ancient hill fort, known to the Romans as Ameria. According to some scholars, Amelia is the oldest town in <span class="loc">Umbria</span>. It was supposedly founded by a legendary Umbrian king, King Ameroe, who gave the city the name Ameria. <span class="loc">Cato</span> the Elder is reported as saying that Ameria was founded 963 years before the war with <span class="loc">Perseus</span> (171-168 BC), so 1134 BC. This date cannot be considered accurate. The city was later occupied by the Etruscans, and later still by the Romans, although it is not mentioned by name in the history of the Roman conquest of <span class="loc">Umbria</span>. Ameria occupied a strategic location in the Second Latin War (340-338 BC), lying on a loop of the Via Cassia called the Via Amerina, which started at Falerii and crossed the <span class="loc">Tiber</span> at Castellum Amerinum (probably <span class="loc">Orte</span>). The town gained political status as a self-governing municipium, maybe as early as 338 BC, but certainly by the middle of the 1st century BC. Citizens of the town were members of the tribus Clustumina. Cicero's speech in defence of Sextus Roscius Amerinus describes Ameria as a flourishing place in 80 BC, with a fertile territory extending to the <span class="loc">Tiber</span>. Its fruit is often extolled by Roman writers. Augustus divided its lands among his veterans, but did not plant a colony.</p>
