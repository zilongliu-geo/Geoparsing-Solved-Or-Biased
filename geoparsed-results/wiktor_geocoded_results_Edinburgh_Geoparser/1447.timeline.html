  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Chaoyang</span> (Chinese: 朝阳) is a prefecture-level <span class="loc">city of Liaoning</span> province, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. With a vast land area of almost 20,000 square kilometres (7,700 sq mi), it is by area the largest prefecture-level city in Liaoning, and borders on <span class="loc">Hebei province</span> and the <span class="loc">Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region</span> to the west. The area under <span class="loc">Chaoyang</span>'s jurisdictional control is split up into two counties (<span class="loc">Jianping</span>, <span class="loc">Chaoyang</span>), two urban districts (<span class="loc">Longcheng</span>, <span class="loc">Shuangta</span>), two county-level cities (<span class="loc">Beipiao</span>, <span class="loc">Lingyuan</span>), and the <span class="loc">Harqin</span> Left Wing Mongolian <span class="loc">Autonomous County</span>. The total regional population is 3 million, while the urban centre where the government office is located has a population of 430,000 and forms the core of <span class="loc">Chaoyang</span>. Known as <span class="loc">China</span>'s 'fossil city', many important paleontological discoveries have been made in <span class="loc">Chaoyang</span>, and the <span class="loc">Harqin</span> region is the oldest currently known prehistoric site in northern <span class="loc">China</span>. Two of the most remarkable Early Cretaceous birds known to date were recovered in the vicinity of the Jiufotang Formation rocks and named Longipteryx chaoyangensis and Sapeornis chaoyangensis in reference to the city.</p><br><br>
