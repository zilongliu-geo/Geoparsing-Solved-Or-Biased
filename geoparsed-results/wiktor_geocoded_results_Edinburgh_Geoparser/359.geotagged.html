According to the 2010 Census, it had a population of 12,629. Before European settlers arrived, Kingston was within the tribal homeland of the Wampanoag people. Several years before the <span class="loc">Mayflower</span> had landed in Plymouth, during the Native American epidemic of 1616 to 1619, the Wampanoag population was severely damaged from a rapidly spreading pandemics due to earlier contacts with Europeans. Several ancient Native American burial sites have been located within the borders of Kingston. Originally part of Plymouth, Kingston was first settled by Europeans shortly after the landing of the Pilgrims at <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> Rock in 1620. It was settled once more in 1635. During 1675, several bloody battles during King Philip's War are believed to have occurred within Kingston's borders and the residence of Governor Bradford, which is now part of Kingston, was raided by Wampanoag warriors. In 1685, the area was placed within the boundaries of <span class="loc">Plymouth County</span> and for a brief time, between 1686 and 1689, the borders of Kingston were within the Dominion of <span class="loc">New England</span>.</p>
