  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Sibu /ˈsibuː/ (simplified Chinese: 诗巫; traditional Chinese: 詩巫; pinyin: Shīwū) is an inland town at the central region of <span class="loc">Sarawak</span> and the capital of <span class="loc">Sibu District</span> in <span class="loc">Sibu Division</span>, <span class="loc">Sarawak</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. It covers an area of 129.5 square kilometres (50.0 sq mi). It is located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Rajang</span> and <span class="loc">Igan Rivers</span>, some 60 kilometres from the <span class="loc">South China Sea</span> and approximately 191.5 kilometres (119 mi) north-east of the state capital <span class="loc">Kuching</span>. The population is mainly dominated by Chinese especially the Fuzhou people. Other ethnic groups such as indigenous <span class="loc">Melanau</span>, <span class="loc">Malay</span>, and <span class="loc">Iban</span> are also present in this region. The town population as of the <span class="date">year 2010</span> is 162,676. <span class="loc">Sibu</span> was founded by <span class="per">James Brooke</span> in <span class="date">1862</span> when he built a fort in the town to fend off attacks by indigenous Dayak people. Following this, a small group of Chinese Hokkien people settled around the fort to carry out business activities safely in the town. In <span class="date">1901</span>, Wong Nai Siong led a large scale migration numbering 1,118 Foochow Chinese from <span class="loc">Fujian province</span> of <span class="loc">China</span> into <span class="loc">Sibu</span>. This made <span class="loc">Sibu</span> being referred popularly as "New Fuzhou". Sibu bazaar and the first hospital in <span class="loc">Sibu</span> was built by the <span class="per">Brooke</span> government. <span class="org">Lau King Howe Hospital</span> and a number of Methodist schools and churches were built in <span class="date">the 1930s</span>. However, the town of <span class="loc">Sibu</span> was burnt to the ground twice in <span class="date">1889</span> and in <span class="date">1928</span> but it was rebuilt after that. There was no fierce fighting in <span class="loc">Sibu</span> during the Japanese occupation of <span class="loc">Sarawak</span> in <span class="date">1941</span>. The Japanese installed a new Resident at <span class="loc">Sibu</span> in <span class="date">June 1942</span> and <span class="loc">Sibu</span> was renamed to "Sibu-shu" in <span class="date">August 1942</span>. After the Japanese surrender in <span class="date">1945</span>, <span class="loc">Sarawak</span> was ceded to the British as <span class="org">Crown</span> Colony. This has caused a dissatisfaction amongst a group of young <span class="loc">Melanau</span> people in <span class="loc">Sibu</span> who were pro-independence. As a result, the second British Governor of <span class="loc">Sarawak</span>, <span class="per">Sir Duncan George Stewart</span> was assassinated by <span class="per">Rosli Dhobi</span> when he visited <span class="loc">Sibu</span> in <span class="date">December 1949</span>. <span class="per">Rosli</span> was later hanged to death at <span class="org">Kuching Central Prison</span> in <span class="date">1950</span>. <span class="loc">Sibu</span> and the <span class="per">Rajang</span> basin also became the centre of communist activities from <span class="date">1950</span> and it continued even after the <span class="loc">Sarawak</span> independence in <span class="date">1963</span>. <span class="per">A Rajang</span> Security Command (RASCOM) was then established to curb Communist activities in the area. Communist insurgency in <span class="loc">Sarawak</span> was significantly impaired in <span class="date">1973</span> and later ended in <span class="date">1990</span>. <span class="loc">Sibu</span> was upgraded to the municipality status in <span class="date">1981</span>. The town received a royal visit in <span class="date">September 2001</span>. The town is also a gateway to <span class="org">Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy</span> (SCORE) since <span class="date">2008</span>. In <span class="date">2011</span>, 110th anniversary of Foochow settlement was celebrated in <span class="loc">Sibu</span>.</p><br><br>
