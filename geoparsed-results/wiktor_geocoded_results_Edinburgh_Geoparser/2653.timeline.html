  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Isla Culebra</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [kuˈleβɾa], "<span class="loc">Snake Island</span>") is an island-municipality of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>. It is located approximately 17 miles (27 km) east of the Puerto Rican mainland, 12 miles (19 km) west of <span class="loc">St. Thomas</span> and 9 miles (14 km) north of <span class="loc">Vieques</span>. <span class="loc">Culebra</span> is spread over 5 wards and <span class="loc">Culebra Pueblo</span> (<span class="loc">Dewey</span>), the downtown area and the administrative center of the city. Residents of the island are known as Culebrenses. With a population of 1,818 as of the latest census, it is <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>'s least populous municipality. Originally called <span class="loc">Isla Pasaje</span> and <span class="loc">Isla</span> de <span class="loc">San Ildefonso</span>, <span class="loc">Culebra</span> is also known as <span class="loc">Isla Chiquita</span> (“<span class="loc">Little Island</span>”) and Última <span class="loc">Virgen</span> (“Last <span class="org">Virgin</span>”, due to its position at the end of the <span class="loc">Virgin Islands</span> archipelago). Some sources claim that <span class="per">Christopher Columbus</span> was the first European to arrive at the island during his second voyage in <span class="date">1493</span>. It is believed that the island was populated by Carib Indians during the colonization. After Agüeybaná and Agüeybaná II led the Taíno rebellion of <span class="date">1511</span>, Taíno Indians from the main island sought refuge on <span class="loc">Culebra</span> and allied with Caribs to launch random attacks at the island estates.</p><br><br>
