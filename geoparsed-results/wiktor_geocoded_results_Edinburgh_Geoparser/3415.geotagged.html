<p><span class="loc">Greenwich</span> is a Canadian rural community located in <span class="loc">eastern Kings County</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>. It was previously known as <span class="loc">Noggins</span> Corner, as travelers could procure a noggin of rum at a local public house. The community is bordered to the south by the <span class="loc">Wolfville</span> Ridge, immediately west of the town of Wolfville and east of the village of New Minas. It is also bordered on the north by the south bank of the <span class="loc">Cornwallis River</span>, opposite the village of <span class="loc">Port Williams</span>. In 1910 the present church opened in <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> as a Methodist meeting house. In 1925 it became part of the United Church of <span class="loc">Canada</span> and is now part of the pastoral charge of <span class="loc">St Andrews</span>, <span class="loc">Wolfville</span>. The community has hosted Horton High School in two different locations since 1959. <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> has a population of approximately 300 people. Water, sewer, hydrant, streetlights, bus transit and sidewalk services make this hamlet a desirable rural residential area within easy access of both New Minas and Wolfville. <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> is also served by a volunteer fire department. <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> has been primarily agricultural in nature since being first settled by families including the Bishop and Forsyth families, who settled here in 1760 as New <span class="loc">England</span> Planters; both of these families still farm in <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> today. Five farm markets in this small community make it the destination of choice for in-season produce in <span class="loc">Kings County</span>. Hennigar's, one of the oldest farm markets in the province, opened in 1921. <span class="loc">Noggins</span> Corner Farm Market is on the site of Timothy and William Bishop's farm and is run by members of the Bishop family.</p>
