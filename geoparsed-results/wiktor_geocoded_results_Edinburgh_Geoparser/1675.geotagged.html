<p><span class="loc">Clark County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 35,613. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Winchester</span>. The county was created in 1792 from Bourbon and Fayette counties and is named for Revolutionary War hero George Rogers Clark. <span class="loc">Clark County</span> is part of the Lexingtonâ€“Fayette, <span class="loc">KY Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Many pioneers traveled through nearby Fort Boonesborough (alternatively known as Fort Boonesboro) in <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, before establishing permanent settlements in <span class="loc">Clark County</span>. At least nineteen pioneer stations (settlements) are believed to have been established in the area during the American Revolution. These included Strode's Station (1779), near <span class="loc">Winchester</span>; McGee's Station (ca. 1780), near <span class="loc">Becknerville</span>; Holder's Station (1781), on Lower <span class="loc">Howard's Creek</span>; and Boyle's Station (ca. 1785), one mile west of Strode's Station. Among the early settlers was a group of forty Baptist families led by Capt. William Bush, who settled on Lower <span class="loc">Howard's Creek</span> in 1775. In 1793 they erected the Old Stone Meeting House. Another early group founded the Tracy settlement, erecting a church building in the 1790s that survived into the early 20th century.</p>
