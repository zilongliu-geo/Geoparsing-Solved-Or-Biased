<p>Seaforth is a district within the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Sefton</span>, <span class="loc">Merseyside</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically in <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, it is located to the north of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>, between <span class="loc">Bootle</span> and <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. The name of Seaforth is thought to come from the Old Norse sæ-fjord, sæ-ford, "sea inlet". It was recorded as Safforde "sea ford" in 1128, suggesting Old English name origins. Another theory for the name of the area is that it was taken from Seaforth House, named after Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth, who built the mansion in 1813 for his daughter and her husband, Sir John Gladstone, father of William Ewart Gladstone, four times Prime Minister of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. A permanent military presence was established in the borough with the completion of Seaforth Barracks in 1882. <span class="loc">Seaforth</span> Dock opened in 1972 and is the largest dock facility on the <span class="loc">River Mersey</span>. It is part of the Port of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> and <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> <span class="loc">Freeport</span>. Seaforth joined Crosby Municipal Borough in 1937, having previously been part of <span class="loc">Waterloo with Seaforth</span> urban district. The whole of <span class="loc">Crosby</span> became part of the new Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Sefton</span> on 1 April 1974.</p>
