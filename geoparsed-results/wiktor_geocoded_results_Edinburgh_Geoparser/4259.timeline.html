  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Croydon</span> is a suburb in the Inner West of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located 11 kilometres west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district. <span class="loc">Croydon</span> is split between the two local government areas of <span class="org">Burwood Council</span> and the Municipality of <span class="loc">Ashfield</span>. The suburb is nestled between the commercial centres of <span class="loc">Ashfield</span> and <span class="loc">Burwood</span>. It is bounded by Parramatta Road to the north, Iron <span class="loc">Cove Creek</span> to the east, <span class="per">Arthur Street</span> to the south and a number of different streets to the west. To the north are Kings and <span class="loc">Canada</span> Bays on the closest reach of the <span class="loc">Parramatta River</span>, to the northwest is <span class="org">Concord Hospital</span> and the Olympic Games complex at <span class="loc">Homebush</span> Bay. To the south is Canterbury Racecourse. The town has the same name as <span class="loc">Croydon</span>, a large district of south <span class="loc">London</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the area <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Croydon</span> was part of the land which the <span class="loc">Wangal</span> tribe hunted and lived having migrated down from northern <span class="loc">Australia</span> and before that <span class="loc">Asia</span>. Their focus of tribal land was believed to be centred on <span class="org">Concord</span> and stretched east to the swampland of Long <span class="loc">Cove Creek</span>. The land was heavily wooded at the time with tall eucalypts, blackbutts and turpentines covering the higher ground and mangroves, swamp oaks and swamp mahoganies in the lower swampy ground of Iron <span class="loc">Cove Creek</span>. The diet of the <span class="loc">Wangal</span> was primarily fish so they spent most of their time living near the shores of the <span class="loc">Parramatta River</span> and fishing in canoes. The land away from the river shores provided fruits, berries and edible plants as well as possums and kangaroos, which were killed both for food and their skins.</p><br><br>
