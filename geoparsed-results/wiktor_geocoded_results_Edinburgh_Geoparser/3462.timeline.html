  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Union City</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Hudson County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census the city had a total population of 66,455, reflecting a decline of 633 (âˆ’0.9%) from the 67,088 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 9,076 (+15.6%) from the 58,012 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census it was the most densely populated city in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, with a density of 51,810.1 per square mile. <span class="loc">Union City</span> was incorporated as a city by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on <span class="date">June 1, 1925</span>, with the merger of Union Hill and <span class="loc">West Hoboken Township</span>. The city's name marks the combination of the two municipalities. Two major waves of immigration, first of German speakers and then of Spanish speakers, greatly influenced the development and character of <span class="loc">Union City</span>. Its two nicknames, "Embroidery Capital of the <span class="loc">United States</span>" and "Havana on the <span class="loc">Hudson</span>", reflect important aspects of that history. Thousands make a pilgrimage to <span class="loc">Union City</span> each year to see the nation's longest-running passion play and the annual Cuban Day Parade of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>.</p><br><br>
