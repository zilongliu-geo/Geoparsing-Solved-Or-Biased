  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Union</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,121 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="org">Union</span> was platted on <span class="date">November 11, 1864</span> along the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trail. The name references the <span class="org">Union</span> states, or Northern States, of the American Civil War. <span class="loc">La Grande</span> was named the county seat when <span class="loc">Union County</span> was created in <span class="date">1865</span>. Due to the <span class="per">Thomas</span> and <span class="per">Ruckle</span> Road going through <span class="org">Union</span>, it elected the county seat in <span class="date">1872</span>, but when the railroad was built it was put through <span class="loc">La Grande</span> instead of <span class="org">Union</span>. <span class="loc">La Grande</span> became the bigger town within the county and regained the county seat in <span class="date">1902</span>. <span class="per">J. W. Shelton</span>, a local attorney, chartered the <span class="org">Union</span> Electric Power and Light Company in <span class="date">March 1890</span> to bring the railroad from <span class="org">Union</span> Junction (2.5 miles away) to <span class="org">Union</span> itself. The company was renamed the <span class="org">Union</span> Railway Company in <span class="date">July 1890</span>, and the rail spur was built into <span class="org">Union</span> by <span class="date">August 1892</span>. <span class="per">Shelton</span> planned to build more lines, had a fight with his company partners (the <span class="loc">Hutchinsons</span>), then two competing firms were formed: <span class="org">Shelton's The Union Railway</span> in <span class="date">January 1893</span>, and <span class="loc">Hutchinsons</span>' <span class="org">Union</span> Street Railway and Suburban Railway. Both companies competed to buy the <span class="org">Union</span> Railway Company. <span class="per">Shelton</span> maintained control until <span class="date">August 1905</span>, when The <span class="org">Union</span> Railway was renamed to the <span class="org">Union</span>, Cove and Valley Railway. This company was bought <span class="date">the following year</span> by a timber company from the East Coast.</p><br><br>
