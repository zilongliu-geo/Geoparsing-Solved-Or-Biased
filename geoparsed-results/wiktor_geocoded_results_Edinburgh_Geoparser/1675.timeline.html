  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Clark County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 35,613. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Winchester</span>. The county was created in <span class="date">1792</span> from <span class="per">Bourbon</span> and <span class="per">Fayette</span> counties and is named for Revolutionary War hero <span class="per">George Rogers Clark</span>. <span class="loc">Clark County</span> is part of the Lexingtonâ€“Fayette, <span class="loc">KY Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Many pioneers traveled through nearby Fort Boonesborough (alternatively known as Fort Boonesboro) in <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, before establishing permanent settlements in <span class="loc">Clark County</span>. At least nineteen pioneer stations (settlements) are believed to have been established in the area during the American Revolution. These included Strode's Station (<span class="date">1779</span>), near <span class="loc">Winchester</span>; McGee's Station (ca. <span class="date">1780</span>), near <span class="loc">Becknerville</span>; Holder's Station (<span class="date">1781</span>), on Lower <span class="loc">Howard's Creek</span>; and Boyle's Station (ca. <span class="date">1785</span>), one mile west of Strode's Station. Among the early settlers was a group of forty Baptist families led by <span class="per">Capt. William Bush</span>, who settled on Lower <span class="loc">Howard's Creek</span> in <span class="date">1775</span>. In <span class="date">1793</span> they erected the Old Stone Meeting House. Another early group founded the Tracy settlement, erecting a church building in the 1790s that survived into the early 20th century.</p><br><br>
