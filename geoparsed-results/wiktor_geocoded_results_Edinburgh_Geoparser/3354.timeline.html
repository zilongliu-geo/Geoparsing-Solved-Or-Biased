  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The <span class="org">Mission</span> district is an inner city neighbourhood of <span class="loc">Calgary</span>, <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> that originated as <span class="loc">Notre Dame</span> de la <span class="loc">Paix</span>, a Catholic mission, and was for a time the incorporated Village of Rouleauville. <span class="org">Mission</span> contains the very popular 4th Street with many trendy restaurants and shops, and it hosts the Lilac Festival in <span class="date">May</span>. It is represented in the <span class="loc">Calgary City</span> Council by the Ward 8 councillor. The community has an area redevelopment plan in place. After a temporary location 40 km (25 mi) away (started in <span class="date">1872</span>), Oblate missionary Father Constantine Scollen, on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church, founded the permanent location in <span class="date">1875</span>. In <span class="date">1883</span>, Oblate missionary Father <span class="per">Albert Lacombe</span>, returning after a ten-year absence, obtained <span class="date">two quarter</span> sections of land for a "<span class="org">Mission</span> district" to ensure a strong French speaking Catholic community. Father Scollen who had lived in the area since <span class="date">1862</span> and who had witnessed Treaty Six with the Cree Nation and Treaty Seven with the Blackfeet Nation left for <span class="loc">Edmonton</span> and then the <span class="loc">U.S.A</span>. After obtaining the rest of the land that's <span class="date">now</span> <span class="org">Mission</span>, the area was incorporated on <span class="date">November 2, 1899</span> as the Village of Rouleauville named after <span class="per">Charles Rouleau</span>. The village was founded in what was then the <span class="loc">Northwest Territories</span>. Despite <span class="per">Lacombe</span>'s desire to preserve the French language and culture, Rouleauville progressively lost its French character, becoming overwhelmingly English. In <span class="date">1907</span> the village was annexed by <span class="loc">Calgary</span>. In the process all the French names of streets were replaced by <span class="loc">Calgary</span>'s street numbering system.</p><br><br>
