  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hobart</span> (/ˈhoʊbɑːt/) is the capital and most populous city of <span class="org">the Australian</span> island state of <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>. Founded in <span class="date">1803</span> as a penal colony, <span class="per">Hobart</span> is <span class="loc">Australia</span>'s second oldest capital city after <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>. The city is located in the state's south-east on the estuary of the <span class="loc">Derwent River</span>, making it the most southern of <span class="loc">Australia</span>'s capital cities and its harbour forms the second-deepest natural port in the world. In <span class="date">June 2013</span>, the city had a greater area population of approximately 217,973. Its skyline is dominated by the 1,271-metre (4,170 ft) <span class="loc">Mount Wellington</span>, and much of the city's waterfront consists of reclaimed land. It is the financial and administrative heart of <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, serving as the home port for both Australian and French Antarctic operations and acting as a major tourist hub, with over 1.192 million visitors in <span class="date">2011</span>/<span class="date">2012</span>. The metropolitan area is often referred to as <span class="per">Greater Hobart</span>, to differentiate it from the <span class="loc">City of Hobart</span>, one of the five local government areas that cover the city. The first settlement began in <span class="date">1803</span> as a penal colony at Risdon Cove on the eastern shores of the <span class="loc">Derwent River</span>, amid British concerns over the presence of French explorers. In <span class="date">1804</span> it was moved to a better location at the present site of <span class="per">Hobart</span> at Sullivans Cove. The city, initially known as <span class="loc">Hobart Town</span> or <span class="loc">Hobarton</span>, was named after <span class="per">Lord Hobart</span>, the Colonial Secretary.</p><br><br>
