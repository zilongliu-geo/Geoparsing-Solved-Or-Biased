One of the oldest inhabited sites in the <span class="loc">district of Aligarh</span>, <span class="loc">Jalali</span> is has been famous for its history and as one of the oldest communities of Saiyyids. <span class="loc">Jalali</span> was under the influence of both <span class="per">Mughals</span> and <span class="per">Britishers</span>. Its history can be traced back to 16th century (<span class="date">1628</span>-<span class="date">1658</span>) when Saiyyids migrated from <span class="loc">Srinagar</span>, <span class="loc">Kashmir</span> and settled down here.

He then got married to the daughter of <span class="per">Qazi</span> of <span class="loc">Jalali</span>. Most of the current Sayyids in <span class="loc">Jalali</span> are descendants of <span class="per">Ameer Kabir Sayyid</span> <span class="per">Ali Hamadani</span>. Syeds of <span class="loc">Jalali</span> were well educated and acquired good positions in Civil Services and Army of <span class="loc">India</span>.
