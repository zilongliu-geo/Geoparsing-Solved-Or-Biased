<p><span class="loc">Wenchang</span> (postal: <span class="loc">Mencheong</span>; Chinese: 文昌) is a county-level city in the northeast of <span class="loc">Hainan province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>.

Tianmeidong, a village located in <span class="loc">Wenchang</span>, received international attention in 2007 when they changed their name to Tianweiban; officials were unsure how to type the final character of the new name on computers, causing various difficulties for villagers.
