  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Fumo</span>, free on bail, will be sentenced <span class="date">July 13</span>. Former State Sen. <span class="per">Vincent J. Fumo</span> is to be sentenced at <span class="date">10 a.m. July 13</span>, according to an order from <span class="loc">U.S.</span> District Judge <span class="per">Ronald L. Buckwalter</span> filed <span class="date">yesterday</span>. <span class="per">Fumo</span> is free on $2 million bail, secured by his mansion and other real estate, after a jury convicted him <span class="date">Monday</span> on 137 counts of conspiracy, fraud, tax offenses, and obstruction of justice. He faces a long prison term. Prosecutors are demanding that <span class="per">Fumo</span>, a Democrat, pay the federal government $4,034,106.34 in forfeiture. They pegged the loss to <span class="org">the Senate</span> at $2.4 million. They said a <span class="loc">South Philadelphia</span> nonprofit, <span class="org">Citizens' Alliance for Better Neighborhoods</span>, had lost $1.5 million. <span class="per">Fumo</span>, they said, also should pay $115,000 to cover the cost of illegal free yacht trips he took courtesy of the Independence Seaport Museum in <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>.</p><br><br>
