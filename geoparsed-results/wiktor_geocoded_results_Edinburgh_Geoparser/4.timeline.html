  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> (formerly <span class="per">Imelda</span>) is a fifth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Romblon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> was known in Spanish times as <span class="loc">Cagbagacay</span>, after a bamboo plant called "bagacay" in the local dialect, which was in abundance in the area. Back then it was still a barrio of Guintigui-an town. In <span class="date">1910</span>, barrio <span class="loc">Cagbagacay</span> was renamed <span class="loc">Concepcion</span> after its patron the Immaculada <span class="loc">Concepcion</span>. On <span class="date">12 September 1982</span>, barrio <span class="loc">Concepcion</span> (<span class="loc">Norte</span>) together with barrios <span class="loc">Bonga</span> and <span class="loc">Concepcion Sur</span> were organized and created into a new municipality by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 234, authored by <span class="per">Assemblyman Nemesio Ganan Jr.</span> The new municipality was named "<span class="per">Imelda</span>", in honor of then First Lady <span class="per">Imelda Marcos</span>, as well as to distinguish the town from <span class="loc">Concepcion</span> municipality on <span class="per">Maestro de Campo</span> Island, also in <span class="loc">Romblon</span>. After the People <span class="per">Power</span> Revolution in <span class="date">1986</span> which toppled the regime of dictator <span class="per">Ferdinand Marcos</span>, the town was renamed <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> on <span class="date">17 April 1988</span> by virtue of Republic Act No. 6651, again in honor of its patron the <span class="date">Immaculate Conception</span> of the Blessed <span class="org">Virgin</span> Mary. Three new barangays were added to the municipality: <span class="loc">San Isidro</span>, <span class="loc">Paroyhog</span>, and <span class="loc">Sto</span>. <span class="loc">Nino</span>.</p><br><br>
