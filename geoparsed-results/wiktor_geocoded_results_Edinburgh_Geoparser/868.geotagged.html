<p><span class="loc">Dublin</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Laurens County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 16,201. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Laurens County</span>. The original settlement was named after <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. Because of <span class="loc">Dublin</span>'s location as a midpoint between Savannah and Atlanta, the town in recent decades became home to a small assortment of industrial distribution centers, which complemented various industries—textiles, furniture, and paper, among others—that had already established themselves there in the second half of the 20th century. Historically, however, <span class="loc">Dublin</span>'s economy was based on the local cotton, corn, and soybean trades, which blossomed as the town's central location enabled it to thrive with the growth of the railroad. Originally, <span class="loc">Dublin</span> and the surrounding area was home to Native Americans of the Muskogee people. Most of the Muskogee fled westward with the arrival of European settlers, many of them organizing themselves into armed resistance units, which fought government forces and British militias to protect their native territory well into the early 19th century. Ultimately, most of the Muskogee diaspora settled in what is now <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>.</p>
