<p><span class="loc">Berat</span> is a city and a municipality located in south-central <span class="loc">Albania</span>, and the capital of the <span class="loc">County of Berat</span>. In July 2008, the old town (<span class="loc">Mangalem district</span>) was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The municipality was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities <span class="loc">Berat</span>, <span class="loc">Otllak</span>, <span class="loc">Roshnik</span>, <span class="loc">Sinjë</span> and <span class="loc">Velabisht</span>, that became municipal units. The seat of the municipality is the city <span class="loc">Berat</span>. The total population is 60,031 (2011 census), in a total area of 379.98 km2. The population of the former municipality at the 2011 census was 32,606. The name of the city in Albanian is <span class="loc">Berat</span> or <span class="loc">Berati</span>, which is probably derived from the Old Bulgarian Бѣлградъ or Bel(i)grad (Белград, meaning "white city" in the <span class="loc">South Slavic</span> languages), under which name it was known in Greek, Bulgarian, Latin and Slavic documents during the High and Late Middle Ages. That name was rendered as Bellegrada (Βελλέγραδα) in Greek. It is believed to have been the site of an Ancient Macedonian stronghold, Antipatreia (Ancient Greek: Ἀντιπάτρεια "<span class="loc">city of Antipater</span>") or Antipatrea in Latin, while during the early Byzantine Empire the name of the town was Pulcheriopolis (Greek: Πουλχεριόπολις, "<span class="loc">city of Pulcheria</span>"). In the Republic of <span class="loc">Venice</span> the city was known as Belgrad di <span class="loc">Romania</span>, while in the Ottoman Empire it was also known as Belgrad-i Arnavud (Albanian <span class="loc">Belgrade</span>) to distinguish it from <span class="loc">Belgrade</span>.</p>
