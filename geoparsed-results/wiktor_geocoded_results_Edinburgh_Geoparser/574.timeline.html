  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Milton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Strafford County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,598 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. A manufacturing, resort and residential town, <span class="per">Milton</span> includes the village of <span class="per">Milton Mills</span>. The primary village in town, where 575 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Milton</span> census-designated place (CDP), and is located along <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 125 and the Salmon <span class="loc">Falls River</span>, just north of Route 75. Originally a part of <span class="loc">Rochester</span> variously called the "Northeast Parish", "Three Ponds" or "<span class="per">Milton Mills</span>", the town was settled in <span class="date">1760</span>. It would be set off and incorporated in <span class="date">1802</span> as "<span class="per">Milton</span>", the name either a contraction of "mill town", or else derived from a relative of the <span class="loc">Wentworth</span> colonial governors -- <span class="per">William Fitzwilliam</span>, <span class="per">Earl Fitzwilliam</span> and <span class="per">Viscount Milton</span>. The town of <span class="per">Fitzwilliam</span> also bears his name. Located along the Maine border, <span class="per">Milton</span> was the location of early industry which used water power from the Salmon <span class="loc">Falls River</span>. Six miles north of <span class="per">Milton</span>, the village of <span class="per">Milton Mills</span> was once called "Shapleigh Mills" and during the 19th century had 4 shoe factories, 2 woolen mills, 1 felt mill, 1 carriage shop and many sawmills. In <span class="date">1872</span>, <span class="per">Henry H. Townsend</span> established The Miltonia Mills, which manufactured fine wool blankets used by Admiral <span class="per">Robert E. Peary</span> on his expedition to the <span class="loc">North Pole</span>, and Admiral <span class="per">Richard E. Byrd</span> at <span class="loc">the Antarctic</span>. The company went bankrupt in <span class="date">1950</span>. The building then became Greene Tanning, a leather tannery where the employees of the mill made raw leather into leather known throughout the world as being some of the highest in quality.</p><br><br>
