  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Guide is a village on the edge of <span class="loc">Blackburn</span>, in <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>. It is located south of the town centre, and the M65 motorway passes around the south and east of the village with junction five situated immediately to the southwest of the village. People who were born and lived in Guide all of their lives are known as 'Guiders'. The traditional village pub, The <span class="loc">King Edward</span>, remains there. It is sited on a corner of the original crossroads. Also in the village is a Post Office, Cantonese restaurant and a <span class="org">Working Man's Club</span> which features artists and is available for private hire. There are a number of industrial and office buildings in the area, many of which have been built since the motorway was extended. Residents of the village have protested against the increasing industrial development of the area. The Guide reservoir was surrounded with countryside and <span class="date">now</span> features a new pub called The Willows, <span class="org">DW Sports Soccerdome &amp; Gym</span>. The main roads in the village were originally <span class="loc">Haslingden</span> Road (the former B6232), Blackamoor Road, and <span class="loc">School Lane</span> (both B6231). As part of the M65 extension work which was completed in <span class="date">1997</span>, a section of Haslingden Road, including the crossroads, was bypassed and the road became part of the A6077, which connects <span class="loc">Blackburn</span> town centre to the motorway.</p><br><br>
