  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county located in the state of <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 47,746. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is the city of <span class="loc">St. Albans</span>. It borders the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Quebec</span>. The county was created in <span class="date">1792</span> and organized in <span class="date">1796</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> metropolitan area. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is one of several <span class="loc">Vermont counties</span> created from land originally ceded by the state of <span class="loc">New York</span> on <span class="date">January 15, 1777</span> when <span class="loc">Vermont</span> declared itself to be a state distinct from <span class="loc">New York</span>. The land originally was contested by <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, and New Netherland, but it remained undelineated until <span class="date">July 20, 1764</span>, when King <span class="per">George III</span> established the boundary between <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span> along the west bank of the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>, north of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and south of the parallel of 45 degrees north latitude. <span class="loc">New York</span> assigned the land gained to <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. On <span class="date">March 12, 1772</span> <span class="loc">Albany County</span> was partitioned to create <span class="loc">Charlotte County</span>, and this situation remained until Vermont's independence from <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Britain</span>. However, this did not end the contest.</p><br><br>
