  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Fernando</span> is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Romblon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. The town of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> was established in <span class="date">1636</span> as <span class="per">Visita de Cauit</span> in what is <span class="date">today</span> <span class="per">Barangay Azagra</span>. It is one of two visitas in <span class="loc">Sibuyan Island</span>, the other being <span class="loc">Cajidiocan</span>. In <span class="date">1744</span>, Cajiodiocan was turned into a pueblo (town) which included <span class="per">Visita de Cauit</span>. The first villages or barrios of <span class="per">Visita de Cauit</span> were <span class="loc">Pag-alad</span>, <span class="loc">Cangumba</span>, <span class="loc">Mabolo</span> or <span class="loc">San Roque</span>, <span class="loc">Canjalon</span>, Espa√±a or Canago, <span class="loc">Agtiwa</span>, <span class="loc">Cangumon</span> and <span class="loc">Otod</span>. After <span class="loc">Romblon</span> was made a separate district in <span class="date">1853</span>, and the local government reorganization of <span class="date">1855</span>, 17 new pueblos were created including <span class="per">Visita de Cauit</span>. On <span class="date">3 February 1868</span>, <span class="per">Pueblo de Cauit</span> was renamed <span class="per">Pueblo de Azagra</span>. One of <span class="per">Azagra</span>'s villages, <span class="per">Visita</span> de <span class="loc">Pag-alad</span> was renamed <span class="per">Visita</span> de <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> in <span class="date">1882</span>, in honor of <span class="per">Ferdinand Magellan</span>. When civilian government was introduced to the province by the Americans on <span class="date">16 March 1901</span>, <span class="per">Azagra</span> was one of 11 new municipalities created. However, by <span class="date">the end of the year</span>, the seat of the municipality was transferred from <span class="loc">Azagra</span> to <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> village, thereby, changing the town's name.</p><br><br>
