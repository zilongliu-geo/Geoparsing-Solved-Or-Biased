<p>Garland, formerly known as <span class="loc">Germantown</span>, is a village in <span class="loc">Seward County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the Lincoln, <span class="loc">Nebraska Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 216 at the 2010 census. In 1874, the Midland Pacific Railroad built the first railway in <span class="loc">Seward County</span>, laying tracks from Lincoln to <span class="loc">Seward</span>. To finance the construction of the new line, the railroad sought money from the county. However, the residents of the southern portion of the county voted overwhelmingly against the bond issue in an 1871 election: they were displeased at having been bypassed by an earlier railroad line, anticipated no benefits from the new line, and were angry with <span class="loc">Seward</span>, which had won the county seat away from the southern town of <span class="loc">Milford</span>. The failure of the bond issue forced the railroad to seek support from the northern portions of the county; so rather than following the desirable route up the valley of <span class="loc">Middle Creek</span>, the company agreed to build the line through Malcolm and then up into the hills of northeastern <span class="loc">Seward County</span>. This measure won enough support for the bonds to be approved in 1872.</p>
