  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salwa</span> (Arabic: سلوى‎) (place of the casuals) is an area in Hawalli Governorate in <span class="loc">Kuwait</span>, bordering <span class="loc">Rumaithiya</span> to the north and <span class="loc">Messila</span> to the south. To the east (across Cooperative Road), it overlooks the <span class="loc">Persian Gulf</span>. Divided into twelve blocks, it is a residential area with a population on 40,000 including Kuwaitis, Westerners, British, Egyptians, Asians (Sri Lankens, Nepalies, Philipinas, Indians and Bangalies) and a small minority of Arabs for instance Lebanese. <span class="loc">Salwa</span> is one of the only few places in <span class="loc">Kuwait</span> for having 2-3 story buildings which gives you a clear view of the City towers that is 15 Kilometers (10 miles) away. Every block will always have a group of shops including grocery stores,a few <span class="org">Starbucks</span>, <span class="org">McDonald's</span>, Doughnut Shops, phone repair shops, salons and much more. Nice thing which you usually can't find in the <span class="loc">US</span> is that most of the restaurants, pharmacy's, and even mobile shops deliver in 30–60 minutes to your door. <span class="loc">Salwa</span> also has parks, a beach, outdoor gym, Arabic library's and diwanias ديوانيه which is a tent or building in every street which all Kuwaitis meet at every night and enjoy Arab coffee.</p><br><br>
