<p><span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> is a fifth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Romblon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. Legend says that the barrio was named after a beautiful, lovely daughter of one of its early settlers of the place. She was so loved and revered by the locals that they named her <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>, and in her death, they named the place after her. However, in Relacion de las Yslas <span class="loc">Filipinas</span> by Spanish conquistador Miguel de Loarca, it states that the barrio was named after <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> in the <span class="loc">province of Granada</span> in <span class="loc">Spain</span>. Its first settlers were Onhan-speaking <span class="loc">Negritos</span> from <span class="loc">Panay Island</span> who emigrated to Tablas as early as 1730. During the Spanish colonial period, <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> was a barrio of neighboring Looc town until 1855 when it was established as a separate pueblo or town. It was abolished and reverted into a barrio again in 1868. In 1892, the Spaniards restored <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>'s municipal status, which would remain until the American colonial period. <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> was one 11 municipalities created in <span class="loc">Romblon</span> when civilian government was established in the province. However, on 10 March 1917, it was abolished and reverted once more into a barrio of <span class="loc">Looc</span>. On 8 January 1940, by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 581, authored by Romblon congressman Leonardo Festin, the municipality of <span class="loc">Looc</span> was abolished and incorporated into a new special municipality called Tablas. Hence, <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> became a barrio of this special municipality.</p>
