  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wayne County</span> is a county located in the Ozark foothills in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 13,521. The county seat is <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. The county was officially organized on <span class="date">December 11, 1818</span>, and is named after General "Mad" <span class="per">Anthony Wayne</span> who served in the American Revolutionary War. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> was created in <span class="date">December 1818</span> by the last <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Territorial Legislature out of parts of <span class="loc">Cape Girardeau</span> and <span class="loc">Lawrence counties</span> and thus predates the state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span> being admitted to the <span class="org">Union</span>. In <span class="date">March 1819</span>, Congress established the Territory of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> and most of <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Territory became <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Territory. The small strip of “Old <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>” that had been orphaned in <span class="loc">Missouri</span> was added to <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> by the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> State Constitution of <span class="date">1820</span>. The <span class="loc">Osage</span> Strip along the Kansas border was added in <span class="date">1825</span>. From 1825-1831, <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> was an enormous area larger than <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, and <span class="loc">Delaware</span> combined. All or part of 32 counties in <span class="loc">Missouri</span> were at one point part of <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>. When <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> was formed, five commissioners were appointed to govern the county. They chose a small settlement known locally as Cedar Cabin located on the St. <span class="loc">Francis River</span> to be the county seat and named it <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. In <span class="date">1900</span>, <span class="loc">Greenville</span> had a population of about 1,000. By <span class="date">1940</span>, the population had declined to 572. The town was relocated by the construction of Lake Wappapello in <span class="date">1941</span> and the new town only had a population of 270 in <span class="date">1950</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, approximately 450 people call Greenville home.</p><br><br>
