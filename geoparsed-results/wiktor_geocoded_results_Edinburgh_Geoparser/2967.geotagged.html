<p><span class="loc">Andara</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Mukwe Constituency</span>, <span class="loc">Kavango East</span>, <span class="loc">Namibia</span>. Located 200km east of <span class="loc">Rundu</span>, it is inhabited primarily by the Hambukushu people. Catholic fathers of the organization Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate founded the Andara Mission in 1913. Possibilities for this were examined already in 1903 and 1907, and in January 1908 fathers Franz Krist and Franz Lauer together with lay brother Georg Kurz founded the mission. Father Krist left back for <span class="loc">Grootfontein</span> after a few weeks, but he died along the way. When a new expedition arrived in <span class="loc">Andara</span>, they only found two graves. Lauer and Kurz had meanwhile died of blackwater fever. The new expedition also ran into difficulties, when one its members misfired his gun and King Libebe of the Hambukushu turned hostile to the missionaries. They now had to move to the Gcirikus, to King Nyangana in a place that was also called Nyangana. King Libebe soon became reconciled with the missionaries, and the German fathers re-established <span class="loc">Andara</span> in 1913. The second attempt was done under leadership of father Joseph Gotthardt, who later became Archbishop of South West Africa.</p>
