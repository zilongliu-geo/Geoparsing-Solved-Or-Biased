  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hampton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 14,976 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Located beside the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>, <span class="loc">Hampton</span> is home to <span class="loc">Hampton</span> Beach, a <span class="date">summer</span> tourist destination. The densely populated central settlement of the town, where 9,656 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Hampton</span> census-designated place (CDP) and is centered on the intersection of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 1 and NH 27. First called the Plantation of Winnacunnet, <span class="loc">Hampton</span> was one of four original <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> townships chartered by the General Court of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, which then held authority over the colony. "Winnacunnet" is an Algonquian Abenaki word meaning "pleasant pines" and is the name of the town's high school, serving students from <span class="loc">Hampton</span> and surrounding towns. In <span class="date">March 1635</span>, <span class="per">Richard Dummer</span> and <span class="per">John Spencer</span> of the <span class="loc">Byfield</span> section in <span class="loc">Newbury</span>, came round in their shallop, came ashore at the landing and were much impressed by the location. <span class="per">Dummer</span>, who was a member of the General Court, got that body to lay its claim to the section and plan a plantation here. The <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> of <span class="date">March 3, 1636</span> ordered that <span class="per">Dummer</span> and <span class="per">Spencer</span> be given power to "To presse men to build there a Bound house".</p><br><br>
