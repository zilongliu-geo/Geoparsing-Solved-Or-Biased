  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A recall issued <span class="date">last week</span> for Thomas the Tank Engine toys made in <span class="loc">China</span> and containing lead-based paint, is the latest scare for consumers, and follows recent scandals involving Chinese-made pet food, pharmaceuticals, toothpaste and other toys, <span class="org">The New York Times</span> has reported in a series of articles. <span class="date">Last week</span>, RC2, a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> toy company based in Oak Brook, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, issued a recall for its popular wooden "Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends" train sets. The recall involved 1.5 million "Thomas Wooden Railway" vehicles and train sets sold at toy stores and various retailers across the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> from <span class="date">January 2005</span> through <span class="date">June 2007</span>. A subsequent recall has been issued in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, where Thomas the Tank Engine was originated in <span class="date">the 1940s</span> as a character in a children's story by the <span class="per">Reverend W.V.</span> Awdry. Around 70,000 toys are involved in the <span class="loc">UK</span> recall, according to <span class="org">The Guardian</span>. "RC2 has determined that the surface paints on the recalled products contain lead. Lead is toxic if ingested by young children and can cause adverse health effects," the Consumer <span class="per">Product Safety Commission</span> said in a press release dated <span class="date">June 13</span>. "Consumers should take the recalled toys away from young children immediately and contact <span class="org">RC2 Corp.</span> for a replacement toy," the commission said. Those "adverse health effects" could include brain and nerve damage, especially in young children, as well as blood and brain disorders. Severe lead poisoning causes vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, anemia, loss of appetite, headaches and in particularly high doses, coma and death. In an article on <span class="date">Monday</span>, <span class="org">The New York Times</span> reported that recalls have been issued for 24 different toys in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> in <span class="date">the past year</span>, and every one of them was made in <span class="loc">China</span>. According to the Toy Industry Association, toys made in <span class="loc">China</span> account for around 70 percent to 80 percent of all the toys sold in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>, <span class="org">The Times</span> said. "These are items that children are supposed to be playing with," <span class="per">Prescott Carlson</span> was quoted as saying by <span class="org">The Times</span>. <span class="per">Carlson</span> is a co-founder of a child-safety website called Imperfect Parent, which tracks recalls of toys and other baby products. "It should be at a point where companies in the <span class="loc">United States</span> that are importing these items are held liable," <span class="per">Carlson</span> said. RC2 would not comment to <span class="org">The Times</span>, and a Consumer Product Safety Commission spokesman would not say how long ago the problem with the lead paint was discovered. For a follow-up article on <span class="date">Tuesday</span>, <span class="org">The Times</span> visited a factory in <span class="loc">Dongguan</span>, in <span class="loc">China</span>'s <span class="loc">Guangdong province</span>, where the "<span class="org">Thomas and Friends</span>" toys are made. The paper interviewed workers and took photos on the factory floor. "You're intruding," a factory manager identified only as Zhong was quoted as telling the reporters. "Tell me, why exactly are you here?" During the visit, a reporter, translator and a photographer were detained by factory officials, and released <span class="date">a day later</span> after local police and government officials intervened. The factory also produces other toys for RC2, including toy <span class="per">John Deere</span> trucks, NASCAR racing models and MandM's cars, <span class="org">The Times</span> said. RC2 makes the toys under licenses from various companies. The "<span class="org">Thomas and Friends</span>" toys are made under license from Hit Entertainment, which owns the "Thomas" brand.</p><br><br>
