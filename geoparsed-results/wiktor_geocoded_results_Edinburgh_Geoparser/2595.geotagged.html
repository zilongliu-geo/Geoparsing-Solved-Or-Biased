<p>Kita is a town and urban commune in western <span class="loc">Mali</span>. The town is the capital of the Kita Cercle in the <span class="loc">Kayes Region</span>. It lies on the eastern slope of Mount Kita (Bambara: "Kita-kulu"), known for its caves and rock paintings. Today, the town is known for its music, its annual Roman Catholic pilgrimage and its role as a processing center for the surrounding cotton- and peanut-growing region. Kita lies on the Dakar-Niger Railway and is the largest transit hub between <span class="loc">Bamako</span> (112 miles) and <span class="loc">Kayes</span> (205 miles). In the 2009 census the urban commune had a population of 48,947. In November 1955, Kita became a commune of average exercise. On March 2, 1966, Kita became a commune of full exercise. The town grew in the 1990s around the cotton industry, but this has since declined. A fictionalized version of Kita features as the setting for Malian author Massa Makan Diabaté's "Kouta Trilogy" (Le lieutenant de Kouta, Le coiffeur de Kouta, and Le boucher de Kouta).
