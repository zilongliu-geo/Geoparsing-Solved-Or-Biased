  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Canterbury</span> (/ˈkæntərbri/, /-bəri/, or /-bɛri/) is a historic English cathedral city and <span class="org">UNESCO World Heritage Site</span>, which lies at the heart of the <span class="loc">City of Canterbury</span>, a local government <span class="loc">district of Kent</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. It lies on the <span class="loc">River Stour</span>. The <span class="per">Archbishop of Canterbury</span> is the primate of the <span class="org">Church of England</span> and the worldwide Anglican Communion owing to the importance of <span class="per">St Augustine</span>, who served as the apostle to the pagan Kingdom of <span class="loc">Kent</span> around the turn of the 7th century. The city's cathedral became a major focus of pilgrimage following the <span class="date">1170</span> martyrdom of <span class="per">Thomas Becket</span>. A journey of pilgrims to his shrine served as the frame for <span class="per">Geoffrey Chaucer</span>'s 14th-century classic The <span class="per">Canterbury</span> Tales. <span class="per">Canterbury</span> is a popular tourist destination: consistently one of the most-visited cities in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, the city's economy is heavily reliant upon tourism. The city has been occupied since Paleolithic times and served as the capital of the Celtic <span class="per">Cantiaci</span> and <span class="per">Jute</span> Kingdom of <span class="loc">Kent</span>. Many historical structures fill the area, including a city wall founded in Roman times and rebuilt in the 14th century, the ruins of <span class="per">St Augustine</span>'s Abbey and a Norman castle, and the oldest extant school in the world, The <span class="org">King's School</span>. Modern additions include the <span class="org">Marlowe Theatre</span> and the <span class="loc">St Lawrence</span> Ground, home of the <span class="org">Kent County Cricket Club</span>. There is also a substantial student population, brought about by the presence of the <span class="org">University of Kent, Canterbury Christ Church University</span>, the <span class="org">University for the Creative Arts</span>, and the Girne American University <span class="per">Canterbury</span> campus. <span class="per">Canterbury</span> remains, however, a relatively small city in terms of geographical size, when compared with other British cities.</p><br><br>
