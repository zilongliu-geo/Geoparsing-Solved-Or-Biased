<p>Newmarket is an Auckland suburb to the south-east of the central business district. With its high building density, especially of retail shops, it is considered <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>'s premier retailing area, and a rival of local competitor Auckland CBD. It is also considered the fashion capital of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. While as early as 1873, Newmarket has been referred to as a 'suburb' of <span class="loc">Auckland</span>, in fact until the amalgamation of the borough councils into <span class="loc">Auckland City</span> Council in 1989, local governance was by the Newmarket Borough Council, with its own Mayor. The borough, while one of the smallest in the <span class="loc">Auckland Region</span>, was also one of the busiest. This is especially true of <span class="loc">Broadway</span>, the main street, which has large shopping centres and smaller retail tenancies (with a total of over 400 stores as of mid-2010), two movie theatres, and numerous restaurants, bars and cafés. The <span class="loc">Maori</span> called this area, particularly the south of the current Newmarket, Te Tī Tūtahi, 'the cabbage tree standing alone' or 'the cabbage tree of singular importance', referring to a tree which stood on the corner of <span class="loc">Mortimer Pass</span> and <span class="loc">Broadway</span> (according to other references at the corner of <span class="loc">Clovernook Road</span> and <span class="loc">Broadway</span>) until 1908. Some of the cabbage trees in the area are descended from this tree, after Alfred Buckland rescued a portion and replanted trees around Newmarket and as far away as Bucklands Beach.</p>
