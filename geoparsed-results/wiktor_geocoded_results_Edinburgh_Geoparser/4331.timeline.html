  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jones County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 28,669. The county seat is Gray. The county was created on <span class="date">December 10, 1807</span> and named after <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Representative <span class="per">James Jones</span>. <span class="loc">Jones County</span> along with <span class="loc">Morgan County</span>, <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>, and Old Randolph were established by an act of the <span class="org">Georgia General Assembly</span> passed on <span class="date">December 10, 1807</span> from land that had originally been part <span class="loc">Baldwin County</span> in <span class="date">1803</span> and, earlier, part of the <span class="loc">Creek Nation</span>. <span class="loc">Jones County</span> was originally bounded by a line running North 56° East to <span class="loc">Commissioners Creek</span>, then North 15° West to <span class="loc">Cedar Creek</span>, then up the creek to corner <span class="loc">Randolph County</span> and <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>, then along a line to <span class="loc">Ocmulgee River</span>, and then down the river to where the old county line between <span class="loc">Wilkinson County</span> and <span class="loc">Baldwin County</span> was. It excluded parts of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Bibb County</span> east of the <span class="loc">Ocmulgee River</span>, including the location of Fort <span class="per">Benjamin Hawkins</span>, as they were part of a reserve guaranteed to the <span class="loc">Creek Nation</span>. Those areas were later added to <span class="loc">Jones County</span> after the Treaty of Indian Springs.</p><br><br>
