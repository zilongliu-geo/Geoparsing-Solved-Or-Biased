<p><span class="loc">Norwood</span> is a village located in St. <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 census, the village had a total population of 1,657. The Village of <span class="loc">Norwood</span> is on the town line of two towns so that it is partly in the Town of <span class="loc">Potsdam</span> and partly in the Town of <span class="loc">Norfolk</span>. The village is north of <span class="loc">Potsdam</span>. The community was known early in its history as "Raquetteville." <span class="loc">Norwood</span> as it is known today, grew out of the shadows of <span class="loc">Potsdam</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> in the 1870s. In 1871 the growing <span class="loc">Potsdam</span> hamlet became a village entered into existence as the "Village of <span class="loc">Potsdam</span> Junction." Villagers later wanted to further distinguish the town by disassociating its name with <span class="loc">Potsdam</span> and submitted proposal to the federal government to become the Village of <span class="loc">Baldwin</span> but it was discovered that there was already a post office named <span class="loc">Baldwin</span>. A short time later on April 15, 1875 a new name was voted on and <span class="loc">Norwood</span> was selected. The mayor of <span class="loc">Norwood</span> is currently Tim Levison. The Benjamin Gordon Baldwin House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.</p>
