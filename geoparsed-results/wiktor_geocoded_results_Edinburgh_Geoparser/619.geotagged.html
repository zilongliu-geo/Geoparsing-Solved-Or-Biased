<p><span class="loc">Belmont</span> is a city in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Mateo County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> Bay Area, on the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> Peninsula halfway between <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="loc">San Jose</span>.

Its population was 25,835 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Ralston</span> Hall is a historic landmark built by Bank of California founder, William Chapman Ralston, on the campus of <span class="loc">Notre Dame</span> de Namur University. It was built around a villa formerly owned by Count Cipriani, an Italian aristocrat. The locally famous "<span class="loc">Waterdog Lake</span>" is also located in the foothills and highlands of <span class="loc">Belmont</span>. One of two surviving structures from the Panama-Pacific International Exposition is on Belmont Avenue (the other is the <span class="loc">Palace of Fine Arts</span> in <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>). The building was brought to <span class="loc">Belmont</span> by E.D. Swift shortly after the exposition closed in 1915. Swift owned a large amount of land in the area.
