  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A real snow day. School is closed across the region opening the door for local kids to finally learn what it's like to have a snow day when there's actual snow for sledding and snowballs. It's been a while since school was cancelled due to this amount of accumulation. If you have the requisite bread and milk, feel free to turn your attention to locating a sled, some gloves and a hillside covered in snow. Sound simple? Well, it's <span class="loc">Richmond</span> and sledding options are a bit limited. There's a few hills, but it's hard to find a friend (or make a friend) with a decent decline in their backyard. In <span class="loc">Henrico County</span>, if a park is open you can use it for sled riding, just don't trespass on someone else's property, says a representative for <span class="loc">Henrico County</span> Police. Sledding is also permitted in <span class="loc">Chesterfield County</span> parks as long as park rules are followed, says Officer Morton with <span class="loc">Chesterfield County</span> Police. The biggest challenge may not be finding a park in <span class="loc">Chesterfield County</span>, but finding a hillside worthy of a sled. The <span class="date">winter</span> storm has not been a long overdue play date for everyone. Travel is hazardous during a <span class="date">winter</span> storm so take your time, slow down and keep plenty of distance between your vehicle and the one ahead of you. This is also a great time to practice driving without talking on the phone or sending text messages. You know who you are.</p><br><br>
