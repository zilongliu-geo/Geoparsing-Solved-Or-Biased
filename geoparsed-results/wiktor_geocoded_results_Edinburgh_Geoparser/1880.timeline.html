  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salisbury</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Litchfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> of the <span class="loc">New York</span> metropolitan area. The town is the northwest-most in the State of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. The MA-NY-CT (Massachusetts-New York-Connecticut) Tri-State Marker is located just on the border of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>. The population was 3,977 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> was established and incorporated in <span class="date">1741</span>, and contains several historic homes, though some were replaced by larger modern structures in the late 20th century. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> was named for a town in <span class="loc">England</span>. Historian <span class="per">Ed Kirby</span> tells us that traces of iron were discovered in what was to become <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> in <span class="date">1728</span>, with the discovery of the large deposit at <span class="loc">Old Hill</span> (later Ore Hill) in <span class="date">1731</span> by <span class="per">John Pell</span> and <span class="per">Ezekiel Ashley</span>. Beginning before the Revolution, during the Federal period, and until around <span class="date">1920</span>, <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> was the seat of an important iron industry. Additional iron mines were opened, mostly in the Western end of the township, although historian <span class="per">Diana Muir</span> dismisses them as "scarcely big enough to notice," with the further disadvantage of not being near a river large enough to ship iron to market at a reasonable cost. The solution, according to <span class="per">Muir</span>, was to pour labor into the iron, working it into a quality of wrought iron so high that it could be used even for gun barrels. This fetched a high price and made <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> iron the celebrated choice of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>'s early nineteenth-century arms industry as well as the preeminent source of cast iron railroad car wheels until they were superseded by steel wheels. Peter P. Everts, an agent of the mid-19th-century mines, however, stated the quality of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> iron varied. The iron industry in <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> became inactive following World War I, a plan to revive it during World War II was never implemented, and the mines remain under water.</p><br><br>
