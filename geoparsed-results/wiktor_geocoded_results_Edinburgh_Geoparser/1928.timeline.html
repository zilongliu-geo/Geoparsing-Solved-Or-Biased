  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Thornton</span> is a village and civil parish on the <span class="loc">River Great Ouse</span> about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) north-east of <span class="loc">Buckingham</span> in the <span class="loc">Aylesbury Vale</span> <span class="loc">district of Buckinghamshire</span>. The toponym is derived from the Old English for "thorn tree by a farm". The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as Ternitone. The earliest record of the <span class="org">Church of England</span> Church of <span class="loc">Saint Michael</span> and All Angels dates from <span class="date">1219</span>. The present building is 14th-century, but was dramatically restored between <span class="date">1770</span> and <span class="date">1800</span> and largely rebuilt by the Gothic Revival architect <span class="per">John Tarring</span> in <span class="date">1850</span>. The restorers retained a number of mediaeval features, including the 14th-century belltower, chancel arch and clerestory and 15th century clerestory windows. The <span class="org">Tudor Revival Thornton House</span> was also built to <span class="per">John Tarring</span>'s designs in <span class="date">1850</span>. It incorporates parts of a mediaeval house that was modernised in the 18th century. <span class="loc">Thornton College</span>, <span class="date">an independent day</span> and boarding school for girls, occupies the former <span class="loc">Manor House</span>. The school educates girls aged 4 - 16 and has a nursery for boys and girls aged 2Â½ to 4. Since the Sisters of <span class="per">Jesus</span> and <span class="per">Mary</span> (a Roman Catholic religious order), purchased the site in <span class="date">1917</span>, there have been a significant number of new developments at the school, most recently an award winning <span class="per">Science</span> and <span class="per">Junior</span> Classroom wing (AVDC Outstanding Design Award). The school <span class="date">now</span> has over 370 pupils.</p><br><br>
