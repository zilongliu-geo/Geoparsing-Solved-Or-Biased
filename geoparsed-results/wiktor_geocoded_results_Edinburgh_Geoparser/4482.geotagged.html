<p>Bury is a village and civil parish in <span class="loc">Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Bury lies approximately 7 miles (11 km) north of <span class="loc">Huntingdon</span> and is near to <span class="loc">Ramsey</span> and <span class="loc">St Ives</span>. Bury is situated within <span class="loc">Huntingdonshire</span> which is a non-metropolitan <span class="loc">district of Cambridgeshire</span> as well as being a historic <span class="loc">county of England</span>. Bury and Hepmangrove, under the name of Bury-cum-Hepmangrove, appear to have originally been separate manors but were united for certain purposes before the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. Known as: <span class="loc">Biri</span>, Byrig (10th century), Byri (12th century), Byry (13th century). Hegmangrave (11th century), Hecmundegrave (12th century), Heitmundgrave, Hetumgrove, Heytmongrave (14th century). The parish lies to the South of <span class="loc">Ramsey</span> and is of a very irregular shape, projecting a considerable distance into the fen on the east side of the road from <span class="loc">Ramsey</span> to <span class="loc">St Ives</span>. The land rises on both sides of the Brook which runs through the parish from north-east to south-west from 16 feet above ordnance datum at the Brook to 66 ft. on the north-east side, and 50 ft. on the south-west. All of the fenland and much of the highland is ploughed. The soil is a strong black loam and the sub-soil is clay. The main crops are wheat, oats, beans and peas on the highland, and potatoes, celery, sugar-beet and ordinary cereals on the fenland.</p>
