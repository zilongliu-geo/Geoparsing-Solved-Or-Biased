  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Claremont</span> is a Southern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> community located in the north part of the <span class="loc">City of Pickering</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Historically, <span class="loc">Claremont</span> was part of <span class="loc">Pickering Township</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario County</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span> until <span class="date">1974</span> when <span class="loc">Ontario County</span> was amalgamated into the <span class="loc">Regional Municipality of Durham</span> established at that time. It is one of many rural villages with suburban type housing mixed with older, historic buildings in the <span class="org">Greater Toronto Area</span>. Brock Road, the main north-south Regional road in the area was realigned to bypass the village to the east in <span class="date">1970</span>. <span class="loc">Claremont</span> is situated just below the Oak Ridges Moraine in the <span class="loc">Greenbelt</span>. Typical of the moraine countryside, around 50 to 70% of the land area around <span class="loc">Claremont</span> is forested. The remaining land around the village is wooded farmland and streams. Until the establishment of regional government in <span class="date">1974</span>, the municipal offices of the former Township of <span class="loc">Pickering</span> were located in <span class="loc">Claremont</span>. Access to and traffic through <span class="loc">Claremont</span> increased greatly with the completion of the eastern extension of the Highway 407 highway, terminating at the Brock Road exit which opened in <span class="date">2001</span>. The Havelock Subdivision of the Canadian Pacific Railway runs through <span class="loc">Claremont</span>. This line is used for freight traffic, but there have been proposals for the return of passenger service as part of a GO Transit expansion to <span class="loc">Peterborough</span>.</p><br><br>
