  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Providence is a ghost town on the north side of the <span class="loc">Maumee</span> River in southern Providence Township, <span class="loc">Lucas County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, about 24 miles (39 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Toledo</span>. After suffering a destructive fire and a cholera epidemic in mid-19th century, the village was abandoned. In this period, canal traffic had also fallen off. The area is <span class="date">now</span> maintained as Providence Metropark of <span class="loc">Toledo</span>, featuring numerous elements of the canal era, including a mule-drawn canal boat on a restored section of the <span class="loc">Miami</span> and <span class="loc">Erie Canal</span>, and an operating saw and gristmill. The village of Providence was founded by a French Canadian, <span class="loc">Peter</span> Manor, who was the first white man to settle upriver on the <span class="loc">Maumee</span> River away from <span class="loc">Lake Erie</span>. He arrived there in <span class="date">1816</span> in order to establish a fur trading post for the North West Fur Company, then based in <span class="loc">Montreal</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. But the <span class="loc">United States</span> prohibited Canadian traders from operating below the border and he was closed down. In <span class="date">1822</span>, Manor had a sawmill erected next to the river, and a gristmill was built in <span class="date">1835</span>. This was about 24 miles from the river's mouth on <span class="loc">Maumee Bay</span>, where there was still an Odawa people village, part of a 34-square mile reserve on the south side of the river.</p><br><br>
