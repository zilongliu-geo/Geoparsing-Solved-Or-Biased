It served as the capital of Las Californias from 1697 to 1777, and The town was founded in 1697 by Jesuit missionaries, who found a steady spring of fresh water on this site, as the Misión Nuestra Señora de <span class="loc">Loreto</span>. The Jesuits were expelled in 1767, and control of the <span class="loc">Baja California</span> missions was given to the Franciscans. In 1769, the Franciscans were ordered to turn over the Baja missions to the Dominican order and accompany the expedition of Gaspar de Portolà to establish new missions in the unexplored northern frontier that became Alta California. The expedition departed from <span class="loc">Loreto</span> on March 24, 1769. The town served as the capital of the <span class="loc">province of Las Californias</span> from its founding until the capital was moved to <span class="loc">Monterey</span> on February 3, 1777. In 1768, the province had been split into Alta California (today's <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span>) and <span class="loc">Baja California</span>. At first, the two provinces continued with a single governor. Later, the town became the headquarters for the Lieutenant Governor of California Viejo (the province of <span class="loc">Baja California</span>).</p>
