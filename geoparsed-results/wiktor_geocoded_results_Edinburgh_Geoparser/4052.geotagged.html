<p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 8,149, making it the fifth-least populous county in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The county seat is Clarendon, while its largest city is <span class="loc">Brinkley</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>'s 20th county, formed on November 2, 1829, from portions of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> and <span class="loc">Phillips</span> counties, and named for James Monroe, the fifth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Sheffield Nelson, the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Republican National Committeeman and his party's gubernatorial nominee in 1990 and 1994, was born in 1940 in <span class="loc">Monroe County</span>. A portion of <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is represented in the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> State Senate by the Republican Ronald R. Caldwell, a real estate businessman from <span class="loc">Wynne</span> in <span class="loc">Cross County</span>. The state representative from <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a Democrat, Marshall Wright, a lawyer from <span class="loc">Forrest City</span> in St. <span class="loc">Francis County</span>. Settlement in <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> began when Dedrick Pike settled where the <span class="loc">Cache River</span> enters the <span class="loc">White River</span> in 1816. The settlement was named <span class="loc">Mouth of the Cache</span>, and a post office by that name was opened years later. The community renamed itself Clarendon in 1824 in honor of the Earl of Clarendon. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was established under the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> territorial legislature in 1829, and the county seat was established at <span class="loc">Lawrenceville</span> where a jail and courthouse were erected. A ferry across the <span class="loc">White River</span> came in 1836, and the county seat was moved to Clarendon in 1857, with the new brick courthouse nearly finished at the outbreak of the American Civil War. The county sent five units into Confederate service, and the Union captured Clarendon in 1863 and destroyed the city. Martial law was established for four years after the war as guerilla warfare continued and the county struggled to rebuild. The Union had completely dismandled the brick courthouse and shipped the bricks to <span class="loc">De Valls</span> Bluff. The <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> Sun was established in 1876.</p>
