  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Geneva</span> (/dʒᵻˈniːvə/, French: Genève [ʒə.nɛv], Arpitan: Genèva [dzəˈnɛva], German: Genf [ɡɛnf], Italian: Ginevra [dʒiˈneːvra], Romansh: <span class="loc">Genevra</span>) is the second most populous city in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span> (after Zürich) and is the most populous <span class="loc">city of Romandy</span>, the French-speaking part of <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. Situated where the Rhône exits <span class="loc">Lake Geneva</span>, it is the capital of the Republic and <span class="org">Canton</span> of <span class="loc">Geneva</span>. The municipality (ville de Genève) has a population (as of <span class="date">December 2014</span>) of 197,376, and the canton (which is essentially the city and its inner-ring suburbs) has 482,545 residents. In <span class="date">2011</span>, the compact agglomération franco-valdo-genevoise (Greater Geneva or Grand Genève) had 915,000 inhabitants in both – <span class="loc">Switzerland</span> and <span class="loc">France</span> (&lt; 30mins distance). Within Swiss territory, the commuter area named "Métropole lémanique" contains a population of 1.25 million. This area is essentially spread east from <span class="loc">Geneva</span> towards the Riviera area (<span class="loc">Vevey</span>, <span class="loc">Montreux</span>) and north-east towards Yverdon-les-Bains, in the neighbouring canton of <span class="loc">Vaud</span>. <span class="loc">Geneva</span> is a global city, a financial center, and worldwide center for diplomacy due to the presence of numerous international organizations, including the headquarters of many of the agencies of the United Nations and the <span class="loc">Red Cross</span>. <span class="loc">Geneva</span> is the city that hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world. It is also the place where the Geneva Conventions were signed, which chiefly concern the treatment of wartime non-combatants and prisoners of war.</p><br><br>
