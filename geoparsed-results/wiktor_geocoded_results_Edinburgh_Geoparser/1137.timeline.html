  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Brighton</span> is a suburb 27 km north of <span class="loc">Hobart</span>, in <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is between <span class="loc">Pontville</span> and the outer <span class="loc">Hobart</span> suburb of <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> on the Midland Highway. At the <span class="date">2006</span> census, <span class="per">Brighton</span> had a population of 3,145. From 1826 onwards, the township was the site of the <span class="per">Brighton</span> Barracks, a military accommodation facility until sold off for subdivision in the early 2000s. <span class="per">A Brighton</span> Post Office opened on <span class="date">1 June 1832</span>. This was renamed <span class="loc">Pontville</span> in <span class="date">1895</span> and closed in <span class="date">1973</span>. The current <span class="per">Brighton</span> office opened on <span class="date">22 May 1964</span>. More recently it was used as emergency accommodation for refugees fleeing the conflicts in eastern <span class="loc">Europe</span>, namely <span class="loc">Kosovo</span>. The area surrounding <span class="per">Brighton</span> was swept with bush and grass fires over the <span class="date">summer</span> of <span class="date">January 2003</span> with fires reaching Cartwright street, the old army camp and the Midland highway placing the town under extreme threat. The <span class="per">Brighton</span> area expected to see an increase in light industrial use, being serviced by both road &amp; rail with the construction of the <span class="per">Brighton</span> Transport Hub. The area is also the site of a major horse racing training facility located at <span class="per">Brighton</span> Racecourse known as the <span class="org">Brighton Training Centre</span>, serving the thoroughbred, trotting &amp; pacing industry.</p><br><br>
