<p><span class="loc">Marlborough</span> (/ˈmɔːlbrə/ MAWL-brə or /ˈmɑːlbərə/ MARL-brə) is a market town and civil parish in the English <span class="loc">county of Wiltshire</span> on the Old Bath Road, the old main road from <span class="loc">London</span> to Bath. It boasts the second widest high street in <span class="loc">Britain</span>, after <span class="loc">Stockton-on-Tees</span>. The town is on the <span class="loc">River Kennet</span>. The earliest sign of human habitation is a 62 feet (19 m) high prehistoric tumulus in the grounds of Marlborough College. Recent radiocarbon dating has found it to date from about 2400 BC. It is of similar age to the larger <span class="loc">Silbury Hill</span> about 5 miles (8.0 km) west of the town. Legend has it that the Mound is the burial site of Merlin and that the name of the town, <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> comes from Merlin's Barrow. On John Speed's map of <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span> (1611), the town's name is recorded as Marlinges boroe. The town's motto is <span class="loc">Ubi</span> nunc sapientis ossa Merlini - Where now are the bones of wise Merlin. More plausibly, the town's name probably derives from the medieval term for chalky ground "marl" – thus "town on chalk".</p>
