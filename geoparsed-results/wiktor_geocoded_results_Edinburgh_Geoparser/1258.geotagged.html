<p>Anderson is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Anderson</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area which encompasses <span class="loc">Madison County</span>. Anderson is the headquarters of the Church of God (Anderson) and home of Anderson University, which is affiliated with that denomination. Highlights of the city include the historic Paramount Theatre and the Gruenewald Historic House. The population was 56,129 at the 2010 census. This is down from 70,000 in 1970. Prior to the organization of <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, William Conner entered the land upon which Anderson is located. Conner later sold the ground to John and Sarah Berry, who donated 32 acres (129,000 mÂ²) of their land to <span class="loc">Madison County</span> on the condition that the county seat be moved from <span class="loc">Pendleton</span> to <span class="loc">Anderson</span>. John Berry laid out the first plat of Anderson on November 7, 1827. In 1828 the seat of justice was moved from <span class="loc">Pendleton</span> to <span class="loc">Anderson</span>. The city is named for Chief William "Adam" Anderson, whose mother was a Delaware Indian and whose father was of Swedish descent. Chief Anderson's Indian name was Kikthawenund meaning "creaking boughs". The Delaware village was known as Anderson's Town, though the Moravian Missionaries called it "The Heathen Town Four Miles Away." Anderson was also known as <span class="loc">Andersonton</span> before being formally organized as Anderson.</p>
