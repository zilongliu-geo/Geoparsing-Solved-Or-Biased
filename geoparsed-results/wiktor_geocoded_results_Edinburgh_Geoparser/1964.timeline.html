  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Topa</span> is a village in <span class="per">Mendhar</span> Tehsil, <span class="loc">Poonch district</span> in the Indian state of <span class="loc">Jammu</span> and <span class="loc">Kashmir</span>. During the Indo-Pakistani War of <span class="date">1965</span>, the Battle of <span class="loc">Topa</span> was fought here by 5 Gorkha Rifles. <span class="loc">Topa</span> is located at 33.65°N 74.11°E﻿ / 33.65; 74.11. It has an average elevation of 1,126 metres (3,694 feet). From anti infiltration operations conducted by the battalion from <span class="date">5 August 1965</span> onwards in <span class="loc">Rajouri</span> and <span class="loc">Mendhar Sectors</span> of <span class="loc">Jammu</span> and <span class="loc">Kashmir</span>, it was evident that many strong infiltrating columns of <span class="org">Pakistani Army</span> had been sent into our territory as part of <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>’s ‘Operation Gibraltar’. By <span class="date">third week of August</span> 65, Headquarter 52 Mountain Brigade (Brigadier later <span class="per">Lieutenant General R D Hira</span>, <span class="org">MVC</span>) had been inducted into the sector for clearance of infiltrators from <span class="loc">Mendhar</span>, <span class="loc">Surankot</span> and <span class="loc">Krishna</span> Ghati area. For the operations 4/5 GR (FF), 14 <span class="loc">Kumaon</span> and <span class="date">3/11</span> GR were put under command of the brigade and made responsible for anti infiltration operations in <span class="per">Mendhar</span> in the South and <span class="per">Krishna</span> <span class="loc">Gati</span> (KG) area of 93 Infantry Brigade Sector. Reports of major infiltration in <span class="per">Mendhar</span> and <span class="per">Balnoi</span> had been received and some of the roads had been blocked by <span class="loc">Paki</span> troops. Closer to <span class="loc">Mendhar</span>, <span class="loc">Paki</span>'s had occupied Topa feature, which effectively dominated fair weather road <span class="per">Mendhar</span> - <span class="per">Balnoi</span>, thus cutting off <span class="per">Balnoi</span> and <span class="per">Krishna</span> <span class="loc">Ghati</span> (93 Infantry Brigade). They had also established defences at a place called OP Hill, on the ridgeline across <span class="loc">Mendhar</span> River. The first priority of the brigade was to cut off maintenance routes of these <span class="loc">Paki</span> troops and clearance of road to <span class="per">Balnoi</span> and KG. Alfa Company of 21 <span class="org">AK Battalion Pakistan Army</span>, with additional troops and Razakars were reported to be occupying Topa Height (Pt 4571) and had effectively interdicted road communications in the area.</p><br><br>
