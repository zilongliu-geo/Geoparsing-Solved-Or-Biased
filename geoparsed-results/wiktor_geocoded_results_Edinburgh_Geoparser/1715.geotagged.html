<p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is a city in and the county seat of suburban <span class="loc">Williamson County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with a population of 47,400 at the 2010 census. Southwestern University, the oldest university in <span class="loc">Texas</span>, was founded in 1840 and is located in <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> about one-half mile from the historic square. Sun City <span class="loc">Texas</span> is a large retirement-oriented and age-restricted development that constitutes more than one-third of Georgetown's population. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> has a notable range of Victorian commercial and residential architecture. In 1976, a local historic ordinance was passed to recognize and protect the significance of the historic central business district, and in 1977, the <span class="loc">Williamson County</span> Courthouse Historical District, containing some 46 contributing structures, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is also known as the "Red Poppy" Capital of <span class="loc">Texas</span> for the red poppy (Papaver rhoeas) wildflowers planted throughout the city. Georgetown's Red Poppy Festival, which attracts up to 30,000 visitors annually, is held in April each year on the historic square. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> has been the site of human habitation since at least 9,000 B.C., and possibly considerably before that. The earliest known inhabitants of the county, during the late Pleistocene (Ice Age), can be linked to the Clovis culture, a Paleo-Indian culture characterized by the manufacture of distinctive "Clovis points." that first appeared around 9200 B.C., and possibly as early as 11,500 B.C., at the end of the last glacial period. One of the most important discoveries in recent times is that of the ancient skeletal remains dubbed "The Leanderthal Lady" because of its age and proximity to nearby community <span class="loc">Leander</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The site is immediately southwest of <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> and was discovered by accident by <span class="loc">Texas</span> <span class="loc">Department of Transportation</span> workers while core samples for a new highway were being drilled. The site has been extensively studied for many years, and samples carbon date the findings to the Pleistocene period, approximately 10,500 years ago (8500 BC). Archeological dig sites showing a much greater evidence of Archaic Period inhabitants have been found in burned rock middens at several sites along the <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> that are now inundated by <span class="loc">Granger Lake</span> and at the confluence of the North and <span class="loc">South San</span> Gabriel Rivers in <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>.</p>
