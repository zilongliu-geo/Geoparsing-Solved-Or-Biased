<p>Hamilton (Salish: čɫc̓lc̓lé ) is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Ravalli County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,348 at the 2010 census. Significant outlying population growth is shown in the area; the ZIP Code Tabulation Area for Hamilton's ZIP Code, 59840, had a population of 15,393 at the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau 2009 estimate. Hamilton was founded by copper king Marcus Daly in the late 19th century. It was named for J.W. Hamilton, who provided the right-of-way to the railroad. Daly is said to have wanted to begin business in the then county seat of <span class="loc">Grantsdale</span>, but was denied the opportunity. He supposedly founded Hamilton out of his own pocket as a reaction to being rebuffed at <span class="loc">Grantsdale</span>. The Ravalli County Museum, founded in 1955, is located in the former <span class="loc">Ravalli County</span> Courthouse and focuses on County history, natural history and art. In the summer of 2000, Hamilton made international headlines when forest fires throughout the Bitterroot Valley filled the area with smoke and prompted the evacuation of many residents. President Clinton declared a state of emergency in the area and dispatched National Guardsmen to assist with fighting the fires.</p>
