<p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a county located in the southwestern corner of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 26,446. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Altus</span>. According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, the county was named for two historical figures: President Andrew Jackson and Confederate General Stonewall Jackson. One source states only that the county was named for the former President, while an earlier source states it was only named for General Stonewall Jackson. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Altus</span>, <span class="loc">OK</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. After a dispute over the Adams-On√≠s Treaty of 1819, both the governments of the <span class="loc">United States</span> and the state of <span class="loc">Texas</span> claimed ownership of some 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km2) in what was then operated as <span class="loc">Greer County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Litigation followed, and in the case of <span class="loc">United States</span> v. State of <span class="loc">Texas</span> 162 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 1 (1896), issued on March 16, the <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span>, having original jurisdiction over the case, decided in favor of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Greer County</span> was then assigned to the Oklahoma Territory on May 4, 1896, and when <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> became a state, in addition to becoming <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, the region was also further split into <span class="loc">Greer</span>, <span class="loc">Harmon</span>, and part of <span class="loc">Beckham counties</span>.</p>
