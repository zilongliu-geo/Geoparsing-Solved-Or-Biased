It is the seat of its county. The population was 4,312 at the 2010 census. The town was settled in 1799 on an estate donated by local landowner William Campbell in order to establish a seat of government for a new county. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was not established by the state assembly until 1812, however. It was incorporated as a city in 1848. The city was probably named for the Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene. Local lore holds it was named by Campbell's wife after the abundant forests seen from the town's hilltop location. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> is located at 37°12′26″N 87°10′35″W (37.207158, -87.176499).

The 1987 Encyclopedia of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> refers to <span class="loc">Greenville</span> as "the unofficial capital of the Black Belt", a reference to the area's production of coal and dark tobacco.</p>
