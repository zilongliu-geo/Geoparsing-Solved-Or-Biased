  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Poti</span> (Georgian: ფოთი [pʰɔtʰi]; Mingrelian: ფუთი; <span class="loc">Laz</span>: ჶაში/Faşi or ფაში/Paşi) is a port city in <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, located on the eastern <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> coast in the region of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti in the west of the country. Built near the site of the ancient Greek colony of <span class="loc">Phasis</span> and deriving its name from the same, the city has become a major port city and industrial center since the early 20th century. It is also home to a main naval base and the headquarters of the Georgian navy. Adjacent to the <span class="loc">Poti</span> port area is the RAKIA owned Free Industrial Zone. Inaugurated in <span class="date">April 2008</span>, it has registered a number of businesses, including those from Iranian businesspeople trying to evade sanctions against <span class="loc">Iran</span>. The name <span class="loc">Poti</span> is apparently linked to <span class="loc">Phasis</span>, but the etymology is a matter of a scholarly dispute. "Phasis" (Greek: Φάσις) is first recorded in Hesiod's Theogony (c. <span class="date">700 BC</span>) as a name of the river, not a town. Since Erich Diehl, <span class="date">1938</span>, first suggested a non-Hellenic origin of the name and asserted that <span class="loc">Phasis</span> might have been a derivative of a local hydronym, several explanations have been proposed, linking the name to the Georgian-Zan *<span class="loc">Poti</span>, <span class="loc">Svan</span> *Pasid, and even to a Semitic word, meaning "a gold river".</p><br><br>
