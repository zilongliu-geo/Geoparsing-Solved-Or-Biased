  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Warren</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,751 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It includes the villages of <span class="loc">East Warren</span>, <span class="loc">Warren</span> and <span class="loc">South Warren</span>, the latter home to the <span class="loc">Maine</span> State Prison and minimum security Bolduc Correctional Facility. Part of the <span class="per">Waldo</span> Patent, it was called the <span class="loc">Upper Town</span> of St. Georges Plantation. It was first settled by Scots-Irish settlers from <span class="loc">Londonderry</span> in <span class="date">1736</span> under the auspices of Brigadier-General <span class="per">Samuel Waldo</span>, its proprietor. Development was hindered, however, by the ongoing French and Indian Wars. In <span class="date">1753</span>, a blockhouse was built and placed under the command of <span class="per">Captain Thomas Kilpatrick</span>, known by terrified Indians as "Tom-kill-the-devil." War raged across <span class="loc">Maine</span> between <span class="date">1754</span>–<span class="date">1758</span>, and local settlers took refuge in the blockhouse or at another in <span class="loc">Cushing</span>. Hostilities ended in <span class="date">1759</span> with the Fall of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. On <span class="date">November 7, 1776</span>, <span class="loc">Upper Town</span> of St. Georges Plantation was incorporated as a town, named after <span class="per">Joseph Warren</span>, a Revolutionary War hero. Hay was the principal crop. Shipbuilding was an important industry, and between <span class="date">1770</span>–<span class="date">1850</span>, 224 vessels were built, varying from 53 to 1,127 tons. <span class="per">Warren</span> had quarries to extract granite and limestone. Falls on the St. <span class="loc">George River</span> provided water power, with the first sawmill built in <span class="date">1785</span>. Woolens were manufactured at the Georges River Mills, and snowshoes at the <span class="per">Warren</span> Shoe Factory. The <span class="loc">Knox</span> and Lincoln Railroad opened on <span class="date">November 6, 1871</span>.</p><br><br>
