  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The Indonesian Health Ministry has stated that at least seven people, including three children from <span class="loc">northern Sumatra province</span> in the <span class="loc">district of Karo</span>, are being hospitalized with suspected H5N1 Bird Flu and officials believe that the infected are part of "two clusters" of family members who are sick. The individuals are being treated at <span class="org">Adam Malik Hospital</span> located in <span class="loc">Medan</span>. All individuals were admitted on <span class="date">Tuesday</span>. The Associated Press quoted Nyoman Kandun, a Health Ministry official, as saying, "there are two clusters, one with two sisters, the other with three family members, and another two of their neighbours." The three children range in age from <span class="date">18 months</span> to six-years-old. However; experts are waiting on results from tests on the individuals and must be "scientifically proven," said Runizar Ruesin, also a Health Ministry official. The condition of all victims are stable, however; all victims have a fever, a cough, and flu-like symptoms which officials say resemble the symptoms of Bird Flu.</p><br><br>
