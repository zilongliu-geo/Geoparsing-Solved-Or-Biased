  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ely</span> (Welsh Trelái tref town + Elái <span class="loc">River Ely</span>) is a community primarily dominated by council housing in western <span class="loc">Cardiff</span>, capital of <span class="loc">Wales</span>. In Roman times, <span class="loc">Ely</span> was the site of a Roman villa, near the old racecourse. There is also thought to have been a Roman road near the site linking to <span class="loc">Cardiff</span> Roman Fort and eastwards to <span class="loc">Newport</span>. In <span class="date">1855</span>, the first horse race took place at <span class="loc">Ely</span> Racecourse, which took over from the <span class="loc">Great Heath</span> racecourse. The Ordnance Survey map from the early 1880s shows just how isolated the ancient <span class="loc">Ely</span> village was from the rest of <span class="loc">Cardiff</span>. Reports about travelling along the main road over <span class="loc">Ely</span> Common to <span class="loc">Cardiff</span> talk of pot holes and no shelter and a terrible journey on foot. Most of <span class="loc">Ely</span> was still farmland feeding <span class="loc">Cardiff</span>'s population. A railway station had only recently been constructed, and this gave the surrounding area further potential for mass housing development. The '<span class="org">Ely Industrial School</span>' on Cowbridge Road East was home to orphaned children originally from <span class="loc">Cardiff</span>. It had been set up to accommodate "pauper children" from <span class="date">1863</span>. It was very much a product of the Victorian age, and workhouse mentality, increased social awareness and responsibility saw it closing in <span class="date">1903</span> and converted to additional workhouse accommodation for adults (though never used for that purpose), known as <span class="loc">Ely</span> Lodge. The children lived in what became as <span class="loc">Ely</span> Homes. The school was demolished some <span class="date">years</span> later and an infectious diseases isolation unit was built on the same site.</p><br><br>
