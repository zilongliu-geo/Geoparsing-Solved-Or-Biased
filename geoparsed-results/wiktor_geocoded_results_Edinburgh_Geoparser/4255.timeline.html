  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kerang</span> is a rural town on the <span class="loc">Loddon River</span> in northern Victoria in <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is the commercial centre to an irrigation district based on livestock, horticulture, lucerne and grain. It is located 279 kilometres (173 mi) north-west of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> on the Murray Valley Highway a few kilometres north of its intersection with the Loddon Valley Highway, elevation 78 metres (256 ft). At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Kerang</span> had a population of 3,872. <span class="loc">Kerang</span> is believed to be an Aboriginal word for Cockatoo. The Wemba-Wemba Aborigines are thought to have been the area's first occupants. <span class="per">Thomas Mitchell</span> was the first European to visit the area, in <span class="date">1836</span>. Squatters began to settle in the area in <span class="date">1845</span> and in <span class="date">1848</span> <span class="per">Richard Beyes</span> opened a public house at a river crossing near <span class="date">the future</span> townsite. This was followed by a saddlery and a church. In <span class="date">1857</span> Woodford Patchell built a bridge upriver from the settlement which drew traffic from the earlier settlement. He built a store, house and hotel that became the center of what was to become <span class="loc">Kerang</span>. Patchell was the first farmer in the state to use irrigation and experimented with oats, barley, maize, millet, tobacco, beet, cotton and sugarcane. The Post Office opened on <span class="date">29 July 1858</span>. An earlier Kerang office, quite distant, was renamed <span class="loc">Wedderburn</span> on the same day.</p><br><br>
