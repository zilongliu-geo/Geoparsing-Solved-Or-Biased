  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Littleton</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">borough of Spelthorne</span>, <span class="loc">Surrey</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Its amenities are a <span class="org">Church of England</span> parish church, village green and Shepperton Studios. It covers a narrow east-west strip of land between the centre of <span class="loc">Shepperton Green</span> to the southeast and the <span class="loc">Queen Mary Reservoir</span> to its north, having contributed most of the land to the reservoir in <span class="date">1931</span> and having historically reached to the <span class="loc">River Thames</span> at <span class="loc">Chertsey</span> Bridge. Contiguous with <span class="loc">Shepperton Green</span> which has a parade of shops, the divide is the <span class="loc">River Ash</span>, a stream. It borders <span class="loc">Laleham</span> to the west and <span class="loc">Charlton</span> which is also in the post town of <span class="loc">Shepperton</span>, centred 0.5 miles (800 m) to the north-east and which has one of the nearest pubs. London Heathrow Airport is centred 5 miles (8 km) north. The <span class="loc">River Thames</span> is 2.5 miles (4 km) south. Sunbury Golf Course is beyond the M3 motorway past a very narrow strip of <span class="loc">Charlton</span>, all of which once lay within <span class="loc">Sunbury</span>. That land and <span class="loc">Upper Halliford</span> is however since the early 20th century also within Shepperton's postal boundaries.</p><br><br>
