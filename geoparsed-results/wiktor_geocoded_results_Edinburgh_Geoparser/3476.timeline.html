  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Hudson is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Before its incorporation as a town in <span class="date">1866</span>, Hudson was a neighborhood and unincorporated village within the town of <span class="loc">Marlborough</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, and was known as <span class="loc">Feltonville</span>, and before that, known as <span class="loc">Eastborough</span>. From around <span class="date">1850</span> until the last shoe factory burned down in <span class="date">1968</span>, Hudson was known as a "shoe town." At one point, the town had 17 shoe factories, many of them powered by the <span class="loc">Assabet River</span>, which runs through town. Because of the many factories in Hudson, immigrants were attracted to the town. <span class="date">Today</span>, most people are of either Portuguese or Irish descent, with a smaller percentage of people being of French, Italian, English, or Scots-Irish descent. Hudson is served by the <span class="org">Hudson Public Schools</span> district. For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place Hudson, please see the article Hudson (CDP), <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. In <span class="date">1650</span>, the area that would become Hudson was part of the Indian Plantation for the Praying Indians. The Praying Indians were evicted from their plantation during <span class="per">King Philip</span>'s War, and most did not return even after the war ended.</p><br><br>
