  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Fiery crash kills three . Three people were in one pickup -- Marshall, his friend <span class="per">Andrew Kummer</span>, 25, and an unidentified young man. Mason, <span class="loc">Devon</span> and the driver believed to be Mason's father were in the other. Business cards belonging to <span class="per">Jason Berube</span>, of <span class="loc">Chatham</span>, were strewn across the scene. A happy family reunion in central Ontario's picturesque cottage country was marred by tragedy <span class="date">yesterday</span>, as two bodies were pulled from a Muskoka lake and a distraught man tried to come to grips with how he helplessly watched his wife and 12-year-old daughter slip into the frigid waters.</p><br><br>
