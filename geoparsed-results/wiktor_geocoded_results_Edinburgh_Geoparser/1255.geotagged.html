<p>Pilar is a first class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Sorsogon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span> located at the south of <span class="loc">Luzon</span> island. It is part of the <span class="loc">Bicol Region</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 68,245 people. Pilar is subdivided into 49 barangays. In 1957 the sitios of Naspi and Calaguitan were separated from the barrio of <span class="loc">Putiao</span> and converted into the barrio of Naspi. Though whale sharks are more associated with the town of <span class="loc">Donsol</span>, whale sharks can also be seen in <span class="loc">Pilar Bay</span> near <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>. Interaction with the whale sharks is regulated by the local department office. With the help of WWF, strict guidelines were developed to protect the sharks. These include limiting the number of swimmers per boat, no scuba divers and staying further than three meters away from the sharks. In practise this rule is almost never applied. As many as 14 boats at a time may 'mob' a shark, with up to 30 or 40 swimmers following the shark on the surface. In recent years the number of male sharks have out-numbered female sharks by 20:1. The females that are seen are generally large mature adults in the 7m ~ 9m range. Increasing numbers of sharks show propellor marks on their backs. Anecdotal evidence from local fishermen suggests that prop strikes are from fishing boats in the off-season, rather than from tourist boats in the main Januaryâ€“May tourist season.</p>
