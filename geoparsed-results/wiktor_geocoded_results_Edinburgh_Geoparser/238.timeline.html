  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Newcastle</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, located 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from <span class="loc">Newcastle</span>'s central business district. The main commercial centre is located around <span class="per">Beaumont Street</span> and boasts a vibrant multicultural atmosphere providing an array of restaurants, retail, fashion and commercial outlets along with day-to-day services such as pharmacies, banks, florists, hairdressers, fruit shops and delicatessens. A local history blog 'Hidden Hamilton' captures the people, places and experiences that make up the collective story of <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> since its earliest beginnings (see http://hiddenhamilton.blogspot.com.au). <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> became a municipality on <span class="date">11 December 1871</span> and was named in honour of <span class="per">Edward Terrick</span> <span class="loc">Hamilton</span>, who was then Governor of the board of directors of <span class="org">the Australian</span> Agricultural Company (<span class="loc">AA Co</span>), from <span class="date">August 1857</span> to <span class="date">September 1898</span>. The <span class="org">AA Co.</span> were instrumental in the growth of the area, operating the mines and owning most of the land. The discovery of coal near St Peter's Church in the area known as Cameron's Hill, was the beginnings for the township of <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> (originally known as Pittown, Borehole or <span class="loc">Happy</span> Flat). A borehole was sunk and a shaft was completed in <span class="date">1849</span> and was known as the D Pit, or borehole. Pittown grew up somewhere in the vicinity of <span class="date">today</span>â€™s <span class="per">Beaumont</span> street to service the needs of the miners and their families.</p><br><br>
