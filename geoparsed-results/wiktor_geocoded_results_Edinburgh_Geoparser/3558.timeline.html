  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Falmouth</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Stafford County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Situated on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Rappahannock River</span> at the falls, the community is north of and opposite the <span class="loc">city of Fredericksburg</span>. Recognized by the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> as a census-designated place (CDP), <span class="loc">Falmouth</span>'s population was 4,274 as of the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Founded in <span class="date">1728</span> by the same act of the <span class="org">Virginia Assembly</span> that established neighboring <span class="loc">Fredericksburg</span>, <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> was created as a port town on the <span class="loc">Rappahannock</span> to serve inhabitants living north of the river within the vast <span class="loc">Northern Neck</span> holdings of <span class="per">Lord Fairfax</span>. His agent, Robert "King" Carter, promoted the establishment of the town, and the Carter family played a dominant role in the town's development throughout much of the colonial period. Originally located within <span class="per">King George County</span>, <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> became part of <span class="loc">Stafford County</span> when county lines were redrawn in <span class="date">1776</span>. During the American Civil War, <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> was occupied by Union forces in <span class="date">1862</span> and <span class="date">1863</span>, and Northern commanders located their headquarters southeast of the town during the <span class="loc">Fredericksburg</span> and <span class="loc">Chancellorsville</span> campaigns. In <span class="date">May 1864</span>, Union wounded and Confederate prisoners from the battles of the <span class="per">Wilderness</span> and <span class="per">Spotsylvania</span> <span class="loc">Court House</span> were transported through the area to the wharves at <span class="loc">Belle Plain</span> on <span class="loc">Potomac Creek</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Potomac River</span>, located east of <span class="loc">Falmouth</span>.</p><br><br>
