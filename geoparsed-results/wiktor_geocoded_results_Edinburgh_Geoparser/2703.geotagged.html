<p><span class="loc">Petersburg</span> (Tlingit: Gantiyaakw SÃ©edi "Steamboat Channel") is a census-designated place within <span class="loc">Petersburg Borough</span> on <span class="loc">Mitkof Island</span> in southeast <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. According to 2009 Census Bureau estimates, its population was 2,824 full-time residents. The borough encompasses <span class="loc">Petersburg</span> and <span class="loc">Kupreanof</span>, plus mostly uninhabited areas stretching to the Canadian border and the southern boundary of the City and <span class="loc">Borough of Juneau</span>. While the <span class="loc">city of Petersburg</span> ceased to exist as a separate administrative entity (the borough assembly created a service area to assume operation of the former city's services), the tiny <span class="loc">city of Kupreanof</span> remains separate within the borough. Tlingits from <span class="loc">Kupreanof</span> Island had long used a summer fish camp at the north end of <span class="loc">Mitkof Island</span>. Earlier cultures of indigenous people also used the island: remnants of fish traps and some petroglyphs have been carbon-dated back some 1,000 years. European explorers to <span class="loc">Mitkof Island</span> encountered the Tlingit. In the nineteenth century, Peter Buschmann, a Norwegian immigrant, settled here, building a cannery, sawmill, docks and early structures. The settlement was named <span class="loc">Petersburg</span> after him, and it flourished as a fishing port. (Icebergs from the nearby <span class="loc">LeConte Glacier</span> provided a source for cooling fish). <span class="loc">Petersburg</span> originally incorporated as a town on April 2, 1910. The town had attracted mostly immigrants of Scandinavian origin, thus giving <span class="loc">Petersburg</span> the nickname "<span class="loc">Little Norway</span>". The Sons of <span class="loc">Norway</span> hall was built on one of the piers. Three other canneries were built and the four have operated continuously since. With the establishment of the cannery, Alaskan Natives, including Chief John Lott, began to work there and live year-round at the site.</p>
