  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salisbury</span> (various pronunciations, but locally /ˈsɔːzbri/, SAWZ-bree) is a cathedral city in <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, and the only city within the county. It is the third-largest settlement in the county, after <span class="loc">Swindon</span> and <span class="loc">Chippenham</span>, with a population of 41,682. The city is located in the southeast of <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span>, near the edge of <span class="loc">Salisbury Plain</span>. Its cathedral was formerly located to the north at <span class="loc">Old Sarum</span>; following its relocation, a settlement grew up around it, drawing residents from <span class="loc">Old Sarum</span> and <span class="loc">Wilton</span>. The new town received its city charter in <span class="date">1227</span> under the name <span class="loc">New Sarum</span>, which continued to be its official name until <span class="date">2009</span>, when the <span class="loc">Salisbury City</span> Council was established. It sits at the confluence of five rivers: the Nadder, Ebble, <span class="loc">Wylye</span>, and <span class="loc">Bourne</span> are tributary to the Hampshire Avon, which flows to the south coast and into the sea at <span class="loc">Christchurch</span> in <span class="loc">Dorset</span>. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> railway station serves the city and is a regional interchange, marking the crossing point between the West of <span class="loc">England</span> Main Line and the Wessex Main Line. <span class="loc">Stonehenge</span>, a <span class="org">UNESCO World Heritage Site</span>, is about 8 miles (13 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> and greatly aids the local economy. The city itself, <span class="loc">Old Sarum</span>, the present cathedral and the ruins of the former one also attract visitors.</p><br><br>
