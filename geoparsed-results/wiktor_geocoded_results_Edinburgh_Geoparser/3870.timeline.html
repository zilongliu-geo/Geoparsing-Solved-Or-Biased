  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tolosa</span> is a fifth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Leyte</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 17,921 people. <span class="loc">Tolosa</span> is located 24 kilometres (15 mi) south of <span class="loc">Tacloban City</span>. <span class="loc">Tolosa</span> is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. According to popular beliefs, <span class="loc">Tolosa</span> derived its name from a legend about three chieftains (datus) who united their chiefdoms. According to the legend, the area that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Tolosa</span> was ruled by three great datus: the datu of fishing, the datu of harvest and the datu of hunting. Typical of chiefdoms in those times, the three datus regard each other with hostility. One time a great battle broke out among the three of them. Their people fought valiantly in defense of each datu. But the three datus were strong they could not defeat each other. Accidentally they were hit by their own swords and they died. Their blood spilt everywhere. Then came a great earthquake followed by a tsunami. When the floodwaters subsided, three promontories rose on three sides of the three datus' lands, as if acting as defensive walls of the contiguous land. Survivors of the great battle realized that the three hills were their great datus who were <span class="date">now</span> united in protecting them from outside dangers. From three (tolo) they became one (usa).</p><br><br>
