  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Grado</span> (Venetian: <span class="loc">Gravo</span>, Latin: Gradus) is a town and comune in the north-eastern Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, located on an island and adjacent peninsula of the <span class="loc">Adriatic Sea</span> between <span class="loc">Venice</span> and <span class="loc">Trieste</span>. Once mainly a fishing center, <span class="date">today</span> it is a popular tourist destination, known commonly as <span class="loc">L</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">Isola</span> del Sole ("The Sunny Island"), also famous because it is also a spa town; together with <span class="loc">Marano Lagunare</span>, it is the center of the Marano-Grado Lagoon, which is famous for its uncontaminated nature. <span class="loc">Grado</span> is the birthplace of <span class="per">Biagio Marin</span>, a poet who sang about the island in the local Venetian dialect. In Roman times the city, known as ad Aquae Gradatae, was first port for ships entering the Natissa (Natisone), headed upstream to <span class="loc">Aquileia</span>. Quite close is the ancient Roman <span class="loc">city of Aquileia</span>; during the late <span class="date">years</span> of the Western Roman Empire many people fled from <span class="loc">Aquileia</span> to <span class="loc">Grado</span> in order to find a safer place, more protected from the invasions coming from the east. In 452, Nicetas, <span class="per">Bishop of Aquileia</span>, took refuge briefly at <span class="loc">Grado</span>; of the same period is the earliest construction of <span class="loc">Grado</span>'s first cathedral, the first church of <span class="loc">Santa Maria delle Grazie</span>, and the baptistery. <span class="loc">Grado</span> was the home base of the patriarchate's fleet.</p><br><br>
