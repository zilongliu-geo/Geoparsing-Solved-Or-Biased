  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>New Gainesville prison clashes with revitalization. A new detention facility planned for the heart of its Midtown district has some Gainesville officials wringing their hands. The city, in talks with <span class="org">Hall County and Corrections Corporation</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>, wants to insure that the new prison, which will house up to 502 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> <span class="per">Immigration</span> and <span class="per">Customs</span> Enforcement detainees, meets its idea of urban revitalization. The city began a project <span class="date">10 years ago</span> to clean up the rundown area and invested $250,000 in a study to map out a revitalization strategy, said City Councilman <span class="per">Danny Dunagan</span>. <span class="loc">Nashville</span>-based <span class="org">CCA</span> signed a five-year agreement to lease the old county jail from <span class="loc">Hall County</span> to operate the center on Main Street. The 20-year lease, with two 5-year renewals, will pay <span class="loc">Hall County</span> $2 million annually. “The last thing we want in downtown for <span class="date">20 years</span> is a prison,” <span class="per">Dunagan</span> said. The city has invested a lot in its Midtown revitalization, including a new police/fire station. Plans also call for a 13-story hotel and two nine-story office buildings. The city had even worked out a verbal agreement with the county to buy the old jail, <span class="per">Dunagan</span> said. The plan called for the city to then lease the facility back to the county so it could sub-lease it to CCA, he said. But that deal would have run for <span class="date">eight years</span>, <span class="per">Dunagan</span> said, then the city would have the option of shutting it down. Councilman <span class="per">George Wangemann</span> said the city is behind the economic boost the prison could bring to the city, but he wants it to fit in with the aesthetics. <span class="per">Louise Grant</span>, CCA marketing and communications director, said that while the company is in the business of operating prisons, it is working to resolve the aesthetics issue with the city. “Safety and security is our first and foremost priority,” she said. “We’re making a $4 million investment to upgrade the facility.” <span class="per">Grant</span> said razor wire is common at all its 60 facilities, but alternative fencing is being discussed. Since <span class="date">last week</span>’s announcement of the prison opening, CCA has received some 500 applications for the approximately 120 jobs available, <span class="per">Grant</span> said.
