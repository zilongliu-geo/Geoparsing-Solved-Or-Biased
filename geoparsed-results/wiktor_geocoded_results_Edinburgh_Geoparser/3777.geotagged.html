<p><span class="loc">Moira</span> is a former mining village about 2.5 miles (4 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Ashby-de-la-Zouch</span> in <span class="loc">North West Leicestershire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The village is about 3 miles (5 km) miles south of <span class="loc">Swadlincote</span> and forms part of the boundary with <span class="loc">Derbyshire</span>. For centuries <span class="loc">North West Leicestershire</span> has been quarried and mined for coal, limestone, granite and brick clay, and its environmental damage was one of the reasons that it was chosen as the site for the National Forest, which is part of a Government-funded programme to create more woodland. Proximate villages include <span class="loc">Donisthorpe</span>, <span class="loc">Overseal</span>, <span class="loc">Oakthorpe</span>, <span class="loc">Spring Cottage</span> and <span class="loc">Norris Hill</span>. Moira's toponym is derived from the Irish earldom of <span class="loc">Moira</span>, one of the titles of the <span class="loc">Hastings</span> family, which held Ashby de la Zouch Castle. The former local colliery, Rawdon Colliery, also bore a <span class="loc">Hastings</span> family name. <span class="loc">Moira</span> is one of the few place names in <span class="loc">England</span> to end in an "a". The Midland Railway opened its <span class="loc">Leicester</span> to Burton upon Trent Line through <span class="loc">Moira</span> in 1845. <span class="loc">Moira</span> railway station served the village until British Railways closed it in 1964. The building still survives and the line remains open as a freight route.</p>
