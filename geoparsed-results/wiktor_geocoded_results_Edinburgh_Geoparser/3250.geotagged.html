<p><span class="loc">Plainville</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population at the 2010 census was 8,264. <span class="loc">Plainville</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Providence metropolitan</span> area. Originally included in a 1635 grant of land for <span class="loc">Dedham</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, the area was later deemed the Plantation of Wollomonuppoag and then later becoming <span class="loc">Wrentham</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> before <span class="loc">Plainville</span> branched out as a separate community. <span class="loc">Plainville</span> became an officially recognized town in 1905, making it the third youngest town in the state, behind <span class="loc">Millville</span> (1916) and <span class="loc">East Brookfield</span> (1920). One of the earliest documentations of <span class="loc">Plainville</span> being settled is from 1674, when a Wampanoag man by the name of Matchinamook petitioned and received a few acres of land at the head of the <span class="loc">Ten Mile River</span>, at present day Fuller's Dam. As Matchinamook was a native warrior under Wampanoag chieftain Metacomet, or more commonly known in the area as King Philip, he most likely fought during King Philip's War. In its early days, <span class="loc">Plainville</span> was nicknamed Slackville after Benjamin Slack, an affluent landowner at the time. After the establishment of a post office in 1856, <span class="loc">Plainville</span> became the town name after the abundance of geographical plains in the area. In 1905, <span class="loc">Plainville</span> officially separated from <span class="loc">Wrentham</span> and became its own town.</p>
