<p><span class="loc">Caldwell</span> is a borough located in northwestern <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, about 16 miles (26 km) outside of New <span class="loc">York City</span>. As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 7,822, reflecting an increase of 238 (+3.1%) from the 7,584 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 35 (+0.5%) from the 7,549 counted in the 1990 Census. <span class="loc">Caldwell</span> was incorporated as a borough by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on February 10, 1892, from portions of Caldwell Township (now Fairfield Township), based on the results of a referendum held on the previous day. In 1981, the borough's name was changed to the "<span class="loc">Township of</span> the <span class="loc">Borough of Caldwell</span>", as one of seven <span class="loc">Essex County</span> municipalities to pass a referendum to become a township, joining four municipalities that had already made the change, of what would ultimately be more than a dozen <span class="loc">Essex County</span> municipalities to reclassify themselves as townships in order take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated townships a greater share of government aid to municipalities on a per capita basis. Effective January 26, 1995, it again became a borough.</p>
