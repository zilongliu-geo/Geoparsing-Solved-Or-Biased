  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lancaster</span> /ˈlæn.kæstər/ is a charter city in northern <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, in the Antelope Valley of the western <span class="loc">Mojave Desert</span> in Southern <span class="loc">California</span>. As of <span class="date">2013</span>, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> was the 31st largest city in <span class="loc">California</span>. <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is part of a twin city complex with its southern neighbor <span class="loc">Palmdale</span> and together they are the principal cities within the Antelope Valley region and <span class="loc">California</span>'s <span class="loc">High Desert</span>. <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is located approximately 70 miles (110 km) north (by highway) of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, near the <span class="loc">Kern County</span> line. It is separated from the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> Basin by the <span class="loc">San Gabriel Mountains</span> to the south, and from <span class="loc">Bakersfield</span> and the <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Joaquin</span> Valley by the <span class="loc">Tehachapi Mountains</span> to the north. The population of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> grew from 37,000 at the time of its incorporation in <span class="date">1977</span> to over 156,000 in <span class="date">2010</span>. According to the Greater Antelope Valley Economic Alliance report of <span class="date">2015</span>, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> has a population of 168,049. The area where <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is <span class="date">now</span> located, known as the Antelope Valley, was originally home to the Paiute Indians. <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>'s origins as a settlement start with the Southern Pacific Railroad, which is believed to first use the name <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, where a station house, locomotive watering facilities and section gang housing were built when the railroad laid track through the town's future location. In <span class="date">Sept.</span> 18r the Southern Pacific completed the line through the Antelope Valley, linking <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. The origin of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>'s name is unclear, attributed variously to the surname of a railroad station clerk, the moniker given by railroad officials, or the former <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> home (<span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>) of unknown settlers. Train service brought passengers through the water-stop-turned-community, which, with the help of promotional literature, attracted new settlers. The person credited with formally developing the town is <span class="per">Moses Langley</span> Wicks, who in <span class="date">1884</span> bought property from the railroad for $2.50 per acre, mapped out a town with streets and lots, and by <span class="date">September</span> was advertising 160-acre tracts of land for $6 an acre. <span class="date">The following year</span>, the <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> News started publication, making it the first weekly newspaper in the Antelope Valley. By <span class="date">1890</span>, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> was bustling and booming, and thanks to adequate rainfall, farmers planted and sold thousands of acres of wheat and barley.</p><br><br>
