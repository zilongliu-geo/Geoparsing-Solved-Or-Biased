  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mitchell</span> is a community located in the Rural Municipality of <span class="loc">Hanover</span>, <span class="loc">Manitoba</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is located three kilometers <span class="loc">west of Steinbach</span>, <span class="loc">Manitoba</span> along Provincial Highway 52, and has a population of 1,136 as of <span class="date">2011</span>. The <span class="org">Mitchell School District</span> was established in <span class="date">1919</span>. A one-room schoolhouse served the community until <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, when another room has added to handle increasing student enrollment. In <span class="date">1968</span>, the school district was dissolved and became part of the newly formed <span class="org">Hanover School Division</span>, after which students from <span class="loc">Mitchell</span> were required to attend school in <span class="loc">Steinbach</span>. The school division has since constructed new elementary and middle schools in <span class="loc">Mitchell</span> and only high school students from the <span class="loc">Mitchell</span> area are presently required to attend school in <span class="loc">Steinbach</span>. <span class="loc">Mitchell</span> has a full range of community-run recreational facilities, including an indoor arena, baseball fields, soccer pitches, and tennis courts. The <span class="loc">Mitchell</span> Arena was built in <span class="date">1979</span> and is home to community's ice hockey teams, nicknamed the Mohawks. The <span class="loc">Mitchell</span>'s minor hockey teams play in various Eastman Minor Hockey leagues. The Junior Mohawks have been members of the <span class="org">Hanover Tache Junior Hockey League</span> since <span class="date">1987</span> and previously played in the <span class="loc">Manitoba</span> Junior 'B' Hockey League. The Mohawks has also fielded senior teams in <span class="date">the past</span> that played in the <span class="per">Hanover-Tache</span> and <span class="per">Carillon</span> Senior Hockey Leagues.</p><br><br>
