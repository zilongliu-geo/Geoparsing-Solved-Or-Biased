  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Area funeral director charged in robberies. An <span class="loc">Alton</span> funeral director has been charged with robbing two Indiana banks of more than $10,000. Vanderburgh, Ind., County prosecutors <span class="date">last week</span> charged George R, <span class="loc">Chesnut</span> with robbing <span class="org">Evansville Federal Credit Union</span> on <span class="date">Dec. 5</span>. The 46-year-old <span class="loc">Chesnut</span> was already in custody for allegedly robbing the First Bank of <span class="loc">Princeton</span> on <span class="date">March 6</span>. Employees at First Bank told police that a man approached the counter at 4:45 p.m. wearing a baseball cap, a gray hooded jacket, blue jeans and white shoes and lifted his jacket to show the butt of a handgun tucked into his waistband, according to a search warrant. The warrant was filed <span class="date">Tuesday</span> in <span class="loc">Madison County</span> for Chesnut's home in the <span class="date">2400</span> block of <span class="per">Gillis Street</span> in <span class="loc">Alton</span>. The man passed an index card to the teller which read "This a robbery. I have a gun. Do not call Police. Give me your hundreds, fifties and twenties. "An off-duty police officer stopped Chesnut's <span class="org">Ford</span> Mustang, bearing Illinois license plates, a short while later. The officer traced the plates to the <span class="per">Gillis Street</span> address. He found $4,470 in a bag inside the engine compartment, according to an affidavit filed with the search warrant. <span class="loc">Chesnut</span> matched the description of a suspect in the <span class="date">Dec. 5</span> bank robbery in which a man wearing a dark hooded jacket entered the bank and showed the teller the butt of his gun and demanded cash. Three tellers were working at the time, and the man approached her window speaking on a cell phone, according to a <span class="loc">Vanderburgh County</span> Sheriff's report. A teller gave him $5,800, according to the affidavit. The teller later picked <span class="loc">Chesnut</span> out of a police lineup, according to the report. On <span class="date">March 7</span>, FBI agents searched Chesnut's home. They seized bank statements, collection notices, credit reports and bank notices that indicated that his Godfrey funeral business was struggling, according to the return.</p><br><br>
