The population was 3,465 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city was a <span class="date">2009</span> <span class="loc">All-America City</span> Award finalist. European-American settlement in <span class="loc">Toledo</span> began in <span class="date">1866</span>, when <span class="per">John Graham</span>, his son <span class="per">Joseph</span>, and <span class="per">William Mackey</span>, claimed land made available by the Homestead Act. The site was called "<span class="per">Graham</span>'s Landing" until a post office was established <span class="date">two years later</span>. <span class="per">Joseph D. Graham</span>, <span class="per">John</span>'s son, named the post office for <span class="loc">Toledo</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, because he was homesick. <span class="per">William Mackey</span> was the first postmaster. <span class="loc">Toledo</span> was made the county seat of the newly established <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> in <span class="date">1893</span>. The city incorporated in <span class="date">1893</span> and reincorporated in <span class="date">1905</span>. <span class="per">Charles Barton Crosno</span> served as the first mayor. The county seat moved from <span class="loc">Toledo</span> to <span class="loc">Newport</span> in <span class="date">1953</span>. In <span class="date">1918</span>, the Port of <span class="loc">Toledo</span> leased land to the Spruce Production Division for a sawmill to cut airplane frames for World War I. However, before production began, the war ended. <span class="per">C. D. Johnson</span> and associates then bought the mill and related equipment, which by 1923 processed logs shipped to <span class="loc">Toledo</span> by rail. Georgia-Pacific acquired the operation in <span class="date">1951</span> and turned it into a pulp mill.</p><br><br>
