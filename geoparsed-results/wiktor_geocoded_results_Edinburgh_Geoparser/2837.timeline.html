In <span class="date">1848</span>, the southern part of <span class="loc">Portage County</span> was renamed <span class="loc">Adams County</span> and included all of current-day <span class="loc">Adams County</span> and the northern section of <span class="loc">Juneau County</span>. <span class="loc">Adams County</span> was organized in <span class="date">April 1853</span>. In <span class="date">1858</span>, The northwestern part of <span class="loc">Adams County</span> was joined with the northern part of <span class="loc">Sauk County</span> to form present-day <span class="loc">Juneau County</span>. At this time, <span class="loc">Adams County</span> took its current shape.</p><br><br>
