<p><span class="loc">Florence</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city was named after the daughter of the third Governor of <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Samuel J. Crawford. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 465. In 1802, <span class="loc">Spain</span> returned most of the land to <span class="loc">France</span>. In 1803, most of the land for modern day <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was acquired by the <span class="loc">United States</span> from <span class="loc">France</span> as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1806, Zebulon Pike led the Pike expedition westward from St Louis, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, of which part of their journey followed the <span class="loc">Cottonwood River</span> through <span class="loc">Marion County</span> near the current <span class="loc">cities of Florence</span>, <span class="loc">Marion</span>, <span class="loc">Durham</span>. In 1854, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in 1861 <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In 1855, <span class="loc">Marion County</span> was established within the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory, which included the land for modern day <span class="loc">Florence</span>. The first settlers in <span class="loc">Marion County</span> located on <span class="loc">Doyle Creek</span>, near the present site of <span class="loc">Florence</span>. They were Moses Shane, who came in 1858, and whose death the next year was the first in the county; Patrick Doyle, in 1859, for whom <span class="loc">Doyle Creek</span> and Township were named, and a family by the name of Welsh, in which occurred the first birth in the county in August 1859. A post office existed in Doyle from November 26, 1866 to March 13, 1871.</p>
