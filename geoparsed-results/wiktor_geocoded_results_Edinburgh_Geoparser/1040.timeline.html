  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Marion</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The municipality is located in north-central <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, approximately 50 miles (80 km) north of <span class="loc">Columbus</span>. The population was 36,837 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. According to the <span class="loc">US</span> Census <span class="date">2008</span> estimate <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s Columbus–Marion–Chillicothe Combined Statistical Area has 2,002,604 people. <span class="per">Marion</span> is the county's largest city and the center of the <span class="org">Marion Micropolitan Statistical Area</span> (as defined by the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau in <span class="date">2003</span>). <span class="per">President Warren G. Harding</span>, a former owner of the <span class="per">Marion Star</span>, was a resident of <span class="per">Marion</span> for much of his adult life. The city and its development were closely related to industrialist <span class="per">Edward Huber</span> and his extensive business interests. The city is home to several historic properties, some listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> listings in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The origins of <span class="per">Marion</span> can be traced back to the War of <span class="date">1812</span> when <span class="per">Jacob Foos</span>, a surveyor for <span class="per">General Harrison</span>'s army, discovered a spring at the top of a hill and established a well there which was named "<span class="per">Jacob</span>'s Well". At the time it was a stopover for troops on their way from Ft. <span class="org">Franklin</span> (<span class="loc">Columbus</span>) to <span class="loc">Toledo</span>. Legend has it that in <span class="date">the middle of the night</span> Foos awoke with a terrible thirst. He began to dig and told his fellow travelers that he was going to dig till he found either water or hell. This well was located near what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Marion</span> Towers on <span class="per">Delaware Ave</span>. The town of <span class="per">Marion</span> was platted north of <span class="per">Jacob</span>'s Well in <span class="date">1822</span> by <span class="per">Alexander Holmes</span> with <span class="per">Eber Baker</span> as his agent (Proprietor - administrator) for selling off the village lots. <span class="loc">Marion County</span> was officially recognized in <span class="date">1824</span>. Like the county in which it is located, the city was named in honor for General <span class="per">Francis Marion</span>.</p><br><br>
