<p><span class="loc">San Juan</span> is a fifth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Southern Leyte</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It was formerly known as Cabali-an. According to the 2010 National census, it has a total population of 14,073 people. The Kabalian language, a Visayan language distinct from Waray-Waray and <span class="loc">Cebuano</span>, is spoken in <span class="loc">San Juan</span>. There seems to be no consensus on the exact origin of the name Cabali-an. While there are several versions, the most popular one involves Magellan who happened to pass by <span class="loc">Cabalian</span>. This account tells of Magellan and his crew attempting to land this settlement after being battered by a heavy storm known locally as “subasco”. One of his ships had a broken main mast that required immediate repair. The curious natives led by their chieftain, Datu Malitik, gathered on the shore as they closely watched the approaching ships. The natives who were armed noticed the broken mast and shouted “gikabali-an”. Roughly translated, the word means “to experience a breakage or broken materials”. Magellan and his men interpreted the hostile-surrounding shouts as the name of the place. Not wishing to engage the natives in combat after the battering of the storm, the explorers lifted anchors and sailed away.</p>
