  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Hope is a town in Haw Creek Township, <span class="loc">Bartholomew County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, known for its historic character. The population was 2,102 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, metropolitan statistical area. The first settlement at Hope was made in <span class="date">1830</span> by a colony of Moravians (people of the Protestant Moravian denomination) from <span class="loc">Salem</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> (<span class="date">now</span> Winston-Salem), led by the <span class="per">Rev. Martin Hauser</span>, after whom the town high school is named. Although a <span class="date">1905</span> source claimed that the town was named for the optimistic spirit of its Moravian pioneer settlers, "Hope" is a common name for religious settlements, denoting hope in God's favor and the resurrection. The town was originally named <span class="loc">Goshen</span>, after the Biblical Goshen, but upon the establishment of a post office in <span class="date">1834</span> the name was changed to Hope, as <span class="loc">Indiana</span> already had a town named <span class="loc">Goshen</span>. The town was founded to be a communal settlement like that of the two prominent Moravian settlements in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="loc">Salem</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> and <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. The model for these did not work for a farming community like Hope, and early on the decision was made to end community property and allow residents to own their own land. Soon thereafter the town was also opened to non-Moravians.</p><br><br>
