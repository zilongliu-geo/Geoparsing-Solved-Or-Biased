<p>Camden is a city in, and the county seat of, <span class="loc">Kershaw County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,838 in the 2010 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, Camden has a total area of 10.68 square miles (27.7 km2), of which 10.07 square miles (26.1 km2) is land and 0.61 square miles (1.6 km2) (5.71%) is water. Camden is the oldest inland city and fourth oldest city in <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. It is near the center of the Cofitachequi chiefdom that existed in the 1500s. In 1730, Camden became part of a township plan ordered by King George II. <span class="loc">Kershaw County</span>’s official web site states, “Originally laid out in 1732 as the town of <span class="loc">Fredericksburg</span> in the <span class="loc">Wateree River</span> swamp (south of the present town) when King George II ordered eleven inland townships established along <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>'s rivers, few of the area settlers chose to take lots surveyed in the town, choosing the higher ground to the north. The township soon disappeared.” In 1758, Joseph Kershaw, from <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> came into the township, established a store and renamed the town Pine Tree Hill. Camden became the main inland trade center in the colony. Kershaw suggested that the town be renamed Camden, in honor of Lord Camden, the champion of colonial rights.</p>
