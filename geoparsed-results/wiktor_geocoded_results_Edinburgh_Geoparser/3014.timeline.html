  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wuwei</span> (Chinese: 武威; pinyin: Wŭwēi) is a prefecture-level city in northwest central <span class="loc">Gansu province</span>. In the north it borders <span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span>, in the southwest, <span class="loc">Qinghai</span>. Its central location between three western capitals, <span class="loc">Lanzhou</span>, <span class="loc">Xining</span>, and <span class="loc">Yinchuan</span> makes it an important business and transportation hub for the area. Because of its position along the Hexi Corridor, historically the only route from central <span class="loc">China</span> to western <span class="loc">China</span> and the rest of Central <span class="loc">Asia</span>, many major railroads and national highways pass through <span class="loc">Wuwei</span>. In ancient times, <span class="loc">Wuwei</span> was called <span class="loc">Liangzhou</span> (涼州 - the name retained by <span class="date">today</span>'s Wuwei's central urban district) and is the eastern terminus of the Hexi Corridor. People began settling here <span class="date">5,000 years ago</span>. It was a key link for the Northern Silk Road, and a number of important archaeological finds were uncovered from <span class="loc">Wuwei</span>, including ancient copper carts with stone animals. The motifs and types of objects in the Wuwei graves, as well as their earthenware, lacquer, and bronze composition, constitute typical examples of the Han Chinese burial style that can be found all over <span class="loc">China</span>. Other graves found along the Hexi Corridor show Xiongnu and other minority influence, which are used to trace regimes such as the Northern <span class="loc">Liang</span>. It became an important provincial capital during the Former Han Dynasty as the Hou Hanshu makes clear:</p><br><br>
