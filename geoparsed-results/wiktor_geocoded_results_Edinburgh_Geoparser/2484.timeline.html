  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Berg is a municipality in the <span class="loc">district of Weinfelden</span> in the canton of Thurgau in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. The earliest traces of human settlement come from the Stone Age and there are scattered Bronze Age items around Berg. The modern village of Berg is first mentioned in 796 as <span class="loc">Berga</span>. In the Early Middle Ages, Berg and the surrounding land were in the possession of the <span class="per">Bishop of Constance</span> and were on the southern border of the Bishop's land. A fortress was first built in the 12th-13th Century, which was replaced in <span class="date">1600</span> by a castle. The castle and the rights to rule over the villages of Berg, Andhausen, Donzhausen and parts of <span class="loc">Andwil</span> (TG), <span class="per">Mauren</span> and <span class="per">Mattwil</span> were rented out by the Cathedral of <span class="per">Constance</span> (not the Bishop) until <span class="date">1798</span>. The circumstances behind the removal of the diocese's administration and the emergence of the court in <span class="date">1386</span> are unclear. Some of the owners of the village included <span class="per">Egli von Zug</span> (<span class="date">1518</span>–67), Brümsi von <span class="loc">Herblingen</span> (<span class="date">1586</span>-1653/56) and the von Thurn-Valsassina family (<span class="date">1676</span>–<span class="date">1798</span>). The village chapel was probably built in the 11th Century. In <span class="date">1506</span> a benefice was donated, so that a chaplain could be supported in the village. The chapel remained a filial church of <span class="loc">Sulgen</span>. During the Protestant Reformation in <span class="date">1529</span>, the village converted to the new religion, while the court and ruler remained Catholic. Due to the religious tension, regular church services were not held in Berg until <span class="date">1575</span>. Until the founding of the <span class="loc">Reformed parish</span> in <span class="date">1851</span>, Berg was part of the <span class="loc">parish of Sulgen</span>. In 16th and 17th <span class="date">Centuries</span>, the Catholic parish also included Altishausen, Birwinken, Dotnacht, Graltshausen, Guntershausen, <span class="per">Hugelshofen</span> and <span class="per">Mattwil</span>. In <span class="date">1935</span>, the church stopped being a shared church and a Catholic church was built.</p><br><br>
