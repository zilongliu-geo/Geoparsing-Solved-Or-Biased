<p><span class="loc">Monroe</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Benton County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 617 at the 2010 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Corvallis</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Monroe</span> is located midway between Eugene and Corvallis along highway 99W and the city experiences a strong friendly rivalry between fans of the <span class="loc">Oregon Ducks</span> and the <span class="loc">Oregon State Beavers</span>. The city formed around a small sawmill established by Joseph White in 1852. By 1853, there was a small settlement known as White's Mill. Around the same time, Roland Hinton formed the town of <span class="loc">Starr Point</span> north of White's Mill. In 1857, <span class="loc">Starr Point</span> combined with White's Mill to form the town of <span class="loc">Monroe</span>. The city quickly became a center for paddle boat traffic. It was one of the largest cities in the state for many years. Monroe High School was built in the 1920s. Since the construction of I-5 in the 1960s, the city has turned into a rural farming community. It is the home of historic Hull-Oakes Lumber Mill, the only steam-powered sawmill operating in the <span class="loc">U.S</span>.</p>
