  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pacheco</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,685 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is located 5.5 miles (9 km) north of <span class="loc">Walnut Creek</span>. This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, <span class="loc">Pacheco</span> has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated "Csb" on climate maps. The town was laid out in <span class="date">1857</span> by <span class="per">Dr. J.H. Carothers</span> and named for Salvio Pacheco, grantee of the Rancho Monte del Diablo Mexican land grant. A post office operated at <span class="loc">Pacheco</span> from <span class="date">1859</span> to <span class="date">1913</span> and from <span class="date">1955</span> to the present. <span class="loc">Pacheco</span> was briefly a prosperous commercial center. During this period, Pacheco Slough was deep enough to receive ocean-based shipping. A series of fires and floods, as well as an earthquake, destroyed the town and filled the Slough with silt during the 1860s. <span class="loc">Pacheco</span> was subsequently depopulated by the attraction of the nearby town of <span class="loc">Todos Santos</span>, later to be known as <span class="org">Concord</span>.</p><br><br>
