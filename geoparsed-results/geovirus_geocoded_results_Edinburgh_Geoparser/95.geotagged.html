<p>Physicians and others are struggling to address a growing outbreak of influenza affecting a large portion of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Earlier this week, the Mayor of <span class="loc">Boston</span> declared a "flu emergency" for the city, as 700 cases of the virus were reported. Public officials in <span class="loc">Texas</span> have urged citizens to receive a flu shot. The state's public health Commissioner said in a press release, "The best thing people can do to protect themselves is to get a dose of flu vaccine now." Doctors are telling citizens to wash their hands, get a flu shot and avoid sick people if possible to lessen chances of catching the virus. However, a report released on Friday noted that 7.3% of deaths last week were a result of pneumonia and the flu. A total of 20 children in the <span class="loc">United States</span> have died during this flu season from flu-related illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control reports nine out of 10 regions in the <span class="loc">United States</span> had "elevated" flu activity. These data indicate that seasonal flu has spread and reached high levels several weeks before the usual time of late January or February. New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state-wide public health emergency on Saturday. He also issued an executive order which allows pharmacists to administer flu vaccinations to patients between six months and 18 years of age.</p>
