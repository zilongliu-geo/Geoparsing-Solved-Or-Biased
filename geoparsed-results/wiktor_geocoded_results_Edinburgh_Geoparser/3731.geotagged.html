<p>Nora is a small, unincorporated town in <span class="loc">Dickenson County</span> in the southern state of Virginia. In the 2000 <span class="loc">US</span> census, its population is listed as 566. Nora is built along one side of the <span class="loc">McClure River</span>. Coal mining has always been the primary business for the town and county. However, in recent years natural gas production has increased sharply because it has become possible to extract gas from the underlying Huron Shale formation. The Huron Shale deposit in this part of Virginia is called the Nora Field. The site of the town was originally called "Mouth of Open Fork", and in 1882 it was briefly the county seat of the newly formed <span class="loc">Dickenson County</span>. In 1904, a post office was built at Mouth of Open Fork, and the first postmaster, W. A. Dorton, arranged for the town and post office to be named for his wife Nora. The Clinchfield Railroad, which was built to haul coal from the area, passes through Nora. Construction of the railroad was completed in 1915, when the last track was laid near Nora.</p>
