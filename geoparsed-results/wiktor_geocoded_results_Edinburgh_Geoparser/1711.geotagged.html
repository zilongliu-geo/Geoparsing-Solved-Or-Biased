<p>The historic Town of <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is the Territorial Charter Municipality that is the county seat of Clear <span class="loc">Creek County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The former silver mining camp along <span class="loc">Clear Creek</span> in the Front Range of the <span class="loc">Rocky Mountains</span> was established in 1859 during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. The federally designated Georgetown-Silver Plume Historic District comprises <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>, the neighboring town of <span class="loc">Silver Plume</span>, and the <span class="loc">Georgetown Loop Historic Mining</span> &amp; Railroad Park between the two towns. The town population was 1,034 at the 2010 census. The Georgetown Post Office has the ZIP code 80444. The town sits at an elevation of 8,530 feet (2,600 m) above sea level, nestled in the mountains near the upper end of the valley of <span class="loc">Clear Creek</span> in the mountains west of <span class="loc">Denver</span> along Interstate 70. Although a small town today, the town was a historic center of the mining industry in <span class="loc">Colorado</span> during the late 19th century, earning the nickname the "Silver Queen of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>". It has evolved into a lively historical summer tourist center today with many preserved structures from the heyday of the <span class="loc">Colorado</span> Silver Boom. The town stretches roughly north-south along <span class="loc">Clear Creek</span>, hemmed in by the mountains, with the historic downtown located at the southern (upper) end and modern development located at the northern (lower) end of town.</p>
