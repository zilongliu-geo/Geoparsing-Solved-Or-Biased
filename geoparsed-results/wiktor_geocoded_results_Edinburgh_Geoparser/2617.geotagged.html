<p><span class="loc">Luoyang</span> (IPA: [lwɔ̂jɑ̌ŋ]; Chinese: 洛阳), formerly romanised as <span class="loc">Loyang</span>, is a city located in the confluence area of <span class="loc">Luo River</span> and <span class="loc">Yellow River</span> in <span class="loc">Central China</span>. It is a prefecture-level city in <span class="loc">western Henan province</span>. It borders the provincial capital of <span class="loc">Zhengzhou</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Pingdingshan</span> to the southeast, <span class="loc">Nanyang</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Sanmenxia</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Jiyuan</span> to the north, and <span class="loc">Jiaozuo</span> to the northeast. As of the final 2010 census, <span class="loc">Luoyang</span> had a population of 6,549,941 inhabitants with 1,857,003 people living in the built-up (or metro) area made of city's five urban districts, all of which except the <span class="loc">Jili District</span> not urbanized yet. Situated on the central plain of <span class="loc">China</span>, <span class="loc">Luoyang</span> is one of the cradles of Chinese civilization, and is one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of <span class="loc">China</span>. The name "Luoyang" originates from the city's location on the north or sunny ("yang") side of the <span class="loc">Luo</span> River. Since the river flows from west to east and the sun is to the south of the river, the sun always shines on the north side of the river. <span class="loc">Luoyang</span> has had several names over the centuries, including "Luoyi" (洛邑) and "Luozhou (洛州)", though <span class="loc">Luoyang</span> has been its primary name. It has been called, during various periods, "Dongdu" (东都, meaning the Eastern Capital, during the Tang Dynasty), "Xijing" (西京, meaning the Western Capital, during the Song Dynasty), or "Jingluo" (京洛, meaning the general capital for <span class="loc">China</span>).</p>
