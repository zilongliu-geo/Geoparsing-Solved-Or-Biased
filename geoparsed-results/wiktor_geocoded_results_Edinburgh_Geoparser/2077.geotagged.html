<p><span class="loc">Lexington</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Lexington Township</span>, <span class="loc">Scott County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located about 10 miles west of the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> and 28 miles <span class="loc">north of Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The town itself was founded before <span class="loc">Indiana</span> became the 19th state in 1816 and was located in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> at the time it was platted. It was the original county seat from 1820 to 1874, before local leaders decided on a more central location at nearby <span class="loc">Scottsburg</span>, which created animosity between the residents of the two towns for several decades afterwards. <span class="loc">Lexington</span> is located at 38°39′9.09″N 85°37′34.50″W (38.652525,-85.62625). <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was originally settled in 1804 and platted in 1810. It was one of eight towns that were considered for the first state capital of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, with <span class="loc">Corydon</span> gaining the honor. It was originally in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> until 1820, when <span class="loc">Scott County</span> was created from parts of Jennings, Jefferson, Clark, Washington and Jackson counties. This area of the state was largely settled by people from the Upper South, traveling by the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>. Since there were no other towns in the county, <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was selected as the county seat. After later settlement in northern parts of the county, there were several unsuccessful attempts to relocate the county seat to a more central location. This did not take place until 1874 when residents voted to relocate the county seat to <span class="loc">Scottsburg</span>, then spelled "Scottsburgh". Records were removed from the courthouse and transferred at night to avoid a civil war between residents. The relocation of the county seat to <span class="loc">Scottsburg</span> created animosity between the two towns for several decades.</p>
