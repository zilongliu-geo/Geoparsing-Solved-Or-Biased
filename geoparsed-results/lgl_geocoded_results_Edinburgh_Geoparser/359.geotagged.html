<p>Council backs rival ecotown plan. Councillors backed their own plan for a rival ecotown to the proposed Weston Otmoor scheme despite a stormy meeting tonight. It devised the scheme as a rival to the original plan to build 15,000 homes near <span class="loc">Weston-on-the-Green</span>. <span class="loc">Cherwell</span> claims Weston Otmoor would damage <span class="loc">Bicester</span> and <span class="loc">Kidlington</span>, while its own plan would benefit the former. But villagers and landowners mounted angry opposition at tonight's meeting, rounding on the north west option's chief architect, Cherwell leader Barry Wood. They have complained the scheme was drawn up without consulting them. Patrick Woodrow, of <span class="loc">Bucknell</span>, told Mr Wood to "find his spine" and stand up to housing minister Margaret Beckett. Landowner Rosemary Henson, of <span class="loc">Himley</span> farm in Chesteron, said: "I bitterly resent being thrown to the wolves as a decoy to divert attention from <span class="loc">Weston</span> Otmoor." But Mr Wood said the development would represent prosperity and investment in <span class="loc">Bicester</span>. He added the infrastructure <span class="loc">Bicester</span> desperately needed would only come with a large scale development like the north west <span class="loc">Bicester</span> proposal. Councillors backed the move to officially put <span class="loc">North West Bicester</span> in front of the Government as a better option to Weston Otmoor. A shortlist of ecotowns is expected to be drawn up in the summer.</p>
