  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Norfolk</span> (local /ˈnɔːrfɔːrk/) is a town in <span class="loc">Litchfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,787 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> is perhaps best known as the site of the <span class="loc">Yale</span> <span class="date">Summer</span> School of Music – <span class="org">Norfolk Chamber Music Festival</span>, which hosts an annual chamber music concert series in "the Music Shed," a performance hall located on the <span class="per">Ellen Battell</span> Stoeckel estate to the west of the village green. <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> has important examples of regional architecture, notably the Village Hall (<span class="date">now</span> Infinity Hall, a shingled 1880s Arts-and-Crafts confection, with an opera house upstairs and storefronts at street level); the <span class="org">Norfolk Library</span> (a shingle-style structure, designed by <span class="per">George Keller</span>, ca <span class="date">1888</span>/<span class="date">1889</span>); and over thirty buildings, in a wide variety of styles, designed by Alfredo S. G. Taylor (of the <span class="loc">New York</span> firm Taylor &amp; Levi) in <span class="date">the four decades</span> before the Second World War. <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1744</span> and incorporated in <span class="date">1758</span>, later than most surrounding towns because of the dense woods, rocky soil and high elevation. Originally a farming community, nineteenth-century <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> saw the rise of numerous small factories, many of which fabricated tools and farming implements from local iron ore, and mills, which took advantage of fast-flowing mountain streams.</p><br><br>
