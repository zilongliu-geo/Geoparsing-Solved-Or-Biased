<p><span class="loc">Lancaster</span> woman takes on the law – and wins top student award. A WOMAN from <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> has scooped a top award from The College of Law in York. Julia Krier has been named as the top student in her year on a graduate diploma in law course which gives non-law graduates an entry route into the legal profession. The 22-year-old, who lives in <span class="loc">Cockerham</span>, completed the course at the College of Law earlier this year with a distinction and is now undertaking a legal practice course, which she must pass before they can proceed to the next stage of training. Julia – pictured right receiving her award from Peter Hannam, President of Yorkshire Law Society – is a former Lancaster Girls’ Grammar School pupil who graduated from Lancaster University with a first class degree in history.</p>
