<p>Mason is a town in <span class="loc">Hillsborough County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,382 at the 2010 census. Mason, together with <span class="loc">Wilton</span>, is home to Russell-Abbott State Forest. Mason was first known as Number One, the first in a line of border towns including area allotted to the Province of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> after its border with neighboring <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> was fixed in 1739. The town's charter was granted in 1749 by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, and in 1768 his nephew, Governor John Wentworth, named it in honor of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>'s founder, Captain John Mason. Captain Mason was the holder of patent with title to the land that became <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was set off from Mason in 1872. Near the town's center is the boyhood home of Samuel Wilson, the meat-supplier who is believed to have inspired the <span class="loc">Uncle Sam</span> character. The private house is today identified by a state historical marker. Another prominent local figure was Elizabeth Orton <span class="loc">Jones</span>, an author, illustrator and teacher better known as "Twig." <span class="loc">Jones</span> is noted for her recording of town history and her dedication to Andy's Summer Playhouse, a renowned youth theater founded in Mason. Pickity Place, a local cottage built in 1759 by Ebenezer Blood, was the model for the grandmother's house in <span class="loc">Jones</span>' 1948 illustrated version of Little <span class="loc">Red Riding Hood</span>. Pickity Place was created by David and Judith Walter. It was also the home of Ron Harry, <span class="loc">Boston Garden</span> organist from 1983â€“1995 and for the Boston Celtics in the TD <span class="loc">Banknorth</span> Garden until his death in 2004.</p>
