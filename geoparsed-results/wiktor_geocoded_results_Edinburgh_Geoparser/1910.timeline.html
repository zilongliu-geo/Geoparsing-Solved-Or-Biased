  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lakewood</span> is a neighborhood of the city of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. A subdistrict of the <span class="loc">Lakeview District</span> Area, its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: Veterans Memorial Boulevard to the north, <span class="loc">Pontchartrain Boulevard</span> and the <span class="loc">Pontchartrain Expressway</span> to the east, Last, Quince, <span class="loc">Hamilton</span>, Peach, Mistletoe, <span class="loc">Dixon</span>, <span class="per">Cherry</span> and <span class="per">Palmetto</span> Streets to the south and the 17th Street Canal to the west. For <span class="date">decades</span> <span class="org">Lakewood Country Club</span> operated in the neighborhood, predating most residential construction and bestowing its name upon the developing area. With the finalization of I-10's and I-610's routes in <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, much of Lakewood's golf course was expropriated for the sprawling I-10/I-610 interchange. <span class="org">Lakewood Country Club</span> relocated to the Algiers neighborhood, on the <span class="loc">West Bank</span> of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River, and the remainder of the golf course was developed as the <span class="loc">Lakewood North</span> and <span class="loc">Lakewood South</span> subdivisions. The former clubhouse remained for <span class="date">years</span>, visible from I-10 and lastly used as the main building for the now-closed <span class="org">New Orleans Academy</span>. The clubhouse was ultimately demolished to make room for a LDS Church, itself demolished in the aftermath of catastrophic flooding occurring in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.</p><br><br>
