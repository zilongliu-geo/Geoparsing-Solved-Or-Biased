<p>McLean (/məˈkleɪn/ mə-KLAYN) is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Fairfax County</span> in Northern Virginia. McLean is home to many diplomats, businessmen, members of Congress, and high-ranking government officials partially due to its proximity to <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span> and the CIA <span class="loc">Central Intelligence Agency</span>. It is the location of Hickory Hill, the former home of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy. It is also the location of <span class="loc">Salona</span>, the former home of Light-Horse Harry Lee, the Revolutionary War hero. The community had a total population of 48,115 as of the 2010 census. It is located between the George Washington <span class="loc">Parkway</span> and the town of <span class="loc">Vienna</span>. McLean is known for its luxury homes and its high-end shopping destinations: the Tysons Corner Center and the Tysons Galleria. McLean ZIP code 22102 is the wealthiest ZIP code in the <span class="loc">Washington Metropolitan</span> Area. The community received its name from John Roll McLean, the former publisher and owner of The Washington Post, who, with Stephen Benton Elkins and French aristocrat Jean-Pierre Guenard, built in 1906 the electrified <span class="loc">Great Falls</span> and Old Dominion Railway (later the <span class="loc">Washington</span> and Old Dominion Railway), which connected the area with <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span> McLean named a railroad station costing $1,500, of which $500 was raised locally, after himself where the rail line (traveling on the present route of Old Dominion Drive) crossed the old Chain Bridge Road. The community itself was founded in 1910, when the communities of <span class="loc">Lewinsville</span> and <span class="loc">Langley</span> merged.</p>
