  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lincoln</span> (/ˈlɪŋkən/) is a cathedral city and the county town of <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span>, within the East Midlands of <span class="loc">England</span>. The non-metropolitan <span class="loc">district of Lincoln</span> has a <span class="date">2012</span> population of 94,600. The <span class="date">2011</span> census gave the entire urban area of <span class="per">Lincoln</span> (which includes <span class="loc">North Hykeham</span> and <span class="loc">Waddington</span>) a population of 130,200. <span class="per">Lincoln</span> developed from the Roman town of Lindum Colonia, which developed from an Iron Age settlement. <span class="per">Lincoln</span>'s major landmarks are <span class="loc">Lincoln</span> Cathedral, a fine example of English Gothic architecture, and <span class="per">Lincoln Castle</span>, an 11th-century Norman castle. The city is also home to the <span class="org">University</span> of <span class="per">Lincoln</span> and <span class="per">Bishop</span> <span class="org">Grosseteste University</span>. <span class="per">Lincoln</span> is situated in a gap in the <span class="per">Lincoln Cliff</span> 141 miles (227 kilometres) north of <span class="loc">London</span>, at an elevation of 20.4 metres (66.9 feet) above sea level by the <span class="loc">River Witham</span>, stretching up to 75 metres (246.1 feet) above sea level in the uphill area around the cathedral. The earliest origins of <span class="per">Lincoln</span> can be traced to the remains of an Iron Age settlement of round wooden dwellings (which were discovered by archaeologists in <span class="date">1972</span>) that have been dated to the <span class="date">1st century BC</span>. This settlement was built by a deep pool (the modern Brayford Pool) in the <span class="loc">River Witham</span> at the foot of a large hill (on which the <span class="loc">Normans</span> later built <span class="loc">Lincoln</span> Cathedral and <span class="per">Lincoln Castle</span>).</p><br><br>
