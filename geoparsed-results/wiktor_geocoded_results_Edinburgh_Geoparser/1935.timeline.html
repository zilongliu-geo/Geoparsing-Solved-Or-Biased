  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Riverton</span> or <span class="per">Aparima</span> is a small town 30 kilometres west of <span class="loc">Invercargill</span> via State Highway 99 on the Southern Scenic Route. It is situated on the south-eastern shorelines of the Jacobs River Estuary being formed by the <span class="loc">Aparima</span> and Pourakino Rivers, which leads through a narrow outflow channel into <span class="loc">Foveaux Strait</span>. The main part of the town is on flat land (the Southland Plains) and the northern end of Oreti Beach but <span class="loc">South Riverton</span> is built on the hills (the Longwood Range) between the eastern shore of the estuary and <span class="loc">Taramea</span> Bay. <span class="per">Riverton</span> is the oldest permanent settlement of <span class="loc">Southland</span> and one of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>'s oldest towns. In <span class="date">2011</span> the town's people of <span class="per">Riverton</span> celebrated their 175th anniversary. The main industry is fishing. However farming (esp. dairying) is fast becoming the industry of influence as the fishing slowly dries up. Support services such as transport, irrigation, engineering and various farm related contractors <span class="date">now</span> play an important part in the local economy. The fish factory based on its main wharf has <span class="date">now</span> been converted to a butchery. However, the harbour is still quite busy, because, along with Bluff, it is a safe harbour for access to <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>'s south / west seas. It is also popular for water skiing, rowing, fishing and catching the occasional flounder. <span class="loc">Taramea</span> Bay is a popular spot in the <span class="date">summer</span> for Southland residents to swim as it provides safe swimming and excellent surf spots. <span class="per">Riverton</span> is well known for dolphin spotting as they like to travel up into the estuary for feeding. Sawmilling has been important to <span class="per">Riverton</span> and <span class="per">Pankhurst</span>'s Mill still supplies timber locally and to wider <span class="loc">Southland</span>.</p><br><br>
