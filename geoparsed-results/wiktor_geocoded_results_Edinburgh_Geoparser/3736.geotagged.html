<p><span class="loc">Kayes</span> (Bambara: <span class="loc">Kayi</span>, Soninké: Xaayi) is a city in western <span class="loc">Mali</span> on the Sénégal River, with a population of 127,368 at the 2009 census. <span class="loc">Kayes</span> is the capital of the administrative region of the same name. The name "Kayes" comes from the Soninké word "karré", which describes a low humid place that floods in rainy season. The city is located 420 kilometres (260 mi) northwest of the capital <span class="loc">Bamako</span>. Prior to French colonial expansion, <span class="loc">Kayes</span> was a small village. Its location on the path of the future Dakar-Niger Railway, and the French need for trade centers, led to the creation of the Kayes market town in 1881. It remains a transport hub, primarily for Senegalese trade, to this day. In 1892, <span class="loc">Kayes</span> became the capital of the <span class="loc">French Sudan</span>; <span class="loc">Bamako</span> replaced it as the capital, first of the state of Haut Sénégal-Niger on October 17, 1899, then as the capital of all of <span class="loc">French Sudan</span> in 1908. <span class="loc">Kayes</span> lies on the Route Nationale 1 (RN1) highway and is 612 km (380 mi) by road from <span class="loc">Bamako</span> and 96 km (60 mi) from the border with <span class="loc">Senegal</span>. The town has an international airport (Kayes Airport), and lies on the Dakar-Niger Railway which offered regional passenger train service to <span class="loc">Bamako</span> three times a week via <span class="loc">Kati</span> and <span class="loc">Diamou</span> as of 2013.  The area is rich in gold and iron.</p>
