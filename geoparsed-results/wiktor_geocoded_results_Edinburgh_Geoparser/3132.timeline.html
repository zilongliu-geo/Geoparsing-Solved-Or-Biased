  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ramah</span> was a small mission run by the Moravian Church in northern <span class="loc">Labrador</span> from <span class="date">1871</span> until <span class="date">1908</span>. It was located on <span class="loc">Ramah Bay</span> at 58° 52' <span class="per">N Lat</span>; 063° 15' W Long. <span class="loc">Ramah Bay</span> is the site of an uncommon semi-translucent light-grey stone with dark banding called "Ramah chert". The <span class="loc">Ramah</span> chert outcrops in a narrow geological bed stretching from <span class="loc">Saglek Fiord</span> to <span class="loc">Nachvak</span>. At <span class="loc">Ramah Bay</span> the highest quality stone, for flaking chipped stone tools (mostly bifaces and projectile points), is most readily accessible. Discovered by pioneering Native American groups, which archaeologists identify as the Maritime Archaic Culture, around 7000 years ago, the stone was highly valued for its functional as well as spiritual qualities. <span class="loc">Ramah</span> chert was the preferred raw material for the Maritime Archaic Indians (ca. 7000 to 3500 years ago) and for succeeding populations of Dorset paleoeskimos (ca. <span class="date">2200</span> to <span class="date">800 years ago</span>) and by the immediate ancestors of the Innu (from <span class="date">about 2000 years ago</span> to contact with the Europeans in the 18th century). Ramahchert was traded as far south as <span class="loc">New England</span> and even <span class="loc">Chesapeake</span> Bay and west to the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> which is documented in a report by <span class="per">Stephen Loring</span>.</p><br><br>
