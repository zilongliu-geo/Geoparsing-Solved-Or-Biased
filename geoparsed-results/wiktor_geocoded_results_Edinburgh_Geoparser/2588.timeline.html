  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Buda</span> is a historical neighbourhood in the Belgian <span class="loc">city of Courtray</span>. The neighbourhood is part of the historical old town. Since it lies between two branches of the River Leie, it is an island and is also called the 'Buda-island'. <span class="loc">Buda</span> has been known as the area north of the River Leie for <span class="date">centuries</span>. From 1454 onwards, <span class="loc">Buda</span> was incorporated within the city boundaries thanks to new ramparts. This stone wall around the city was 2.3 km long. The name <span class="loc">Buda</span> rose for the first time at the end of the 17th century. In <span class="date">1686</span>, the <span class="loc">city of Buda</span> in <span class="loc">Hungary</span> was conquered from the Turks. Compared to Pest, the upper town of <span class="loc">Buda</span> lies on the other side of the <span class="loc">Donau</span> River. When <span class="loc">Vauban</span> in <span class="date">1690</span> and <span class="date">1698</span> developed the new fortifications around the <span class="loc">Buda</span> Island in Courtray, people said they had built a little <span class="loc">Buda</span> over here, near the existing Broel Towers. This name was kept alive among the inhabitants of the city and was found for the first times in the city archives in <span class="date">1734</span>. Later on, this name was given to the main street along the island. This <span class="loc">Buda</span> street (Budastraat in Dutch) is one of the eldest streets in town.</p><br><br>
