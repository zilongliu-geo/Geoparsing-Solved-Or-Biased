  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Somerset</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Pulaski County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city population was 11,196 according to the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1798</span> by <span class="per">Thomas Hansford</span> and received its name from <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, where some of the early settlers had formerly lived. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> became the <span class="loc">Pulaski County</span> seat in <span class="date">1802</span>, and it was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1887</span>. A significant Civil War battle was fought in <span class="date">January 1862</span>, at Mill Springs (<span class="date">now</span> "Nancy") about 8 miles (13 km) west of <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, and a museum is at the site. A smaller battle was fought nearby at Dutton's Hill in <span class="date">1863</span>. The completion of Lake Cumberland in <span class="date">1950</span> transformed <span class="loc">Somerset</span> from a sleepy rural community into one of the largest recreation centers in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, drawing more than 1.7 million visitors annually, especially between the Memorial and <span class="date">Labor Day</span> holidays. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> is located at 37°4′59″N 84°36′34″W (37.082966, -84.609387), and the downtown (central) part of the city is at an elevation of around 750–800 feet above sea level. The city is located at the eastern end of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>'s <span class="loc">Mississippian</span> Plateau (or <span class="loc">Pennyroyal</span> Plateau); however, the micropolitan area extends eastward into the Appalachian Plateau (or Eastern <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> Coalfield), and northward to <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>'s [[Bluegrass region |Outer Bluegrass]] region. Thus, the area shows significant variations in landforms and scenery.</p><br><br>
