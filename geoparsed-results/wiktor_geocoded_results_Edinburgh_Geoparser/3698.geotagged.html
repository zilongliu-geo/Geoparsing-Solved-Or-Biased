The walk is 2.45 miles long and passes All Saints Church, Park Pond, and the cemetery. The small hamlet of Burthorpe Green is attached to Barrow. The playing field in the centre of the village is bordered by 19 poplar trees. On the small road to <span class="loc">Risby</span> is a large steep hill known locally as Bread &amp; <span class="loc">Water Hill</span>.
