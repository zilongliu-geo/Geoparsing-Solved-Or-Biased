  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alexandria or Fort Alexandria is a National Historic Site of <span class="loc">Canada</span> on the <span class="loc">Fraser River</span> in British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, and was the end of the Old Cariboo Road and the Cariboo Wagon Road. It is located on Highway 97, 103 miles north of 100 Mile House and 28 miles south of <span class="loc">Quesnel</span>. On <span class="date">June 21, 1793</span>, explorer <span class="per">Alexander MacKenzie</span> reached the shores of the First Nations village at what would become Alexandria. He was told by the people of the village that the river was not safe for navigation beyond that point. <span class="per">Mackenzie</span> heeded their advice and he and his party turned around and returned upriver to what would become the town of Quesnellemouth, (later <span class="loc">Quesnel</span>) and continued on to <span class="loc">Bella Coola</span>. In <span class="date">1821</span>, the North West Company erected a fort at Alexandria, the last the company would build before it was merged the same year with the Hudson's Bay Company. The fort was named Alexandria in honour of <span class="per">Alexander Mackenzie</span>. They also built a grainery and wintered their horses there. Alexandria became a key way station along the Hudson's Bay Brigade Trail.</p><br><br>
