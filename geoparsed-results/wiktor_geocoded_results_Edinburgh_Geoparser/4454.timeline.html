  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Chatham</span> (/ˈtʃætəm/ CHAT-əm) is one of the <span class="loc">Medway</span> towns located within the <span class="loc">Medway</span> unitary authority, in <span class="loc">North Kent</span>, in <span class="loc">South East England</span>. Chatham Royal Dockyard closed in <span class="date">1984</span>, but major naval buildings remain as the focus for a flourishing tourist industry. Following closure, part of the site became a commercial port, other parts were redeveloped for business and residential use, and part became the Chatham Historic Dockyard museum, which features the submarine HMS Ocelot among a good many other attractions. <span class="loc">Chatham</span> also has military connections; several Army barracks were located here, together with 19th-century forts which provided a defensive shield for the dockyard. Brompton Barracks, located in the town, remains the headquarters of the <span class="org">Corps of Royal Engineers</span>. The town has important road links and the railway and bus stations are the main interchanges for the area. It is the administrative headquarters of <span class="loc">Medway</span> unitary authority, as well as its principal shopping centre. The name <span class="loc">Chatham</span> was first recorded as Cetham in 880. The Domesday Book records the place as Ceteham. Most books explain this name as a British root ceto (like Welsh coed) plus Old English ham, thus meaning a forest settlement. However, the river-valley situation of <span class="loc">Chatham</span> is more consistent with cet being an Old English survival of the element catu that was common in Roman-era names and meant 'basin' or 'valley'.</p><br><br>
