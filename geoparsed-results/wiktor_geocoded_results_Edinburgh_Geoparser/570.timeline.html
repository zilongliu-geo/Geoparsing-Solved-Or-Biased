  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Milton is a 6th-class city along the south bank of the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> in <span class="loc">Trimble County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 525 at the time of the <span class="date">year 2000</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census. The Milton-Madison Bridge connects it to <span class="org">Madison</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, and is the only road link between the two states for 40 miles in either direction. It was the setting for the <span class="date">1958</span> film Some Came Running. Milton was settled in <span class="date">1785</span> and founded in <span class="date">1789</span>, at which time it was still part of Virginia. A ferry with <span class="org">Madison</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, on the opposite side of the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> began service in <span class="date">1804</span>. The current bridge connecting them was constructed in <span class="date">1929</span>. The city has endured many floods and most of its riverside downtown has been repeatedly destroyed, leaving little historic architecture. Two exceptions are Ginn's Furniture Store and the building housing Rowlett's Grocery, both of which are located on Main Street. Milton was hit by a tornado on <span class="date">March 2, 2012</span>. The <span class="org">Milton Fire and Rescue</span> firehouse was destroyed. Milton is located at 38°42.6′N 85°22.5′W (38.7095, -85.3742).</p><br><br>
