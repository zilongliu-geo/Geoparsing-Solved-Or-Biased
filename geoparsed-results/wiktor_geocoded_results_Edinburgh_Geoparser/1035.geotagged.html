<p>Duma (Arabic: دوما‎, also spelled as <span class="loc">Douma</span>) is Palestinian town in the Nablus Governorate in the northern <span class="loc">West Bank</span>, located 25 kilometers southeast of <span class="loc">Nablus</span>. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the town had a population of 2,220 inhabitants in mid-year 2006. Duma's total land area consists of 17,351 dunams, about 200 of which are designated as built-up area. On 31 July, 2015, suspected Israeli settlers firebombed two homes in Duma, killing 18-month-old Ali Saad Dawabsha and critically injuring his parents and 4-year-old brother. The boy, Ali, died in the attack; his father, 32, died later of second-degree burns over most of his body, followed by the death of his wife, from her injuries, about 5 weeks later. The attack is believed to be a price tag attack by Israeli settlers, who were seen fleeing towards Ma'ale Efrayim. Pottery sherds from the Hellenistic, Hellenistic/Roman and Roman era have been found. South–southwest of the village is a spring called <span class="loc">Ayn Duma</span>, where water has been collected in ancient small pools, some hollowed out of rock.</p>
