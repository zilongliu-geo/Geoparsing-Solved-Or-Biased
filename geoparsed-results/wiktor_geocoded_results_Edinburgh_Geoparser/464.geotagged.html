<p>Bar (Montenegrin: Бар, pronounced [bâr], Italian: <span class="loc">Antivari</span>, Albanian: Tivar) is a coastal town and seaport in southern <span class="loc">Montenegro</span>. It is the capital of the Bar Municipality and a center for tourism. In 2011, its population was 40,037. Bar is a shortened form of <span class="loc">Antivari</span>, which is derived from the town's location across the <span class="loc">Adriatic Sea</span> from <span class="loc">Bari</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>. Variations are in Italian, Antivari / Antibari; in Turkish, Bar; Albanian: Tivari; Greek: Θηβάριον, Thivárion, Αντιβάριον, Antivárion; in Latin, Antibarium. Local archaeological findings date to the Neolithic era. It is assumed that Bar was mentioned as the reconstructed Roman castle, Antipargal, in the 6th century. The name Antibarium was quoted for the first time in the 10th century. In the 6th and 7th centuries, Slavs occupied the <span class="loc">Balkans</span>. <span class="loc">Duklja</span>, a Slavic, or Serbian state, was mentioned in the 10th century. Jovan Vladimir (ruler 1000 - 1016), of Skadarska Krajina is the first ruler of <span class="loc">Duklja</span> whose history is known. Stefan Vojislav (ruler 1018 - 1043), the eponymous founder of the Vojislavljević dynasty, defeated the Byzantines in a battle on a hill near Bar. He made Bar his seat of power. Vojislav then expanded the area under his rule. Mihailo I of <span class="loc">Duklja</span> (ruler 1050 - 1081), Vojislav's son, established the Archdiocese of <span class="loc">Antivari</span>. He continued to fight the Byzantines in order to secure the town's independence. This led to a union of states known as the Serbian Grand Principality. From 1101 to 1166, the principality was ruled by the Vukanović dynasty. However, for much of this time, Bar was under Byzantine rule. In 1183, Stefan Nemanja conquered Bar and it stayed under Serbian control under the Nemanjić dynasty.</p>
