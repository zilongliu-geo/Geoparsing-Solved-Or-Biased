<p>Buffalo is a town in <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along the <span class="loc">Kanawha River</span>. The population was 1,236 at the 2010 census. Buffalo is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Along with numerous sites in the Kanawha River Valley, Buffalo was originally settled by waves of ancient cultures of prehistoric indigenous peoples. Clovis points indicate the presence of inhabitants more than 10,000 years ago. One of the last cultures, that of the Fort Ancient people, had a few villages such as Buffalo and Marmet that survived into the time of European exploration. Archaeologists have found European trade items among Fort Ancient artifacts. Historic tribes such as the <span class="loc">Huron</span>, from the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> region, and the Conoy (also spelled Conois and Kanawha) were driven out of the central valley by Iroquois' invading from their base in present-day western <span class="loc">New York</span>. Many of the Conoy by the early 17th century had resettled on the west side of the <span class="loc">Chesapeake</span> Bay and below the <span class="loc">Potomac River</span>. After decades of encroachment by English colonists, surviving Conoy (also called <span class="loc">Piscataway</span> by then) went north to <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and allied with the Susquehannock and Iroquois.</p>
