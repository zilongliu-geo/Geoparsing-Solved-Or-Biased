According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 26.0 square miles (67.4 km2), of which 25.9 square miles (67.1 km2) is land and 0.12 square miles (0.3 km2), or 0.41%, is water. <span class="loc">Peru</span> lies on the eastern border of <span class="loc">Berkshire County</span>, and is bordered by <span class="loc">Windsor</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Cummington</span> to the northeast, <span class="loc">Worthington</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Middlefield</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Washington</span> to the southwest, and <span class="loc">Hinsdale</span> to the west. <span class="loc">Peru</span> is 13 miles (21 km) east of <span class="loc">Pittsfield</span>, 40 miles (64 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Springfield</span> and 118 miles (190 km) west of <span class="loc">Boston</span>.</p><br><br>
