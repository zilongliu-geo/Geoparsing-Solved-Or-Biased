  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The Town of <span class="per">Windsor</span> is a Home Rule Municipality in <span class="per">Larimer</span> and <span class="per">Weld</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, the population of the town was 18,644. <span class="per">Windsor</span> is located in the region known as Northern <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. <span class="per">Windsor</span> is situated 59 miles (95 km) north of the <span class="loc">Colorado</span> <span class="loc">State Capitol</span> in <span class="loc">Denver</span>. A rich wheat farming district, the area around <span class="per">Windsor</span> first drew permanent residents in the early 1870s. Two factors were to play a critical role in stimulating <span class="per">Windsor</span>'s early development: irrigation and the railroad. Irrigation increased crop variety and production and the railroad shipped this bounty to market. The town was platted in <span class="date">1882</span>, the same year the <span class="per">Windsor</span> Railroad Depot was built, and incorporated in <span class="date">1890</span>. It was named for the <span class="per">Rev. Samuel Asa Windsor</span>. By <span class="date">1900</span>, tariffs on foreign sugar had created a market for new sources of sugar. Research in the improved cultivation of sugar beets was taking place at <span class="org">Colorado Agricultural College</span> in Fort Collins, and the capital to advance production and manufacture of beet sugar was coming together. In <span class="date">1903</span> a factory for producing sugar from sugar beets was built in <span class="per">Windsor</span>. Sugar beet cultivation required large numbers of "stoop laborers", a need that was met by ethnic German immigrants from <span class="loc">Russia</span>. With large families and a strong work ethic, the German-Russians who settled in <span class="per">Windsor</span> and other sugar beet areas would achieve financial success within one generation and own the highest producing beet farms. The Great <span class="org">Western Sugar Company</span> fueled <span class="per">Windsor</span>'s economy through the mid-1960s, when the <span class="per">Windsor</span> factory closed. Plentiful water and land drew <span class="org">Kodak</span> to <span class="per">Windsor</span> where it opened a manufacturing plant on the heels of the sugar factory's closing.</p><br><br>
