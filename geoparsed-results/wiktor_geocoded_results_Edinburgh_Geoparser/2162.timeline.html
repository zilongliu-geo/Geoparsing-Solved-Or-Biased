  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Florence</span> (O'odham: S-auppag) is a town, sixty-one miles southeast of Phoenix, in the <span class="loc">Pinal County</span> of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Florence</span>, which is the county seat of <span class="loc">Pinal County</span>, is one of the oldest towns in that county and is regarded as a National Historic District with over 25 buildings listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Florence</span> was 25,536 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The area where the current town of <span class="loc">Florence</span> is located was once inhabited by the members of the Athabascans, ancestors of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Prior to the establishment of the town, the <span class="loc">Gila River</span> served as a part of the border between the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. In <span class="date">1853</span>, the <span class="loc">Gadsden Purchase</span> extended American territory well south of the <span class="loc">Gila</span>. <span class="per">Levi Ruggles</span>, a veteran of the American Civil War founded the town of <span class="loc">Florence</span>, on the southern boundary of the <span class="loc">Gila River</span>. He came to <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Territory in <span class="date">1866</span> as a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Indian Agent. Recognizing the agricultural potential of the valley, he found an easily fordable crossing on the <span class="loc">Gila River</span> and surveyed a townsite there. With the aid of <span class="per">Governor R.C. McCormick</span>, he secured a post office in <span class="date">August</span> of the same year. <span class="per">Ruggles</span> held numerous public offices including that of Territorial Legislator. <span class="loc">Florence</span> became the government seat of <span class="loc">Pinal County</span> Courthouse in the newly formed <span class="loc">Pinal County</span> and silver was discovered at the Silver King Mine in <span class="date">1875</span>.</p><br><br>
