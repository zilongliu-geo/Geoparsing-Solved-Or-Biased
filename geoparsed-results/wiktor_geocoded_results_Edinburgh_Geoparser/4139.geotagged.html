<p><span class="loc">Hegang</span> (Chinese: 鹤岗; pinyin: Hègǎng, also known as Haoli and Heligang), is a prefecture-level city in <span class="loc">Heilongjiang province</span> of the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, situated in the southeastern section of the Lesser Khingan Range, facing <span class="loc">Jiamusi</span> across the <span class="loc">Songhua</span> River to the south and <span class="loc">Russia</span>'s <span class="loc">Jewish Autonomous Oblast</span> across the <span class="loc">Amur River</span> to the north. <span class="loc">Hegang</span> is one of the principal coal-producing cities in <span class="loc">China</span>. <span class="loc">Hegang</span> covers an administrative area of 14,679.88 km2 (5,667.93 sq mi) and according to the 2010 Census, has a population of 1,058,665 inhabitants. Its built-up area is home to 664,471 inhabitants spread out over 5 urban districts including <span class="loc">Dongshan</span> being urbanized, even though still largely rural. The region of <span class="loc">Hegang</span> was a desolate and uninhabited area until the late 1890s. In 1906, the area of <span class="loc">Hegang City</span> was under the administration of <span class="loc">Tangyuan County</span> under the Qing Dynasty. Since then, the government has been encouraging people to farm in the region. In 1914, coalfield was discovered in Haoli, and Heilongjiang Government approved to set up Xinghua Mines (興華煤礦) which is jointly invested by merchants including Shen Songnian (沈松年). The area was also renamed <span class="loc">Xingshan</span> (興山) after the Xinghua Coal Mine. The <span class="loc">Hegang</span> mines were founded in 1916 by a Chinese entrepreneur with Russian capital. <span class="loc">Hegang</span> has witnessed rapid economic growth thanks to its rich coal resources. In 1926 a railway was built between <span class="loc">Hegang</span> and <span class="loc">Jiamusi</span>, some 30 miles to the south on the <span class="loc">Songhua</span> River. A coal carrier fleet was privately financed in 1930 by General Zhang Xueliang. On August 1932, <span class="loc">Hegang</span> mines were occupied by the Japanese as the Japanese Empire advanced through <span class="loc">Manchuria</span>. The mines were further developed during the Japanese occupation of <span class="loc">Manchuria</span>. On August 11, 1945, <span class="loc">Hegang</span> was occupied by the Soviet Red Army, and was relegated to the Communist Force. Since several major coal mines in southern <span class="loc">Manchuria</span> were controlled by Kuomintang Forces, <span class="loc">Hegang</span> became one of the main coal-producing area of Communist Force in the Chinese Civil-War, playing an important role in guaranteeing the acquisition of weapons and other war materials. <span class="loc">Hegang</span> was renamed in 1949, and set up as a prefecture-level city in Heilongjiang.</p>
