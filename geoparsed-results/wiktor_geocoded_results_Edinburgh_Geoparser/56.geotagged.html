<p>For the town in <span class="loc">Erie County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, see Aurora, <span class="loc">Erie County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> Aurora is a village and college town in the town of <span class="loc">Ledyard</span>, <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The village had a population of 724 at the 2010 census. Wells College, an institution of higher education for women founded by Henry Wells in 1868, is located in Aurora. It became coeducational in 2005, and since then enrollment has risen. In 1980, its Aurora Village-Wells College Historic District, with more than 50 contributing properties, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. From 2001 to 2007, redevelopment of historic properties in the village by entrepreneur Pleasant Rowland and the Aurora Foundation earned compliments, as well as provoking citizen concern, a lawsuit joined by state and national preservation organizations, and national media attention. Indigenous peoples occupied the lakeshore and riverways in present-day <span class="loc">New York</span> for thousands of years. Prior to European-American settlement, a major Cayuga Indian village, Chonodote, stood near the present-day site of Aurora village. It had permanent dwellings and the people cultivated fields for their staple crops of varieties of corn, beans and squash. Chonodote was destroyed by the Sullivan Expedition in 1779 during the Revolutionary War, when the <span class="loc">Cayuga</span> were allies of the British army, in retaliation for raids by Joseph Brant and his Mohawk and Loyalist forces mostly in the eastern <span class="loc">Mohawk Valley</span>. Most of the <span class="loc">Cayuga</span> went with other Iroquois nations to <span class="loc">Canada</span>, where their descendants are enrolled in the Six Nations Reserve. Some members of the Cayuga tribe returned to the area after the war, but the tribe had been forced to cede its land to <span class="loc">New York</span>. They were left landless and shared space with the <span class="loc">Seneca</span> on their reservation that once included the north end of <span class="loc">Cayuga Lake</span>.</p>
