  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Richmond</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Cheshire County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,155 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town was first chartered in <span class="date">1735</span> by Governor <span class="per">Jonathan Belcher</span> of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Granted to soldiers returning from the war in <span class="loc">Canada</span>, it was named Sylvester-Canada in honor of <span class="per">Captain Joseph Sylvester</span> of <span class="loc">Scituate</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, who was killed in <span class="date">1690</span> during an attempt to capture <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. After the border between <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> was fixed, the town fell on the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> side of the line. It was incorporated in <span class="date">1752</span> as <span class="per">Richmond</span> by Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span>. He named it after <span class="per">Charles Lennox</span>, 3rd <span class="per">Duke of Richmond</span>, a staunch advocate of colonial independence. It was settled about <span class="date">1757</span> by emigrants from <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> and <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 37.8 square miles (98 km2), of which 37.6 sq mi (97 km2) is land and 0.2 sq mi (0.52 km2) is water, comprising 0.53% of the town. <span class="loc">Little Monadnock Mountain</span>, elevation 1,883 feet (574 m) above sea level, is within a mile of the eastern boundary, in the town of <span class="loc">Fitzwilliam</span>. The highest point in <span class="per">Richmond</span> is one mile northwest of Little Monadnock, on an unnamed hill whose elevation is 1,624 feet (495 m) above sea level. The Franconia Mountain Range (not to be confused with the much higher ridge in the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span> to the north) is a 1,300-foot (400 m) high chain of hills in the western part of town.</p><br><br>
