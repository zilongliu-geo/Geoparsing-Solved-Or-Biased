  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rockville</span> is a former city in <span class="loc">Delaware County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Bordering <span class="loc">Dubuque County</span> within the North Fork Township, it was approximately 3 miles northwest of <span class="loc">Worthington</span> and 1.5 miles west of <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="loc">Iowa</span> Highway 136. <span class="loc">Rockville</span> was founded in <span class="date">1845</span> by <span class="per">Oliver A. Olmstead</span>. Second only to <span class="loc">Delhi</span>, it was one of the oldest towns in <span class="loc">Delaware County</span>. The area served as an important trading point and included a sawmill, a gristmill, a blacksmith, hotel, and various stores. Slightly predating Rockville's establishment, a log schoolhouse was built in <span class="date">1843</span>. This would be rebuilt in brick after burning down <span class="date">ten years</span> after its founding. During this era, <span class="loc">Rockville</span> served as a stagecoach stop for those heading west of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. The <span class="loc">Rockville</span> post office opened <span class="date">June 15, 1846</span> with <span class="per">Olmstead</span> serving as postmaster, and a hotel was opened for travelers of the Western Stage Company. The town's popularity even saw <span class="per">Charles W. Hobbs</span>, one of the first settlers in <span class="loc">Delhi</span>, relocating to <span class="loc">Rockville</span> in <span class="date">1850</span>. <span class="per">Hobbs</span> subsequently opened a store which allegedly found great success.</p><br><br>
