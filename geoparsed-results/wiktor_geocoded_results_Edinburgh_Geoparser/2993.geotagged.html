<p><span class="loc">Acton</span> is a hamlet and townland of 22 acres in <span class="loc">County Armagh</span>, <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>, about a half mile north of Poyntzpass. It is situated in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Ballymore</span> and the historic barony of <span class="loc">Orior</span> Lower and within the <span class="loc">Armagh City</span> and District Council area. It had a population of 72 people (28 households) in the 2011 Census. The village was founded in the 17th century, during the Plantation of <span class="loc">Ulster</span>, by Sir Toby Poyntz. He was the son of Lieutenant Charles Poyntz, who, for his military services, obtained a 500 acres (2.0 km2) grant of land that had been confiscated from the O'Hanlons by the English. The Irish called the area An Chora Uachtarach, meaning "the upper weir". There he built a bawn 100 feet (30 m) square, a house of brick and lime for himself, and 24 cottages for so many English settlers. The Poyntz family were anciently feudal barons of <span class="loc">Curry Mallet</span> in <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, later of <span class="loc">Iron Acton</span> in <span class="loc">Gloucestershire</span>, after which <span class="loc">Acton</span>, <span class="loc">County Armagh</span>, was named. By 1837 it contained about 50 houses "indifferently built".</p>
