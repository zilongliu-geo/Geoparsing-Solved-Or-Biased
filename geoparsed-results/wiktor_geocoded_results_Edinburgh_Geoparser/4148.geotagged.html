<p><span class="loc">Truro</span> (postcode 5356, altitude 311m) is a town in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>, 80 km northeast of Adelaide. It is situated in an agricultural and pastoral district on the Sturt Highway, east of the <span class="loc">Barossa</span> Valley, where the highway crosses somewhat lofty and rugged parts of the Mount Lofty Ranges. At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Truro</span> had a population of 395. <span class="loc">Truro</span> is in the Mid Murray Council local government area, the South Australian <span class="loc">House of Assembly</span> electoral <span class="loc">district of Schubert</span> and the Australian House of Representatives Divisions of Barker and <span class="loc">Wakefield</span>. The town was established on <span class="loc">Truro Creek</span> (<span class="loc">White Hut Creek</span>) in 1848 by John Howard Angas, the son of George Fife Angas who had bought the land in 1842. The survey was conducted by Thomas Burr, assisted by his (eventual) son in law Frederick Sinnett, during a period when both were freed from their usual commitments in order to pursue private contracts. It is named after the <span class="loc">city of Truro</span> in <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. It is somewhat uncertain whether the name <span class="loc">Truro</span> was given by Angas, or the first settlers in the town, but with the Wheal Barton mine nearby, many of those settlers were Cornish miners, so it is quite likely that if they were not the namers of the town, they were certainly the inspiration thereof.</p>
