  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Inglewood</span> is a city in southwestern <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, southwest of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, the city had a population of 109,673. It was incorporated on <span class="date">February 14, 1908</span>. The city is in the <span class="loc">South Bay</span> region of the <span class="org">Greater Los Angeles Area</span>. <span class="loc">City of Champions Stadium</span> is under construction in the city and when finished around <span class="date">2019</span> will be the home of the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> Rams, which moved back to the <span class="org">Los Angeles Area</span> in <span class="date">2016</span>. The earliest residents of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> were Native Americans who used the natural springs in <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="per">Edward Vincent</span> Jr. Park (known for most of its history as <span class="loc">Centinela</span> Park). Local historian Gladys Waddingham wrote that these springs took the name <span class="loc">Centinela</span> from the hills that rose gradually around them and which allowed ranchers to watch over their herds "(thus the name centinelas or sentinels)". <span class="loc">Waddingham</span> traced the written history of <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> back to the original settlers of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> in <span class="date">1781</span>, one of whom was the Spanish soldier <span class="per">Jose Manuel Orchado</span> <span class="loc">Machado</span>, "a 23-year-old muleteer from <span class="loc">Los Alamos</span> in <span class="loc">Sinaloa</span>". These settlers, she wrote, were ordered by the officials of the <span class="org">San Gabriel Mission</span> "to graze their animals on the ocean side of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> in order not to infringe on Mission lands." As a result, the settlers, or pobladores, drove some of their cattle to the "lush pasture lands near <span class="loc">Centinela</span> Springs," and the first construction there was done by one Ygnacio Avila, who received a permit in <span class="date">1822</span> to build a "corral and hut for his herders."</p><br><br>
