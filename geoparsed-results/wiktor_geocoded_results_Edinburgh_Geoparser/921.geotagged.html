<p><span class="loc">Albany</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Linn County</span>, and the 11th largest city in the State of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. <span class="loc">Albany</span> is located in the <span class="loc">Willamette</span> Valley at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Calapooia River</span> and the <span class="loc">Willamette River</span> in both Linn and Benton counties, just east of <span class="loc">Corvallis</span> and south of <span class="loc">Salem</span>. It is predominantly a farming and manufacturing city that settlers founded around 1848. As of the 2010 United States Census, the population of <span class="loc">Albany</span> was 50,158. Its population was estimated by the Portland Research Center to be 51,583 in 2013. <span class="loc">Albany</span> has a home rule charter, a councilâ€“manager government, and a full-time unelected city manager. The city provides the population with access to over 30 parks and trails, a senior center, and many cultural events such as River Rhythms and Mondays at Monteith. In addition to farming and manufacturing, the city's economy depends on retail trade, health care, and social assistance. In recent years the city has worked to revive the downtown shopping area, with help from The Central Albany Revitalization Area. In the historic era, the area of the <span class="loc">Willamette</span> Valley that makes up modern-day <span class="loc">Albany</span> was inhabited by one of the tribes of the Kalapuya a Penutian-speaking, Native American people. The Kalapuya had named the area Takenah, a Kalapuyan word used to describe the deep pool at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Calapooia</span> and <span class="loc">Willamette</span> rivers. A variation of the place name can also be written as Tekenah.</p>
