<p>Franklin is a city in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 641 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Logan, <span class="loc">Utah-Idaho Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Founded by Mormon pioneers led by Thomas S. Smart on April 14, 1860 in what was then Washington Territory. The town received its name after Franklin Richards, an Apostle for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Franklin is the first permanent European settlement in present-day <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. However, the town's founders believed the townsite was in Utah Territory. Its political status remained ambiguous until an 1872 survey determined the townsite was in <span class="loc">Idaho</span> Territory about 1-mile (1.6 km) north of the Utah Territory border [1]. Franklin is the location of a portion of the filming of the movie Napoleon Dynamite. The chicken farm scenes of the movie were filmed on Ritewood Egg Farms property, and the supervisor's character is loosely based on Marlow Woodward, a late Franklin resident and one of the farm's founders. Franklin is located at 42°0′58″N 111°48′11″W (42.016039, -111.803101). at an elevation of 4,501 feet (1,372 m) above sea level.</p>
