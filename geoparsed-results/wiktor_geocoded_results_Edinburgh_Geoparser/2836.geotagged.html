<p><span class="loc">Adams County</span> lies in northeastern <span class="loc">Indiana</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span> and shares its eastern border with <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. It was officially established in 1836. The county seat is <span class="loc">Decatur</span>. According to the 2010 census, its population was 34,387, an increase of 2.27% from 33,625 in 2000. The county has four incorporated cities and towns with a total population of over 15,000, as well as many small unincorporated communities. The county is divided into 12 townships which provide local services. There are four <span class="loc">Indiana</span> state roads in the county, as well as three <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Routes and one railroad line. <span class="loc">Adams County</span> was created by statute on February 7, 1835, and organized March 1, 1836. Its name honors the sixth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, John Quincy Adams. The site of the county seat was chosen May 18, 1836. The first non-Native American settlers arrived in what is now <span class="loc">Adams County</span> in 1835. They arrived as a result of the end of the Black Hawk War as well as the completion of the <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal. They consisted entirely of settlers from <span class="loc">New England</span>. These were "Yankee" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled <span class="loc">New England</span> in the colonial era. They were primarily members of the Congregational Church though due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now <span class="loc">Adams County</span>. The Congregational Church subsequently has gone through many divisions and some factions are now known as the Church of Christ and the United Church of Christ. When the <span class="loc">New England</span> settlers arrived in what is now <span class="loc">Adams County</span> there was nothing but a dense virgin forest and wild prairie.</p>
