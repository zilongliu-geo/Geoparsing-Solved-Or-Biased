  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Buenavista</span> is a third-class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Quezon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 29,053 people. It used to be called <span class="loc">Piris</span>. <span class="loc">Buenavista</span> is politically subdivided into 37 barangays. <span class="loc">Piris</span> was its former name. It was a mere hamlet of the municipality of Guinanyagan, <span class="loc">province of Quezon</span> and remained as such for quite <span class="date">a number of years</span> until it finally became a municipality. <span class="loc">Buenavista</span> is <span class="date">now</span> its official name which means beautiful view. Its original name was <span class="loc">Piri</span> as engraved in the oldest church bell which was donated by one <span class="per">Don Jose Casal</span> in the <span class="date">year 1866</span>. It used to be located in the <span class="loc">Sitio</span> of <span class="loc">Pinagbayanan</span> situated in the western side of the <span class="loc">Piris River</span> which is about one a half kilometers away from the present town site. This place became the choice of the founders who were a mixture of <span class="per">Bicolanos</span> and <span class="per">Visayans</span> to enable them to easily escape the Moro raids that were prevalent during the olden times. When the raids finally subsided, the barrio of <span class="loc">Piris</span> was transferred to its present location. The word <span class="loc">Piri</span> was changed to <span class="loc">Piris</span> and later re-changed to <span class="loc">Piris</span>.</p><br><br>
