<p><span class="loc">Brunswick</span> is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 6 km north of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>'s central business district. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Moreland</span>. At the 2011 Census, <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> had a population of 22,764. Approximately four kilometres north of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> CBD, it has a southern border with the suburbs of Princes Hill and <span class="loc">Parkville</span>, the boundary being <span class="loc">Park Street</span>. To the east <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> is bordered by <span class="loc">Brunswick East</span>, the boundary being behind <span class="loc">Lygon</span> Street and Holmes Street; to the north it is bordered by <span class="loc">Coburg</span>, along <span class="loc">Moreland Road</span>, while the western border with <span class="loc">Brunswick West</span> follows <span class="loc">Grantham</span>, Pearson and Shamrock Streets. <span class="loc">Brunswick</span>'s main thoroughfare is Sydney Road, which runs north-south as the continuation of Royal Parade and which several kilometres north of <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> becomes the Hume Freeway. <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> is designated one of 82 Major Activity Centres in the <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> 2030 Metropolitan Strategy. <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> takes its name from Queen Caroline (née Princess Caroline, Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel), the wife of George IV. <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> is in the area known as Iramoo by the Aboriginal people who inhabited and hunted in it. Occupied by the Wurundjeri people who spoke the Woiwurrung dialect, white settlement began in the 1830s, with Assistant Surveyor Darke surveying the area – under the instruction of Robert Hoddle. North and south boundaries were drawn up, running in an east-west direction between <span class="loc">Moonee Ponds Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Merri Creek</span>. These boundaries would become <span class="loc">Moreland Road</span> and <span class="loc">Park Street</span>, respectively. A narrow road was surveyed down the centre to service what were intended to be agricultural properties, which would eventually become the major thoroughfare of Sydney Road. Ten allotments were drawn up on each side of this road, with each block of land running all the way to either <span class="loc">Moonee Ponds Creek</span> or <span class="loc">Merri Creek</span>. These wide strips of land are still reflected in the current street layout.</p>
