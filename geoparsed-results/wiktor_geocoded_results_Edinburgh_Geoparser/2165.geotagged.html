<p>Florence is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Omaha</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> on the city's north end and originally one of the oldest cities in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. It was incorporated by the <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> Territorial Legislature on March 10, 1857. The site of Winter Quarters for Mormon migrants traveling west, it has the oldest cemetery for people of European descent and oldest standing gristmill in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. Florence was the site of an illegal territorial legislature in 1858. Given the high concentration of National Register of Historic Places in the neighborhood, it is regarded as "the historic front door to <span class="loc">Omaha</span> as well as the state." In the spring of 1854 James C. Mitchell, following the advice of the fur trader Peter A. Sarpy, platted the village of Florence, including the old buildings and improvements of old Cutler's Park. Cutler's Park was established at the site of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 1846 Winter Quarters as a hold-over on their way from <span class="loc">Nauvoo</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> to <span class="loc">Utah</span>. Due to the harsh conditions, 359 members of the 2,500 person party died and are buried in what is now called the Mormon Pioneer Cemetery. Their community was the first city in the <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> Territory. Despite lasting only two years, the city had a mayor and city council, 24 policemen and fireguards, various administrative committees, and a town square for public meetings. The Mormon pioneers left their town once they moved on in 1848. Mitchell platted Florence six years later. The town of Florence was named for one Miss Florence Kilbourn.</p>
