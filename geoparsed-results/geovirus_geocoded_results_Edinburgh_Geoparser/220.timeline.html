  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A 35-year old woman, Venus <span class="per">Critchfield</span> of <span class="loc">Philippi</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to two to <span class="date">six years</span> in prison. <span class="per">Critchfield</span> was accused of beating her stepchildren with boards, and using hooks and ropes to secure them and force them to stand for long periods of time. <span class="per">Critchfield</span> also forced the children to continuously eat food and drink, and then eat their own vomit. Her stepson, <span class="date">now</span> aged 17, described the abuse in court. Circuit Judge Alan D. Moats called this the worst case he has seen in <span class="date">30 years</span>. "You have never been a mother. You are the antithesis of everything that is a mother." Moats said in court. The abuse involved all six of <span class="per">Critchfield</span>'s children, however only some were willing to testify against her. <span class="per">Critchfield</span> pleaded guilty and was convicted of two counts of child abuse, with injury. The charges pertained to abuse committed from <span class="date">January 2001</span> until <span class="date">January 2002</span>. She was sentenced to the maximum possible term. State welfare services had removed the children, <span class="date">now</span> 11-16 <span class="date">years</span> old, from the Critchfields' care in previous cases. Jenning <span class="per">Brian Critchfield</span>, the father, is currently serving <span class="date">a 3-15 year</span> sentence for abuse.</p><br><br>
