  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Paro</span> (Dzongkha:སྤ་རོ་, <span class="loc">Wylie</span>: spa ro) is a town and seat of <span class="loc">Paro District</span> in the <span class="loc">Paro</span> Valley of <span class="loc">Bhutan</span>. It is home to <span class="loc">Paro Airport</span>, <span class="loc">Bhutan</span>'s only international airport. <span class="loc">Rinpung Dzong</span> a fortress-monastery overlooking the <span class="loc">Paro</span> valley has a long history. A monastery was first built on the site by Padma Sambhava at the beginning of the tenth century, but it wasn't until <span class="date">1644</span> that Ngawang Namgyal built a larger monastery on the old foundations, and for <span class="date">centuries</span> this imposing five storey building served as an effective defence against numerous invasion attempts by the Tibetans. Built with stones instead of clay, the Dzong was named Rinpung, meaning "heaps of jewels" but Rinpung and all its treasures were destroyed by the fire in <span class="date">1907</span>. Only one thangka, known as Thongdel, was saved. The <span class="loc">Paro Dzong</span> was rebuilt by the penlop dawa Penjor after the fire. Housed within its walls is a collection of sacred masks and costumes. Some date back <span class="date">several centuries</span>; others were contributed by Dawa Penjor and his successor Penlop Tshering Penjor in recent times.</p><br><br>
