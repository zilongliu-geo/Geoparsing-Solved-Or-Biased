<p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 17,581. The county seat is Chatom. The county was named in honor of <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, the first President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a dry county, with the exception of Chatom. The area of today's <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was long inhabited by various indigenous people. In historic times, European traders encountered first Choctaw and later Creek Indians, who had moved southwest from <span class="loc">Georgia</span> as early European settlers encroached on their land. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was organized on June 4, 1800 from the <span class="loc">Tombigbee District</span> of the Mississippi Territory by proclamation of territorial governor Winthrop Sargent. It was the first county organized in what would later become <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, as settlers moved westward after the American Revolutionary War. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is the site of <span class="loc">St. Stephens</span>, the first territorial capital of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. In 1807 former <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Vice President Aaron Burr was arrested at <span class="loc">Wakefield</span> in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, during his flight from being prosecuted for alleged treason (which he was eventually found innocent of).</p>
