<p>Jackson is a town in <span class="loc">Carroll County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 816 at the 2010 census. Jackson is an elegant resort area in the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span>. Parts of the White Mountain National Forest are in the west, north and east. Once consisting of several large land grants by Colonial Governor John Wentworth, the town was first named New Madbury, after the seacoast town of <span class="loc">Madbury</span>. In 1772, a road was built through <span class="loc">Pinkham Notch</span>, and the area was first settled in 1778 by Benjamin Copp and his family. In 1800, the community was renamed in honor of President John Adams, who was then in office. The name Adams stuck until the town was incorporated in 1829, when Andrew Jackson, the hero of the Battle of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>, was inaugurated president. Governor Benjamin Pierce, a staunch backer of President Jackson, was influential in changing the name to Jackson. Only one vote was cast against the switch. In 1847, artists of the White Mountain School began arriving in Jackson to paint the scenic beauty of the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span>. Others would follow, and in 1858, Joshua B. Trickey opened the Jackson Falls House. The <span class="loc">Portland</span> &amp; Ogdensburg Railroad began service to Glen station at nearby <span class="loc">Bartlett</span> in the early 1870s, and several hotels were built to accommodate a growing infusion of tourists. Thorn Mountain House, built by Trickey in 1869, would evolve during the 1880s into Wentworth Hall, still in business today. Designed as a grouping of cottages around a main service building, the hotel included such amenities as a casino, built in 1886, and a hydroelectric plant, built in the 1890s. By the 1920s, 40 trains a day delivered passengers to Jackson.</p>
