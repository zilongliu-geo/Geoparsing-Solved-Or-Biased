  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Murray County</span> was one of the original Nineteen Counties in <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> and is <span class="date">now</span> one of the 141 Lands administrative divisions of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>. It included the area which is <span class="date">now</span> part of <span class="loc">Canberra</span> and as far north as <span class="loc">Lake George</span> and <span class="loc">Yass</span>. It was originally bounded on the west by the <span class="loc">Murrumbidgee River</span>, on the east by the <span class="loc">Shoalhaven River</span> and on the north by the <span class="loc">Yass River</span>. A large area of the county was transferred to the Commonwealth government in <span class="date">1909</span> in <span class="org">the Seat of Government Acceptance Act</span> to make part of the <span class="loc">Australian Capital Territory</span>, along with land in <span class="loc">Cowley County</span>. Since then, the ACT border is <span class="date">now</span> part of the western boundary. <span class="org">Part of the ACT</span> border is determined by property boundaries in the <span class="loc">Parish of Keewong</span>, in the <span class="loc">County of Murray</span>; specifically the southern end of portions 177, 218, 211, 36, and 38. This is mentioned in <span class="org">the Seat of Government Acceptance Act</span> of <span class="date">1909</span>. <span class="loc">Murray County</span> is named in honour of Lieutenant-Governor, Sir <span class="per">George Murray</span> (<span class="date">1772</span>â€“<span class="date">1846</span>). The electoral <span class="loc">district of United</span> <span class="loc">Counties of Murray</span> and <span class="loc">St Vincent</span> was the first electoral district for the area, between <span class="date">1856</span> and <span class="date">1859</span>.</p><br><br>
