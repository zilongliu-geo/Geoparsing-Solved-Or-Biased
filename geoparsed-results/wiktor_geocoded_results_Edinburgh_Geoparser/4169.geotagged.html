<p>Woodlands is a village in the New Forest National Park of <span class="loc">Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The village lies 6 miles (9.7 km) west from <span class="loc">Southampton</span> and 2.75 miles (4.43 km) north-east from <span class="loc">Lyndhurst</span>. The village is in the civil parish of <span class="loc">Netley Marsh</span>. Before the 20th century Woodlands was a sparsely populated settlement. Two historic buildings are known as Goldenhayes and Woodlands Lodge Hotel. The latter was a hunting lodge dating from around 1770 – it was converted to a hotel in the 1950s. There was a pub here by the beginning of the 20th century known as the <span class="loc">Royal Oak</span> – it is now known as the Gamekeeper. Woodlands experienced some growth following the arrival of Sir Richard Leys, who was a major employer in the 1920s. Sir Richard had Woodlands House built in 1905. Many of the other Edwardian houses in Woodlands were due to him - Lampits house was his coach house where his chauffeur lived, and a house on the double bend near Busketts Lawn was his stables. More infilling of houses occurred in the 1920s and 30s, and especially in the post World War II period with the building of many of the bungalows along the northern end of Woodlands Road.</p>
