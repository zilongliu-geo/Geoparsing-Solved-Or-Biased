  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dura</span> (Arabic: دورا‎) is a Palestinian town located eleven kilometers southwest of <span class="loc">Hebron</span> in the <span class="loc">Hebron</span> Governorate in the southern <span class="loc">West Bank</span>. According to the <span class="org">Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics</span>, the town had a population of over 28,268 in <span class="date">2007</span>. The current mayor is Saeed <span class="per">M. Awawdeh</span>. Some believe Noah, the tenth of the pre-flood Patriarchs, as the story of <span class="loc">Noah's Ark</span> is told in the Hebrew Bible, is buried in <span class="loc">Dura</span>. The city was fortified by Rehoboam (<span class="date">974 BC</span> – <span class="date">913 BC</span>), King of the United Monarchy of <span class="loc">Israel</span> and later the King of the Kingdom of Judah, who was a son of <span class="per">Solomon</span> and a grandson of David, according to 2 Chron. 11.9. The city was called <span class="loc">Adora</span> in the First Book of Maccabees (1 Macc. 13.20). In <span class="date">1517</span>, the village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of <span class="loc">Syria</span>. After the British Mandate, in the wake of the <span class="date">1948</span> Arab–Israeli War, <span class="loc">Dura</span> was occupied by <span class="loc">Jordan</span> and came under Jordanian rule. <span class="loc">Dura</span> was established as a municipality on <span class="date">January 1, 1967</span>, <span class="date">five months</span> before it was occupied by <span class="loc">Israel</span> during the Six-Day War.</p><br><br>
