  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Shooting staged as cover, police say. The wounding of a <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> woman charged in the beating death of a neighbor was staged to distract law enforcement, <span class="loc">Richmond County</span> investigators said <span class="date">Monday</span>. Sheriff's <span class="per">Lt. Scott Peebles</span> also said his department plans to submit its evidence to the district attorney for possible indictment. Authorities said <span class="per">Rebecca Sears</span>, 41, of <span class="loc">Grovetown</span>, planned to have her son, <span class="per">Christopher Sean</span> Bowers, 19, of <span class="loc">Martinez</span>, threaten her with a gun <span class="date">Thursday night</span> as she left her job at Healing Hands Physical Therapy on Augusta's Highland Avenue. <span class="per">Ms. Sears</span> was supposed to be on the phone with a co-worker at the time, according to sheriff's <span class="per">Sgt. Blaise Dresser</span>. Instead, the son fired the gun, wounding his mother in the leg, <span class="per">Sgt. Dresser</span> said. <span class="per">Ms. Sears</span> told police a strange man appeared from the bushes as she left work, shot her in the leg, then said if she "didn't have his money it would be her face," according to a <span class="loc">Richmond County</span> sheriff's report. "She wasn't real happy about getting shot," <span class="per">Sgt. Dresser</span> said <span class="date">Monday</span>. <span class="per">Ms. Sears</span> and <span class="per">Mr. Bowers</span> are <span class="date">now</span> both charged with murder in the brutal beating of Katherine "Kay" Parsons, 41, who was <span class="per">Ms. Sears</span>' neighbor on Hot Springs Drive, as well as a co-worker. <span class="date">Last week</span>, authorities said <span class="per">Mrs. Parsons</span> appeared to have interrupted a burglary at her home, but sources familiar with the investigation said they <span class="date">now</span> believe burglary was not a motive in her death. So far police have refused to discuss what prompted the fatal beating. On <span class="date">Monday</span>, both <span class="per">Ms. Sears</span>, of 227 Hot Springs Drive, and <span class="per">Mr. Bowers</span>, of the 4000 block of Briarwood Drive, faced Magistrate Judge Dale Jenereaux via videoconference to hear the charges against them. Although both are also charged with murder, conspiracy allegations might be withdrawn, the magistrate said. According to arrest warrants filed with the court, authorities allege that <span class="per">Ms. Sears</span> and <span class="per">Mr. Bowers</span> killed <span class="per">Mrs. Parsons</span> between 6:50 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. <span class="date">Wednesday</span> after she returned home from taking her son to school. A deputy was called to her home when a contractor discovered a smashed-in door, and found <span class="per">Mrs. Parsons</span> lying in the garage near a baseball bat and claw hammer believed to have been used in the attack. Staff Writers Sandy <span class="per">Hodson</span> and <span class="per">Adam</span> Folk contributed to this report.</p><br><br>
