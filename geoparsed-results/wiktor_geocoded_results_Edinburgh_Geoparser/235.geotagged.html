<p><span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Martin County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 516 at the 2010 census. The current mayor is Gil Matthews. Elected Town Commissioners include Franky Stokes Lee (mayor pro tem), Herbert Lee Everett, Kerry Spivey, Mamie Staton, and Ervin Williams. The mayor and all 5 commissioners were re-elected without opposition in the November 5, 2013 municipal election. All commissioners and the mayor serve 2 year terms. The town's municipal building is located at 101 North Front Street and is open Monday-Friday 8 AM - noon and 1 PM - 5 PM. <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is located at 35°56′39″N 77°12′28″W (35.944116, -77.207772). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.5 square miles (1.3 km2), all of it land. It is located on the <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> River at the 60 Mile Mark. The town was founded in 1804 on the highest point of the <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> River. The most significant historical event of early <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> was the battle and fall of Fort Branch, when Union vessels and troops came upriver from <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> (see <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> History) in an attempt to reach <span class="loc">Weldon</span> to cut off supplies to General Robert E. Lee during the Civil War. The fort protected <span class="loc">Weldon</span> until the day after the General Lee surrendered at Appomattox <span class="loc">Court House</span>, whereupon the railroad line over the <span class="loc">Weldon</span> bridge had no more military significance. Afterwards, the fort was abandoned and the cannons were dumped into the <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> River by departing Confederate troops, and were only recently discovered. In July 1972, a group of men from <span class="loc">Alabama</span> came and began pulling cannons from the river. The group was accused of violating <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>'s antiquities laws in an effort to keep the cannons in <span class="loc">Martin County</span>. The courts officially decided that the cannons belong to the state under the North Carolina Department of Archives and History. The department decided to permanently loan the artifact to Fort Branch.</p>
