<p>Logan-Rogersville students relocate into new building. Logan-Rogersville kindergartners try out a new jungle gym. Students recently moved into a new building. (Donna Baxter / for the News-Leader) Logan Elementary was formed in 1952 when eight eastern <span class="loc">Greene County</span> rural districts consolidated. High school students had a choice -- <span class="loc">Rogersville</span> or <span class="loc">Springfield</span>. Two years later, seven rural Christian and <span class="loc">Webster County</span> districts consolidated into <span class="loc">Rogersville</span>. In 1965, <span class="loc">Rogersville</span> voted to annex to Logan. A new high school was built in southeast <span class="loc">Greene County</span>. All grade 7 and 8 students -- who up to that time had attended the two elementary buildings -- were moved into the old high school in <span class="loc">Rogersville</span>. The elementaries remained separate until 1983 when the district was reorganized. K-5 students attended Logan and grade 6-8 students went to <span class="loc">Rogersville</span>. After several subsequent reorganizations, Logan-Rogersville has five campuses (including the Logan building) with a population of nearly 2,300.</p>
