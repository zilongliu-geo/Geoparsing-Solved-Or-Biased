  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Exeter</span> is a north-western suburb of <span class="per">Adelaide</span> 14 km from the CBD, on the <span class="loc">LeFevre Peninsula</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> and falls under <span class="org">the City of Port</span> <span class="per">Adelaide Enfield</span>. It is adjacent to Semaphore, <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span>, <span class="loc">Largs Bay</span> and <span class="loc">Glanville</span>. C It is bounded to the south by <span class="per">Exmouth</span> Road, to the north by <span class="loc">Hargrave</span> Street and in the east and west by the Outer Harbor railway line and Woolnough Road respectively. <span class="per">Exeter</span> is essentially a residential suburb. On <span class="date">18 May 1850</span>, <span class="per">Phillip Levi</span> purchased the land sections 1104-1107, Hundred of <span class="loc">Port Adelaide</span>. By <span class="date">April 1851</span>, section <span class="date">1106</span> was owned by <span class="per">John Lapthorne</span>, who had subdivided it sometime before <span class="date">January 1854</span>, however the name of <span class="per">Exeter</span> does not appear on official documents until <span class="date">1882</span> when <span class="per">William Wells</span> cut part of section <span class="date">1106</span>. <span class="per">John Lapthorne</span> sailed to <span class="loc">South Australia</span> on the Orissa in <span class="date">1840</span>. He was born in <span class="per">Exeter</span>, in the English <span class="loc">county of Devon</span>, in <span class="date">1807</span> and died at <span class="per">Exeter, Adelaide</span> in <span class="date">1889</span>; the suburb is named after his home town. An early landmark was the <span class="per">Lord Exmouth Hotel</span>, of which <span class="per">William Knapman</span> (<span class="date">1830</span>â€“<span class="date">1908</span>) was in <span class="date">1859</span> the first licensee and, at least in part, the builder. The eponym of the hotel, <span class="per">Edward Pellew</span>, 1st <span class="per">Viscount Exmouth</span> died at <span class="loc">Teignmouth</span>, 15 miles (24 km) <span class="loc">south of Exeter</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The association of the suburb's name deepens, as <span class="per">Knapman</span>'s wife <span class="per">Charlotte</span> was born in <span class="loc">Christow</span> near <span class="loc">Exeter</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Numerous other places have also been given the name <span class="per">Exeter</span>.</p><br><br>
