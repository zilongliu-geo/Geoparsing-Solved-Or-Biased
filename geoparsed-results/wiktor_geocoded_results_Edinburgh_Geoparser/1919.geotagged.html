<p><span class="loc">Sodo</span> or Wolaita Sodo is a town and separate woreda in south-central <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. The administrative center of the Wolaita Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region, it has a latitude and longitude of 6°54′N 37°45′E with an elevation between Template:Convrt above sea level. It was part of the former Sodo woreda which included Sodo Zuria which completely surrounds it. <span class="loc">Sodo</span> is served by an airport. A 166 kilometers long road connecting <span class="loc">Sodo</span> with <span class="loc">Chida</span>, whose construction had started in 1994, was completed by early 1999. Featuring an 80-meter Bailey bridge across the Omo river and five other bridges, this road cost 255 million <span class="loc">Birr</span>, and reduced the distance between the Regional capital at <span class="loc">Awassa</span> and <span class="loc">Mizan Teferi</span> to 400 kilometers. According to the SNNPR's Bureau of Finance and Economic Development, as of 2003 Sodo's amenities include digital and mobile telephone access, postal service, 24-hour electrical service, two banks, and a hospital. <span class="loc">Sodo</span> is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Sodo-Hosaena. In the early 1930s, <span class="loc">Sodo</span> was described as the only locality in <span class="loc">Wolaita district</span> deserving to be called a town. It had a Saturday market, a telephone line to the capital and a weekly mail courier. Italian ground troops captured <span class="loc">Sodo</span> on 27 January 1937; it was there that two Italian generals with their divisions – Liberati with his 25th Division, and Bacarri with his 101st Division – surrendered on 22 May 1941, after a minimum of resistance. The British also captured the remnants of the 21st Division, who had escaped around the north end of Lake Abijatta. The loot included more than 4,000 officers and men, 6 medium tanks, 4 light tanks, 100 machine guns, ammunition and supplies.</p>
