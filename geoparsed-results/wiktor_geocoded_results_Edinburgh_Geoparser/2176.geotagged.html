<p>Sharon is a former village now incorporated into the municipality of the Town of East Gwillimbury, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, formerly the Township of East Gwillimbury. The municipal offices of the town are in Sharon. The community's most historic building is the Sharon Temple, once the meeting house of the Children of Peace (or Davidites). It is part of the musical, political, religious and architectural heritage of <span class="loc">Ontario</span> and is now a museum and National Historic Site of <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The museum hosts a number of concerts and educational programs, and has hosted the Words Alive Literary Festival since 2007. In the mid to late 1980s, housing developments were built in the area around Sharon. Further developments have continued slowly around Sharon since 2002. Prominent residents have included wrestling legend Whipper Billy Watson, comedian John Candy, Olympian Veronica Brenner, and Barkley Good, creator of the 1990s pet training seminars "Joyce: Be Good!". The village of Sharon grew around the farm of David Willson (Lot 10, Second Conc.), the leader of the Quaker denomination known as the Children of Peace. The Children of Peace constructed a series of meeting houses on Willson's farm, which became the core of the utopian community they called Hope. They changed the name to Sharon in 1841 to acquire a post office.</p>
