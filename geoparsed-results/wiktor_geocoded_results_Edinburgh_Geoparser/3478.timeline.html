  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hudson</span> is a village in <span class="loc">McLean County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,838 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Hudson</span> is located at 40°36′21″N 88°59′14″W. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="loc">Hudson</span> has a total area of 0.83 square miles (2.15 km2), all land. <span class="loc">Hudson</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> was laid out by Horatio Petit on <span class="date">August 13, 1836</span>. It was one of eight towns founded in <span class="loc">McLean County</span> during the great real estate boom that swept through central <span class="loc">Illinois</span> between <span class="date">1835</span> to <span class="date">1837</span>. It also shares the distinction of being one of two "colonial" settlements in the county; the other was the <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> colony in the southwestern part of the county. Traditional Sources say that the town was named for the town of <span class="loc">Hudson</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> in <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> which, so it was said, was the home of its early settlers. However, in her Book on the <span class="loc">Hudson</span>, <span class="per">Ruth Biting Hamm</span> has pointed out that, while some settlers were from <span class="loc">Queens County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, none came from near the town of <span class="loc">Hudson</span>. She suggests that it is more likely town was simply named for the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>.</p><br><br>
