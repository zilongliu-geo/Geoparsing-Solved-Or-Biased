<p><span class="loc">Goro</span> is one of the woredas in the <span class="loc">Oromia Region</span> of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. It shares the same name as the administrative center of the woreda, <span class="loc">Goro</span>. Part of the Bale Zone, <span class="loc">Goro</span> is bordered on the southwest by Guradamole, on the west by Berbere, on the northwest by Sinanana Dinsho, on the northeast by <span class="loc">Ginir</span>, and on the southeast by the Somali Region; it is separated from Guradamole and Berbere by the <span class="loc">Gestro</span> River (or <span class="loc">Weyib</span> River). Other towns in this woreda include <span class="loc">Meliyu</span>. Dawe Kachen woreda was separated from <span class="loc">Goro</span>. Almost three-fourths of this woreda is covered by plains, and the rest are considered hilly or rugged. Mount Holachis is the highest point; other important peaks include Mounts Dadimos and Farra. Perennial rivers include the <span class="loc">Weyib</span> and the <span class="loc">Mena</span>, which are lined by forest. A survey of the land in this woreda shows that 17.7% is arable (5.9% was under cultivation), 38% pasture, 39.3% forest or heavy vegetation, and the remaining 5.3% is considered swampy, mountainous or otherwise unusable. 18.16 square kilometers of forest are part of the Goro Bale State Forest. Notable landmarks in this woreda include the Sof Omar Caves. Sugar cane, oil seeds, spices and vegetables are important cash crops.</p>
