  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fremont</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Dodge County</span> in the eastern portion of the state of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> in the Midwestern <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 26,397 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Fremont</span> is the county seat. From the 1830s to the 1860s, the area saw a great deal of traffic due to the <span class="loc">Mormon</span> Trail, which passed along the north bank of the <span class="loc">Platte River</span>. A ferry connected the two banks of the <span class="loc">Elkhorn River</span> near <span class="loc">Fremont</span>. It was a major overland route for emigrant settlers going to the West, the military and hunters. <span class="loc">Fremont</span> was laid out in <span class="date">1856</span> in anticipation that the railroad would be extended to that site. It was named after the American explorer, politician and military official General <span class="per">John C. Fr√©mont</span>. Due to the town's geographically central location, the First Transcontinental Telegraph line (<span class="date">1861</span>), railroad (<span class="date">1866</span>) and highway (<span class="date">1913</span>) passed through or very near <span class="loc">Fremont</span>. Original brick portions of the "Old Lincoln Highway" located east of <span class="loc">Fremont</span>, on the way to <span class="loc">Omaha</span>. On <span class="date">January 10, 1976</span>, in downtown <span class="loc">Fremont</span>, the Pathfinder Hotel exploded due to a natural gas leak in the basement. At the time the hotel was being used as apartments, mostly occupied by senior citizens. It also was a meeting place for philanthropic and business organizations, and had a drug store on the northwest corner. The explosion shattered windows around the city, and the ensuing fire killed 23 people and destroyed most of the city block of the hotel.</p><br><br>
