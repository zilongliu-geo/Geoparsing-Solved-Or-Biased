<p>Esperanza is a municipality in <span class="loc">Masbate Province</span>, the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, with a population of 17,357 people in the 2010 census. About 60% of the population lives along the coastline, most of whom are fishermen. It is about 4 hours travel south of <span class="loc">Masbate City</span> with some roads and highways still undeveloped. Esperanza has several beaches, among them Gamay Na Baybay Beach, <span class="loc">Talisay</span> (<span class="loc">Punta</span>) Beach and Manok Manok Beach. Esperanza is politically subdivided into 20 barangays. People in the 1970s to early 1990s were heavily dependent on the water resources in the so-called <span class="loc">Kapayawan</span>, which means "deep well". It is the only safe water source for the majority of the people living in the area. In 2000, Esperanza was finally connected to the electricity grid supplied by MASELCO which benefited 80% of the households in the area. In 2006, President Gloria Arroyo defined Esperanza to be the most accessible town in <span class="loc">Masbate</span> going to <span class="loc">Samar</span>, <span class="loc">Leyte</span> and <span class="loc">Cebu</span>. That is the primary reason why the National Government constructed the port to serve as a roll-on/roll-off (RORO) gateway.</p>
