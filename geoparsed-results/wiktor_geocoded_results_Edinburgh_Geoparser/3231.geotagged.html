<p>Hale is a village and electoral ward within the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Trafford</span>, in <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The population of the village taken at the 2011 Census was 15,315.  It is contiguous with the southeast of <span class="loc">Altrincham</span>, about 9 miles (14 km) southwest of the <span class="loc">city of Manchester</span>. The earliest documented reference to Hale is in the Domesday Book of 1086, although the name of the settlement is probably as old as 7th or 8th century. The area was mostly agricultural. Hale grew in the Middle Ages to the point when Hale Barns was established as a separate settlement. Hale was formerly in <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>. Hale, Bowdon and Hale Barns together are regarded as the wealthiest areas in <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, and similarly wealthy to <span class="loc">Cheshire</span> <span class="loc">Golden Triangle</span> towns <span class="loc">Wilmslow</span>, <span class="loc">Alderley Edge</span> and <span class="loc">Prestbury</span>. These towns and the area between them contain some of the most expensive properties in <span class="loc">England</span> outside <span class="loc">London</span>. The toponym "Hale" derives from the Old English halh, meaning a nook or shelter, as supported by the surrounding area that has natural features that provide shelter. The name Hale occurs in a number of places throughout <span class="loc">Britain</span>.</p>
