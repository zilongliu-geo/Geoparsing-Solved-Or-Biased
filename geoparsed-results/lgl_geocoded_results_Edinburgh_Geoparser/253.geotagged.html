<p>Whitestown thanks philanthropists with pipe signing. Local individuals and businesses donated $10,000 toward funding the Whitestown water line replacement project and, as a way to say thank you and memorialize the donations, <span class="loc">Whitestown</span> invited all donors to join in a water pipe signing ceremony earlier this month at Whitestown Town Hall. The donations helped the town in obtaining a $500,000 grant from the Office of Community and Rural Affairs to replace more than 11,000 linear feet of the 50 year-old water lines in <span class="loc">Whitestown</span>. The signed water pipe will be placed in service under Main Street. The water line construction started Jan. 5 and is expected to be completed by early summer.</p>
