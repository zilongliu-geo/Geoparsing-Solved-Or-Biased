  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salem</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Salem County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> United States Census, the city's population was 5,146, reflecting a decrease of 711 (-12.1%) from the 5,857 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn declined by 1,026 (-14.9%) from the 6,883 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census, an overall drop of more than 25% over <span class="date">the two decades</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Salem County</span>, the state's most rural county. The name "Salem", in both the city and county, is derived from the Hebrew word shalom, meaning "peace". The town and colony of <span class="loc">Salem</span> was laid out in <span class="date">1675</span> by <span class="per">John Fenwick</span> and the community was given permission to choose officers in <span class="date">October 1693</span>. It was incorporated on <span class="date">February 21, 1798</span>, as part of the initial group of 104 townships established by the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature. On <span class="date">February 25, 1858</span>, it was reincorporated as <span class="loc">Salem City</span>. <span class="loc">Salem</span> was founded by <span class="per">John Fenwick</span>, a <span class="loc">Quaker</span>. <span class="per">Fenwick</span> had been involved in a financial dispute with an <span class="per">Edward Billinge</span>, another <span class="loc">Quaker</span>, who had received the undivided portion of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> territory that <span class="per">James Stuart</span>, <span class="loc">Duke of York</span> had granted to Lord <span class="per">John Berkeley</span> in <span class="date">1664</span>. <span class="per">Berkeley</span> had sold his share to <span class="loc">Billinge</span> in <span class="date">1675</span> for 1,000 pounds, but <span class="per">Billinge</span> had become bankrupt and so had the property turned over to <span class="loc">Fenwick</span> to hold for <span class="per">Billinge</span> and his assigns in trust. <span class="per">Billinge</span> and <span class="per">Fenwick</span> came to disagree over the property.</p><br><br>
