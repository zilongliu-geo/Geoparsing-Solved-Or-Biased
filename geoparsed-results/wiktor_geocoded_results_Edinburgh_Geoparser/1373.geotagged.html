<p>Cleveland, a suburb of <span class="loc">Redland City</span>, is located on the western shores of <span class="loc">Moreton Bay</span> approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) east-south-east of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, the capital of the Australian state of <span class="loc">Queensland</span>. It comprises commercial, residential and industrial areas and is the location of <span class="loc">Redland City</span>'s Council Chambers, offices and various cultural facilities. As at the 2011 Census, Cleveland was estimated to be home to 14,414 people, with the majority of these of working age. There are conflicting reports as to the naming of Cleveland; it was either named in 1770 by Captain James Cook in honour of John Clevland, the Secretary of the Admiralty around the time, or by surveyors in the 1840s, in honour of William Vane, 1st Duke of Cleveland. European settlement of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> and surrounding areas was banned from 1824 until 1842, due to the <span class="loc">Moreton</span> Bay <span class="loc">Penal Settlement</span>, but the area to become Cleveland was first surveyed in 1840, and in 1841, was recommended for a maritime or seaport township. In 1847 a navigation beacon was established at <span class="loc">Cleveland Point</span>. In 1847, the Government planned for the new town, and on 13 December 1850, Cleveland was proclaimed a township. The first land sales of the new township took place a year later, with early purchases primarily around <span class="loc">Cleveland Point</span>, at the time an early candidate for a major port to replace <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>. <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> was troubled by sand bars across the mouth of the <span class="loc">Brisbane River</span>, and <span class="loc">Cleveland Point</span> was closer to the southern passage (the entrance to <span class="loc">Moreton Bay</span> between <span class="loc">North Stradbroke Island</span> and <span class="loc">Moreton Island</span>).</p>
