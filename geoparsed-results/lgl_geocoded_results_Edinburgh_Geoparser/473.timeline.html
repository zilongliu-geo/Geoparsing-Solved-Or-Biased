  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Don't toss out old medications. Too many people toss old medications in the trash or flush them down the drain instead of using an existing return program, according to Metro Vancouver. An estimated 21 per cent of area residents are aware pharmacies take back unused medicine, non-prescription drugs, as well as vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements. That's too low, say Metro Vancouver officials, who are aiming to boost participation in the free Medications Return Program. Pharmaceuticals that end up in landfills or in the sewer system can make their way into the environment. There it's feared they can poison or disrupt hormone levels and normal reproductive cycles in aquatic life, and potentially contribute to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Metro Vancouver already banned the disposal of pharmaceuticals from landfill disposal <span class="date">last year</span>. Eliminating expired or unwanted drugs from medicine cabinets also ensures they aren't someday consumed by accident. About 40 tonnes of prescription and over-the-counter drugs are safely returned to pharmacies for safe disposal each year.</p><br><br>
