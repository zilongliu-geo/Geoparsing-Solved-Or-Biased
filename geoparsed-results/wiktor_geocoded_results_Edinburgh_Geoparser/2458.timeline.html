  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Florida</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 49,746. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Marianna. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> was created by the <span class="org">Florida Territorial Council</span> in <span class="date">1822</span> out of <span class="loc">Escambia County</span>, along with <span class="loc">Duval County</span> out of St. <span class="loc">Johns County</span>, making them the third and fourth counties in the Territory. The county was named for <span class="per">Andrew Jackson</span>, who had served as Florida's first military governor for <span class="date">six months</span> in <span class="date">1821</span>. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> originally extended from the <span class="loc">Choctawhatchee River</span> on the west to the <span class="loc">Suwannee River</span> on the east. The county had been reduced close to its present boundaries by <span class="date">1840</span> through the creation of new counties from its original territory. Minor adjustments to the county boundaries continued through most of the 19th century, however. There were no towns in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> when it was formed. The first county court met at what was called "Robinson's Big Spring" (later called Blue Springs) in <span class="date">1822</span> and then at the "Big Spring of the Choctawhatchee" in <span class="date">1823</span>. <span class="date">The following year</span> the county court met at "<span class="loc">Chipola</span> Settlement" which is also known as Waddell's <span class="loc">Mill Pond</span>.</p><br><br>
