<p><span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> is a neighborhood in the northwestern quadrant of <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span>, the capital of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The neighborhood is bounded by Rock Creek Park to the north and west; and <span class="loc">Harvard Street</span>, <span class="loc">NW</span>, and the <span class="loc">Adams</span> Morgan neighborhood to the south; and Sixteenth Street, <span class="loc">NW</span>, and the <span class="loc">Columbia Heights</span> neighborhood to the east. The neighborhood is home to about 10,000 people. In 1727, Charles Calvert, 5th Lord Baltimore (then governor of the <span class="loc">Maryland</span> Colony) awarded a land grant for present-day <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> to James Holmead. This estate included the territory of present-day <span class="loc">Adams</span> Morgan, <span class="loc">Columbia Heights</span>, and <span class="loc">Pleasant Plains</span> neighborhoods. James's son, Anthony, inherited the estate in 1750 and named it <span class="loc">Pleasant Plains</span>. After the <span class="loc">United States</span> Congress created the <span class="loc">District of Columbia</span> in 1791, <span class="loc">Pleasant Plains</span> estate became part of <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, a section of the District lying between what now is <span class="loc">Florida Avenue</span> and the <span class="loc">Maryland</span> border. The Holmeads gradually sold off all tracts of the <span class="loc">Pleasant Plains</span> estate. In the 21st century, the family name is preserved in Holmead Place, a short street located west of Thirteenth Street between Spring and Park Roads <span class="loc">NW</span>, in what now is <span class="loc">Columbia Heights</span>. During 1794 and 1796, Robert Peter, Georgetown's pioneer businessman, conducted title descriptions. He created maps for tracts of some of his land in <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> for transactions with commissioners of the city.</p>
