It was an independent city until <span class="date">1926</span>, when it merged with <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Venice</span> is known for its canals, beaches, and the circus-like Ocean Front Walk, a two-and-a-half-mile pedestrian-only promenade that features performers, mystics, artists and vendors. In <span class="date">1839</span>, a region called <span class="loc">La Ballona</span> that included the southern parts of <span class="loc">Venice</span>, was granted by the Mexican government to <span class="loc">Machados</span> and <span class="loc">Talamantes</span>, giving them title to <span class="loc">Rancho</span> <span class="loc">La</span> Ballona Later this became part of the <span class="loc">Port Ballona</span>. <span class="loc">Venice</span>, originally called "Venice of <span class="loc">America</span>," was founded by tobacco millionaire <span class="per">Abbot Kinney</span> in <span class="date">1905</span> as a beach resort town, 14 miles (23 km) west of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. He and his partner <span class="per">Francis Ryan</span> had bought two miles (3.24 km) of oceanfront property south of <span class="loc">Santa Monica</span> in <span class="date">1891</span>. They built a resort town on the north end of the property, called Ocean Park, which was soon annexed to <span class="loc">Santa Monica</span>. After <span class="per">Ryan</span> died, <span class="per">Kinney</span> and his new partners continued building south of Navy Street. After the partnership dissolved in <span class="date">1904</span>, <span class="per">Kinney</span>, who had won the marshy land on the south end of the property in a coin flip with his former partners, began to build a seaside resort like the namesake Italian city took it.</p><br><br>
