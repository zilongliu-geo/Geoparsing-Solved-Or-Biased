  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Farmington</span> is a town located in <span class="loc">Hartford County</span> in the <span class="loc">Farmington Valley</span> area of central <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 25,340 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. As an affluent suburb of <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, it is home to the world headquarters of several large corporations including Carrier Corporation, <span class="org">Otis Elevator Company</span>, and <span class="loc">Carvel</span>. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> was originally inhabited by the Tunxis Indian tribe. In <span class="date">1640</span>, a community of English immigrants was established by residents of <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, making <span class="loc">Farmington</span> the oldest inland settlement west of the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> and the twelfth oldest communities in the state. Settlers found the area ideal because of its rich soil, location along the floodplain of the <span class="loc">Farmington River</span>, and valley geography. The town and river were given their present names in <span class="date">1645</span>, which is considered the incorporation year of the town. The town's boundaries were later enlarged several times, making it the largest in the <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> Colony. The town was named after <span class="loc">Farmington</span>, in <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> has been called the "mother of towns" because its vast area was divided to produce nine other central <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> communities. The <span class="loc">borough of Unionville</span>, in Farmington's northwest corner, was once home to many factories harnessing the water power of the <span class="loc">Farmington River</span>.</p><br><br>
