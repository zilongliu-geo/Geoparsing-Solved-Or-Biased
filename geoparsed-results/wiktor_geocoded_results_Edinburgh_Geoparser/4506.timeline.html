  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rock Island</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Douglas County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Wenatcheeâ€“East Wenatchee Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 788 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> was officially incorporated on <span class="date">November 3, 1930</span>. The area of <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> was used by Native American tribes for fishing and crossing of the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span> due to the nearby Rock <span class="loc">Island Rapids</span> prior to settlement of the <span class="loc">Washington</span> Territory. The site had been previously settled in the late 19th Century and was known as <span class="loc">Hammond</span>; early maps sometimes show the city as <span class="loc">Hammond P.O.</span> (Post Office) or <span class="loc">Power City</span>. In the teacup valley in which <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> is currently located, two men, <span class="loc">Ingraham</span> and <span class="loc">McBride</span>, opened a trading post in the early 1860s. Their patrons were local Native Americans, who often fished that stretch of the <span class="loc">Columbia</span> when the fish were running. The two pioneering men would later move their post to the mouth of the <span class="loc">Wenatchee River</span>, leaving little trace of their stay. The most notable figure in <span class="loc">Rock Island</span>'s founding is <span class="per">James E. Keane</span>. As the first permanent settler to the <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> area, <span class="per">James Keane</span> arrived with a crew of men in <span class="date">1887</span>. <span class="per">Keane</span> planned to build a home and improve the land that he had acquired through the homestead, pre-emption, and desert acts. <span class="date">Four years later</span>, the Great Northern Railroad made its first survey of the area and began construction toward the valley from the east. One half mile upriver from the well-known Rock <span class="loc">Island Rapids</span>, <span class="per">Mr. Keane</span> platted a townsite he named <span class="loc">Hammond</span>.</p><br><br>
