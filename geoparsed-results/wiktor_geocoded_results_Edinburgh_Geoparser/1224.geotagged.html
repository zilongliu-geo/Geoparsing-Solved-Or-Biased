Many were Quaker families who moved to the area from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> in search of productive farmland. Among the original settlers was James Mendenhall, who established a farmstead near present-day <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> in 1762. Though Mendenhall moved to <span class="loc">Georgia</span> in 1775, his son George remained, and by 1816, he founded the village of <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> in honor of his father. The Mendenhall family, who owned and operated the area's first grist and lumber mills, also owned much of the town's original land. Today, <span class="loc">High Point</span> <span class="loc">City Lake</span> is situated where the original family farmhouse and land was located.</p>
