  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Linden is an unincorporated community in <span class="per">Fauquier</span> and <span class="per">Warren</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of Virginia. It is located west of <span class="loc">Washington</span>, D.C. along Interstate 66. In <span class="date">1669</span> the "official" discovery of the <span class="loc">Shenandoah</span> Valley was credited to <span class="per">John Lederer</span> and <span class="per">John Catlett</span> at the present day site of Linden. The discovery and mapping of the area helped to open the area for further settlement. A marker at the intersection of VA 55 and SR 638 in Linden help commemorate this event. From the mid-18th century to <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, the Linden area was home to 25 apple orchards. The Linden Methodist Church was built in <span class="date">1842</span> and numerous buildings still exist dating from the 19th century. In <span class="date">November 1954</span>, tragedy struck the Linden church. A fire thought to be the caused by a faulty pipe in the wood burning stove, destroyed the beautiful 62-year-old wooden structure. Its towering steeple and bell had long been an iconic landmark in the community. The <span class="org">Front</span> Royal Fire Department courageously fought the blaze for four hours before it was squelched. Several heroic men in the Linden community, including <span class="per">Rev. B. L. Lock</span> entered the burning building to salvage the church's antique pulpit, pews and bible. All were relics from a church building that had previously served the congregation.</p><br><br>
