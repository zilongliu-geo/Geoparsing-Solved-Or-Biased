  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the only city in the county, but only the fourth-largest community, with a population of 21,233 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. A historic seaport and popular <span class="date">summer</span> tourist destination, <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> was the home of the Strategic Air Command's <span class="loc">Pease Air Force Base</span>, later converted to <span class="org">Portsmouth International Airport</span> at Pease with limited commercial air service. Native Americans of the Abenaki and other Algonquian languages-speaking nations, and their predecessors, inhabited the territory of coastal <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> for <span class="date">thousands of years</span> before European contact. The first known European to explore and write about the area was <span class="per">Martin Pring</span> in <span class="date">1603</span>. The <span class="loc">Piscataqua</span> River is a tidal estuary with a swift current, but forms a good natural harbor. The west bank of the harbor was settled by English colonists in <span class="date">1630</span> and named Strawbery Banke, after the many wild strawberries growing there. The village was fortified by <span class="loc">Fort William</span> and Mary. Strategically located for trade between upstream industries and mercantile interests abroad, the port prospered. Fishing, lumber and shipbuilding were principal businesses of the region. Enslaved Africans were imported as laborers as early as <span class="date">1645</span> and were integral to building the city's prosperity. <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> was part of the <span class="org">Triangle Trade</span>, which made significant profits from slavery.</p><br><br>
