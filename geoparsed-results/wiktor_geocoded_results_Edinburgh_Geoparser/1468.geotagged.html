<p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Des</span> <span class="loc">Moines County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 25,663 in the 2010 census, a decline from the 26,839 population in the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is the center of a micropolitan area including <span class="loc">West Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span> and <span class="loc">Middletown</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span> and <span class="loc">Gulfport</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is the home of Snake Alley, once labelled the crookedest alley in the world. Prior to European settlement, the area was neutral territory for the Sac and Fox Indians, who called it Shoquoquon (Shok-ko-kon), meaning <span class="loc">Flint Hills</span>. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson organized two parties of explorers to map the Louisiana Purchase. The Lewis and Clark Expedition followed the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River, while Lt. Zebulon Pike followed the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. In 1805, Pike landed at the bluffs below <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and raised the <span class="loc">United States</span> Flag for the first time on what would become <span class="loc">Iowa</span> soil and recommended construction of a fort. The recommendation went unheeded. The American Fur Company of John Jacob Astor established a post in the area in 1829. Settlement began in 1833, shortly after the Black Hawk Purchase, when Samuel (aka Simpson) White, Amzi Doolitle, and <span class="loc">Morton</span> M. McCarver crossed the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River from <span class="loc">Big Island</span> and staked claims there. According to an account A.T. Andreas wrote in 1875, White erected a cabin in the area later platted to be Front Street between Court and High streets. Andreas called White and Doolittle the <span class="loc">Romulus</span> and <span class="loc">Remus</span> of their settlement, referring to the mythic heroes who founded <span class="loc">Rome</span>, a city surrounded by hills. A few weeks later, William R. Ross joined them and established a general store. In November and December, he surveyed the settlement for White and Doolittle.</p>
