  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bexley</span> is a suburban city in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,057 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Founded as a village over <span class="date">a hundred years ago</span>, the <span class="loc">City of Bexley</span> is an old, tree-lined suburb of <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> state capital, situated on the banks of <span class="loc">Alum Creek</span> next to Driving Park and <span class="loc">Wolfe</span> Park, just east of the <span class="org">Franklin</span> Park Conservatory. It is horizontally bisected by the National Road (Main Street), serving as a reminder of <span class="loc">Bexley</span>'s origins as a merger between the prestigious <span class="loc">Bullitt</span> Park neighborhood to the north, and the Lutheran college community of Pleasant Ridge to the south. This history of joining economic and educational privilege remains evident in <span class="loc">Bexley</span> to <span class="date">this day</span>. The historic suburb is perhaps best known, however, for its large houses and estates, located primarily in <span class="loc">Bullitt</span> Park. The most famous of these include the Jeffrey Park Mansion (aka "Kelveden"), the home of the president of The <span class="org">Ohio State University</span>, and the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> Governor's Mansion. Located in northern <span class="loc">Bexley</span>, the Governor's Mansion—originally built as a private residence in <span class="date">1925</span> and given to the state in <span class="date">1955</span>—has served as the official residence of <span class="loc">Ohio</span> governors since <span class="date">1957</span>, though <span class="per">Governor James A. Rhodes</span> (in his final two terms in office) and current Governor <span class="per">John Kasich</span>, both of whom were residents of central <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, chose to remain in their private homes while in office.</p><br><br>
