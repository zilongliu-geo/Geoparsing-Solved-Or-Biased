<p><span class="loc">Socorro</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Socorro County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> Valley at an elevation of 4,579 feet (1,396 m). In 2012 the population was 8,906. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Socorro County</span>. <span class="loc">Socorro</span> is located 74 miles (119 km) south of <span class="loc">Albuquerque</span> and 146 miles (235 km) north of <span class="loc">Las Cruces</span>. In June 1598, Juan de Oñate led a group of Spanish settlers through the Jornada del Muerto, an inhospitable patch of desert that ends just south of the present-day <span class="loc">city of Socorro</span>. As the Spaniards emerged from the desert, Piro Indians of the pueblo of <span class="loc">Teypana</span> gave them food and water. Therefore, the Spaniards renamed this pueblo <span class="loc">Socorro</span>, which means "help" or "aid". Later, the name "Socorro" would be applied to the nearby Piro pueblo of Pilabó. Nuestra Señora de <span class="loc">Perpetuo Socorro</span>, the first Catholic mission in the area, was probably established c. 1626. Fray Agustín de Vetancurt would later write that around 600 people lived in the area during this period. Mines in the Socorro mountains were opened by 1626.</p>
