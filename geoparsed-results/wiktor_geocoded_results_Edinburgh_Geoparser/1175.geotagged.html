<p><span class="loc">Nevada</span> (Spanish for "snow covered") is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>. <span class="loc">Nevada</span> is the 7th most extensive, the 35th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 <span class="loc">United States</span>. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, which contains the <span class="loc">Las</span> <span class="loc">Vegasâ€“Paradise metropolitan</span> area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is <span class="loc">Carson City</span>. <span class="loc">Nevada</span> is officially known as the "Silver State" due to the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the "Battle Born State", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words "Battle Born" also appear on the state flag); as the "Sage-brush State", for the native plant of the same name; and as the "Sage-hen State". Nevada borders <span class="loc">Oregon</span> to the northwest, <span class="loc">Idaho</span> to the northeast, <span class="loc">California</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Arizona</span> to the southeast and <span class="loc">Utah</span> to the east. <span class="loc">Nevada</span> is largely desert and semiarid, much of it located within the <span class="loc">Great Basin</span>. Areas south of the <span class="loc">Great Basin</span> are located within the <span class="loc">Mojave Desert</span>, while <span class="loc">Lake Tahoe</span> and the <span class="loc">Sierra Nevada</span> lie on the western edge. About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> federal government, both civilian and military.</p>
