Many of these feature late Art Deco design elements. Medium density flats have been built in the areas close to <span class="per">King Georges Road</span> and Stoney Creek Road. <span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span> was originally known as <span class="loc">Dumbleton</span> after a local farm in the area, circa <span class="date">1830</span>.
