<p><span class="loc">Naples</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Collier County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of 2015, the city's population was about 20,600. <span class="loc">Naples</span> is a principal city of the Naples-Marco Island, <span class="loc">Florida Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which had a population of about 322,000 at the 2015 census. <span class="loc">Naples</span> is one of the wealthiest cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, with the sixth highest per capita income in <span class="loc">America</span>, and the second highest proportion of millionaires per capita in the <span class="loc">US</span>. Real estate is among the most expensive in the country, with houses for sale in excess of $40 million. The <span class="loc">city of Naples</span> was founded during the late 1880s by former Confederate general and <span class="loc">Kentucky U.S.</span> Senator John Stuart Williams and his partner, Louisville businessman Walter N. Haldeman, the publisher of the Louisville Courier-Journal. Throughout the 1870s and '80s, magazine and newspaper stories telling of the area's mild climate and abundant fish and game likened it to the sunny Italian peninsula. The name <span class="loc">Naples</span> caught on when promoters described the bay as "surpassing the bay in <span class="loc">Naples</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>". Major development was anticipated after the railroad reached <span class="loc">Naples</span> on January 7, 1927, and the <span class="loc">Tamiami</span> Trail linking <span class="loc">Naples</span> to <span class="loc">Miami</span> was completed in 1928, but did not begin until after the Great Depression and World War II. During the war the U.S. Army Air Forces built a small air field and used it for training purposes; it is now the <span class="loc">Naples</span> Municipal Airport.</p>
