  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Falmouth</span> (/ˈfælməθ/; <span class="loc">Cornish</span>: Aberfala) is a town, civil parish and port on the <span class="loc">River Fal</span> on the south coast of <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. It has a total resident population of 26,767. See also: <span class="per">Miss Susan Gay</span>'s <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> chronology The name <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> is of English origin, which recent Cornish language enthusiasts have translated to "Aberfal" (or "Aberfala") based on Welsh precedents. It is claimed that an earlier Celtic name for the place was Peny-cwm-cuic, which has been Anglicized to 'Pennycomequick'. <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> was the site where <span class="per">Henry VIII</span> built <span class="loc">Pendennis Castle</span> to defend <span class="loc">Carrick Roads</span>, in <span class="date">1540</span>. The main town of the district was then at <span class="loc">Penryn</span>. <span class="per">Sir John Killigrew</span> created the town of <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> shortly after <span class="date">1613</span>. In the late 16th century, under threat from the Spanish Armada, the defences at <span class="loc">Pendennis</span> were strengthened by the building of angled ramparts. During the Civil War, <span class="loc">Pendennis Castle</span> was the second to last fort to surrender to the Parliamentary Army. After the Civil War, <span class="per">Sir Peter Killigrew</span> received Royal patronage when he gave land for the building of <span class="org">the Church of King</span> <span class="per">Charles</span> the Martyr, dedicated to <span class="per">Charles I</span>, "the Martyr".</p><br><br>
