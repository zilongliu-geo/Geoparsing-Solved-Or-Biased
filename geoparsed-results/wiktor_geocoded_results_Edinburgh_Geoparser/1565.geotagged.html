<p>Henderson is a major suburb of <span class="loc">Auckland</span>, in the <span class="loc">North Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. It is located 13 kilometres to the west of <span class="loc">Auckland</span> city centre, and two kilometres to the west of the <span class="loc">Whau River</span>, a southwestern arm of the <span class="loc">Waitemata Harbour</span>. The population was 4,026 in the 2006 Census, an increase of 123 from 2001. The suburb is in the <span class="loc">Waitakere ward</span>, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of <span class="loc">Auckland City</span>. It was named after early colonial settler Thomas Henderson, who started a timber mill in the area in ca. 1847 to process the kauri trees which were cut from the <span class="loc">Henderson</span> Valley, and upstream from the eastern flanks of the <span class="loc">Waitakere Ranges</span>. Henderson features a large shopping and theatre complex, the Australian-owned Westfield WestCity shopping centre, with numerous other shops and large-scale stores also in the area. On the outskirts of Henderson is the Corban's Wine Estate, a major <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> export wine brand. The Corban's Estate Arts Centre hosts the annual InterACT Disability Arts Festival. Henderson Train Station has recently been expanded to accommodate a second track and a bus depot is planned nearby. The public transport hub has been dubbed "Baby Britomart". The West Wave pool in Henderson, owned by the Auckland Council, was built to host the Aquatics at the 1990 Commonwealth Games.</p>
