<p><span class="loc">Tempe</span> (/tɛmˈpiː/, <span class="loc">US</span> dict: tem-ˈpē; Oidbaḍ in <span class="loc">Pima</span>), also known as Hayden's Ferry during the territorial times of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, is a city in <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with the Census Bureau reporting a 2010 population of 161,719. The city is named after the <span class="loc">Vale of Tempe</span> in <span class="loc">Greece</span>. <span class="loc">Tempe</span> is located in the East Valley section of metropolitan Phoenix; it is bordered by Phoenix and Guadalupe on the west, <span class="loc">Scottsdale</span> on the north, Chandler on the south, and Mesa on the east. <span class="loc">Tempe</span> was the location of US Airways Group's corporate headquarters until December 9, 2013, when US Airways and American Airlines merged to form American Airlines Group. The headquarters for the combined airline moved to American's headquarters in <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. <span class="loc">Tempe</span> is also the home of Arizona State University. The Hohokam lived in this area and built canals to support their agriculture. They abandoned their settlements during the 15th century, with a few individuals and families remaining nearby. <span class="loc">Fort McDowell</span> was established approximately 25 mi (40 km) northeast of present downtown <span class="loc">Tempe</span> on the upper <span class="loc">Salt River</span> in 1865 allowing for new towns to be built farther down the <span class="loc">Salt River</span>. <span class="loc">US</span> military service members and Hispanic workers were hired to grow food and animal feed to supply the fort, and less than a year later, had set up small camps near the river that were the first permanent communities in the Valley after the fall of the Hohokam. (Phoenix was settled shortly afterward, by 1867-68.) The two settlements were 'Hayden's Ferry', named after a ferry service operated by Charles T. Hayden, and '<span class="loc">San Pablo</span>', and were located west and east of <span class="loc">Hayden Butte</span> respectively. The ferry became the key river crossing in the area. The Tempe Irrigating Canal Company was soon established by William Kirkland and James McKinney to provide water for alfalfa, wheat, barley, oats, and cotton.</p>
