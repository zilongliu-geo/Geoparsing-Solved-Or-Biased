<p>Arlington is a city in <span class="loc">Gilliam County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The account of how the city received its name varies; one tradition claims it was named after the lawyer Nathan Arlington <span class="loc">Cornish</span>, while another tradition claims that the Southern inhabitants of the city had enough clout to rename the city after <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, home of general Robert E. Lee. The city's population was 586 at the 2010 census. Originally named Alkali, Arlington came into existence as a place for shipping cattle down the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span>. It was incorporated as Arlington by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on November 20, 1885. Following the completion of the John Day Dam, the original location of Arlington was moved to higher ground in 1963 to avoid the resulting inundation. Arlington was the birthplace of musician Doc Severinsen, best known as the musical director for the American television program The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1967â€“1992). In 2008, it was discovered that Mayor Carmen Kontur-Gronquist had posted photos of herself in lingerie online, which, along with several other issues, led to her recall from office.</p>
