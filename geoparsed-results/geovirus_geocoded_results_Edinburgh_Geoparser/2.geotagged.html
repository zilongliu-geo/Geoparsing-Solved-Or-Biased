<p>The agriculture officials earlier announced that the depopulation will be carried out in a "humane" manner, following current Office international des épizooties (OIE) procedures that ensure protection of animal welfare in the Bulacan farm. According to Philippine Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque, the quarantine of the hog farm in <span class="loc">Palauig</span>, <span class="loc">Manaoag</span>, <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span> has been lifted after finding no traces of viral transmission. According to Yap, test results conducted by a joint mission of FAO, the World Animal Health Organization, WHO and their local counterparts, reveal that viral transmission continues to exist in Pandi hog farms, which is only 0.5% of the 13 million pigs raised throughout the country. DOH officials also say a pig farm worker in <span class="loc">Cabanatuan</span> in <span class="loc">Nueva Ecija</span>, who had no direct contact with sick hogs, has tested positive for Immunoglobulin G antibodies against the <span class="loc">Reston</span> ebolavirus, which is non-lethal, unlike the Zaïre, <span class="loc">Bundibugyo</span>, Côte d'<span class="loc">Ivoire</span> and <span class="loc">Sudan</span> strains, according to FAO.</p>
