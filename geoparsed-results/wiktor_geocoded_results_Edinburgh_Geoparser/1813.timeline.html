  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Moura</span> is a small town and locality in <span class="org">the Shire of Banana</span> in Central Queensland, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It services the surrounding coal mining and rural activities. It is situated approximately 65 kilometres (40 mi) west of <span class="loc">Biloela</span> on the Dawson Highway, 186 kilometres (116 mi) west of the port <span class="loc">city of Gladstone</span>, and 171 kilometres (106 mi) south west of <span class="loc">Rockhampton</span>. At the 2011census, <span class="loc">Moura</span> had a population of 1,899 people. In <span class="date">1854</span> <span class="per">Charles Marshall</span> named his leased pastoral selection <span class="loc">Moura</span>. There are two theories regarding the origin of the name. One is that it is named after <span class="loc">Moura</span> in <span class="loc">Portugal</span> where he served in the British Army during the Peninsular Wars. The other is that it is an Aboriginal word meaning native camp dog. The <span class="loc">Moura</span> property was developed into a homestead in <span class="date">1880</span> by <span class="per">Edward Homer</span>. The town was first established in <span class="date">1936</span> as a farming centre near the existing <span class="loc">Moura</span> Station. The <span class="org">Moura Post Office</span> opened in <span class="date">late 1939</span>. <span class="org">Moura Provisional School</span> was opened on <span class="date">10 September 1940</span>. It became <span class="org">Moura State School</span> on <span class="date">1 January 1948</span>. In <span class="date">1965</span> a secondary department was attached to the school. By <span class="date">1975</span>, there were sufficient secondary students to warrant a formal high school and so <span class="org">Moura State High School</span> was opened on <span class="date">25 January 1976</span> with 263 pupils.</p><br><br>
