<p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> is a green and hilly inner-southern suburb of the South Australian capital <span class="loc">city of Adelaide</span>. It is located in the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges, around 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south-east of the <span class="loc">Adelaide city</span> centre. The suburb is part of the hills-face zone, with sweeping views over the Adelaide plains. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is an affluent area containing many of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>'s most valuable residential properties. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is bounded to the North by the suburbs of <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> and <span class="loc">Netherby</span>, to the west by <span class="loc">Torrens Park</span> and <span class="loc">Mitcham</span>, to the south by Mitcham and Brown <span class="loc">Hill Creek</span>, and to the east by <span class="loc">Leawood</span> Gardens and Urrbrae. Situated on the east side of the <span class="loc">Mitcham district</span>, the land was first purchased from the crown in 1841 by Richard F. Newland, manager of the Bank of Australasia. By 1870, Charles B. Hardy was making extensive additions to a residence named "Springfield", laying out extensive gardens and adding to the acreage of the estate. Fifty years ago, the area was purchased from Mr. Frank Rymill by Springfield Limited which boasted a subdivisional design "entirely different from any previous scheme or organised suburban development in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>".</p>
