  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Norwood</span> is the second most populous city in <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and an enclave of the larger <span class="loc">city of Cincinnati</span>. The population was 19,207 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Originally settled as an early suburb of <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span> in the wooded countryside north of the city, the area is characterized by older homes and tree-lined streets. The earliest humans in the area <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Norwood</span> are believed to have been Pre-Columbian era people of the <span class="loc">Adena</span> culture. Norwood Mound, a prehistoric earthwork mound built by the <span class="loc">Adena</span>, is located in <span class="loc">Norwood</span> and listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. The <span class="loc">Adena</span> constructed the mound at the location of Norwood's present-day Water Tower Park, which is the highest land elevation in the city and one of the highest in all of <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>. Archaeologists believe the mound was built at this site due to the high elevation and was used by the <span class="loc">Adena</span> for religious ceremonies and smoke signaling. Native American mounds are not uncommon in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and several were located in Downtown Cincinnati at the time of arrival of the first white settlers. However by <span class="date">1895</span>, the Norwood Mound was the only remaining mound in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>." The mound has never been excavated, but it is reported that many artifacts found in the area by early <span class="loc">Norwood</span> settlers in the 1800s made up the original nucleus of the Native American Art Collection of the <span class="loc">Cincinnati Art Museum</span>. In the early-20th century, <span class="org">Norwood High School</span> named their sports team mascot the Indians in honor of this local Native American heritage.</p><br><br>
