  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Milton is a borough in <span class="loc">Northumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, on the <span class="loc">West Branch Susquehanna River</span>, 50 miles (80 km) north of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>. It is about 10 miles upriver from the mouth of the <span class="loc">West Branch Susquehanna River</span> and about 30 miles downriver of <span class="loc">Williamsport</span>. Settled in <span class="date">1770</span>, it was incorporated in <span class="date">1817</span>, and is governed by a charter that was revised in <span class="date">1890</span>. Formerly, its extensive manufacturing plants included car and woodworking machinery shops; rolling, flour, knitting, planing, and saw mills; washer, nut, and bolt works; and furniture, shoe, couch, nail, fly net, bamboo novelty, and paper-box factories. In <span class="date">1900</span>, 6,175 people lived in Milton. In <span class="date">1940</span>, 8,313 people lived there. The population was 6,650 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census, and 7,042 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The <span class="loc">Milton Historic District</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Canal and Limestone Run Aqueduct, <span class="loc">Milton Armory</span>, and <span class="loc">Milton Freight Station</span> are listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. At the turn of the 20th century, several industrial and manufacturing companies were located within the borough. The six principal industries were <span class="org">Samuel J. Shimer &amp; Sons</span>, the <span class="org">Milton Manufacturing Company</span>, the American <span class="per">Car</span> and <span class="per">Foundry</span> Company, the <span class="per">F.A. Godcharles</span> Company, the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> <span class="per">H. Souter</span> Silk Company, and the West Branch Novelty Company. Many smaller businesses flourished in parallel with the large manufacturing companies during this early period, which made the borough an industrial center in the region at the time.</p><br><br>
