<p><span class="loc">Ede</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Osun</span> State, southwestern <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. It lies along the <span class="loc">Osun</span> River at a point on the railroad from <span class="loc">Lagos</span>, 112 miles (180 km) southwest, and at the intersection of roads from <span class="loc">Oshogbo</span>, <span class="loc">Ogbomosho</span>, and <span class="loc">Ife</span>. <span class="loc">Ede</span> is one of the older towns of the Yoruba people. It is traditionally said to have been founded about 1500 by Timi Agbale, a hunter and warlord sent by Alaafin (King) <span class="loc">Kori</span> of <span class="loc">Old Oyo</span> (<span class="loc">Katunga</span>), capital of the Oyo empire, to establish a settlement to protect the Oyo caravan route to <span class="loc">Benin</span> (127 miles [204 km] to the southeast). Nearby towns include <span class="loc">Awo</span>, <span class="loc">Iragberi</span> and <span class="loc">Oshogbo</span>. The present <span class="loc">Ede</span> was established by Timi Kubolaje Agbonran around 1817 along with his siblings Oyefi, Ajenju, Arohanran and Oduniyi, all being the descendants of <span class="loc">Lalemo</span>. The former <span class="loc">Ede</span> is known as Ede-Ile. <span class="loc">Ede</span> is a predominantly Muslim town with about 90% of the population. This can be traced back to 19th century during the reign of Timi Abibu Lagunju as the king of <span class="loc">Ede</span>, who is most likely the first Muslim <span class="loc">Oba</span> in Yorubaland given the fact that he was already on the throne for a few years when in November 1857, the <span class="loc">Baptist</span> missionary W.H. Clarke visited <span class="loc">Ede</span>. Clarke record thus: "This young follower of the Prophet (Prophet Muhammad), a short time since became the ruler of this town in the place of his father (Oduniyi), the deceased, and brings with him into office, the influence of his new religion (Islam)."</p>
