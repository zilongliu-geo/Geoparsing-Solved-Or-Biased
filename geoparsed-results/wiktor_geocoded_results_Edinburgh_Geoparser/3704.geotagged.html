<p><span class="loc">Howard County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, with its southern border made by the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. As of the 2010 census, the population was 10,144. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Fayette</span>. The county was organized January 23, 1816 and named for Benjamin Howard, the first Governor of the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Territory. On the north bank of the <span class="loc">Missouri River</span>, <span class="loc">Howard County</span> was settled primarily by migrants from the Upper Southern states of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> and Virginia. They brought slaves and slaveholding traditions with them, and quickly started cultivating commodity crops similar to those in Middle Tennessee and Kentucky: hemp and tobacco. Howard was one of several counties settled mostly by Southerners along the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River in the central part of the state. Given their culture and traditions, this area became known as <span class="loc">Little Dixie</span> and <span class="loc">Howard County</span> was at its heart. Following the 1848 revolutions in <span class="loc">Germany</span>, many German immigrants also settled in this area. Due to the reliance on slave labor, in 1860 slaves made up 25 percent or more of the county's population. <span class="loc">Howard County</span> residents generally supported the Confederacy during the Civil War. After Reconstruction, whites imposed Jim Crow laws and segregation. There were five lynchings between 1891 and 1914: all the victims—Olli Truxton, Frank Embree, Thomas Hayden, Arthur McNeal, and Dallas Shields—were African-American men. The rate of lynchings of blacks was higher in the Deep South, during what is considered the nadir of <span class="loc">United States</span> race relations.</p>
