  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Milford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hillsborough County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, on the <span class="loc">Souhegan River</span>. The population was 15,115 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the retail and manufacturing center of a six-town area known informally as the <span class="loc">Souhegan</span> Valley. The town center of <span class="loc">Milford</span>, where 8,835 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Milford</span> census-designated place (CDP), and is located at the junction of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> routes 13 and 101A. <span class="loc">Milford</span> separated from neighboring <span class="loc">Amherst</span> in <span class="date">1794</span>. Like most towns named <span class="loc">Milford</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, its name comes from the fact that it grew around a mill built on a ford - in this case on the <span class="loc">Souhegan River</span>. <span class="loc">Milford</span> was once home to numerous granite quarries, which produced a stone that was used, among other things, to make the pillars for the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Treasury in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span>â€”pillars that can still be seen on the American $10 bill. Its nickname remains "The Granite Town," although only one small quarry is in operation as of <span class="date">2007</span>. Like many <span class="loc">New England</span> riverside towns, <span class="loc">Milford</span> developed several thriving textile mills in the 19th century. That industry left <span class="loc">New England</span> by World War II, but <span class="loc">Milford</span> remains the commercial and retail center for surrounding towns. Major employers included casting company <span class="org">Hitchiner Manufacturing Co.</span>, a metal cable manufacturer <span class="loc">Hendrix</span> <span class="per">Wire</span> and <span class="per">Cable</span> Inc. and a contract manufacturing solutions company, <span class="org">Cirtronics Corporation</span>.</p><br><br>
