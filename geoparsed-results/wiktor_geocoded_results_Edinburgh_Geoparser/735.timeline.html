  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lourdes</span> (pronunciation: [luʀd]; <span class="loc">Lorda</span> in Occitan, pron. ['lurðɔ]) is a small market town lying in the foothills of the <span class="loc">Pyrenees</span>. It is part of the Hautes-Pyrénées department in the <span class="loc">Midi-Pyrénées region</span> in south-western <span class="loc">France</span>. Prior to the apparitions of the <span class="org">Virgin</span> Mary in <span class="date">1858</span>, the most prominent feature of the town was the fortified castle that rises up from a rocky escarpment at its centre. In <span class="date">1858</span> <span class="loc">Lourdes</span> rose to prominence in <span class="loc">France</span> and abroad due to the <span class="org">Marian</span> apparitions seen by the peasant girl <span class="per">Bernadette Soubirous</span>, who was later canonized. Shortly thereafter the city became one of the world's most important sites of pilgrimage and religious tourism. <span class="date">Today</span> Lourdes hosts around six million visitors every year from all corners of the world. This constant stream of pilgrims and tourists transformed quiet <span class="loc">Lourdes</span> into the second most important center of tourism in <span class="loc">France</span>, second only to <span class="loc">Paris</span>, and the third most important site of international Catholic pilgrimage after <span class="loc">Rome</span> and the Holy Land. As of <span class="date">2011</span>, of French cities only <span class="loc">Paris</span> had more hotel capacity. The <span class="org">Virgin</span> Mary appeared to Marie-Bernadette <span class="per">Soubirous</span> on a total of eighteen occasions at <span class="loc">Lourdes</span>. <span class="loc">Lourdes</span> has become a major place of Roman Catholic pilgrimage and of miraculous healings. The 150th Jubilee of the first apparition took place on <span class="date">11 February 2008</span> with an outdoor Mass attended by approximately 45,000 pilgrims.</p><br><br>
