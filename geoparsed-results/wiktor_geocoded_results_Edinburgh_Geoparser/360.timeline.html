  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Kingston is a borough in <span class="loc">Luzerne County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, on the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span> opposite Wilkes Barre. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 13,182. Kingston was named after Kingston, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, and incorporated as a borough in <span class="date">1857</span>. Kingston has adopted a home rule charter which became effective in <span class="date">January 1976</span>. Kingston has a rich history as a pivotal pioneer in American education. In <span class="date">1775</span>, a new school was erected on the site of one established in <span class="date">1773</span>, which is said to have been the first public school in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. The borough is also home to the Upper School campus of <span class="loc">Wyoming Seminary</span>, a prestigious college preparatory school founded in Kingston in <span class="date">1844</span>. The school was founded with a total of just 31 students—17 boys and 14 girls—enrolling in the first year. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Wyoming Seminary</span>'s historic campus hosts roughly 450 students and its Lower School grounds in Forty Fort host students from pre-K through eighth grade. In <span class="date">June 1972</span>, Kingston was devastated by the flooding of Hurricane Agnes. The hurricane, at the time the most significant natural disaster in American history, wreaked havoc on Kingston and neighboring Wilkes-Barre, causing a state of emergency. The natural disaster earned national attention and a visit from President <span class="per">Richard Nixon</span> who recruited <span class="loc">Wyoming Seminary</span> graduate <span class="per">Frank Carlucci</span>, <span class="per">Nixon</span>'s head of the <span class="org">Department of Health, Education</span>, and Welfare, as a point man to oversee flood recovery efforts.</p><br><br>
