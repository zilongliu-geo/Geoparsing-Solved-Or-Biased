The district is predominantly populated by the <span class="per">Pashtun Khattak</span> tribe. There are several natural resources that have been discovered in <span class="per">Karak</span>. The salt mines were well known in antiquity and a major source of salt for the Indian subcontinent into British imperial times. More recently oil, gas, and uranium have all been discovered.
