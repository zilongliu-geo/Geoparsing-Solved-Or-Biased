<p><span class="loc">Clifton</span> is a neighborhood on the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Staten Island</span> in New <span class="loc">York City</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is an older waterfront neighborhood, facing Upper New <span class="loc">York Bay</span> on the east. It is bordered on the north by <span class="loc">Stapleton</span>, on the south by <span class="loc">Rosebank</span>, on the southwest by Concord, and on the west by Van <span class="loc">Duzer</span> Street. The name "Clifton" for the area dates to 1817, when a town by the name, larger in area than the present neighborhood, was laid out along the waterfront. In its early history, much of the surrounding land was owned by the Vanderbilt family. As a young man, Cornelius Vanderbilt established ferry service from the waterfront to Manhattan at the foot of present Vanderbilt Avenue. Bayley Seton Hospital, north of <span class="loc">Vanderbilt Avenue</span>, was formerly the <span class="loc">United States</span> Public Health Service Hospital and housed the original headquarters of the National Institutes of Health (now located in <span class="loc">Bethesda</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>). In the 1840s the Townsend family built a huge home that had turrets so it was called the Townsend Castle. It was located at what is now Townsend Avenue and Tompkins Avenue. In the 1870s many roads and large homes were built near the water. The area has many Victorian houses left from the late 1800s in the area from <span class="loc">Vanderbilt</span> to <span class="loc">Norwood Avenues</span>. In 1900 the Fox Hills Golf Club encompassed the entire area of where the Park Hill Apartments are now. There was a big clubhouse on Vanderbilt Avenue. Many tournaments were held there until the 1920s when it closed. The land was taken over by the government and used for military barracks during World War II. By the 1950s, it evolved into a middle-class, multi-ethnic community of civil employees including firemen, teachers, and doctors.</p>
