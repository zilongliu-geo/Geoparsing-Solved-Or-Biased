<p>Harrow is a community located in the town of <span class="loc">Essex</span>, <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Hiram Walker, of Canadian Club Whisky fame is credited with putting Harrow on the map. Walker built the railroad, which then brought grain from the South end of the County into the city for use in his distillery. The tracks remained for over 100 years, and were finally removed in 1992 to be replaced with the <span class="loc">Chrysler</span> <span class="loc">Canada</span> <span class="loc">Greenway</span>, part of the Trans <span class="loc">Canada</span> Trail. Walker's distillation operations remained in Harrow until 2009, when the <span class="loc">Canbar</span>, Inc cooperage closed. Though early settlers were mostly German, a thriving community of Portuguese came later and still remain. Today Harrow is a community situated along scenic County Road 20 that offers shops and places for antique hunters. It is also the home of <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s southernmost high school. Attractions include Colio Winery and historic John R. Park Homestead. Harrow has organized and hosted an annual agricultural fair every Labour Day weekend for over 150 years, and many people from <span class="loc">Essex County</span> and other parts of <span class="loc">Ontario</span> attend. Highlights of the fair include a mom calling contest, a pie auction, "bossy" bingo and a tractor pull. The Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Greenhouse and Processing Crops Research Centre is also located in Harrow. Atlas Tube, a unit of JMC Steel Group, owned by the Zekelman family, makes its home on the outskirts on the town.</p>
