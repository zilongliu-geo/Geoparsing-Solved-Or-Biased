  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Tune is a former municipality in Østfold county, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. The former municipality originally covered the current Sarpsborg municipality with the exception of <span class="loc">Skjeberg</span> and with the addition of Rolvsøy. The <span class="loc">parish of Tune</span> was established as a municipality <span class="date">January 1, 1838</span> (see formannskapsdistrikt). The <span class="loc">city of Sarpsborg</span> was grounded and separated from Tune to constitute a separate administrative unit in <span class="date">1839</span>. The rural <span class="loc">district of Varteig</span> was separated from Tune in <span class="date">1861</span>, and the same thing happened with Rolvsøy on <span class="date">1 January 1911</span>, leaving Tune with a population of 8,040. Despite the separations Tune witnessed steady growth over the <span class="date">years</span>. Starting in <span class="date">1884</span>, a series of border adjustments which moved territory from Tune to <span class="loc">Sarpsborg</span> took place. Following the moving of an uninhabited part of Tune to <span class="loc">Sarpsborg</span> in <span class="date">1884</span>, parts with 696, 1,008, 66 and 10 inhabitants were moved to <span class="loc">Sarpsborg</span> in <span class="date">1912</span>, <span class="date">1925</span>, <span class="date">1957</span> and <span class="date">1980</span> respectively. On <span class="date">1 January 1992</span> the rest of Tune, along with <span class="loc">Skjeberg</span> and <span class="loc">Varteig</span> municipalities, was incorporated into <span class="loc">Sarpsborg</span>. Prior to the merger Tune had a population of 15,143, and consisted of the parishes Tune and Greåker.</p><br><br>
