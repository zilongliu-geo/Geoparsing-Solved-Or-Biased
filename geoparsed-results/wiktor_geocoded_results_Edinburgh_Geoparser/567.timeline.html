  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Milton</span> (<span class="date">2011</span> census population 84,362) is a town in <span class="loc">Southern Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, and part of the <span class="loc">Halton Region</span> in the <span class="org">Greater Toronto Area</span>. The town received a significant amount of attention after the <span class="date">2006</span> and 2011 censuses indicated that <span class="per">Milton</span> was the fastest growing municipality in the Greater <span class="loc">Golden Horseshoe</span>, with a 71.4% increase in population between <span class="date">2001</span> and <span class="date">2006</span>, and a 56.4% increase in population between <span class="date">2006</span> and <span class="date">2011</span>. In <span class="date">early 2014</span>, <span class="per">Milton</span>'s population is estimated to be 102,000 with an estimated growth to 228,000 by <span class="date">2031</span>. <span class="per">Milton</span> is located 40 km (25 mi) west of Downtown Toronto on Highway 401, and is the western terminus for the <span class="per">Milton</span> line commuter train and bus corridor operated by GO Transit. <span class="per">Milton</span> is on the edge of the <span class="loc">Niagara Escarpment</span>, a UNESCO world biosphere reserve and the <span class="loc">Bruce</span> Trail. The town took root out of a settlement by <span class="per">Jasper Martin</span> along the <span class="loc">Sixteen Mile Creek</span>; <span class="per">Martin</span> immigrated from <span class="loc">Newcastle</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> with his wife <span class="per">Sarah</span> and two sons on <span class="date">May 17, 1818</span>. <span class="per">Martin</span> was granted 100 acres (40 ha) of land, from the <span class="org">Crown</span> in <span class="date">1820</span>, designated Lot 14, Concession 2, Township of <span class="loc">Trafalgar</span>, <span class="loc">Halton County</span>, in <span class="org">the District of Gore</span>. <span class="per">Martin</span> later built a grist mill along the creek and created a pond, known as <span class="loc">Mill Pond</span>, to power his mill. The mill became the centre of settlement for others as they settled in the region. In <span class="date">1837</span> the area had a population of approximately 100 people and was named <span class="per">Milton</span> after the English poet <span class="per">John Milton</span>. The town, as it is <span class="date">today</span>, soon after became known as <span class="per">Milton</span>. The two principal property owners of the young town were the Martins and the Fosters. The current site of <span class="per">Milton</span>'s town hall was donated from <span class="per">Mr. Hugh Foster</span> (and thus, <span class="per">Hugh Foster Hall</span>).</p><br><br>
