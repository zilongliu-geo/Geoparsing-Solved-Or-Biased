<p>Salma (Arabic: سلمى‎) is a village in northwestern <span class="loc">Syria</span>, administratively part of the <span class="loc">Latakia</span> Governorate, located northeast of <span class="loc">Latakia</span>. Nearby localities include <span class="loc">Mashqita</span> and <span class="loc">Ayn</span> al-Bayda to the west, al-Haffah to the southwest, <span class="loc">Aramo</span> and <span class="loc">Slinfah</span> 12 km to the south, and Kinsabba to the north. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Salma had a population of 2,131 in the 2004 census. Its inhabitants and those of the <span class="loc">Jabal</span> al-Akrad area are predominantly Sunni Muslims, although about 80% of the <span class="loc">Latakia District</span>'s residents are Alawites. Salma is well known for its dry climate and its plentiful clean water. It is situated about 800 meters above sea level. Prior to the Baathist takeover of <span class="loc">Syria</span> in the 1960s, Salma was one of the few places in the coastal mountain region to be electrified and connected to a grid. During the Syrian civil war, as of late July 2012 the FSA controlled the town, whose population has mostly left (part to <span class="loc">Latakia city</span> and part to <span class="loc">Turkey</span>). The FSA said that they were able to hold on to Salma thanks to its mountainous nature and the fact that it is surrounded by Sunni villages. It was on the front line of fighting in <span class="loc">Latakia</span> Governorate between rebels and government forces for a lengthy period of time. In November 2013, reporter Jonathan Steele claimed that the town was the <span class="loc">Latakia</span> governorate headquarters of both al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of <span class="loc">Iraq</span> and the Levant.</p>
