Its former name used to be <span class="loc">Panangatan</span>, which comes from the root word sang-at, meaning "to put up on an elevated place". This referred to the practice of fishermen from Dimiao and Lila who would put up (sang-at) their boats on the banks of the <span class="loc">Panangatan</span> River when taking shelter during the south-west monsoons. Here nipa palms grew along the river, preventing the boats from being washed away by the waves. <span class="loc">Panangatan</span> remained part of Dimiao until 1867. That year a Spanish priest was assigned to the place and it became a separate municipality. The priest gave it a new name, naming after his birthplace in <span class="loc">Spain</span>. In 1879 <span class="loc">Valencia</span> had a population of 7,009.</p>
