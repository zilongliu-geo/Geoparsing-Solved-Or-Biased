<p>Brandon is a small village in <span class="loc">Warwickshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Along with nearby <span class="loc">Bretford</span>, it forms part of a joint civil <span class="loc">parish of Brandon and Bretford</span>. Administratively it is part of the <span class="loc">borough of Rugby</span>. The <span class="loc">River Avon</span> passes just to the east of the village. Brandon is located upon the A428 road between <span class="loc">Coventry</span>, 6 miles (9.5 km) to the west, and Rugby, 7 miles (11 km) to the east. Brandon is separated from the much larger village of <span class="loc">Wolston</span> by a railway viaduct, but the two villages practically form a single entity. The railway viaduct dates from 1837 and was part of the original <span class="loc">London</span> and <span class="loc">Birmingham Railway</span>, The village used to have a railway station, but this was closed in 1960. 1.5 miles (2.5 km) west of Brandon is the suburban village of <span class="loc">Binley Woods</span> and 2 miles (3 km) to the east is the small village of <span class="loc">Bretford</span>. The village contains a number of old cottages and has a pub near the railway line. Just to the north of the village is Coventry Stadium, used for speedway racing, greyhound racing, and stock car racing. The stadium is home to the Elite League speedway team the Coventry Bees.</p>
