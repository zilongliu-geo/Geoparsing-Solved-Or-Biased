<p>Jackson is the capital of and the largest city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. It is located primarily in <span class="loc">Hinds County</span>, serving as one of two county seats there; segments of the city overlap <span class="loc">Madison County</span> and <span class="loc">Rankin County</span>. Jackson is on the <span class="loc">Pearl River</span>, which drains into the <span class="loc">Gulf of Mexico</span>, and it is part of the <span class="loc">Jackson Prairie</span> region of the state. The city is named after General Andrew Jackson, who was honored for his role in the Battle of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> during the War of 1812 and later served as <span class="loc">U.S.</span> President. The current slogan for the city is "Jackson, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>: City with Soul." It has had numerous musicians prominent in blues, gospel and jazz, and was known for decades for its illegal nightclubs on the <span class="loc">Gold Coast</span>; one site has been designated for the Mississippi Blues Trail. The city is the anchor for the metro area. While its population declined from 184,256 at the 2000 census to 173,514 at the 2010 census, the metropolitan region grew. The 2010 census ascribed a population of 539,057 to the five-county <span class="loc">Jackson metropolitan</span> area.</p>
