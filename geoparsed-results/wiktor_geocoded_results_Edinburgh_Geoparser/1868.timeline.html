  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Flora is a municipality in Sogn og <span class="loc">Fjordane county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. It is located in the traditional <span class="loc">district of Sunnfjord</span>. The administrative centre is the town of Florø, which was founded in <span class="date">1860</span>, has 8,642 inhabitants (<span class="date">2012</span>). The Eikefjord area, which is the second largest settlement in Flora, has about 1000 inhabitants. Other village areas in the municipality include Rognaldsvåg, <span class="loc">Stavang</span>, <span class="loc">Grov</span>, <span class="loc">Norddalsfjord</span>, <span class="loc">Nyttingnes</span>, Steinhovden, and Brandsøy. The municipality stretches from inner fjords where the mountains ascend to the Ålfotbreen glacier, to the outermost islands off the mainland coast. The town is <span class="date">today</span> both a charming little community, and at the same time a town with busy industries that are developing continuously. Trade and industry in Flora is mainly fishing industry, shipyards, and supply for the oil and gas industry in the <span class="loc">North Sea</span>. The municipality is named after the farm Flora (Old Norse Flóra) since the town of Florø was built on its ground in <span class="date">1860</span>. The name is probably derived from a Germanic root meaning “flat” or “even” (cf. English floor). Flora itself is the accusative/dative case form of “Flore” (Old Norse Flóri), from which the names Florø and Florelandet are derived. A common misunderstanding is that the name Florø is the Danish word ø (“island”) suffixed to Flora. Although not true, it almost lead to the town being renamed “Florøy” in <span class="date">the 1930s</span>.</p><br><br>
