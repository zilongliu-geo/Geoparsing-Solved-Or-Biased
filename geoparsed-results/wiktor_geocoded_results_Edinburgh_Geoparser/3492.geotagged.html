<p>Clinton is a town in and the parish seat of <span class="loc">East Feliciana Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town was named for New York Governor DeWitt Clinton. The population was 1,653 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 1824, when <span class="loc">Feliciana Parish</span> was split into East and West, Clinton became the seat of <span class="loc">East Feliciana Parish</span>'s government, replacing the town of Jackson in this capacity. Several military engagements occurred during the American Civil War which involved Clinton. Union General Benjamin Grierson occupied Clinton on June 7, 1863, one month before the fall of <span class="loc">Vicksburg</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. Grierson found the town deserted, as Confederates had withdrawn ten miles to the north. According to the historian John D. Winters in The Civil War in <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> (1863), the Union "burned a railroad depot, a warehouse containing several hundred hides, a small supply of corn, a machine shop, a locomotive, a crude woolen mill, a cartridge factory, a supply of ammunition, and several barrels of <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> rum."</p>
