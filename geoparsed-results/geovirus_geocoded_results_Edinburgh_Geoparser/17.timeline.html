  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>"Prudent precautionary planning is under way across all elements of the response, including the health service, other essential services and local authorities," said a Home Office spokesman. However; at the moment, the virus only infects humans who have been in close or direct contact with infected poultry. The <span class="loc">U.K.</span> also reports that it has stockpiled at least 14.6 million doses of anti-viral medication. The report cautions that vaccines against the virus "will not be available in the first wave of a pandemic" and that the vaccines would not be a "silver bullet." It also states that the local officials are prepared to handle only 48,000 deaths in <span class="loc">Wales</span> and in <span class="loc">England</span> for a pandemic lasting <span class="date">15 weeks</span>, however; the reports states further that, "even with ramping local management capacity by 100%, the prudent worst case of 320,000 deaths is projected to lead to a delay of some <span class="date">17 weeks</span> from death to burial or cremation."</p><br><br>
