<p><span class="loc">Clifton</span> is the largest city in <span class="loc">Bosque County</span>, located in central <span class="loc">Texas</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city's population was 3,442 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Clifton</span> is located at 31°46′49″N 97°34′51″W (31.780275, -97.580825). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.9 square miles (4.9 km2), all land. The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, <span class="loc">Clifton</span> has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps. <span class="loc">Clifton</span> and <span class="loc">Bosque County</span> are currently listed as part of the Dallas-Fort Worth DMA. However, <span class="loc">Bosque County</span> is a neighboring county of the <span class="loc">Waco</span> metropolitan area, meaning that all of the <span class="loc">Waco</span>/Temple/Killeen market stations also provide coverage for <span class="loc">Clifton</span> and <span class="loc">Bosque County</span>. The <span class="loc">Clifton</span> Record is the local newspaper. <span class="loc">Clifton</span> was founded in the winter of 1852-1853, when the families of Frank Kell, Joseph A. Kemp, Samuel and Monroe Locker, and T. A. McSpadden settled in the vicinity. The town was named Cliff Town after the surrounding limestone cliffs. Over the years the name was altered to <span class="loc">Clifton</span>. The site was originally on the banks of Clear Branch. The Masonic lodge hall and a log schoolhouse were the first public buildings. The post office was established in 1859. The First Presbyterian Church of <span class="loc">Clifton</span> was organized in 1861 and is the oldest church in continuous service in the county. The Baptists built the first church building in <span class="loc">Clifton</span> in 1884-85. After the Civil War, Joel Martin Stinnett (1806-1875), the grandfather of Joseph Kemp, built a flour mill powered by the <span class="loc">Bosque River</span>. In 1868, this mill was replaced by a limestone mill, which was eventually converted to the electric power plant that provided the first electricity for <span class="loc">Clifton</span> homes and businesses. A three-story school known as Rock School was built about 1870 and served the community for more than twenty years. In 1893, a new building was constructed on property donated to the <span class="loc">Clifton</span> school system.</p>
