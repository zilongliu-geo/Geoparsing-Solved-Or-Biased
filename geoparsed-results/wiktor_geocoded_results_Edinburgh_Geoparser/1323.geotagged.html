<p><span class="loc">Hun</span> or Houn /ˈhuːn/ (Arabic: هون‎ Hūn) is an oasis town in the <span class="loc">northern Fezzan region</span> of southwest <span class="loc">Libya</span>. The town is the capital of the <span class="loc">Jufra District</span>. <span class="loc">Hun</span> is about halfway between <span class="loc">Sabha</span> and the Mediterranean coast in the <span class="loc">Sahara Desert</span>. The modern <span class="loc">city of Hun</span> is 150 years old. The natural landscape around <span class="loc">Hun</span> mainly consists of black basalt mountains, with extensive sand dunes, and date palm trees - Phoenix dactylifera groves indicating oases. The <span class="loc">cities of Waddan and Sokna</span> are the nearest settlements. There is a ruined ksar and several mosques in the <span class="loc">city of Waddan</span>.

In this part of the desert, summer daytime temperatures are a bit moderated due to the influence of the cooler offshore winds from the <span class="loc">Mediterranean Sea</span>, although averages high temperatures consistently exceed 40 °C (104 °F) during the hottest months of the year. <span class="loc">Hun</span> is said to bake in bright sunshine during 85 % of the daylight hours. <span class="loc">Hun</span> is located in one of the sunniest and driest regions in the world.</p>
