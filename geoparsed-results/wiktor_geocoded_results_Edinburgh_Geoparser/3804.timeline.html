  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Bethany is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is situated north of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 26 near <span class="loc">Beaverton</span>, about four miles northwest of Cedar Mill, and is within the <span class="loc">Portland</span> metropolitan area. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, the community had 20,646 residents. Fire protection and EMS services are provided through Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue. The name Bethany was first applied to a crossroads trading center about two miles northeast of the current location, where a Presbyterian church stands <span class="date">today</span>. The area was first settled by Ulrich Gerber, who came from <span class="loc">Switzerland</span> in the mid-1870s. <span class="loc">Gerber</span> helped establish the first post office in the area in <span class="date">1878</span>, about a mile east of the current <span class="org">Bethany School</span>, and suggested the name Bethany. "Bethany" is a Hebrew word, originally applied to a place in <span class="loc">Palestine</span> near <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>, and used as a place name all over the <span class="loc">United States</span>, especially in connection with a church. The post office was discontinued in <span class="date">1904</span>. The area's first public library was opened in <span class="date">July 2007</span> by a non-profit organization named the Cedar Mill Community Library Association, which has operated a library in nearby Cedar Mill since <span class="date">1976</span>. It is considered a branch of that library and is named the Cedar Mill Community Library @ Bethany. The area became a census-designated place after the <span class="date">2010</span> Census.</p><br><br>
