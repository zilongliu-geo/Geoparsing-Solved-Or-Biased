  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Magdalena</span> is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Laguna</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 22,976 people. <span class="per">Magdalena</span> is politically subdivided into 24 barangays. <span class="per">Magdalena</span> was formerly a barrio of <span class="loc">Majayjay</span>, <span class="loc">Laguna</span>. A petition from the residents of the barrio for the creation of a new town was presented on <span class="date">September 15, 1819</span>. It was proclaimed a new town by <span class="per">Governor General Don Mariano</span> Fern√°ndez de <span class="loc">Folgueras</span> on <span class="date">January 18, 1820</span>, and was originally named "<span class="per">Magdalena de Ambling</span>". The name was derived from its patron saint <span class="loc">Maria Magdalena</span> and the barrio of Ambling where it was established. The first <span class="loc">Teniente Alcalde</span> or <span class="loc">Capitan</span> (the highest political authority in a town) was <span class="per">Don Mauricio</span> <span class="loc">San Mateo</span>. They first established a makeshift school in <span class="date">1820</span>, which was the very first requirement for it to be a town. The municipal hall was also constructed. A small chapel was also constructed and it gave way to the construction of a church in <span class="date">1829</span>. The church was made of stones and bricks and donations were solicited from the residents. The construction was finished in <span class="date">1861</span>. The construction of the concrete town hall and the church convent started in <span class="date">1871</span>, and was finished in <span class="date">1884</span>.</p><br><br>
