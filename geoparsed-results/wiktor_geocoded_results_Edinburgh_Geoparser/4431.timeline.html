  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Aston</span> is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">East Hertfordshire district</span> of <span class="loc">Hertfordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. According to the <span class="date">2001</span> census it had a population of 844. Located in <span class="loc">Hertfordshire</span> on a ridge between the new-town of <span class="loc">Stevenage</span> and the <span class="loc">Beane Valley</span>, the village of <span class="per">Aston</span> is just 10 minutes drive from the A1(M). A mile north of <span class="loc">Aston</span> lies <span class="loc">Aston End</span>, a hamlet which has strong social and geophysical ties with the village. Hooks Cross, another hamlet in the Parish, straddles the A602, <span class="loc">Stevenage</span> to <span class="loc">Hertford</span> road. <span class="per">Aston</span> is known locally for its conviviality and, despite its modest size, boasts a great many clubs, societies and interest groups as well as hosting a very successful annual school fete. During the reign of Edward the Confessor (<span class="date">1024</span>â€“66), the manor (i.e. the land) of "Estone" was held by three vassals of Stigend, <span class="per">Archbishop of Canterbury</span>. Their names are not known but some land is recorded as that of <span class="loc">Wulf</span> the Dane. By the time Domesday Book was completed (<span class="date">1086</span>), the small community of Estone, <span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Aston</span>, was made up of about twenty-five families and included a priest. So it seems that there was a church at that time and it was almost certainly on the site of the present <span class="per">Aston St Mary</span>'s.</p><br><br>
