  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The town of <span class="loc">Palmerston</span>, in <span class="loc">New</span> <span class="loc">Zealand</span>'s <span class="loc">South Island</span>, lies 50 kilometres to the north of the <span class="loc">city of Dunedin</span>. It is the largest town in the <span class="loc">Waihemo Ward</span> of the <span class="loc">Waitaki District</span>, with a population of 890 residents. <span class="loc">Palmerston</span> grew at a major road junction: State Highway 1 links <span class="loc">Dunedin</span> and <span class="loc">Waikouaiti</span> to the south with <span class="loc">Oamaru</span> and <span class="loc">Christchurch</span> to the north, while State Highway 85 (known colloquially as "The <span class="loc">Pigroot</span>") heads inland to become the principal highway of the <span class="loc">Maniototo</span>. The Main South Line railway passes through the town and the Seasider tourist train travels from <span class="loc">Dunedin</span> to <span class="loc">Palmerston</span> and back once or twice <span class="date">a week</span>. From <span class="date">1880</span> until <span class="date">1989</span>, the town acted as the junction between the main line and a branch line that ran inland, the <span class="loc">Dunback</span> and Makareao Branches. <span class="loc">Palmerston</span> stands near the banks of the <span class="loc">Shag River</span>, five kilometres inland from the Pacific coast. Between it and the sea stands the lone hill of <span class="loc">Puketapu</span> (Maori for sacred hill, known by Southerners as Holy Hill), crowned with a monument to the 19th century Otago politician Sir <span class="per">John McKenzie</span>. An annual race takes place up to the memorial and back, which is called the <span class="per">Kelly</span>'s canter, dedicated to <span class="per">Albert Kelly</span> who ran up <span class="loc">Puketapu</span> as a constable in the <span class="loc">Palmerston</span> police force every day during World War II.</p><br><br>
