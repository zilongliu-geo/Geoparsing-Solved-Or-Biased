  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Scandal-plagued Ga. pastor to be buried <span class="date">Saturday</span>. <span class="loc">ATLANTA</span> - A former mega church leader who rose to fame with his progressive evangelical ministry only to have it crumble after a series of sex scandals will be honored in the church he helped build in suburban <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>. <span class="per">Archbishop Earl Paulk</span> of <span class="org">the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit</span> at Chapel Hill Harvester Church died <span class="date">Sunday</span> after a battle with cancer. He was 81. A funeral is scheduled for <span class="date">1 p.m. Saturday</span> at the Cathedral in <span class="loc">Decatur</span>. For <span class="date">years</span> the church was at the forefront of many social movements - admitting black members in <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, ordaining women and opening its doors to gays. But <span class="per">Paulk</span> was dogged for <span class="date">decades</span> by accusations of molestation and sexual misconduct. The most shocking revelation came in <span class="date">October 2007</span> when a court-ordered paternity test showed he was the biological father of his brother's son, <span class="per">D.E. Paulk</span>, who had become head pastor of the church after the archbishop retired <span class="date">the previous year</span>. <span class="per">Earl Paulk</span> had sworn in an affidavit he'd never had sex with anyone but his wife, which lead to him pleading guilty to a felony charge of lying under oath. He was sentenced to <span class="date">10 years</span>' probation and a $1,000 fine. None of the Paulks could be reached for comment by The Associated Press, but <span class="per">D.E. Paulk</span> issued a statement. "Over <span class="date">the past 55 years</span>, <span class="per">Bishop Paulk</span> has ministered to thousands in the Atlanta area and touched the lives of countless thousands in the global community," he wrote. "As the family and church mourn his death and celebrate his life, we pray for peace and closure for all who have been connected in any way to his life and ministry." <span class="per">Paulk</span>'s church, which he co-founded with his brother, <span class="per">Don</span>, grew from a tiny congregation in <span class="date">the 1960s</span> to a massive empire with 10,000 members, an international television ministry, a Bible college and a $12 million sanctuary on an expansive 100-acre plot in <span class="loc">Decatur</span>. <span class="per">Paulk</span> was invited to a White House prayer breakfast by then-President <span class="per">Ronald Reagan</span>, and the church was named one of former President <span class="per">George Bush</span>'s "1,000 <span class="org">Points of Light</span>." The church made national headlines in <span class="date">1992</span> when six female members came forward saying they were brainwashed into having sexual relationships with <span class="per">Earl Paulk</span> and <span class="per">Don Paulk</span> and other ministers at the church. <span class="date">A decade later</span>, a former church member accused <span class="per">Earl Paulk</span> of molesting her when she was a child and teenager, a lawsuit that eventually was settled out of court. Then former church employee <span class="per">Mona Brewer</span> sued <span class="per">Earl Paulk</span> and the church, saying she had been coerced into having a long-term affair with the pastor because he told her it was her godly duty. It was her lawsuit that led to the paternity test and the felony charge. At the same time, <span class="per">Earl Paulk</span> was battling prostate cancer and undergoing multiple surgeries that left him weak and unable to make much more than one appearance at the church each week. The church's membership dwindled to 1,000 - mostly due to the sexual scandals - and the flashy neo-Gothic cathedral is up for sale for $24.5 million. The church is seeking to move to a smaller venue and continue its ministry, <span class="per">D.E. Paulk</span> has said. <span class="per">Don Paulk</span> told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he hopes his brother will be remembered for his work in ministry rather than the scandals. "Preachers are just like anyone else - they're a man," he told the newspaper.</p><br><br>
