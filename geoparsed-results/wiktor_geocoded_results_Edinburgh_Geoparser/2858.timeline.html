  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dora</span> (also al-Dura, or ad-Durah, Arabic,الدورة) is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Al Rashid</span> administrative district, <span class="loc">southern Baghdad</span>, <span class="loc">Iraq</span>. Although this was a majority Assyrian Christian neighborhood, it became controlled by Sunni Muslim Extremists during the <span class="org">Iraq War</span>. They started ethnic cleansing of the neighborhood in <span class="date">2006</span>-<span class="date">2007</span>, driving out or forcing conversions and confiscating or attacking property. Hundreds of Christian, <span class="per">Shia</span> and <span class="per">Mandeans</span> families have fled since <span class="date">late 2006</span> due to de facto Islamist Sunni control of the area. It became an al-Qaeda stronghold as affiliated foreign Islamic fighters entered the country after <span class="date">2004</span>. <span class="loc">United States</span> soldiers once called it "the most dangerous place in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>" until they were driven out. In the early <span class="date">morning of March 19, 2003</span>, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> forces initiated the invasion of <span class="loc">Iraq</span> by attacking a "buried command post" believed to be occupied by <span class="per">Saddam Hussein</span> and his sons <span class="per">Uday</span> and <span class="per">Qusay</span>. In fact, the target did not exist; the strike on a disused above-ground regime leadership compound killed one civilian and injured fourteen others, including one child. (see <span class="loc">Dora</span> Farms strike)</p><br><br>
