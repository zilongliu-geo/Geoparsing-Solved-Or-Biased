<p>Wellington is a village in <span class="loc">Lorain County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,802 at the 2010 census. Wellington was settled in 1818 by Ephraim Wilcox, Charles Sweet, William T. Welling, John Clifford, and Joseph Wilson from the states of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span>. It was originally named <span class="loc">Charlemont</span> by Charles Sweet who, after winning a tree chopping contest, was given the right to name the township. It was later changed to Wellington by the townspeople in honor of one of the founders, William Welling and "<span class="loc">Iron Duke</span>," the Duke of Wellington. Wellington was incorporated as a village in 1855. In 1858, the former American House Hotel (later torn down and replaced by Herrick Memorial Library) was the site of the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue. A group of men, both white and black and many from <span class="loc">Oberlin</span>, swarmed the hotel to rescue runaway slave John Price. He was being held by a <span class="loc">US</span> Marshal and his men, who intended to return him to his master in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The abolitionists transported Price out of town en route to the Underground Railroad and helped convey him to <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Thirty-seven men were indicted, but only two, Simeon M. Bushnell and Charles Henry Langston, were tried in federal court for interfering with the marshal in carrying out the Fugitive Slave Law. After Langston's eloquent speech about slavery and discrimination, the judge gave them light sentences. The events and trial received national attention, and kept the issue of slavery at the forefront of debate.</p>
