<p>Allen is an affluent city in <span class="loc">Collin County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, a northern suburb of Dallas. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city had a total population of 84,246. The Allen area was previously home to the <span class="loc">Caddo</span>, <span class="loc">Comanche</span>, and other indigenous peoples. The first immigrants from the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Europe</span> arrived in the early 1840s. The town was established by the <span class="loc">Houston</span> and Central <span class="loc">Texas</span> Railroad and named in 1872 for Ebenezer Allen, a state politician and railroad promoter. The railroad allowed sale of crops across the country before they rotted, causing a shift from the previous cattle-based agriculture. On February 22, 1878, a gang led by Sam Bass committed in Allen what is said to be <span class="loc">Texas</span>'s first train robbery. From 1908 through 1948, Allen was a stop along the Texas Traction Company's interurban line from <span class="loc">Denison</span> to Dallas. Allen was a small town of a few hundred residents when it was incorporated in 1953. Since this time, it has grown dramatically due to the construction of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 75, the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and the development of nearby Dallas and Plano.</p>
