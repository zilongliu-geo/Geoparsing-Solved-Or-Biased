<p><span class="loc">United States</span> and Vietnamese officials began meetings in <span class="loc">Hanoi</span> on Tuesday to discuss further funding to help victims still suffering from exposure to the chemical Agent Orange. Officials in <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> are requesting more funding from the <span class="loc">US</span> in order to clean up the Da Nang International Airport, a major "hot spot" for Agent Orange. Vietnamese Vice Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Nguyen Cong claimed that "the committed funds from the <span class="loc">US</span> government have not been disbursed." The Vietnamese government claims it will cost US$58 million to clean up the <span class="loc">Da Nang</span> airport and two other contaminated locations. The <span class="loc">US</span> has so far pledged $8 million. Agent Orange was used during the <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> war in order to defoliate the dense <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> jungle. Vietnamese officials say that up to three million Vietnamese suffer from exposure to it today. The chemical has been linked to dangerous diseases such as diabetes, cancer and birth defects.</p>
