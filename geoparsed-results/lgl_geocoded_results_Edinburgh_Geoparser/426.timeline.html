Susan Vela svela@lsj.com <span class="date">March 24, 2009</span> From <span class="loc">Lansing</span> State Journal The <span class="loc">Lansing City</span> Council will host several public hearings to consider the mayor's proposed $117.3 million general fund budget for 2009-10. A schedule was not available <span class="date">Monday</span>. The $5.5 million gap between projected revenues and expenses, Finance Director <span class="per">Jerry Ambrose</span> said, could be shrunk in this fashion: $1.853 million by eliminating 40 positions. $1.377 million by moving money once set aside for debt payment to the operating fund. $1 million by reducing the prefunding for retiree health care. $500,000 from fines for a new motor carrier weight enforcement program. $412,000 from increased ambulance service fees paid for by insurance companies. $350,000 from grant funding for law enforcers. $25,000 in 54-A District Court reimbursements.
