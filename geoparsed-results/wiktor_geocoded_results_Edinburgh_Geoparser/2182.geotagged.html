<p><span class="loc">Hebei</span> (Chinese: 河北; pinyin:  Héběi; postal: <span class="loc">Hopeh</span>) is a <span class="loc">province of China</span> in the <span class="loc">North China region</span>. Its one-character abbreviation is "冀" (jì), named after <span class="loc">Ji Province</span>, a Han Dynasty province (zhou) that included what is now southern <span class="loc">Hebei</span>. The name <span class="loc">Hebei</span> means "north of the river", referring to its location entirely to the north of the <span class="loc">Yellow River</span>. <span class="loc">Hebei</span> was formed in 1928 after the central government dissolved the <span class="loc">province of Chihli</span> (直隸), which means "Directly Ruled (by the Imperial Court)". Beijing and Tianjin Municipalities, which border each other, were carved out of <span class="loc">Hebei</span>. The province borders Liaoning to the northeast, <span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Shanxi</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Henan</span> to the south, and <span class="loc">Shandong</span> to the southeast. <span class="loc">Bohai</span> Bay of the <span class="loc">Yellow Sea</span> is to the east. A small part of <span class="loc">Hebei</span>, Sanhe Exclave, consisting of <span class="loc">Sanhe</span>, <span class="loc">Dachang</span> <span class="loc">Hui</span> <span class="loc">Autonomous County</span>, and <span class="loc">Xianghe County</span>, an exclave disjointed from the rest of the province, is wedged between the municipalities of <span class="loc">Beijing</span> and <span class="loc">Tianjin</span>.</p>
