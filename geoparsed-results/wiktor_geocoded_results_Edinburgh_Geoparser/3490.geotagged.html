<p>Clinton is a city in <span class="loc">Vermillion County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,893 at the 2010 census. The city was established in 1829 and is named after DeWitt Clinton, who served as governor of <span class="loc">New York</span> from 1817 to 1823. Many of Clinton's original settlers were immigrants working in coal mines. Most of the immigrants were Italians trying to earn a living coal mining. According to <span class="loc">Vermillion County</span> naturalization records, "...from 1856 to 1952... <span class="loc">Vermillion County</span> received almost 3,550 new citizens of foreign birth, the largest number coming during the first twelve years of [the 20th] century. Italians accounted for one-third, or 1,178, of the total number who filed Declarations, with Austrians the next largest group (675) and then Scots. At least 77 percent of the Italians were from the northern regions of <span class="loc">Italy</span>." This was in contrast to the majority of Italian immigrants to <span class="loc">America</span> during this same time period that hailed from southern <span class="loc">Italy</span>. Over time, the coal mining industry in Clinton died down but many of the Italian settlers stayed at Clinton.</p>
