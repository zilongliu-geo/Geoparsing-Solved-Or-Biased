<p>Urdaneta (<span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>: Ciudad na Urdaneta; <span class="loc">Ilocano</span>: Ciudad ti Urdaneta) is a second class city in the <span class="loc">province of Pangasinan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 125,451 people, with a land area of 12,100 hectares. Gateway to Northern <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, the city's strategic location is on the central part of eastern <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>. The first settlers of the area were Pangasinenses, followed by a migration of Ilocanos who settled in outlying areas. These settlers petitioned the Spanish government to allow them to form a separate pueblo for greater ties and stronger unity. Their petition was granted and Urdaneta was formally founded as a pueblo on January 8, 1858. There is uncertainty if it was named after Andr√©s de Urdaneta, Miguel de Urdaneta, or Simon de Urdaneta. Urdaneta became a city through Republic Act 8480, otherwise known as "An Act Converting the Municipality of <span class="loc">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="loc">Province of Pangasinan</span> into a Component City to be known as the <span class="loc">City of Urdaneta</span>". This was signed on January 10, 1998 and was voted affirmatively by the people of <span class="loc">Urdaneta City</span> on March 21, 1998.</p>
