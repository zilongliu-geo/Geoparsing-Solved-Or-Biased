<p><span class="loc">Argentina</span> (/ˌɑːrdʒənˈtiːnə/; Spanish: [aɾxenˈtina]), officially the <span class="loc">Argentine Republic</span> (Spanish: República <span class="loc">Argentina</span>), is a federal republic located in southeastern <span class="loc">South America</span>. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbour <span class="loc">Chile</span>, it is bordered by <span class="loc">Bolivia</span> and <span class="loc">Paraguay</span> to the north; <span class="loc">Brazil</span> to the northeast; <span class="loc">Uruguay</span> and the <span class="loc">South Atlantic Ocean</span> to the east; <span class="loc">Chile</span> to the west and the <span class="loc">Drake Passage</span> to the south. With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,500 sq mi), <span class="loc">Argentina</span> is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second-largest in Latin <span class="loc">America</span>, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. <span class="loc">Argentina</span> claims sovereignty over part of <span class="loc">Antarctica</span>, the <span class="loc">Falkland Islands</span> (Spanish: <span class="loc">Islas Malvinas</span>), <span class="loc">South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands</span>. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (Spanish: provincias, singular provincia) and one autonomous city (ciudad autónoma), <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, which is the federal capital of the nation (Spanish: <span class="loc">Capital Federal</span>) as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system.</p>
