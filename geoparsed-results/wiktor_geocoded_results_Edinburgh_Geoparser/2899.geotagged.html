<p><span class="loc">Madison County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 73,442. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Wampsville. The county is named after James Madison, fourth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>, and was first formed in 1806. <span class="loc">Madison County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Syracuse</span>, <span class="loc">NY</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. Indigenous peoples had occupied areas around <span class="loc">Oneida</span> Lake for thousands of years. The historic <span class="loc">Oneida</span> Nation is an Iroquoian-speaking people who emerged as a culture in this area about the fourteenth century and dominated the territory. They are one of the Five Nations who originally comprised the Iroquois Confederacy or Haudenosaunee. English colonists established counties in eastern present-day <span class="loc">New York</span> State in 1683; at the time, the territory of the present <span class="loc">Madison County</span> was considered part of <span class="loc">Albany County</span>, with the <span class="loc">city of Albany</span> located on the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of <span class="loc">New York</span> State around <span class="loc">Albany</span> as well as all of the present State of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> and, in theory, extending westward to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. It was claimed by the English but largely occupied by the <span class="loc">Oneida</span>, <span class="loc">Onondaga</span>, <span class="loc">Seneca</span>, <span class="loc">Cayuga</span> and <span class="loc">Mohawk</span>, who had the territory in the central <span class="loc">Mohawk</span> Valley, as well as Mahican near the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>. On July 3, 1766 the English organized <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, and on March 16, 1770 they organized <span class="loc">Gloucester County</span>, both containing territory now included in the state of <span class="loc">Vermont</span>.</p>
