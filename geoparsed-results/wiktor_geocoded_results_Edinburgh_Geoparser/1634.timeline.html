  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Roshchino</span> (Russian: Ро́щино; Finnish: <span class="loc">Raivola</span>), <span class="loc">Raivola</span> before <span class="date">1948</span>, is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) in <span class="loc">Vyborgsky District</span> of <span class="loc">Leningrad Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, and a station on the Saint Petersburg-Vyborg railroad. It is situated on the <span class="loc">Karelian Isthmus</span> 60 kilometers (37 mi) northwest of St. Petersburg, approximately halfway to <span class="loc">Vyborg</span>. Population: 13,439 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census); 9,393 (<span class="date">2002</span> Census); 8,436 (<span class="date">1989</span> Census). In the wooded areas surrounding <span class="loc">Roshchino</span> there are multiple marshes and small lakes. Lintula larch forest is located some 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) to the west from the railroad station. <span class="loc">Raivola</span> was first shown on maps of <span class="loc">Finland</span> in the 16th century. After <span class="date">1812</span> it was under jurisdiction of Grand Duchy of <span class="loc">Finland</span> being part of Russian Empire, a part of the <span class="loc">Viipuri Province</span>. The mixed Russian-Finnish population of the area was engaged in agriculture. Around <span class="date">1802</span> count <span class="loc">Saltykov</span> resettled some 609 of his subjects from Oryol Governorate to the area to meet growing manpower demands for his iron works; in addition to the iron foundry maps of mid-19th century show also sawmill. After the railroad to <span class="loc">Helsinki</span> was opened by czar <span class="per">Alexander II</span> in <span class="date">1870</span>, <span class="loc">Raivola</span> was used for changing of locomotive crews. Establishment of the railroad station turned <span class="loc">Raivola</span> into suburb of St. Petersburg and development of the area continued with construction of <span class="date">summer</span> cottages. By <span class="date">end of the century</span> the population stood around 2,000, of which 169 were Finns. The village had shops, warehouses, two (Finnish and Russian) schools, and Russian Orthodox church of <span class="date">St. Nicholas</span> with library and medical facility. Also hydro-electric power station and telephone station were established. The importance of the local railway station was eclipsed by <span class="loc">Terijoki</span> where Finnish customs depot was established in <span class="date">1911</span></p><br><br>
