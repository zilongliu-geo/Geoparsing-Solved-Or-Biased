<p><span class="loc">Bedford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is within the Greater Boston area, 15 miles (24 km) north-west of the <span class="loc">city of Boston</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Bedford</span> was 13,320 at the 2010 census. The following compilation comes from Ellen Abrams (1999) based on information from Abram English Brown’s History of the Town of <span class="loc">Bedford</span> (1891), as well as other sources such as The Bedford Sampler Bicentennial Edition containing Daisy Pickman Oakley’s articles, Bedford Vital Records, New <span class="loc">England</span> Historical and Genealogical Register, Town Directories, and other publications from the Bedford Historical Society. The land now within the boundaries of <span class="loc">Bedford</span> was first settled by Europeans around 1640. In 1729 it was incorporated from a portion of Concord (about 3/5 of <span class="loc">Bedford</span>) and a portion of <span class="loc">Billerica</span> (about 2/5 of <span class="loc">Bedford</span>). In 1630 came the arrival of John Winthrop and Thomas Dudley of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Bay Company. Aboard the Arabella from <span class="loc">Yarmouth</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">Winthrop</span> and Dudley sailed, and after a difficult ten-week voyage, they landed on the shores of the <span class="loc">New World</span>, with <span class="loc">Salem</span> and <span class="loc">Boston Harbor</span> being the Arabella's earliest destinations. In 1637, the General Court of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> granted some 2,200 acres (9 km²) of land, including <span class="loc">Huckins</span> Farm land to the first Governor, John Winthrop, and to Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley. The following year, the two men agreed to divide the land so that the parcel south of the two large boulders by the Concord River (<span class="loc">Brothers Rocks</span>) belonged to Governor Winthrop and north of the Rocks was to belong to Deputy Governor Dudley. Later, Dudley became governor. Dudley’s son Rev. Samuel Dudley and Winthrop’s daughter Mary were married, thus <span class="loc">Brothers Rocks</span> were so named because of this marriage of families.</p>
