  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montserrat</span> (/mɒntsəˈræt/) is a Caribbean island—specifically in the <span class="loc">Leeward Islands</span>, which is part of the chain known as the <span class="loc">Lesser Antilles</span>, in the <span class="loc">British West Indies</span>. It is a British Overseas Territory. <span class="loc">Montserrat</span> measures approximately 16 km (10 mi) long and 11 km (7 mi) wide, with approximately 40 km (25 mi) of coastline. <span class="loc">Montserrat</span> is nicknamed The <span class="loc">Emerald Isle</span> of the Caribbean both for its resemblance to coastal <span class="loc">Ireland</span> and for the Irish ancestry of many of its inhabitants. On <span class="date">18 July 1995</span>, the previously dormant Soufrière Hills volcano, in the southern part of the island, became active. Eruptions destroyed <span class="loc">Montserrat</span>'s Georgian era capital <span class="loc">city of Plymouth</span>. Between <span class="date">1995</span> and <span class="date">2000</span>, two-thirds of the island's population was forced to flee, primarily to the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. The volcanic activity continues, mostly affecting the vicinity of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, including its docking facilities, and the eastern side of the island around the former <span class="per">W. H. Bramble</span> Airport, the remnants of which were buried by flows from volcanic activity on <span class="date">11 February 2010</span>. An exclusion zone that extends from the south coast of the island north to parts of the <span class="loc">Belham</span> Valley was imposed because of the size of the existing volcanic dome and the resulting potential for pyroclastic activity. Visitors are generally not permitted entry into the exclusion zone, but an impressive view of the destruction of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> can be seen from the top of Garibaldi Hill in Isles Bay. Relatively quiet since <span class="date">early 2010</span>, the volcano continues to be closely monitored by the <span class="loc">Montserrat</span> <span class="loc">Volcano Observatory</span>.</p><br><br>
