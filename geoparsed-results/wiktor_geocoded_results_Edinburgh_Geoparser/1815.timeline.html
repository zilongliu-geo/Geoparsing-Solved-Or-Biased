  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jaba</span>' (Arabic: جبع‎) is a Palestinian village in the northern <span class="loc">West Bank</span>, located 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) southwest of the <span class="loc">city of Jenin</span>. According to the <span class="org">Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics</span>, the town had a population of 8,942 in the <span class="date">2007</span> census. The village's name translates as "hill" and it is situated on the slopes of the Jabal Dabrun mountain. The village and its immediate vicinity contain a number of archaeological sites, including a tomb for a certain Neby Yarub. During the Ottoman era, <span class="loc">Jaba</span>' served as a throne village of the powerful Jarrar clan. The town is administered by a municipal council, currently headed by Bassam Jarrar. The village's name <span class="loc">Jaba</span>' is the word for "hill". Biblical scholars <span class="per">Edward Robinson</span> and <span class="per">Eli Smith</span> believed that the village's name made it "decidedly another ancient <span class="loc">Geba</span> or <span class="loc">Gibeah</span>", but they were not aware of the existence of an ancient village with either of those names in Jaba's vicinity. A possibility, they noted, was that <span class="loc">Jaba</span>' was the "Gabe", mentioned by the Byzantine historian Jerome, that was located 16 Roman miles from the coastal <span class="loc">city of Caesarea</span>.</p><br><br>
