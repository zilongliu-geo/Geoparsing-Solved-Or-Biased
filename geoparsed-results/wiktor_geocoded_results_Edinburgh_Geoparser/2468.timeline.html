  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Liverpool</span> is a suburb and major centre in the metropolitan area of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located in Greater Western <span class="loc">Sydney</span> 32 kilometres (20 mi) south-west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district. <span class="per">Liverpool</span> is the administrative seat of the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Liverpool</span>. <span class="per">Liverpool</span> is one of the oldest urban settlements in <span class="loc">Australia</span>, founded on <span class="date">7 November 1810</span>  as an agricultural centre by Governor <span class="per">Lachlan Macquarie</span>. He named it after <span class="per">Robert Banks Jenkinson</span>, <span class="per">Earl of Liverpool</span>, who was then <span class="org">the Secretary of State</span> for the Colonies and the British <span class="loc">city of Liverpool</span>, upon which some of the area's architecture is based. <span class="per">Liverpool</span> is at the head of navigation of the <span class="loc">Georges River</span> and combined with the Great Southern Railway from <span class="loc">Sydney</span> to <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> reaching <span class="per">Liverpool</span> in the late 1850s, <span class="per">Liverpool</span> became a major agricultural and transportation centre as the land in the district was very productive. Until <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, <span class="per">Liverpool</span> was still a satellite town with an agricultural economy based on poultry farming and market gardening. However the tidal surge of urban sprawl which engulfed the rich flatlands west of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> known as the <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> Plain soon reached <span class="per">Liverpool</span>, and it became an outer suburb of metropolitan <span class="loc">Sydney</span> with a strong working-class presence and manufacturing facilities. The <span class="per">Liverpool</span> area also became renowned for its vast Housing Commission estates housing thousands of low-income families after the slum clearance and urban renewal programs in inner-city <span class="loc">Sydney</span> in <span class="date">the 1960s</span>.</p><br><br>
