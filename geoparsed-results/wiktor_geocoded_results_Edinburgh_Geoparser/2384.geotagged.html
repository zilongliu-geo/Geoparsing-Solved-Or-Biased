<p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Montcalm County</span> of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 8,481 at the 2010 census. Greenville residents can commute to jobs in the nearby <span class="loc">Grand Rapids</span> metro area. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> is named after its founder, John Green, who settled in the wilderness of the southwest part of the <span class="loc">Montcalm County</span> in 1844. John Green constructed a sawmill on the <span class="loc">Flat River</span> that is credited for attracting other settlers. The newly formed Green's Village attracted many people of Danish origin who followed another early Danish settler's positive letters home regarding the area., Because of the town's heritage, <span class="loc">Greenville</span> celebrates the Danish Festival every year on the third weekend of August. A post office was established on January 20, 1848, with Abel French as the first postmaster. John Green had the village platted in 1853 and it was a station on the <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, <span class="loc">Grand Rapids</span> and Western Railroad. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> incorporated as a village in 1867 and as a city in 1871. Hendrik Meijer, founder of Meijer's stores, moved to <span class="loc">Greenville</span> after immigrating to the <span class="loc">USA</span> from the <span class="loc">Netherlands</span>. He was initially a barber, but the Great Depression and lack of a proper grocery on his side of town led him to open his own store in 1934. Meijer corporation now operates stores throughout the <span class="loc">Midwest</span>. Hendrik's son Fred Meijer, principal architect of the modern Meijer chain, is a native son.</p>
