<p>Henderson, formerly known as <span class="loc">Henderson Island</span>, is an unincorporated community and a U.S. Post Office in <span class="loc">Adams County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Henderson has the ZIP Code 80640. Portions of the Henderson area have been annexed by <span class="loc">Commerce City</span>, <span class="loc">Brighton</span>, and <span class="loc">Thornton</span>. In 1859, John D. "Colonel Jack" Henderson built a ranch, trading post, and hotel on <span class="loc">Henderson Island</span> in the <span class="loc">South Platte River</span> in <span class="loc">Arapahoe County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory. Jack Henderson was the former editor and proprietor of the <span class="loc">Leavenworth</span> (<span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory) Journal and an outspoken Confederate conservative politician who had been accused of voter fraud in eastern <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. Henderson sold meat and provisions to gold seekers on their way up the <span class="loc">South Platte River Trail</span> to the gold fields during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. <span class="loc">Henderson Island</span> was the first permanent settlement in the <span class="loc">South Platte River Valley</span> between Fort <span class="loc">Saint Vrain</span> in the <span class="loc">Nebraska Territory</span> and the Cherry Creek Diggings in the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory. Jack Henderson eventually returned to eastern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and, despite his pro-slavery views, fought for the Union in the American Civil War.</p>
