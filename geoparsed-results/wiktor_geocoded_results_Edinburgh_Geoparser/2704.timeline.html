  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Petersburg</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Menard County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, on the bluffs and part of the floodplain overlooking the <span class="loc">Sangamon River</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,299 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census, and 2,185 at a <span class="date">2009</span> estimate. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Menard County</span>. <span class="loc">Petersburg</span> is located approximately two miles north of <span class="loc">New Salem</span>, the original settlement where <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span> first settled when he came to <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The town began as a planned community organized by real estate speculators <span class="per">Peter Lukins</span> (for whom the town is named) and <span class="per">George Warburton</span>. <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span> worked as the surveyor who first mapped, measured and help to divide lots on the land. <span class="loc">Petersburg</span> quickly grew, due to an advantageous placement on the river, becoming the county seat in the 1830s and eventually drawing off the population of <span class="loc">New Salem</span>, which was abandoned in <span class="date">1840</span>. Many of the lush Victorian-era homes built by early wealthy inhabitants still stand on the bluffs of <span class="loc">Petersburg</span>. The town itself takes great pride in these structures, which has even preserved some of the original cobblestone streets to complement the classical architecture.</p><br><br>
