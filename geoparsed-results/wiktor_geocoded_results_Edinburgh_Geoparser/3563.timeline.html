  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Medford</span> is a township in <span class="loc">Burlington County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the township's population was 23,033, reflecting an increase of 780 (+3.5%) from the 22,253 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 1,727 (+8.4%) from the 20,526 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. <span class="loc">Medford</span> was incorporated as a township by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on <span class="date">March 1, 1847</span>, from portions of Evesham Township, based on the results of a referendum held <span class="date">that day</span>. Portions of the township were taken to form <span class="loc">Shamong</span> Township (<span class="date">February 19, 1852</span>), Lumberton Township (<span class="date">March 14, 1860</span>) and <span class="loc">Medford Lakes</span> (<span class="date">May 17, 1939</span>). The area known as <span class="loc">Medford</span> was sold to Samual Coles in <span class="date">1670</span>, in all it consisted of 900 acres (3.6 kmÂ²). Within <span class="date">the next few years</span> the <span class="loc">Braddock</span>, <span class="loc">Prickett</span>, <span class="loc">Stratton</span>, <span class="loc">Branin</span>, and <span class="loc">Wilkins</span> families moved to the area (many of whom continue to live in the area <span class="date">today</span>). <span class="loc">Upper Evesham</span>, as it was then known, continued to grow from scattered homesteads into a small village. Many of the building and roads built between the sale of the land and the American Revolutionary War are still in existence, which include Oliphant's Mill, Christopher's Mill and the <span class="loc">Shamong</span> Trail (<span class="date">now</span> known as Stokes Road).</p><br><br>
