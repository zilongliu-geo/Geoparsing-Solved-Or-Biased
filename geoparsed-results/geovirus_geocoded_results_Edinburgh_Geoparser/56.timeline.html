  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>At least four people in <span class="loc">Peru</span> have contracted HIV, the virus that causes AIDS after receiving blood transfusions that were infected with the deadly virus. As a result, all of <span class="loc">Peru</span>'s 240 blood banks have been closed pending further investigation and an emergency has been declared by the government. "This situation cannot continue. All of <span class="loc">Peru</span>'s blood banks are being reviewed. We do not want people to panic, what we have to do is be more careful, strengthen our care," said <span class="per">Carlos Vallejos</span>, the Health Minister of <span class="loc">Peru</span>. The country's government made its decision when <span class="per">Judith Rivera</span>, 44 and mother of four children, went public with claims that during an operation, she was infected with HIV when doctors gave her a transfusion. Soon after the government admitted that at least three other individuals, one being an infant child only <span class="date">11 months</span> old, another a 17 year-old boy, contracted the virus through blood transfusions and all received care from the same hospitals. <span class="per">Vallejos</span> also stated that all of the individuals infected will receive whatever care is necessary to treat their conditions.</p><br><br>
