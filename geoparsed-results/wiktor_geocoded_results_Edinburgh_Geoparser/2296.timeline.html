  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Gordon</span> is a small town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, named after settler <span class="per">George Gordon</span>. The town is located on the Old Melbourne Road in the Shire of <span class="loc">Moorabool</span> local government area, 95 kilometres (59 mi) west of the state capital, <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="per">Gordon</span> had a population of 1,219. <span class="per">George Gordon</span> settled the area in <span class="date">1838</span> with a 30,000 acre stock farming run which was known to outsiders as "Gordons". During the Victorian gold rush it prospered due to being at the main road junction to the nearby goldfields of All Nation's Gully and <span class="loc">Mount Egerton</span>. Gold was discovered in the district in <span class="date">1853</span> including around the town itself and several gold mining operations continued extracting in the subsequent <span class="date">decades</span>. The fledgling town had many Irish Australian settlers and those not involved in mining or commerce took up agriculture, notably potato farming. The local Post Office opened on <span class="date">1 July 1858</span> and was known as <span class="per">Gordon</span>'s until <span class="date">1887</span>. At the peak of its boom, the town had as many as eight hotels, with banks and several stores.</p><br><br>
