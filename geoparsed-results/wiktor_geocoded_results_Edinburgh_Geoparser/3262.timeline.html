  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is a suburb in the northern outskirts of Adelaide, <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">City of Playford</span>. <span class="org">Gawler Plains Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">12 July 1850</span> and was renamed <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> in <span class="date">1855</span>. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> has Main North Road as its eastern boundary, with service stations, the historic <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> Hotel and several other businesses and private residences. Anderson Walk is the southern boundary of the original village, which was arranged in a grid with Augusta Square in the centre. West of the older residential area is an industrial zone along the railway line, with <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> railway station on the south side of Anderson Walk. Munno Para Shopping City is on the south side of <span class="loc">Smith Creek</span>. There are more residential areas south and west of the railway station, and an Army Reserve depot west of the shopping centre which is home to the 3rd/9th Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles) and 49 <span class="org">ACU Army Cadets</span>. A 1 mile (1.6 km) speedway track was built in the <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> area in <span class="date">1926</span> by the Motorcycle Club of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. The exact location may have been in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Elizabeth</span> Downs. The <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> Speedway was believed to be the first in the world to be promoted by a motorcycle club. The first meeting was scheduled for <span class="date">Wednesday 13 October 1926</span>, but postponed to <span class="date">Saturday 16 October</span> due to poor weather. The first race meeting was held before the grandstands were built, and the new track generated a lot of dust. The track was on the east side of the Gawler Road, a little south of <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> township, in a paddock of 80 acres (32 ha). It appears to have only operated until about <span class="date">1930</span>.</p><br><br>
