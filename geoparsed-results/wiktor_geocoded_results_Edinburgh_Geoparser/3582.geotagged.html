<p><span class="loc">Tambunan</span> is a valley district covering an area of 1,347 km2. in the Interior Division of the state of <span class="loc">Sabah</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. It is located 80 kilometres east of the state capital, <span class="loc">Kota Kinabalu</span> (to which is connected by the Kota Kinabalu-Tambunan-Keningau Highway, 48 kilometres south of <span class="loc">Ranau</span> and 48 kilometres north of <span class="loc">Keningau</span>. At an average altitude of 750 meters, this valley, which is part of the Crocker Range, experiences a mild tropical climate all year long. The valley is peppered with terraced paddy fields and 70 villages. The dense forests of bamboo around <span class="loc">Tambunan</span> are a legacy of the British colonial period, during which an edict stated that 20 bamboo sprouts had to be planted for every bamboo cut. A census carried out in 2010 by the Department of Statistics estimated the population of <span class="loc">Tambunan</span> at 35,667.  Most residents of <span class="loc">Tambunan</span> are of Dusun descent. There are significant minorities of Malays, Chinese Malaysians and other native Sabahan ethnic groups. The Chinese population in <span class="loc">Tambunan</span> consists primarily of cantonese Si Yap. The Mat Salleh Memorial, located in the middle of paddy fields at Kampung <span class="loc">Tibabar</span> (<span class="loc">Tibabar Village</span>), is a concrete structure erected by the state government in memory of Datu Paduka Mat Salleh. Better known as Mat Salleh, he led a rebellion against the British <span class="loc">North Borneo</span> Company in the late 19th century in response to the locals' dissatisfaction with alleged exploitation by the Company. He was killed in a gun battle with the British police on 1 February 1900. The memorial was erected on the spot where Mat Salleh was killed after <span class="loc">Sabah</span> became part of <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>.</p>
