  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Salina (/səˈlaɪnə/ sə-LY-nə) is a city in <span class="loc">Sevier County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,393 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The first permanent settlers (about 30 families) moved into the area in <span class="date">1864</span> at the direction of leaders of The Church of <span class="per">Jesus Christ</span> of Latter-day Saints. They found abundant salt deposits nearby so they named the area "Salina". In <span class="date">1866</span> troubles with Indians who used the area as their hunting ground (the Black Hawk War (<span class="loc">Utah</span>)) forced the white settlers to retreat to the Manti area. They returned to Salina in <span class="date">1871</span>, organized a militia, and constructed a fort and buildings for a school and a church. At that time they discovered coal deposits in "almost inexhaustible quantities" in the canyon east of the settlement. A creek north of the settlement was tapped to provide water for irrigation, domestic purposes, and to power various enterprises such as sawmills, grist mills, salt refineries and generation of electricity. The <span class="loc">Sevier River</span> was tapped in <span class="date">1874</span>, and by <span class="date">1908</span> the area west of the settlement was being fully cultivated.</p><br><br>
