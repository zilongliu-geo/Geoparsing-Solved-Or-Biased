The county seat is <span class="loc">Arkadelphia</span>. The <span class="loc">Arkadelphia</span>, <span class="loc">AR</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of <span class="loc">Clark County</span>. <span class="loc">Clark County</span> was <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>' third county, formed on December 15, 1818, alongside <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> and <span class="loc">Pulaski</span> counties. The county is named after William Clark who at the time was Governor of the Missouri Territory, which included present-day <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. <span class="loc">Arkadelphia</span> was named as the county seat in 1842. Note: Unlike most <span class="loc">Arkansas counties</span>, <span class="loc">Clark County</span> only has one single township. That township encompasses the entire county. Townships in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> are the divisions of a county. Each township includes unincorporated areas; some may have incorporated cities or towns within part of their boundaries. Arkansas townships have limited purposes in modern times. However, the United States Census does list Arkansas population based on townships (sometimes referred to as "county subdivisions" or "minor civil divisions"). Townships are also of value for historical purposes in terms of genealogical research. Each town or city is within one or more townships in an <span class="loc">Arkansas county</span> based on census maps and publications. The townships of <span class="loc">Clark County</span> are listed below; listed in parentheses are the cities, towns, and/or census-designated places that are fully or partially inside the township.</p>
