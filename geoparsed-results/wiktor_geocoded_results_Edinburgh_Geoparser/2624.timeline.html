  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tempe</span> (/tɛmˈpiː/, <span class="loc">US</span> dict: tem-ˈpē; Oidbaḍ in <span class="loc">Pima</span>), also known as <span class="per">Hayden</span>'s Ferry during the territorial times of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, is a city in <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with the Census Bureau reporting a <span class="date">2010</span> population of 161,719. The city is named after the <span class="loc">Vale of Tempe</span> in <span class="loc">Greece</span>. <span class="loc">Tempe</span> is located in the East Valley section of metropolitan <span class="per">Phoenix</span>; it is bordered by <span class="per">Phoenix</span> and <span class="per">Guadalupe</span> on the west, <span class="loc">Scottsdale</span> on the north, Chandler on the south, and Mesa on the east. <span class="loc">Tempe</span> was the location of <span class="org">US Airways Group</span>'s corporate headquarters until <span class="date">December 9, 2013</span>, when <span class="org">US Airways and American Airlines</span> merged to form American Airlines Group. The headquarters for the combined airline moved to American's headquarters in <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. <span class="loc">Tempe</span> is also the home of <span class="org">Arizona State University</span>. The Hohokam lived in this area and built canals to support their agriculture. They abandoned their settlements during the 15th century, with a few individuals and families remaining nearby. <span class="loc">Fort McDowell</span> was established approximately 25 mi (40 km) northeast of present downtown <span class="loc">Tempe</span> on the upper <span class="loc">Salt River</span> in <span class="date">1865</span> allowing for new towns to be built farther down the <span class="loc">Salt River</span>. <span class="loc">US</span> military service members and Hispanic workers were hired to grow food and animal feed to supply the fort, and less than <span class="date">a year later</span>, had set up small camps near the river that were the first permanent communities in the Valley after the fall of the Hohokam. (<span class="per">Phoenix</span> was settled shortly afterward, by 1867-68.) The two settlements were '<span class="per">Hayden</span>'s Ferry', named after a ferry service operated by <span class="per">Charles T. Hayden</span>, and '<span class="loc">San Pablo</span>', and were located west and east of <span class="loc">Hayden Butte</span> respectively. The ferry became the key river crossing in the area. The Tempe Irrigating Canal Company was soon established by <span class="per">William Kirkland</span> and <span class="per">James McKinney</span> to provide water for alfalfa, wheat, barley, oats, and cotton.</p><br><br>
