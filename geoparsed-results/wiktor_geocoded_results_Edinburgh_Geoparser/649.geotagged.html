<p><span class="loc">Bor</span>, also known as the <span class="loc">City of Bor</span> or Bortown, is the capital of Jonglei State in the Republic of South <span class="loc">Sudan</span>. <span class="loc">Bor</span> is of historical importance to the people of <span class="loc">South Sudan</span>. It was in <span class="loc">Malek</span>, a small settlement about 19 kilometres (12 mi) south of <span class="loc">Bor</span>, that the first modern Christian mission in present-day <span class="loc">South Sudan</span> was established by Archibald Shaw in December 1905. <span class="loc">Bor</span> became the first area to host a Church Missionary Society station in 1905. <span class="loc">Malek</span> was turned into a missionary stronghold in the Upper <span class="loc">Nile Region</span>. Shaw opened the first primary school in <span class="loc">Malek</span>. This school produced the first indigenous Anglican bishop to be consecrated in Dinkaland, Rt. Rev. Daniel Deng Atong, followed the Nikonora Achiek Deng Ariir. John Aruor became the first legend to be baptized in 1916 in <span class="loc">Bor</span>. <span class="loc">Bor</span> became an administrative centre under the Anglo-Egyptian <span class="loc">Sudan</span> (1899â€“1956) for the Dinka people. <span class="loc">Bor</span> is the epicenter of the Second Sudanese Civil War. Dr. John Garang De Mabior, an officer in the Sudanese Army led a revolt in the town of <span class="loc">Bor</span>, in May of 1983, leading to the birth of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement and Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLM/SPLA). <span class="loc">Bor</span> was also the scene of the 1991 <span class="loc">Bor</span> massacre, where approximately 20000 people were killed. Eventually <span class="loc">South Sudan</span> became independent on 9 July 2011.</p>
