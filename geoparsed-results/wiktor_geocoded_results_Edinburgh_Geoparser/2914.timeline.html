  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Buffalo is a city in <span class="loc">Johnson County</span>, <span class="loc">Wyoming</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,585 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Johnson County</span>. In <span class="date">recent years</span>, the town has boomed economically due to methane production from the coal bed methane extraction method used in the Powder River Basin and surrounding areas.Even though energy is a vital part of its economy, agriculture and tourism are two other major components. Buffalo is located at the foot of the Bighorn Mountains, so recreation is a short distance away. Many generational ranchers still run cattle and sheep over the highly productive terrain. The <span class="org">Wyoming Department of Health Veteran's Home</span> of <span class="loc">Wyoming</span>, an assisted living facility for veterans and their dependents, is located in Buffalo. The facility was operated by the <span class="org">Wyoming Board of Charities and Reform</span> until that agency was dissolved as a result of a state constitutional amendment passed in <span class="date">November 1990</span>. Buffalo also has an airport named <span class="loc">Johnson County</span> Airport/KBYG. Public education in the <span class="loc">city of Buffalo</span> is provided by <span class="loc">Johnson County</span> School District #1. Schools serving the city include <span class="org">Meadowlark Elementary School</span> (grades K-2) Cloud Peak Elementary School (grades 3–5), Clear Creek Middle School (grades 6–8), and Buffalo High School (grades 9–12). Buffalo High School was in the national news spot light after the (former) head football coach, distributed an offensive "hurt feelings report" in <span class="date">November 2011</span>. This attention brought several heated school board meetings and eventually lead to the resignation of Lynch as the head football coach.</p><br><br>
