  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 9,487. The county seat is <span class="loc">Mount Ida</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>'s 45th county, formed on <span class="date">December 9, 1842</span>, and named after <span class="per">Richard Montgomery</span>, an American Revolutionary War general. Stone spear and dart points found in the area verify that people from the Dalton Culture were present in <span class="loc">Mongomery County</span> around <span class="date">8500 BC</span>. Early signs of houses and American Indian cemeteries are present in and around <span class="loc">Caddo Gap</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, indicating the definite presence of the Caddo Indians having settled in the area in the 13th century and 14th century. In <span class="date">1541</span>, the explorer <span class="per">Hernando de Soto</span> fought the Tula Indians at <span class="loc">Caddo Gap</span>, and that he was injured during that battle. The first white settlers arrived in <span class="date">1812</span>, when <span class="per">Martin</span> and <span class="per">Mary</span> Collier settled what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Caddo Gap</span>. They befriended the local tribes, and seemingly had no problems from them whatsoever. Granville Whittington arrived in <span class="date">1835</span>, and built a road that led from Hot Springs, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> to his farm about a mile north of the settlement of <span class="per">Montgomery</span>. By <span class="date">1836</span> when <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> received statehood, most of the native Indians were gone. Some of the native Indian women had intermingled and intermarried with local white settlers. <span class="loc">Whittington</span> opened a general store that drew customers from the surrounding area, and in <span class="date">1842</span> he opened the Mount <span class="org">Ida Post Office</span> in <span class="loc">Mount Ida</span>. West of the <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> River, settlers from a wagon train wintered in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Oden</span>, and decided to stay when the weather cleared. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> was named after General <span class="per">Richard Montgomery</span>, an American general who died during the American Revolution.</p><br><br>
