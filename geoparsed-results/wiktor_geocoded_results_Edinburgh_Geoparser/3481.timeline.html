According to its most recent census, Hudson has a population of approximately 3800 people but during the day, this swells to over 11,000 due to those who work in town and those who attend school at <span class="org">Caldwell Community College</span> and other surrounding schools. <span class="org">Google</span> recently located a server facility very close to the town as well. Hudson's landmarks are the "HUB" (the Hudson Uptown Building, the former Hudson Elementary school where locals can gather for special events), the Gold Mine Fine Jewelry &amp; Gifts, the <span class="org">Hudson Library</span>, the <span class="org">Hudson Volunteer Fire Department</span>, the <span class="org">Hudson Post Office</span>, the <span class="org">Hudson Optimist Club</span>, Donna's <span class="loc">Cafe</span>, Vintage Cafe, Yesteryear Antiques and Hudson Primary Care.</p><br><br>
