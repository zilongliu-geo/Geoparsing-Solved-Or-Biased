<p>Walpole is a town in the south-western region of Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, located approximately 430 kilometres (270 mi) south southeast of <span class="loc">Perth</span> and 66 kilometres (41 mi) west of <span class="loc">Denmark</span>. Walpole lies very close to the northern point of the 100-hectare (250-acre) Walpole Inlet, from which it takes its name. The inlet in turn is named for the <span class="loc">Walpole River</span>, discovered in 1831 by Captain Thomas Bannister, and named by Governor Stirling for Captain W. Walpole, with whom he had served aboard HMS Warspite in 1808. The first European settlers to arrive in the area were Pierre Bellanger and his family in 1909. They travelled aboard the Grace Darling from <span class="loc">Albany</span> to take up 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land. Land in the Walpole area was reserved for a national park in 1910, and the area subsequently became a popular holiday destination. Major development began to occur in the 1930s as part of the land settlement scheme. The railway reached <span class="loc">Nornalup</span> in 1929, and the Walpole town site was gazetted in 1933. Walpole was always the preferred name, but it was believed this was already in use in <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>. So the newly gazetted township was officially named <span class="loc">Nornalup</span>, but this caused confusion with the railway terminus 13 kilometres (8 mi) east. Eventually the Post Office advised that there was no <span class="loc">Walpole</span> in <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, and in 1934 the town reverted to its original name of Walpole.</p>
