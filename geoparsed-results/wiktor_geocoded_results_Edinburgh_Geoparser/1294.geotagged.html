<p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 238,136, making it the fifth-most populous county in <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Stillwater</span>. The county was established in 1849. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is included in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, <span class="loc">MN-WI Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was one of the nine original counties created when the Minnesota Territory was organized in 1849. The county was officially established October 27, 1849, named after <span class="loc">George Washington</span>. Early development in the area was on the St. <span class="loc">Croix</span> River, which now forms the boundary with <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> on the county's eastern side. The river not only provided a means of transportation to move people upstream, but also move logs downstream. The area was heavily forested and the early economy was dependent on the logging and lumber industries. The first settlement and seat was named Dacotah, and was located as early as 1838 in what is now northern <span class="loc">Stillwater</span>, where <span class="loc">Brown's Creek</span> flows into the St. <span class="loc">Croix</span> River. The creek's name is from the founder of this settlement, Joseph Renshaw Brown. However, a sawmill was built at Marine-on-St.-<span class="loc">Croix</span> in 1839, and another was built in the current location of downtown <span class="loc">Stillwater</span> in 1844. The success of these soon attracted the settlers from Dacotah, and <span class="loc">Stillwater</span> became the county seat in 1846.</p>
