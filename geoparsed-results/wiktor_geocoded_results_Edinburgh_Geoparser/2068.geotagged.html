<p>Lexington is a town in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Lexington County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and is also the largest town in <span class="loc">Lexington County</span>. The population was 17,870 at the 2010 census. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated 2014 population is 20,905. In 1735, the colonial government of King George II established eleven townships in backcountry <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, to encourage settlement, and to provide a buffer between Native American tribes to the West and colonial plantations in the Lowcountry. The townships included one named <span class="loc">Saxe Gotha</span>, which flourished with major crops of corn, wheat, tobacco, hemp, and flax, as well as beeswax and livestock. The Battle of <span class="loc">Tarrar</span> Springs was fought nearby on November 16, 1781. In 1785, <span class="loc">Saxe Gotha</span> was replaced with <span class="loc">Lexington County</span>, in commemoration of the Battles of Lexington and Concord in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The county's first courthouse was built in <span class="loc">Granby</span>, but chronic flooding forced the courthouse to move in 1820 to its present location, establishing the community of Lexington Courthouse. The community was incorporated as the Town of Lexington in 1861.</p>
