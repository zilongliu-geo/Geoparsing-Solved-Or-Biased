<p><span class="loc">Buda</span> (/ˈbjuːdə/ BYOO-da) is a city in <span class="loc">Hays County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,343 residents in 2010. <span class="loc">Buda</span> is part of the Austin-Round Rock-San <span class="loc">Marcos metropolitan</span> statistical area and one of Austin's fastest growing suburbs. Some high school competitions held there. <span class="loc">Buda</span> is located at 30°05′03″N 97°50′21″W (30.084229, −97.839081). This is 13 miles (21 km) southwest of Austin and 60 miles (97 km) northeast of <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> on Interstate 35.

Hays High School. <span class="loc">Buda</span> is home to numerous fast-growing small- to medium-sized businesses. Because of its proximity to Austin, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">Buda</span> is a suburb and commuter town for commuters to Austin. Commercial development along the I-35 corridor, such as the Cabela's sporting good store, has increased city sales tax revenue, and city leaders hope that further revitalization of downtown <span class="loc">Buda</span> will attract tourists and residents to the Main Street area.</p>
