<p><span class="loc">Dublin</span> is a city in Franklin, <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, and Union counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The population was 41,751 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Dublin</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>.
