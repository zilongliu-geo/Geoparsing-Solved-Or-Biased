Located on the city's southeast coast, the barrio was originally an elegant seaside resort. However, it eventually became the city's most exclusive suburb. <span class="loc">Carrasco</span> is regarded as one of the most expensive barrios in <span class="loc">Montevideo</span>, and features a wide range of architectural styles. <span class="loc">Carrasco</span> borders <span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Carrasco</span> <span class="loc">Norte</span> to the north, <span class="org">Canelones Department</span> to the east and the coastline to the south. Part of the seafront avenue along <span class="loc">Carrasco</span> is named <span class="loc">Rambla</span> <span class="per">Tom√°s Berreta</span> and across it stretches the beach of <span class="loc">Carrasco</span>. The <span class="loc">Carrasco</span> Creek separates this neighbourhood from <span class="org">Canelones Department</span>. <span class="loc">Carrasco</span> residents, tend to be the most well cultured and educated sector of the city, although other barrios like <span class="loc">Punta Carretas</span> also share that type of demographics. Although there are no universities in the area of <span class="loc">Carrasco</span>, this barrio (together with adjacent <span class="loc">Carrasco</span> <span class="loc">Norte</span>) is home to many independent schools including: Woodlands School, <span class="per">Saint Patrick</span>'s College, Preuniversitario <span class="loc">Carrasco</span>, Scuola Italiana di <span class="loc">Montevideo</span>, and the <span class="org">Uruguayan American School</span>, which has 32 nationalities amongst its 300 students. Education in <span class="loc">Carrasco</span>, has proven to be one of the best if not the best of the whole country, having among its students a long list of presidents and politicians, as well as very important business men and women.</p><br><br>
