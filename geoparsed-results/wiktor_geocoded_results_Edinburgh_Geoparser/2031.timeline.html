  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Union County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">US</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 52,300. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Marysville</span>. Its name is reflective of its origins, it being the union of pieces of <span class="org">Franklin</span>, <span class="per">Delaware, Madison</span>, and <span class="per">Logan</span> counties. <span class="loc">Union County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">OH</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Union County</span> has been under the rule of three countries in its history: <span class="loc">France</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, and the present-day <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was discovered by the French explorer <span class="loc">La Salle</span>, along with traders and missionaries who accompanied him. After the French and <span class="org">Indian War</span>, the Treaty of <span class="loc">Paris</span> of <span class="date">1763</span> placed the area under British rule. Following the American Revolution, in <span class="date">1783</span>, the area would eventually become known as the Northwest Territory and part of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. After the American Revolution, former soldiers from <span class="loc">New England</span> poured into <span class="loc">Ohio</span> after being granted land by the government. They surveyed the land, and sought to develop a state between <span class="loc">Lake Erie</span> and the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>. Their proposals for the governance of the territory led to the passage of the Ordinance of <span class="date">1787</span>, which guided the establishment of states within the Northwestern Territory. Bitter struggles with American Indians over the next <span class="date">decades</span> would follow, culminating with the battle of <span class="loc">Tippecanoe</span> in <span class="date">1811</span>, which saw the final defeat of the American Indian tribes in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> led by <span class="loc">Tecumseh</span>. A notable victim of the warring between the settlers and Indians was <span class="per">Jonathan Alder</span>, who resided in and around the <span class="loc">Union County</span> area throughout his life.</p><br><br>
