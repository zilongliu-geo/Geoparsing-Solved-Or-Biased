<p><span class="loc">San Fernando</span> (population of 50,208 according to the 2011 census,) is the larger of <span class="loc">Trinidad and Tobago</span>'s two cities and the second largest municipality after <span class="loc">Chaguanas</span>. It occupies 18 km² and is located in the southwestern part of the island of <span class="loc">Trinidad</span>. It is bounded to the north by the <span class="loc">Guaracara River</span>, the south by the <span class="loc">Oropouche</span> River, the east by the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway, and the west by the <span class="loc">Gulf of Paria</span>. The former borough was elevated to the status of a city on November 18, 1988. The motto of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> is: "Sanitas Fortis" - In a Healthy Environment We Will Find Strength. Many local Trinidadians refer to the city with the shortened name "Sando." <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> is called <span class="loc">Trinidad and Tobago</span>'s "industrial capital" because of its proximity to the Pointe-a-Pierre oil refinery and many other petrochemical, LNG, iron and steel and aluminium smelters in places such as <span class="loc">Point Lisas</span>, <span class="loc">Point Fortin</span>, and <span class="loc">La Brea</span>. The Amerindians called the area Anaparima, which has been translated as either "single hill" or "without water". A single hill, San Fernando Hill, rises from the centre of the city. A town named <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> de <span class="loc">Naparima</span> was established by Spanish Governor Don José Maria Chacón in 1784, in honour of the heir to Spanish crown. With time, the "de <span class="loc">Naparima</span>" was dropped.</p>
