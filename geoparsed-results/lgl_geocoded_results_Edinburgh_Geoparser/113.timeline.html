  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Police say man pulled a gun on another man at motel. Police say they found drugs on a Charleston man who had been accused of pulling a gun on another man. Charleston police were called <span class="date">Tuesday</span> to a report of a disturbance at the Knights Inn motel on <span class="loc">MacCorkle Avenue</span> in <span class="loc">Kanawha City</span>. A man there, identified as <span class="per">Rick Smith</span>, told police he'd been trying to break up a fight between <span class="per">Jason Terrell Jones</span>, 23, of Central Avenue and <span class="per">Jones</span>' girlfriend, who was not identified, according to a complaint filed in <span class="org">Kanawha Magistrate Court</span>. Witnesses told police <span class="per">Jones</span> got upset, went into the motel room where he was staying, retrieved a gun and put it to Smith's head, the complaint said. <span class="per">Jones</span> fled on foot when officers arrived but was picked up a short distance away, according to the complaint. Police wrote in the complaint that they found a gun in a creek bed along the route <span class="per">Jones</span> took to evade arrest. While searching <span class="per">Jones</span> at police headquarters, officers retrieved two baggies of white rocks, believed to be crack cocaine, from <span class="per">Jones</span>' underwear, the complaint said. The substance in the bags, which totaled about 8.6 grams, later tested positive as cocaine, according to the complaint. Police discovered that <span class="per">Jones</span> had been convicted in <span class="date">2004</span> of selling controlled substances in <span class="loc">Bronx County</span>, <span class="loc">N.Y</span>, which makes him ineligible to possess a gun, the complaint said. <span class="per">Jones</span> was charged with brandishing, possessing a firearm when prohibited by law and possession of crack cocaine with intent to deliver.</p><br><br>
