  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Sidney is a town located at the northern end of the <span class="loc">Saanich Peninsula</span>, on <span class="loc">Vancouver Island</span> in the Canadian <span class="loc">province of British Columbia</span>. It is one of the 13 Greater Victoria municipalities. It has a population of approximately 11,583. Sidney is located just east of <span class="org">Victoria International Airport</span>, and a few kilometres south of BC Ferries' Swartz Bay Terminal. The town is also the only Canadian port-of-call in the Washington State Ferry system, with ferries running from Sidney to the <span class="loc">San Juan</span> Islands and <span class="loc">Anacortes</span>. Sidney is located along Highway 17, which bisects the town from north to south. It is generally considered part of the <span class="loc">Victoria metropolitan</span> area. The town west of Highway 17 (also called Patricia Bay Highway locally abbreviated as the Pat Bay Highway) has a mixture of single-family residences and light industry. The majority of the town is located east of highway 17. Single-family units are also present east of the highway, but the eastern sector also has many condominium-type buildings, plus most of the service and retail outlets. The island-studded <span class="loc">Haro Strait</span>, part of the Salish Sea forms Sidney's eastern boundary. There is a large boating and marine industry in the area, ranging from marinas to boatbuilders and marine suppliers.</p><br><br>
