  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Manga</span> is a barrio (neighbourhood or district) of <span class="loc">Montevideo</span>, <span class="loc">Uruguay</span>. <span class="loc">Manga</span> shares borders with <span class="loc">Manga</span> - Toledo Chico to the north and northwest, Villa García - <span class="loc">Manga Rural</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Piedras Blancas</span> to the south and Casavalle to the southwest. The origin of the name "<span class="loc">Manga</span>" is believed it comes from the short name of the word "Mangangá", name which appeared mentioned in <span class="date">1780</span>, the zone later called "<span class="loc">Manga</span>". According to Benito Tesore, expert in <span class="loc">Manga</span>'s history and its men that subsisted in the zone in the first <span class="date">years</span> of the century. Lot of trenches and strongholds were built, possibly to stop the Portuguese advance (in <span class="per">Artigas</span>' times). Armed with this assumption, it could be why municipal authority gave names as "Trinchera" (Trenches) and "Fortín" (Fort) to two roads of the zone. The first owner of a ranch in <span class="loc">Manga</span> was <span class="per">Esteban Artigas</span> (Son of the <span class="per">captain Juan Antonio Artigas</span>), ceded by The Government of <span class="loc">Spain</span>. In the Register Aldecoa, from 1772-1773, he's figured as living with his six under-age children in The <span class="loc">Manga</span>, then known as "<span class="per">Pago del Arroyo</span> de <span class="org">Sierra</span>" (Zone of the brook of Mountain Range), known by that name because of a neighbour's surname of the zone.</p><br><br>
