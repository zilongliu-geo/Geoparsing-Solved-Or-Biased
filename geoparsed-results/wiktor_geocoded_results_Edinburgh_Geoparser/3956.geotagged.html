<p><span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is an urban community in the <span class="loc">Rocky Mountains</span> within the Municipality of <span class="loc">Crowsnest Pass</span> in southwest <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It was formerly incorporated as a village prior to 1979 when it amalgamated with four other municipalities to form <span class="loc">Crowsnest Pass</span>. Unlike some of the other communities in <span class="loc">Crowsnest Pass</span>, which relied on a single coal mine, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> benefitted from the proximity of several successful mines and, despite setbacks from fire, strikes, mine accidents and fluctuations in the coal market, persisted as a successful community to the present day. <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> was founded in 1905 on the flat land above the Bellevue Mine operated by the French-based West Canadian Collieries (WCC). Its post office opened in 1907. The naming of the town is credited to Elsie Fleutot, the young daughter of one of WCC’s French principals, <span class="loc">Jules</span> J. Fleutot, after she exclaimed “Quelle belle vue!” (What a beautiful view!). In 1909 the <span class="loc">Maple Leaf</span> Coal Company commenced operations at the Mohawk Bituminous Mine and constructed the settlement of <span class="loc">Maple Leaf</span> adjacent to <span class="loc">Bellevue</span>. In 1913 WCC transferred many workers to <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> from its closed Lille operations. WCC displayed a five-ton coal boulder at the 1910 Dominion Exhibition in <span class="loc">Calgary</span>.</p>
