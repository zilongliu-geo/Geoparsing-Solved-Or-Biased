  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Norwich</span>, known as 'The Rose of <span class="loc">New England</span>', is a city in New <span class="loc">London County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 40,493 at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. Three rivers, the <span class="loc">Yantic</span>, the <span class="loc">Shetucket</span>, and the <span class="loc">Quinebaug</span>, flow into the city and form its harbor, from which the <span class="loc">Thames River</span> flows south to <span class="loc">Long Island Sound</span>. <span class="loc">Norwichtown</span> was founded in <span class="date">1659</span>, by settlers from <span class="loc">Old Saybrook</span> led by Major <span class="per">John Mason</span> and <span class="per">Reverend James Fitch</span>. They purchased the land "nine miles square" that would become <span class="loc">Norwich</span> from the local Native Mohegan Sachem Uncas. In <span class="date">1668</span>, a wharf was established at <span class="loc">Yantic</span> Cove. Settlement was primarily in the three-mile (5-km) area around the <span class="org">Norwichtown Green</span>. The 69 founding families soon divided up the land in the Norwichtown vicinity for farms and businesses. By <span class="date">1694</span>, the public landing built at the head of the <span class="loc">Thames River</span> allowed ships to offload goods at the harbor; the harbor area is known as the <span class="loc">Chelsea</span> neighborhood. The distance between the port and <span class="loc">Norwichtown</span> was serviced by the East and West Roads, which later became <span class="loc">Washington Street</span> and <span class="loc">Broadway</span>.</p><br><br>
