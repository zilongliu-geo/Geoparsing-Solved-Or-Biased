<p>Platte Co. tops 32K for first time. Census data released today show <span class="loc">Platte County</span> reaching an all-time population high of 32,072 as of July 1, 2008, an increase of 1.6 percent since the 2000 census. From 2007 to 2008, the population increased by 272 people, nearly a percentage point gain at .86 percent. The increase places <span class="loc">Platte</span> as the state’s 10th most populous county. Overall in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, not even a third of the counties saw populations increase in 2008. The figures show 28 of Nebraska’s 93 counties gained in population from July 2007 to July 2008. That’s one more than in the previous year. All but one of the remaining counties lost population. <span class="loc">Sherman County</span>, which includes Loup City, held firm at 2,994. But an analysis from the University of Nebraska at Omaha’s Center for Public Affairs Research shows changes overall were better than those seen in recent years. Small Hitchcock and Hayes counties in southwest <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, for example, both gained population in the one-year period after several years of losses. “Maybe it’s a one-year blip or something, but it’s definitely interesting to see that,” said UNO’s David Drozd, a research associate. Dakota, <span class="loc">Otoe</span> and <span class="loc">Washington</span> counties, whose numbers typically go up, saw their populations fall. In December, the Census bureau reported the state gained 13,959 residents over the one-year period. That’s the most <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> has seen in a dozen years. Drozd attributed the gain to people moving into <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> from states harder hit by the economic downturn, as well as a strong birth rate. Economic conditions also could have lured some people back to rural areas, including college students who returned to the farm, he said. “By and large, for rural areas, a lot of the commodity prices were relatively strong,” he said. Several counties are seeing population levels unseen in decades. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>’s population (<span class="loc">North Platte</span>) of 35,582 is closer than ever to its all-time high set in 1981. It needs about 220 more people to top it. Some counties that marked losses in 2008 saw their rates of decline slowing. <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, for example, lost just 20 people after losing hundreds after the closing of a Tyson Foods plant in 2006. The combined population of Douglas, <span class="loc">Sarpy</span> and <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> counties continues to creep closer to the 1 million mark. They now account for 52 percent of the state’s population, having more than 931,000 residents combined. In 2000, they controlled nearly 49 percent of the state’s population. With the 2010 Census quickly approaching, the latest estimates confirm a timely change of course within Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District. The district that includes more than three-fourths of the state lost about 2,700 people annually in the first six years of the decade. But in 2008, it gained about 150 people. Drozd estimates its total population now sits at 551,000. Every 10 years following the census, seats in the U.S. House of Representatives must be redistributed fairly among the states. In 2000, Nebraska’s slow growth sparked concern that the state could lose a seat a decade down the line. More than 70 years ago, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> had six congressional districts. The House lost seats in 1933, 1943 and 1963.</p>
