<p>Chester is a town in <span class="loc">Windsor County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,154 at the 2010 census. The town was originally chartered by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth as <span class="loc">Flamstead</span> in 1754. The terms of the charter were not met and the town was re-chartered as New Flamstead in 1761. In 1766, a patent was issued by <span class="loc">New York</span> that changed the name of the town to Chester, after George Augustus Frederick, the Earl of Chester and the eldest son of King George III. The governing authority of Chester reverted to the 1761 charter by an act of the <span class="loc">Vermont</span> legislature, although it left the name "Chester" in place. 2011 was the 250th anniversary of the town. As of the census of 2010, 3,154 people resided in Chester, with 1,793 housing units. In 2010, Chester had 510 residents 14 years old and younger; 205 15 to 19; 277 20 to 29; 298 ages 30 to 39; and 418 ages 40 to 49. Our 0-49 age group makes up 53.2% of the Chester population. Of the entire population, 17.6% is 50 to 59 years old, 13.1% is 60 to 69; 7.6% is between 70 and 79 and 5.2% is 80 and older.</p>
