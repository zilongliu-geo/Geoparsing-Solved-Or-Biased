<p>The Town of <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> is a Home Rule Municipality located in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> is situated west of, and adjacent to, the City and <span class="loc">County of Denver</span>. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau estimates that the town population was 529 on 2005-07-01. The Denver Post Office (ZIP Code 80212) serves <span class="loc">Mountain View</span>. <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> was incorporated in 1904 on the land occupied by the Berkeley Annex subdivision established in 1888, which itself was part of the <span class="loc">Berkeley Farm</span> founded by John Brisben Walker in 1879. The town grew to approximately 500 residents living in 272 houses by 2008, with approximately 20 businesses in operation, but occupying a total of only 12 square-blocks "sandwiched between Wheat Ridge and <span class="loc">Denver</span>." By 2009, the town was going through a bit of an existential crises. Several businesses closed down, sales taxes declined, and city workers were paid late on three occasions over two months. The Town Council added a US$162 fee to sewer bills in order to maintain basic services. The Government of the State of <span class="loc">Colorado</span> stepped in to pay for getting the city's financial records in order. The Town wrote a letter to city residents saying: " 'Our town is in serious trouble and we need your help!' [offering] three options: Get some more businesses into town, unincorporate and be absorbed into <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> or let a neighboring community annex the town."</p>
