<p><span class="loc">Thornton</span> is a village on the <span class="loc">Fylde</span>, in <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, about 4 miles (6 km) north of <span class="loc">Blackpool</span> and 2 miles (3 km) south of <span class="loc">Fleetwood</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">Borough of Wyre</span>. Together with its neighbouring town of <span class="loc">Cleveleys</span>, <span class="loc">Thornton</span> forms part of the unparished area known as Thornton-Cleveleys. The two communities are linked by Victoria Road. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> is first mentioned in 1086 in the Domesday Book, where it was referred to as Torentum. At the time it covered a large area including what are now Cleveleys and Fleetwood, and had a very low population density. It is thought that a settlement had existed at the site since the Iron Age, and a Roman road passes close to the village. The area remained lightly populated until 1799, when the marshland around the village was drained and agricultural production began on a large scale. A railway station was opened in <span class="loc">Thornton</span> in 1865. The opening of salt works at nearby <span class="loc">Burn Naze</span> by the United Alkali Company in the early 1890s (later becoming ICI) led to significant expansion of the village, with new houses and community buildings constructed. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> became an Urban District Council in 1900, surviving until 1974 when it became part of the <span class="loc">Wyre Borough</span> Council.</p>
