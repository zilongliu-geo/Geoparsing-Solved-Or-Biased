  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Nelson</span> is an unincorporated community in northwestern <span class="loc">Choctaw County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. It is six miles <span class="loc">north of Soper</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. <span class="org">Spencer Academy</span>, a Choctaw Nation school, was moved here from <span class="loc">Spencerville</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. A United States Post Office was established at <span class="per">Nelson</span>, Indian Territory on <span class="date">March 10, 1881</span> and operated until <span class="date">November 30, 1954</span>. Until <span class="date">September 15, 1881</span>, the official name of this post office was Nelsons. <span class="per">Nelson</span> is named for Cole <span class="per">E. Nelson</span>, prominent <span class="org">Choctaw Indian and National Attorney</span> of the Choctaw Nation. Until the advent of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>'s statehood <span class="per">Nelson</span> was located in <span class="loc">Kiamitia County</span> (<span class="loc">Kiamichi County</span>), Choctaw Nation. <span class="per">Nelson</span>’s livelihood as a commercial and population center was threatened after the St. <span class="per">Louis</span> and <span class="per">San</span> Francisco Railway built its tracks east of <span class="per">Nelson</span>, passing instead through the communities of Antlers, <span class="loc">Hamden</span>, <span class="loc">Speer</span> and Hugo. Although it retained a lively community for <span class="date">decades</span> following the railroad’s construction in the 1880s, the towns along the railroad sapped it of potential commercial success. <span class="per">Nelson</span> continues to be home to several families, and as such remains the area’s oldest settlement.</p><br><br>
