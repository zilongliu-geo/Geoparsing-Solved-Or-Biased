  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Karbala</span> (Arabic: كربلاء‎; Karbalā’; also referred to as Karbalā' al-Muqaddasah) is a city in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>, located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">Baghdad</span>. <span class="loc">Karbala</span> is the capital of Karbala Governorate, and has an estimated population of 572,300 people (<span class="date">2003</span>). The city, best known as the location of the Battle of <span class="loc">Karbala</span> (680), is the holiest city for Shia Muslims after Mecca, <span class="loc">Medina</span> and the noble sanctuary in <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>. It is home to the Imam Hussein Shrine. <span class="loc">Karbala</span> is famous as the site of the martyrdom of Hussein ibn Ali (<span class="per">Imam Husayn</span>), and commemorations are held by millions of <span class="loc">Shias</span> annually to remember it. <span class="loc">Karbala</span> is considered sacred by <span class="loc">Shias</span> and rivals Mecca as a place of pilgrimage. Several theories address the origin of the name <span class="loc">Karbala</span>. The geographer <span class="per">Yaqut al-Hamawi</span> expressed the traditional hypothesis: that the name is an alternate Arabic feminine version of karbalah "soft earth". Alternatively, it has been said to be derived from the Aramaic word <span class="loc">Kora</span>, meaning place for making bricks, for the nearby ancient <span class="loc">city of Babil</span>, hence Karbabil, which became <span class="loc">Karbala</span> by contraction. According to Shia belief, the archangel Gabriel narrated the true meaning of the name Karbalā to Muhammad: the land which will cause many agonies (karb) and afflictions (balā)."</p><br><br>
