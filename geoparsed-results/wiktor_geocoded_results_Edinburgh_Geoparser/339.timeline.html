It is <span class="date">today</span> largely residential, but in <span class="date">the past</span> it was a centre for straw plaiting. The original <span class="loc">All Saints</span> school was a "<span class="org">Straw Plait School</span>" where children were expected to learn to plait straw from as young as <span class="date">four years</span> of age. They would also be taught to read.</p><br><br>
