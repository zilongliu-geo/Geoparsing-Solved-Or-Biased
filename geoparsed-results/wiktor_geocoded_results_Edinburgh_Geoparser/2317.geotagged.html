<p>Houston is a borough in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,314 at the 2000 census. Students in Houston and neighboring Chartiers Township attend school in the Chartiers-Houston School District. Houston is located at 40°14′59″N 80°12′37″W (40.249790, -80.210275). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2), all of it land. The land on which this town stands was part of a tract purchased from John Haft on January 24, 1827, by Daniel Houston, a near relative of Gen. <span class="loc">Sam Houston</span>, leader of the <span class="loc">Texans</span> in their war for independence from <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. After the Chartiers Valley Railroad was completed through that section in 1871, David C. Houston, a son of Daniel Houston, saw the possibilities of a town at that point and laid out the present plan of <span class="loc">Houstonville</span>. The first house in the new town was completed in the summer of 1871 by A. T. Haft and the second by J. C. Johnson. A few years later H. E. Riggle laid out a plan adjoining which was called Riggletown until the <span class="loc">Borough of Houstonville</span> was incorporated on May 13, 1901.</p>
