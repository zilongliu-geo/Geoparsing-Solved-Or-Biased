<p><span class="loc">La Ceiba</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [la ˈseiβa]) is a port city on the northern coast of <span class="loc">Honduras</span> in Central <span class="loc">America</span>. It is located on the southern edge of the Caribbean, forming part of the south eastern boundary of the <span class="loc">Gulf of Honduras</span>. With an estimated population of over 200,000 living in approximately 170 residential areas (called colonias or barrios), it is the fourth largest city in the country and the capital of the Honduran department of Atlántida. <span class="loc">La Ceiba</span> was officially founded on August 23, 1877. The city was named after a giant ceiba tree which grew near the old dock, which itself finally fell into the sea in late 2007. The city has been officially proclaimed the "Eco-Tourism Capital of <span class="loc">Honduras</span>" as well as the "Entertainment Capital of <span class="loc">Honduras</span>". Every year, on the third or fourth Saturday of May, the city holds its famous carnival to commemorate Isidore the Laborer (Spanish <span class="loc">San Isidro Labrador</span>). During this time, the city is host to approximately 500,000 tourists. In 1872 Manuel Hernandez built a small shack under the Ceiba tree that was at one point by the old docks. Over time, more and more people from all over present-day <span class="loc">Honduras</span> (especially the departments of Olancho and <span class="loc">Santa Barbara</span>), and from around the world settled in <span class="loc">La Ceiba</span>. These people were attracted by the cultivation of bananas that became popular in the region. In the late 19th century, the banana business caught the attention of big North American banana companies such as the Vaccaro Brothers' Standard Fruit Company from <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. This new economic activity attracted national and international immigrants to <span class="loc">La Ceiba</span>. The current neighborhood known as Barrio Ingles was the first recognized neighborhood in the city and was named so because of the number of English speaking people living in the barrio. At that point the main thorougfare of <span class="loc">La Ceiba</span> was present-day <span class="loc">Avenida</span> <span class="loc">La Republica</span>, which is where the train tracks were set. These train tracks were built by the Standard Fruit Company (now Standard Fruit de <span class="loc">Honduras</span>, a Dole subsidiary). This company was largely responsible for the early growth of the city.</p>
