<p><span class="loc">Goro</span> was one of the 77 woredas in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. This woreda was named after one of the sub-groups of the Sebat Bet Gurage, the <span class="loc">Goro</span>. Part of the <span class="loc">Gurage Zone</span>, <span class="loc">Goro</span> was bordered on the south by the <span class="loc">Wabe</span> River which separates it from <span class="loc">Cheha</span>, on the west and north by the <span class="loc">Oromia Region</span>, on the farther east by Kokir Gedebano Gutazer, and on the southeast by Ezhana Wolene. The major town in <span class="loc">Goro</span> was Welkite. <span class="loc">Goro</span> was divided for Abeshge, Kebena and Welkite woredas. Local landmarks include the <span class="loc">Acho</span> falls on the <span class="loc">Wabe</span> river which is 60 meters in height, and <span class="loc">Walga</span> Falls on the <span class="loc">Walga</span> river which is 30 meters in height. <span class="loc">Goro</span> was selected by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in 2004 as one of several woredas for voluntary resettlement for farmers from overpopulated areas, becoming the new home for a total of 3000 heads of households and 12,000 total family members. Based on figures published by the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, this woreda has an estimated total population of 169,000, of whom 84,033 are men and 84,967 are women; 27,775 or 16.43% of its population are urban dwellers, which is greater than the Zone average of 6.3%. With an estimated area of 925.01 square kilometers, <span class="loc">Goro</span> has an estimated population density of 182.7 people per square kilometer, which is less than the Zone average of 278.3. In the 1990s, a survey revealed an isolated enclave of 1,000 speakers of Gumuz around Welkite, a language otherwise found only in western <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>.</p>
