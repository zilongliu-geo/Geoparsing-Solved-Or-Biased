<p><span class="loc">Pudong</span> is a <span class="loc">district of Shanghai</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>, located east of the <span class="loc">Huangpu</span> River across from the historic city center of Shanghai in <span class="loc">Puxi</span>. The name refers to its historic position as "The <span class="loc">East Bank</span>" of the <span class="loc">Huangpu</span> River, which flows through central Shanghai, although it is now administered as the Pudong New Area, a state-level new area which extends all the way to the <span class="loc">East China Sea</span>. The traditional area of <span class="loc">Pudong</span> is now home to the Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone and the Shanghai Stock Exchange and many of Shanghai's best-known buildings, such as the Oriental Pearl Tower, the Jin Mao Tower, the Shanghai World Financial Center, and the Shanghai Tower. These modern skyscrapers directly face Puxi's historic Bund, a remnant of a former foreign concessions in <span class="loc">China</span>. The rest of the new area includes the Shanghai Expo and Century Park, Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park, <span class="loc">Pudong</span> international airport, the Jiuduansha Wetland Nature Reserve, and a planned Disney resort. Pudong—literally "The <span class="loc">East Bank</span> of the <span class="loc">Huangpu</span> River"—originally referred only to the less-developed land across from Shanghai's <span class="loc">Old City</span> and foreign concessions. The area was mainly farmland and only slowly developed, with warehouses and wharfs near the shore administered by the <span class="loc">districts of Puxi</span> on the west bank: <span class="loc">Huangpu</span>, <span class="loc">Yangpu</span>, and <span class="loc">Nanshi</span>. <span class="loc">Pudong</span> was originally established as a county in 1958 until 1961 which the county was split among <span class="loc">Huangpu</span>, <span class="loc">Yangpu</span>, <span class="loc">Nanshi</span>, <span class="loc">Wusong</span> and <span class="loc">Chuansha County</span>. In October 1, 1992 the original area of <span class="loc">Pudong County</span> and <span class="loc">Chuansha County</span> merged and established Pudong New Area.</p>
