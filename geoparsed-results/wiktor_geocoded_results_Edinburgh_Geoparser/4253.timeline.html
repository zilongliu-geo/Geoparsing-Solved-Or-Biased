  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Esperance</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Snohomish County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Esperance</span> is an enclave of the <span class="loc">city of Edmonds</span>, WA. The population was 3,601 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Esperance</span> is located at 47°47′42″N 122°20′51″W (47.795006, -122.347487). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.7 square miles (1.9 km²), all of it land. Five times in <span class="date">the last 50 years</span>, the <span class="loc">City of Edmonds</span> has looked at annexing <span class="loc">Esperance</span> into the city. In each case, voters in the enclave have rejected the annexation. Issues for annexation include a desire for a contiguous <span class="loc">City of Edmonds</span>, continuity of services and a belief that services will be easier to provide. Arguments against annexation include desire to remain part of unincorporated area of <span class="loc">Snohomish county</span>, an expectation that taxes may rise with annexation, and the desire to take part in activities that are possible in the county that would not be permitted under city regulations. The latter includes less regulation for building certain structures and the ability to keep animals.</p><br><br>
