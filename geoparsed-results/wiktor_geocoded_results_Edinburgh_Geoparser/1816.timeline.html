  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Mason is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. It is named after the state's first governor, Stevens T. Mason. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 8,252. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Ingham County</span>. Mason is the only city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> that serves as a county seat ahead of a state capital, with the capital of <span class="loc">Lansing</span> also in <span class="loc">Ingham County</span>. Despite Mason being the county seat, many county offices and courtrooms are located in <span class="loc">Lansing</span>. In <span class="date">1836</span> <span class="per">Charles Noble</span> knew that <span class="loc">Michigan</span> would be seeking a central location for a new capital when it became a state. He purchased an area of forest, cleared 20 acres (81,000 m2), and founded Mason Center. The "Center" was soon dropped. In <span class="date">1847</span>, however, the state chose Lansing Township 12 miles (19 km) northward to be its capital due its potential for water power. Noble managed to make Mason the county seat instead. <span class="loc">Ingham County</span>'s first downtown courthouse was built in <span class="date">1843</span>, and was replaced in <span class="date">1858</span>, and then again in <span class="date">1905</span>.</p><br><br>
