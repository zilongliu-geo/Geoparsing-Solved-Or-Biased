<p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a small town in country Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located 180 km north of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> with a mixture of rural and semi-rural communities on the northern <span class="loc">Campaspe River</span>, between <span class="loc">Bendigo</span> and the <span class="loc">Murray River</span> port of <span class="loc">Echuca</span>. At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Rochester</span> had a population of 3,106. The area around the <span class="loc">Campaspe River</span> was known as Yalooka, and for thousands of years was home to the Pinpandoor, the local tribe of Aboriginees. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> (via Rowechester) was named after Dr John Pearson Rowe, who had a hotel here before the township was gazetted in 1855. The Post Office opened on 11 May 1863 and the town was reached by the railway line from <span class="loc">Bendigo</span> (connecting it to <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>) in 1864. The town is famous as the birthplace in 1904 of Australian racing and endurance cyclist, Sir Hubert Opperman, affectionately known as <span class="loc">Oppy</span>. There is a museum dedicated to <span class="loc">Oppy</span> in <span class="loc">Moore</span> street, and a statue of him winning the 24-hour Bol D'Or race in <span class="loc">Paris</span> in 1928. On his 90th birthday <span class="loc">Oppy</span> donated one of his trusty Malvern Star bicycles to the museum.</p>
