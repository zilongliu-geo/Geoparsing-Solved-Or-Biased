  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Madison Central</span> wins state mock trial championship. The <span class="org">Madison Central High School</span> mock trial team won the state championship <span class="date">Sunday</span>, defeating <span class="org">Eastern High School</span> of <span class="loc">Louisville</span> in the final round. Senior <span class="per">Kasey Anderson</span> was named the tournament’s best attorney, while Junior Matt Bendure won best witness. MCHS will represent <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> in the national tournament to take place <span class="date">May 8-9</span> in <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>. Central was one of four <span class="loc">Madison County</span> teams in the tournament. Only <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, with seven, had more schools represented in the in the 26-team competition. <span class="org">Madison Southern High School and Model Laboratory School</span>, along with <span class="org">Foley Middle School</span>, took part in the tournament. Foley Middle, which earlier won its state tournament, was invited to participate and won one round before being eliminated. “All four teams represented <span class="loc">Madison County</span> very well,” said <span class="per">Madison Circuit Judge William G. Clouse Jr.</span>, who helps coach the MCHS team. “The Foley team received very complimentary remarks from the judges during of its evaluations.” Central defeated <span class="loc">McLean County</span>, <span class="loc">Louisville Assumption</span>, the <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> blue team and the <span class="per">C.M. Gatton</span> Academy of <span class="per">Math</span> and <span class="per">Science</span> before facing Eastern in the finals. Draws determined whether competitors would represent the prosecution or defense in the case of a defendant accused of selling marijuana on school property. In the finals, Central’s team successfully argued the defendant was not guilty, based on police entrapment, <span class="per">Clouse</span> said. The competition, conducted in the <span class="org">Jefferson County Judicial Center</span>, was judged by judges from the <span class="org">Kentucky Court of Appeals</span>, circuit and district judges, attorneys and law students. “We have an exceptional group of students on our 12-member team,” <span class="per">Clouse</span> said, “and they have worked extremely hard.” <span class="per">Clouse</span>’s daughter, <span class="per">Kristin</span>, a senior at the <span class="org">University of Kentucky College of Law</span>, and <span class="per">Robin Lake</span>, a senior at Chase Law School, are the attorney coaches for MCHS. Vicki Rollins is the faculty coach. The team will begin preparing <span class="date">today</span> for the national competition, <span class="per">Judge Clouse</span> said. “Kentucky has an outstanding reputation in the mock trial world and several schools already have sent us e-mails wanting to conduct practice scrimmages with Central after we get to <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> before the competition,” he said. <span class="per">Bill Robinson</span> can be reached at brobinson@richmondregister.com or 624-6622.</p><br><br>
