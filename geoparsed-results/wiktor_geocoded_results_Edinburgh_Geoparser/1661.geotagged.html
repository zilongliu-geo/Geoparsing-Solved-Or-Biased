<p><span class="loc">San Patricio</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Nueces</span> and <span class="loc">San Patricio</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The population was 318 at the 2000 census. According to the United States Census Bureau, <span class="loc">San Patricio</span>, located at 27°57′33″N 97°46′23″W (27.959196, -97.773134), has a total area of 3.9 square miles (10.0 km²), of which 3.8 square miles (9.9 km²) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km²) (1.03%) is water. The town was founded in 1829 by empresarios James McGloin and John McMullen. They had received approval from the Mexican government to settle 200 Irish Catholic families on the land—the name meaning <span class="loc">Saint Patrick</span>, the patron saint of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. Empresario James Power was involved as well. The Battle of <span class="loc">San Patricio</span> was fought near the town in 1836 during the Texas Revolution. With the approval of the General Council, <span class="loc">Texas</span> revolutionaries James Grant, Frank W. Johnson and Robert C. Morris collaborated on plans to lead an assault on the Mexican town of <span class="loc">Matamoros</span>. Recruiting some 300 men, several of who were native to <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>, they gathered provisions from the <span class="loc">Alamo</span> and <span class="loc">Presidio La Bahia</span> for their expedition. The men needed mounts for their long journey and divided into groups as they traveled toward the coast to capture wild horses.</p>
