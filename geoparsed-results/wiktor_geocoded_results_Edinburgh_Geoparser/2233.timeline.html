  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Melrose, Montana</span>, once known as "<span class="loc">Camp Creek</span>", had its early beginnings as a tiny stage stop along the <span class="loc">Big Hole River</span> that would eventually become a terminus for the railroad, a shipping and receiving point for the <span class="org">Hecla Consolidated Mining Company and Bryant Mining District</span>, consisting of <span class="loc">Hecla</span>, Lion City, Greenwood, <span class="loc">Norwood</span>, and <span class="loc">Glendale</span>. The area along the <span class="loc">Big Hole River</span> was settled as early as <span class="date">1870</span>, three families shared the valley, <span class="per">Jefferson McCauley</span>, <span class="per">John Stone</span> and <span class="per">William Bowe</span>. In <span class="date">1875</span>, <span class="per">William Bowe</span> bought out two squatters giving them a combined total of $250.00. <span class="per">William Bowe</span> pre-empted 160 acres of land and subsequently added 80 acres of Desert land. <span class="per">William</span> built himself a modest home in <span class="date">1875</span> and later purchased a structure in Rocker which he moved to <span class="loc">Camp Creek</span> (later <span class="per">Melrose</span>), establishing himself as a Stage Stop and Hotel Entrepreneur. On <span class="date">December 25, 1876</span>, <span class="per">William</span> was married to Lucina Phillips who had recently divorced <span class="per">Adam Fleser</span> of whom "<span class="loc">Fleser</span> Mountain" was named. She brought four children from this marriage and settled with <span class="per">William Bowe</span> in their Hotel/Stage Stop. <span class="loc">Lucina</span> was no stranger to greeting and caring for travelers as her ex-husband <span class="per">Adam</span> also operated a tiny stage stop along the base of <span class="per">Mount Fleser</span>. It is likely that the married couple mutually agreed to operate the stage stop together as <span class="loc">Lucina</span> could tend to the meals and needs of the traveler while Billy could provide stable and other services.</p><br><br>
