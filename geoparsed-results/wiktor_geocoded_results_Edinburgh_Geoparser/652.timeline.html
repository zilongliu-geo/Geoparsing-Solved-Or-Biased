  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Arlington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Gilliam County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The account of how the city received its name varies; one tradition claims it was named after the lawyer <span class="per">Nathan Arlington</span> <span class="loc">Cornish</span>, while another tradition claims that the Southern inhabitants of the city had enough clout to rename the city after <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, home of general <span class="per">Robert E. Lee</span>. The city's population was 586 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Originally named Alkali, <span class="per">Arlington</span> came into existence as a place for shipping cattle down the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span>. It was incorporated as <span class="per">Arlington</span> by the <span class="org">Oregon Legislative Assembly</span> on <span class="date">November 20, 1885</span>. Following the completion of the John Day Dam, the original location of <span class="per">Arlington</span> was moved to higher ground in <span class="date">1963</span> to avoid the resulting inundation. <span class="per">Arlington</span> was the birthplace of musician <span class="per">Doc Severinsen</span>, best known as the musical director for the American television program The Tonight Show Starring <span class="per">Johnny Carson</span> (<span class="date">1967</span>â€“<span class="date">1992</span>). In <span class="date">2008</span>, it was discovered that Mayor Carmen Kontur-Gronquist had posted photos of herself in lingerie online, which, along with several other issues, led to her recall from office.</p><br><br>
