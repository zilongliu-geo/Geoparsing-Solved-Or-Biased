  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Warren is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Marshall County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,563 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Warren was platted in <span class="date">1879</span>, and named for Charles H. Warren, a railroad official. A post office has been in operation at Warren since <span class="date">1880</span>. Although several times larger than the next largest city in the county, Warren's prominence as the county seat has been threatened several times in its history. The original plan for the Soo Line Railroad (completed in <span class="date">1905</span>) branch line that passes through Warren called for it to run from Thief <span class="loc">River Falls</span> to <span class="loc">Argyle</span> and then west. Argyle interests hoped the establishment of a railroad junction there would lead to the removal of the county seat from Warren to <span class="loc">Argyle</span>. Other interests prevailed, although the railroad line forms a parabola extending north from Thief <span class="loc">River Falls</span>, and then south to Warren, as if the plan changed while the line was being built.[1] In <span class="date">1974</span>, citizens of the eastern part of the county, noting Warren's location in the western quarter of the long county, and very nearly at its southern boundary, petitioned twice for the relocation of the county seat to <span class="loc">Newfolden</span>. Neither effort <span class="date">that year</span> resulted in the question being put on the ballot, and in fact, voters in the interim had approved the construction of an addition to the courthouse in Warren.</p><br><br>
