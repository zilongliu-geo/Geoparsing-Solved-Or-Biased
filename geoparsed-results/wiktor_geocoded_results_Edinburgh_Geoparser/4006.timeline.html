It is part of Northeast <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s combined <span class="loc">Cleveland-Akron-Canton metropolitan</span> area, the 15th-largest Combined Statistical Area in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, in <span class="date">2012</span>, the city population was estimated at 23,160. The city has been recognized by Money in its list of "Best Places to Live" multiple times, placing 23rd in <span class="date">2009</span> and 3rd in <span class="date">2011</span>." The city has been rated as one of the safest in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, has a highly rated public school system, and was ranked as one of the "best places to raise kids" by Bloomberg Businessweek. <span class="loc">Solon</span> has a strong economy and in <span class="date">2013</span> was granted a <span class="org">Google</span> eCity award, recognizing it as the city with the strongest online business community in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. In <span class="date">1820</span>, the first settlers arrived from <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> to live in part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. The township was named after <span class="per">Lorenzo Solon Bull</span>, who was the son of <span class="per">Isaac Bull</span>, one of the first settlers. Purportedly, the selection of young <span class="per">Lorenzo</span>'s middle name was due to its derivation from the "father of democracy", <span class="loc">Solon</span>, the famous Athenian lawmaker of Ancient <span class="loc">Greece</span>.</p><br><br>
