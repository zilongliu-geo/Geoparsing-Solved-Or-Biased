  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is a town located on the border of <span class="loc">Steuben County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> and <span class="loc">DeKalb County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. In <span class="loc">Steuben County</span>, it is in Otsego Township, and in <span class="loc">DeKalb County</span> it is in <span class="org">Franklin</span> Township. The population was 1,532 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In the late 1830s, the land that present-day <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> was built on was sold by the owner Niconar Munson to <span class="per">Dr. Samuel Tuttle</span>, who was the first to plat the town. The original name of the town was "Enterprise". <span class="per">Dr. Tuttle</span> went to <span class="loc">New York</span> shortly thereafter, where he met <span class="per">Fisher Howe</span>, president of a syndicate of capitalists. <span class="per">Dr. Tuttle</span> sold all but one-sixteenth of the plat to him for $15,000. In the <span class="date">spring of 1838</span>, Howe sent Sidney <span class="loc">Gambia</span>, an agent, to Enterprise to sell goods and develop the settlement. However, Enterprise was heavily-ladened with illness <span class="date">that year</span>, to such an extent that is became known for it. To improve the settlement's reputation, the name was changed to <span class="loc">Hamilton</span>. Eventually the town was sold to Sidney <span class="loc">Gambia</span> for $1 (and for other terms), and the name was officially recorded as the Town of <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> in <span class="date">1844</span>.</p><br><br>
