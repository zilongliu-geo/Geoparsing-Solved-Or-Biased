It is 378 kilometres (235 mi) west of the state capital, <span class="loc">Lucknow</span>, 206 kilometres (128 mi) south of the national capital <span class="loc">New Delhi</span> and 125 kilometres (78 mi) north of <span class="loc">Gwalior</span>. With a population of 1,686,993 (<span class="date">2013</span> est.), it is one of the most populous cities in <span class="loc">Uttar Pradesh</span> and the 19th most populous in <span class="loc">India</span>. <span class="loc">Agra</span> can also refer to the administrative district that has its headquarters in <span class="loc">Agra city</span>. It is a major tourist destination because of its many splendid Mughal-era buildings, most notably the Tāj <span class="loc">Mahal</span>, <span class="loc">Agra</span> Fort and Fatehpūr Sikrī, all three of which are <span class="org">UNESCO World Heritage Sites</span>. <span class="loc">Agra</span> is included on the <span class="loc">Golden Triangle</span> tourist circuit, along with <span class="loc">Delhi</span> and <span class="loc">Jaipur</span>. The city was first mentioned in the epic Mahābhārata, where it was called Agrevaṇa (derived from Sanskrit (अग्रेवण) meaning "the border of the forest"). Legend ascribes the founding of the city to <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="loc">Badal</span> <span class="loc">Singh</span>, a Sikarwar Rajput king (c. <span class="date">1475</span>), whose fort, <span class="loc">Badalgarh</span>, stood on or near the site of the present fort. However, the 11th century Persian poet <span class="loc">Mas</span>'ūd Sa'd Salmān writes of a desperate assault on the fortress of <span class="loc">Agra</span>, then held by the Shāhī <span class="per">King Jayapala</span>, by <span class="loc">Sultan Mahmud</span> of <span class="loc">Ghazni</span>. It was mentioned for the first time in <span class="date">1080 AD</span> when a Ghaznavide force captured it. Sultan Sikandar Lodī (<span class="date">1488</span>–<span class="date">1517</span>) was the first to move his capital from <span class="loc">Delhi</span> to <span class="loc">Agra</span> in <span class="date">1506</span>. He governed the country from here and <span class="loc">Agra</span> assumed the importance of the second capital. He died in <span class="date">1517</span> and his son, Ibrāhīm Lodī, remained in power there for nine more <span class="date">years</span> and several palaces, wells and a mosque were built by him in the fort during his period. Finally being defeated at the Battle of <span class="loc">Panipat</span> in <span class="date">1526</span>. Between <span class="date">1540</span> and <span class="date">1556</span>, Afghans, beginning with <span class="per">Sher Shah Suri</span> ruled the area. It achieved fame as the capital of the Mughal Empire from <span class="date">1556</span> to <span class="date">1658</span>.</p><br><br>
