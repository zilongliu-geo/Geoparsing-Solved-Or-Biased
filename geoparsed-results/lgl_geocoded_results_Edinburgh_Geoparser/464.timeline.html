  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Drug addicts guilty of harassment. A pair of drug addicts who preyed on a vulnerable <span class="loc">Hounslow</span> resident have admitted harassment. <span class="per">John Lambe</span>, 23, and <span class="per">Matthew Evans</span>, 25, both from <span class="loc">Hounslow</span>, appeared in court charged with theft and harassment after repeatedly taking money from the 58-year-old, who suffers from learning difficulties. He revealed he needed money after <span class="loc">Lambe</span> and <span class="loc">Evans</span> convinced him to hand over his benefit cheque. PC <span class="per">Doug Moore</span>, of <span class="loc">Hounslow</span> safer neighbourhood team (SNT), issued the pair with a harassment warning notice to prevent them continuing their actions while he made further enquiries, and persuaded the victim to provide a statement. <span class="date">A month later</span> the victim told police the pair had taken money from him and they were arrested. <span class="per">Lambe</span> and <span class="per">Evans</span> appeared at Feltham Magistratesâ€™ Court on <span class="date">November 18</span>, where they pleaded not guilty and elected for trial at <span class="org">Crown Court</span>. However, after the victim gave evidence at <span class="org">Kingston Crown Court</span>, the men pleaded guilty. He is due to reappear at court on <span class="date">April 3</span>.</p><br><br>
