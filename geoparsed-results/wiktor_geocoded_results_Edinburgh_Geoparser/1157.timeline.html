  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">El Salvador</span> (/ɛl ˈsælvədɔːr/; Spanish: [el salβaˈðor]), officially the <span class="loc">Republic of El Salvador</span> (Spanish: República de <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>, literally "Republic of The Savior"), is the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central <span class="loc">America</span>. <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>'s capital and largest city is <span class="loc">San Salvador</span>. As of <span class="date">2015</span>, <span class="loc">El Salvador</span> had a population of approximately 6.38 million, making it the most densely populated country in the region. Its population consists largely of Mestizos of European and Indigenous American descent. <span class="loc">El Salvador</span> was for <span class="date">centuries</span> inhabited by several Mesoamerican nations, especially the Cuzcatlecs, as well as the <span class="loc">Lenca</span> and Maya. In the early 16th century, the Spanish Empire conquered the territory, incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New <span class="loc">Spain</span>. In <span class="date">1821</span>, the country achieved independence from <span class="loc">Spain</span> as part of the First Mexican Empire, only to further secede as part of <span class="org">the Federal Republic of Central</span> <span class="loc">America</span> in <span class="date">1823</span>. Upon the republic's dissolution in <span class="date">1841</span>, <span class="loc">El Salvador</span> became sovereign until forming a short-lived union with <span class="loc">Honduras</span> and <span class="loc">Nicaragua</span> called the Greater <span class="org">Republic of Central</span> <span class="loc">America</span>, which lasted from <span class="date">1895</span> to <span class="date">1898</span>.</p><br><br>
