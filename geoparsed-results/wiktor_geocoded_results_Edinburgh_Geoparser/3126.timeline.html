  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Shelton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Fairfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 39,559 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Shelton</span> was settled by the English as part of the town of <span class="loc">Stratford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, in <span class="date">1639</span>. On <span class="date">May 15, 1656</span>, the <span class="org">Court of the Colony of Connecticut in Hartford</span> affirmed that the town of <span class="loc">Stratford</span> included all of the territory 12 miles (19 km) inland from <span class="loc">Long Island Sound</span>, between the <span class="loc">Housatonic River</span> and the <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> town line. In <span class="date">1662</span>, <span class="loc">Stratford</span> selectmen <span class="per">Lt. Joseph Judson</span>, Captain <span class="per">Joseph Hawley</span> and <span class="per">John Minor</span> had secured all the written deeds of transfer from the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation for this vast territory that comprises the present-day towns of <span class="loc">Trumbull</span>, <span class="loc">Shelton</span> and <span class="loc">Monroe</span>. <span class="per">Shelton</span> was split off from <span class="loc">Stratford</span> in <span class="date">1789</span>, as <span class="per">Huntington</span> (named for <span class="per">Samuel Huntington</span>). The current name originated in a manufacturing village started in the 1860s named for the <span class="org">Shelton Company</span> founded by <span class="per">Edward N. Shelton</span> â€” also founder of Ousatonic Water Power Company. The rapidly growing <span class="loc">borough of Shelton</span> incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1915</span> and was consolidated with the town of <span class="per">Huntington</span> in <span class="date">1919</span> establishing the present <span class="loc">city of Shelton</span>.</p><br><br>
