  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hastings</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> on the <span class="loc">Mornington</span> Peninsula, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, as a part of the urban enclave on Western Port comprising <span class="loc">Hastings</span>, <span class="loc">Bittern</span>, <span class="loc">Crib Point</span>, <span class="loc">Tyabb</span>, and <span class="loc">Somerville</span>. Its local government area is the Shire of <span class="loc">Mornington</span> Peninsula. It is served by <span class="per">Hastings</span> railway station on the <span class="loc">Stony Point</span> greater-metropolitan line. <span class="per">Hastings</span> is situated on an inlet on Western Port, a major port and important environmental area. <span class="per">Hastings</span> has multiple marinas and is home to many recreational boating activities. <span class="per">Hastings</span> is thought to be named after a fishing town in <span class="loc">England</span> or the British imperial administrator <span class="per">Warren Hastings</span>. Previously known as Kingâ€™s Creek and <span class="loc">Star Point</span>, its post office opened on <span class="date">4 February 1863</span>. Settlement of the area dates from the 1840s, with fishing being the main industry. Growth took place from the 1850s into the 1870s as the township developed. Expansion continued in the late 1880s and 1890s, aided by the construction of the railway line and the establishment of many orchards. Significant residential development occurred during <span class="date">the 1960s and 1970s</span>, spurred by industrial growth and public housing construction. Growth began to slow from <span class="date">the 1980s</span>. The population has increased since <span class="date">the early 1990s</span>, a result of new dwellings being added to the area.</p><br><br>
