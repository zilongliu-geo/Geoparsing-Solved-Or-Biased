<p>Decatur lights up downtown. The aldermen approved a plan by Fire Chief Eddie Jewell to begin a Junior Firefighter program. The program is for boys and girls age 13 to 17. Jewell said the program will promote the volunteer service of the fire department while training young people so they can step up as volunteers when they become adults. Following the meeting, the aldermen met as the Beer Board to approve an application for carry-out package sales for The Tobacco Barn. The board approved the application with only one vote opposing it cast by Vice Mayor Ray Melton. The aldermen will meet again on Tuesday April 14.</p>
