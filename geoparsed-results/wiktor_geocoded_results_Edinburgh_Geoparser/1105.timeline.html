  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Chester</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Delaware County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with a population of 33,972 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Chester</span> is situated on the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River, between the <span class="loc">cities of Philadelphia and Wilmington</span>, <span class="loc">Delaware</span>. The first European settlers in the area were Swedes. They called the settlement that became <span class="loc">Chester</span> first "Finlandia" (the Latin name for <span class="loc">Finland</span>), then "Upland" (see the Swedish <span class="loc">province of Uppland</span> and the <span class="loc">borough of Upland</span>). They built Fort Mecoponacka in <span class="date">1641</span> to defend the settlement. By <span class="date">1682</span>, Upland was the most populous town of the new <span class="loc">Province of Pennsylvania</span>. On <span class="date">October 27</span>, the ship Welcome arrived at the town, bearing <span class="loc">William Penn</span> on his first visit to the province. <span class="loc">Penn</span> renamed the settlement for the English <span class="loc">city of Chester</span>. <span class="loc">Chester</span> served as the county seat for <span class="loc">Chester County</span>, which then stretched from the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River to the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span>. In <span class="date">1789</span>, the city became the county seat for the newly created <span class="loc">Delaware County</span> (whereupon <span class="loc">Chester County</span> became landlocked, with <span class="loc">West Chester</span> as its county seat), but the county seat was moved to the <span class="loc">borough of Media</span> in <span class="date">1851</span>. The courthouse is near the new City Hall building.</p><br><br>
