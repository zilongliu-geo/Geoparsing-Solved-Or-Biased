  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span>, affectionately called St. <span class="loc">Joe County</span> by locals, is an unincorporated community in German Township, <span class="loc">Vanderburgh County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and centered on <span class="per">St. Joseph</span> Catholic Church. Along with that of <span class="loc">Darmstadt</span>, its colonization marked the beginning of German-American immigration to southern <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. The area was chosen as a settlement for its rich farmland. The town is named after the church in its center, <span class="per">St. Joseph</span> Catholic Church. The church is named for the <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> the Carpenter, the father of Jesus. Unlike most other local communities, <span class="per">St. Joseph</span> has never had a railway station. The nickname "St. <span class="loc">Joe County</span>" originates from the fact that there are multiple churches by the name of <span class="per">St. Joseph</span> in the Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="loc">Evansville</span> and <span class="loc">Vincennes</span>, and different names were needed to distinguish one from the next in conversation and on paperwork. The church is referred to as "<span class="per">St. Joe</span> in the County", referring to the fact that the other <span class="per">St. Joseph</span> Catholic Churches are located in <span class="loc">Evansville</span> ("<span class="per">St. Joe</span> [in the] City") and Jasper "<span class="per">St. Joe</span> [in] Jasper"). The name is frequently truncated to "St. <span class="loc">Joe County</span>", and members of the diocese have come to know the town as "St. <span class="loc">Joe County</span>".</p><br><br>
