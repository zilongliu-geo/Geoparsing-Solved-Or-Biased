  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sorrento</span> is a township in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, located on the shores of <span class="loc">Port Phillip</span> on the <span class="loc">Mornington</span> Peninsula, about one and a half hours by car south of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. It is a largely upper-class, seaside resort area, but is also a quiet seaside township in the off-peak <span class="date">months</span> of the year. It was named by the Italian founders after the southern Italian town. In <span class="date">1803</span>, <span class="date">30 years</span> before the founding of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, <span class="loc">Sullivan Bay</span> in <span class="loc">Sorrento</span> became the site of Victoria's first mainland European settlement. Due to a lack of fresh water the settlement was short lived and subsequently moved to <span class="loc">Hobart</span> in <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>. Victoria's first magistrates' court, public hospital, postal service and government printing office were established in <span class="loc">Sorrento</span>. The first Victorian wedding, christening and funeral services were held at <span class="loc">Sullivan Bay</span>. The first settlement site overlooking <span class="loc">Sullivan Bay</span> includes graves believed to be of first settlers. <span class="org">Sorrento Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">10 January 1871</span>. A horse and steam powered tram which ran between the foreshore and the back beach opened in <span class="date">1890</span> and closed in <span class="date">1920</span>.</p><br><br>
