<p><span class="loc">Falmouth</span> (/ˈfælməθ/; <span class="loc">Cornish</span>: Aberfala) is a town, civil parish and port on the <span class="loc">River Fal</span> on the south coast of <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. It has a total resident population of 26,767. See also: Miss Susan Gay's <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> chronology The name <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> is of English origin, which recent Cornish language enthusiasts have translated to "Aberfal" (or "Aberfala") based on Welsh precedents. It is claimed that an earlier Celtic name for the place was Peny-cwm-cuic, which has been Anglicized to 'Pennycomequick'. <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> was the site where Henry VIII built <span class="loc">Pendennis Castle</span> to defend <span class="loc">Carrick Roads</span>, in 1540. The main town of the district was then at <span class="loc">Penryn</span>. Sir John Killigrew created the town of <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> shortly after 1613. In the late 16th century, under threat from the Spanish Armada, the defences at <span class="loc">Pendennis</span> were strengthened by the building of angled ramparts. During the Civil War, <span class="loc">Pendennis Castle</span> was the second to last fort to surrender to the Parliamentary Army. After the Civil War, Sir Peter Killigrew received Royal patronage when he gave land for the building of the Church of King Charles the Martyr, dedicated to Charles I, "the Martyr".</p>
