  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>For the town in <span class="loc">Erie County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, see <span class="org">Aurora</span>, <span class="loc">Erie County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> <span class="org">Aurora</span> is a village and college town in the town of <span class="loc">Ledyard</span>, <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The village had a population of 724 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Wells</span> College, an institution of higher education for women founded by <span class="per">Henry Wells</span> in <span class="date">1868</span>, is located in <span class="org">Aurora</span>. It became coeducational in <span class="date">2005</span>, and since then enrollment has risen. In <span class="date">1980</span>, its <span class="org">Aurora</span> Village-Wells College Historic District, with more than 50 contributing properties, was listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. From <span class="date">2001</span> to <span class="date">2007</span>, redevelopment of historic properties in the village by entrepreneur <span class="per">Pleasant Rowland</span> and the <span class="org">Aurora Foundation</span> earned compliments, as well as provoking citizen concern, a lawsuit joined by state and national preservation organizations, and national media attention. Indigenous peoples occupied the lakeshore and riverways in present-day <span class="loc">New York</span> for <span class="date">thousands of years</span>. Prior to European-American settlement, a <span class="per">major Cayuga</span> Indian village, Chonodote, stood near the present-day site of <span class="org">Aurora</span> village. It had permanent dwellings and the people cultivated fields for their staple crops of varieties of corn, beans and squash. Chonodote was destroyed by the Sullivan Expedition in <span class="date">1779</span> during the Revolutionary War, when the <span class="loc">Cayuga</span> were allies of the British army, in retaliation for raids by <span class="per">Joseph Brant</span> and his <span class="per">Mohawk</span> and <span class="per">Loyalist</span> forces mostly in the eastern <span class="loc">Mohawk Valley</span>. Most of the <span class="loc">Cayuga</span> went with other Iroquois nations to <span class="loc">Canada</span>, where their descendants are enrolled in the Six Nations Reserve. Some members of the <span class="per">Cayuga</span> tribe returned to the area after the war, but the tribe had been forced to cede its land to <span class="loc">New York</span>. They were left landless and shared space with the <span class="loc">Seneca</span> on their reservation that once included the north end of <span class="loc">Cayuga Lake</span>.</p><br><br>
