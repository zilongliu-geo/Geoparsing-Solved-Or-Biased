It is not to be confused with <span class="loc">Lake Poso</span>, which is some distance inland. With the total of population of over 40,000, Poso is one of the biggest and the oldest towns in the province. The central location of Poso has made it a stopover either from the north to the south, or from west to the east of Sulawesi. It is for this reason that the population of Poso consists of many different ethnicities, religions and backgrounds. People living in Poso are spread from the coastal area to the mountainous region, with the main sources of income being farming and fishing. Poso can be reached by plane from <span class="loc">Palu</span> or by bus from many other big <span class="loc">cities on Sulawesi</span>, and is situated on the equator. It features tropical rain forest, seashore gardens and other natural scenery.</p>
