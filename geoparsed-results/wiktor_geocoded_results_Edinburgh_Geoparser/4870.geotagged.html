<p>Dongtan is a plan for a new eco-city on the island of <span class="loc">Chongming</span> in Shanghai, <span class="loc">China</span>. Dongtan was planned to open, with accommodation for 10,000, in time for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. By 2050 the city was expected to be one-third the size of Manhattan, with a total planned population of 500,000. However, the project has fallen behind schedule, and no construction has taken place yet. <span class="loc">Arup</span>, the British engineering consultancy firm, was contracted in 2005 by the developer, The Shanghai Industrial Investment Company (SIIC), to design and masterplan Dongtan, an eco-city on <span class="loc">Chongming</span> Island close to Shanghai, the first of a planned series. Dongtan was presented at the United Nations World Urban Forum by <span class="loc">China</span> as an example of an eco-city, and is the first of up to four such cities to be designed and built in <span class="loc">China</span> by <span class="loc">Arup</span>. The cities are planned to be ecologically friendly, with zero-greenhouse-emission transit and complete self-sufficiency in water and energy, together with the use of zero energy building principles. Energy demand will be substantially lower than comparable conventional cities due to the high performance of buildings and a zero emission transport zone within the city. Waste is considered to be a resource and most of the city's waste will be recycled.</p>
