  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Norfolk</span> (/ˈnɔːrfᵿk/ NOR-fək, local /ˈnɒfʊk/ NOF-uuk) is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 242,803; in <span class="date">2015</span>, the population was estimated to be 247,189 making it the second-most populous city in Virginia, behind neighboring Virginia Beach. <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> is located at the core of the <span class="loc">Hampton Roads</span> metropolitan area, named for the large natural harbor of the same name located at the mouth of <span class="loc">Chesapeake</span> Bay. It is one of nine cities and seven counties that constitute the <span class="loc">Hampton Roads</span> metro area, officially known as the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA. The city is bordered to the west by the <span class="loc">Elizabeth River</span> and to the north by the <span class="loc">Chesapeake</span> Bay. It also shares land borders with the independent <span class="loc">cities of Chesapeake</span> to its south and Virginia Beach to its east. One of the oldest of the cities in <span class="loc">Hampton Roads</span>, <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> is considered to be the historic, urban, financial, and cultural center of the region. The city has a long history as a strategic military and transportation point. The largest Navy base in the world, Naval Station <span class="loc">Norfolk</span>, is located in <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> along with one of <span class="org">NATO</span>'s two Strategic Command headquarters. The city also has the corporate headquarters of <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> Southern Railway, one of <span class="loc">North America</span>'s principal Class I railroads, and <span class="org">Maersk Line, Limited</span>, which manages the world's largest fleet of US-flag vessels. As the city is bordered by multiple bodies of water, <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> has many miles of riverfront and bayfront property, including beaches on the <span class="loc">Chesapeake</span> Bay. It is linked to its neighbors by an extensive network of Interstate highways, bridges, tunnels, and three bridge-tunnel complexes—the only bridge-tunnels in the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p><br><br>
