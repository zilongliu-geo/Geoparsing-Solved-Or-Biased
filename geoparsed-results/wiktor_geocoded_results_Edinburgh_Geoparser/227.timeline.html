  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hamilton</span> (Salish: čɫc̓lc̓lé ) is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Ravalli County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,348 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Significant outlying population growth is shown in the area; the ZIP Code Tabulation Area for <span class="per">Hamilton</span>'s ZIP Code, 59840, had a population of 15,393 at the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau <span class="date">2009</span> estimate. <span class="per">Hamilton</span> was founded by copper king <span class="per">Marcus Daly</span> in the late 19th century. It was named for <span class="per">J.W. Hamilton</span>, who provided the right-of-way to the railroad. <span class="per">Daly</span> is said to have wanted to begin business in the then county seat of <span class="loc">Grantsdale</span>, but was denied the opportunity. He supposedly founded <span class="per">Hamilton</span> out of his own pocket as a reaction to being rebuffed at <span class="loc">Grantsdale</span>.
