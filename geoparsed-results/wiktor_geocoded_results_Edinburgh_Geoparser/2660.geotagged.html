<p>Paria /pəˈriːə/, (rhymes with "Maria") or <span class="loc">Pahreah</span>, is a ghost town on the <span class="loc">Paria River</span> in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in central <span class="loc">Kane County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was inhabited from 1870 to 1929, and later used as a filming location. The area was first settled in 1865 by a Mormon group led by Peter Shirts. This early settlement was named <span class="loc">Rockhouse</span>, for Shirts's strongly built sandstone house. After the end of the Black Hawk War in 1867 settlers began to arrive at a rapid pace. Farming produced good crops for several years, but irrigation was very difficult; each spring the surface runoff water was absorbed into the desert soil too quickly to properly water the fields. In 1870 the residents agreed to move the settlement. They divided in two groups; half the people went about 5 miles (8.0 km) upstream and founded the town of <span class="loc">Pahreah</span>. In 1871, John D. Lee came to the Paria area, fleeing investigators of the Mountain Meadows massacre. He constructed a dam and irrigation ditches with the help of many locals and passersby, including members of John Wesley Powell's second <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> expedition.</p>
