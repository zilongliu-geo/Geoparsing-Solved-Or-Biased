  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Norwood</span> is a suburb of Adelaide, about 4 km east of the <span class="loc">Adelaide city</span> centre. The suburb is in the <span class="loc">City of Norwood Payneham</span> &amp; <span class="loc">St Peters</span>, the oldest South Australian local government municipality, with a city population over 34,000. <span class="loc">Norwood</span> is named after <span class="loc">Norwood</span>, <span class="loc">London</span>. It was first laid out in <span class="date">1847</span>. The suburb consists of four segments, being divided into north and south by the major thoroughfare of The Parade and east and west by Osmond Terrace. It is bounded on the south by Kensington Road, on the north by Magill Road, on the east by Portrush Road and on the west by Fullarton Road. It is a leafy suburb many of whose streets are lined with plane trees and older houses, though in <span class="date">recent years</span>, due to a State Government initiative of "urban-infill", there have been more higher density (by Adelaide standards) developments. It is <span class="date">now</span> a sought-after suburb to live in, but this was not always the case. Osmond Terrace is a street with a wide median strip featuring a prominent war memorial commemorating ANZAC soldiers who fought in the first and second World Wars.</p><br><br>
