  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Whitney (formerly <span class="loc">East Las Vegas</span>) is an unincorporated town and census-designated place in <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 38,585 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Whitney, at one time, had its own identity, one of a few small communities between <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> and <span class="loc">Henderson</span> along Boulder Highway (which was <span class="loc">US</span> 93 and <span class="loc">US</span> 95 at the time). <span class="org">Whitney Elementary School</span> was a converted Barracks. It housed grades from first to seventh until <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, then the seventh graders were moved to <span class="loc">Henderson</span> Junior High. In the beginning <span class="date">years</span> the town boasted a Post Office operated by <span class="per">John</span> and <span class="per">Nellie</span> Bunch, owners of much of the Whitney property and surrounding areas. The town consisted of three streets running east and west: Whitney <span class="per">Avenue, Keenan</span> Avenue, and Missouri Avenue. Cross streets running north and south were 1st Street, 2nd Street, and 3rd Street. Among recognized businesses were <span class="per">Harry Gunn</span>'s Liquor Store, The Three Pigs Bar, Louise's Bar, The Exotica bar (with Sarah at the piano), the Wind N Sand Cafe, a gas station/market, a motel and a couple of trailer parks. High School students attended Basic High in <span class="loc">Henderson</span>. Even when phone service reached our little town, it was still long distance charges to <span class="loc">Henderson</span>. Still a segregated society, there were a couple of off-the-grid settements of black families who lived by <span class="loc">Duck Creek</span> at the outskirts of town.</p><br><br>
