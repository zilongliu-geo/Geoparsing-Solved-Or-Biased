<p><span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> is a city near the Southern <span class="loc">California</span> coast in Santa <span class="loc">Barbara County</span>. It is approximately 120 miles (190 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> (city limits). Its estimated 2014 population was 103,410, making it the most populous city in the county and the Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, CA Metro Area. The city is notable for its wine industry and Santa Maria-style barbecue. Sunset magazine called <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> "The West’s Best BBQ Town”. The <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> Valley, stretching from the <span class="loc">Santa Lucia Mountains</span> toward the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>, was the homeland of the Chumash people for several thousand years. The Native Americans made their homes on the slopes of the surrounding hills among the oaks, on the banks of the <span class="loc">Santa Maria River</span> among the sycamores, and along the coast. They had unique plank-built boats, called <span class="loc">Tomol</span>, which they used for ocean fishing. In 1769, the Portolá Expedition passed through the <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> Valley during the first Spanish land exploration up the coast of <span class="loc">Las Californias</span> Province. <span class="loc">Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa</span> was established just north of the valley in 1772, and Mission La Purísima Concepción was established near present-day <span class="loc">Lompoc</span> in 1787. Rather than rich soil, white settlers were attracted here by the possibility of free land. In 1821, after the Mexican War of Independence, the mission lands in <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> Valley were made available for private ownership under a Mexican land grant called Rancho Punta de Laguna. At the end of the Mexican War in 1848, <span class="loc">California</span> was ceded to the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p>
