<p><span class="loc">Trinidad</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [tɾiniˈðað]) is a town in the <span class="loc">province of Sancti Spíritus</span>, central <span class="loc">Cuba</span>. Together with the nearby Valle de los Ingenios, it has been one of UNESCOs World Heritage sites since 1988. <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> was founded on December 23, 1514 by Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar under the name Villa de la Santísima Trinidad. Hernán Cortés recruited men for his expedition from Juan de Grijalva's home in <span class="loc">Trinidad</span>, and Sancti Spíritus, at the start of his 1518 expedition. This included Pedro de Alvarado and his five brothers. After ten days, <span class="loc">Cortes</span> sailed, the alcayde Francisco Verdugo failing to prevent <span class="loc">Cortes</span> from leaving, despite orders from Diego Velázquez. Francisco Iznaga, a Basque landowner in the southern portion of <span class="loc">Cuba</span> during the first 30 years of the colonization of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, was elected Mayor of <span class="loc">Bayamo</span> in 1540. Iznaga was the originator of a powerful lineage which finally settled in <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> where the <span class="loc">Torre</span> <span class="loc">Iznaga</span> (<span class="loc">Iznaga Tower</span>) is. His descendants fought for the independence of <span class="loc">Cuba</span> and for annexation to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>, from 1820 to 1900.</p>
