<p>Burton is a small village with 103 households (2014) in the <span class="loc">Cotswolds</span> Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in <span class="loc">England</span>. Kelly's Directory of <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span> of 1915 identifies Burton as the most important part of the <span class="loc">parish of Nettleton</span>. It is about 8 miles (13 km) west of <span class="loc">Chippenham</span>. There is a record of Burton dating back to AD 1204, and more recently in Book 44 - <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span>, of the Topographical Collections of John Aubrey 1659-70. The modern community has an active Anglican church, St Mary's; the Burton Community Association, formed in 2014; and a public house, The <span class="loc">Old House</span> at Home. It is served by two nearby Church schools, Bybrook Valley CofE School in <span class="loc">Yatton Keynell</span> (4 miles) and Trinity CofE School in <span class="loc">Acton Turville</span> (1 mile), as well as Grittleton House private school (3 miles). The Church of St Mary the Virgin, which stands on the hill above the hamlet of Burton, is the oldest and most important building in the village, and is a Grade I listed building. The oldest parts of the Church date from about 1290 although little remains from that period. The Register of Incumbents dates back to 1305 when the Abbot of <span class="loc">Glastonbury</span> presented Johannes de Montacute to the living. The Manor and Advowson of Netlington belonged, until the Dissolution, to <span class="loc">Glastonbury</span> Abbey. The Church is now in the ByBrook Benefice in the rural deanery of <span class="loc">Chippenham</span>, archdeaconry of <span class="loc">Malmesbury</span>, and the present patron is the Bishop of Bristol.</p>
