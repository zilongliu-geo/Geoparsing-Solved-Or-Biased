  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Kenya</span>'s livestock minister, <span class="per">Mohammed Kuti</span>, said <span class="date">today</span> that cattle rustlers have killed eleven people near the central town of <span class="loc">Isiolo</span>. <span class="per">Kuti</span>, who is also the member of parliament for <span class="loc">Isiolo</span>, said the rustlers raided in a village in the area early in the day. "The eleven people were killed when rustlers stormed a village in Kisima area early this morning," he commented. The state-owned <span class="org">Kenya Broadcasting Corporation</span> puts the number of attackers at 300, and stated that they stole an unknown number of livestock. Cattle rustling is common in <span class="loc">Kenya</span>, and the extended drought has heightened competition for scarce sources of food. In mid-September, 30 people were killed in a shootout as rustlers from the Pokot tribe attacked the Samburu tribe and made off with hundreds of cattle.</p><br><br>
