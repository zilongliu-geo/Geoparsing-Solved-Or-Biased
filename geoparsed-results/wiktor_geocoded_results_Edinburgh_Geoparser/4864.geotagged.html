<p><span class="loc">Agua Prieta</span> (Opata: Bachicuy) is a town in <span class="loc">Agua Prieta</span> Municipality in the northeastern corner of the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Sonora</span> (31°19′33″N 109°32′56″W). It stands on the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>–<span class="loc">Mexico</span> border, adjacent to the town of <span class="loc">Douglas</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The municipality covers an area of 3,631.65 km² (1,402.2 sq mi). In the 2010 census the town had a population of 79,138 people, making it the seventh-largest community in the state, and a literacy rate of 96.3%. 89% of the homes in the city have electricity, 94% have running water, and 86% are connected to the sewer system. The city's most important economic activities, in descending order, are industry, commerce and farming. The city is the location of the CFE <span class="loc">Agua Prieta</span> power plant. <span class="loc">Agua Prieta</span> began growing at the end of the 19th century as railroads were built between <span class="loc">Douglas</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, and <span class="loc">Nacozari</span>, <span class="loc">Sonora</span>, to transport minerals. As a result, the first settlers of the town were those employed by the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> mining company Phelps Dodge Corporation, which was based in <span class="loc">Douglas</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. The town was founded in 1899 as the Commissary of <span class="loc">Fronteras</span>, but did not become an independent municipality with its current name until August 28, 1916. Rodolfo L. Márquez was the new municipality's first president. It rose to the status of villa (town) on May 8, 1933, and it was officially placed in the category of city relatively recently, on November 11, 1942.</p>
