  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Middleton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Dane County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a north-western suburb of the state capital, <span class="org">Madison</span>, but it was actually founded before <span class="org">Madison</span>. It got its name from <span class="loc">Middletown</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>; the "w" being dropped was due to a paperwork error made by longtime historian <span class="per">Edward Kromrey</span> (namesake of the local middle school). Middleton's motto is "The Good Neighbor City." The population was 17,442 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In <span class="date">July 2009</span>, <span class="org">CNN</span>/<span class="per">Money</span> and <span class="per">Money</span> magazine ranked <span class="loc">Middleton</span> the fourth best small town to live in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Since <span class="date">1990</span> there has been a population increase of over 20% in the <span class="loc">Madison metropolitan</span> area. This has led to <span class="loc">Middleton</span> being considered as the western hub of a proposed, albeit controversial, 13-mile (21 km) railroad corridor connecting Middleton's <span class="loc">Greenway</span> Station, the <span class="org">University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison</span> campus, downtown <span class="org">Madison</span>, and <span class="org">Madison</span>'s far east side. As of the census in <span class="date">2000</span>, there were 15,770 people living in <span class="loc">Middleton</span>, although in <span class="date">2006</span> that number was estimated to be as high as 16,595. The population density was 1,953.2 people per square mile (754.5/km2). There were 7,397 housing units at an average density of 916.2 per square mile (353.9/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 92.08% White, 1.97% Black or <span class="org">African American</span>, 0.45% Native American, 2.66% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 1.27% from other races, and 1.54% from two or more races. 2.82% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.</p><br><br>
