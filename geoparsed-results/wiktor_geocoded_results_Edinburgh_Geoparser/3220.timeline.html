  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wilton</span> is a town and civil parish in <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span> (of which it was once the county town), <span class="loc">England</span>, with a rich heritage dating back to the Anglo-Saxons. Carpets have been manufactured at <span class="loc">Wilton</span> since the 18th century. <span class="date">Today</span> it is overshadowed by its larger neighbour, <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, but still has a range of notable shops and attractions, including <span class="org">Wilton House</span>. The confluence of the rivers <span class="per">Wylye</span> and <span class="per">Nadder</span> is at <span class="loc">Wilton</span>. The history of <span class="loc">Wilton</span> dates back to the Anglo-Saxons in the <span class="date">8th century AD</span>, and by the late 9th century it was the capital of Wiltunscire, a shire of the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Wessex</span>. It remained the administrative centre of <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span> until the 11th century. <span class="loc">Wilton</span> was of significant importance to the church, with the founding of <span class="loc">Wilton</span> Abbey in AD 771 and a number of other establishments. In AD 871 Alfred the Great fought and lost an important battle there against the Danish armies, leaving him in retreat for <span class="date">several years</span>. Despite further attacks, <span class="loc">Wilton</span> remained a prosperous town, as recorded in the Domesday book. The building of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> Cathedral nearby, however, caused <span class="loc">Wilton</span>'s decline, as the new site of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, with a new bridge over the <span class="loc">River Avon</span>, provided a convenient bypass around <span class="loc">Wilton</span> on the trade routes.</p><br><br>
