  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Vale (Guernésiais: Lé Vale; French: Le Valle) is one of the ten <span class="loc">parishes of Guernsey</span>. In 933 the islands, formerly under the control of <span class="per">William I</span>, then Duchy of Brittany were annexed by the Duchy of <span class="loc">Normandy</span>. The island of <span class="loc">Guernsey</span> and the other <span class="loc">Channel Islands</span> represent the last remnants of the medieval Duchy of <span class="loc">Normandy</span>. Much of the Vale parish belonging to the fief <span class="loc">Saint Michael</span>, which benefited the Benedictine monks who lived in an abbey that had been built next to the Vale Church from when it was granted in <span class="date">1032</span> by Robert of <span class="loc">Normandy</span> who had apparently been caught in a storm and his ship had ended up safe in <span class="loc">Guernsey</span>. The rights to the fief were removed by <span class="per">Henry VIII</span> when he undertook <span class="org">the Dissolution of the Monasteries</span>. The Castle of <span class="loc">Saint Michael</span>, <span class="date">now</span> called Vale Castle, has an origin going back <span class="date">at least 1,000 years</span> and was used as a refuge against pirate attacks. In <span class="date">1117</span> there was a large ceremony to celebrate the finalisation of major works. In <span class="date">1372</span> Owain Lawgoch a claimant to the Welsh throne, at the head of a free company, on behalf of <span class="loc">France</span>, attacked <span class="loc">Guernsey</span>, popularly called “<span class="per">La Descente des Aragousais</span>”. Owain Lawgoch withdrew after killing 400 of the Island militia, The poem of the same name refers to the castle as the Château de l'Archange, the location of the last ditch stand against the insurgents.</p><br><br>
