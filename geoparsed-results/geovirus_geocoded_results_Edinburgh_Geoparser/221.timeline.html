  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The Sizzler Restaurant franchise in <span class="loc">Australia</span> has closed the salad bars in all of its 29 restaurants across the country, after rat poison was discovered in food at two of the chain's outlets in <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>. Self-serve salad bars at the restaurants have been closed in response to a sabotage scare. Sizzler <span class="loc">Australia</span> Managing Director <span class="per">Bo Ryan</span> said customer safety was always the restaurant chainâ€™s first priority. A media release on the Sizzler website states: "As a precautionary measure and because customer health and safety is our number one priority, we have temporarily closed salad bars in all Sizzler Restaurants. We sincerely apologise for this major inconvenience." Police said green pellets were found in pasta sauce at a Sizzler restaurant in Brisbane's inner-west on <span class="date">January 20</span>. A regular customer at the Toowong restaurant told Sizzler staff she had found something odd in her bolognese pasta sauce. Similar pellets were found in a vegetable soup at <span class="org">Sizzler's Myer Centre</span> outlet in the city about 5pm on <span class="date">Saturday</span>. <span class="per">Bo Ryan</span> said the decision to close all of its Australian salad bars was made after laboratory tests confirmed that the substance in the pasta sauce was indeed rat poison. He said trainees who tasted the poisoned soup had been been taken to hospital by ambulance as a precaution, but had suffered no ill effects. Queensland Police Inspector <span class="per">Bob Hytch</span> said no one had been reported ill as a result of eating the poisoned food and there had been no extortion threats. <span class="per">Sarah Kenny</span>, a university student, said she and two friends had eaten spaghetti bolognese that "tasted really weird". "The inconvenience to customers and the economic impact on the company and its 1600 employees will be severe, but as a family restaurant our first priority is the welfare of our diners," said <span class="per">Bo Ryan</span>. "Steak and seafood and a limited range of salads would continue to be available." He hopes that customers will understand the action was taken in their best interests, and that "they can be patient while temporary product security procedures are developed and implemented in all restaurants." The 29 Australian Sizzler Restaurants, along with 107 Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets are operated by the Collins Foods Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Worldwide Restaurant Concepts Inc. <span class="per">Mr Ryan</span> said Sizzler was assessing measures which could be taken to prevent a recurrence of the sabotage. "As soon as new measures are introduced, over and above existing strict protocols, we will reassess the situation," he said.</p><br><br>
