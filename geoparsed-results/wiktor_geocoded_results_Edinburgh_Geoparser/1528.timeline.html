  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Valencia</span> is a 2nd class component city in the <span class="loc">province of Bukidnon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city has a population of 181,556 people. <span class="loc">Valencia</span> attained its city status after the ratification of Republic Act 8985 in <span class="date">January 12, 2001</span>. The city is the most populous among all cities and municipalities, and the 6th largest in terms of area in the <span class="loc">province of Bukidnon</span>. It is also the most populous inland city/municipality in <span class="loc">Mindanao</span>. The territory that <span class="date">now</span> comprises the <span class="loc">city of Valencia</span> were former thirteen Barangays of the <span class="loc">City of Malaybalay</span>, <span class="loc">Bukidnon</span>. The earliest inhabitants in the area presently comprising part of the <span class="loc">Poblacion</span> were Bukidnon natives who founded a settlement along the banks of <span class="loc">Pulangi River</span> and the confluence of the <span class="loc">Panglibatuhan</span> River. The pioneers were led by <span class="loc">Datu</span> <span class="per">Sebastian Manangkila</span> together with the families of the Binalhays, Laugas, Dongogans, Gua-ans, Lanayans, and the Arenzos. The first site of the settlement was a sitio named “<span class="loc">Panglibatuhan</span>” because the area was thickly forested by tree species called by the natives as “Malibato trees”. In <span class="date">1911</span>, on-room barrio school was opened, and its first teacher was the late <span class="per">Leon Galorport</span>. That school site is approximately the present location of the <span class="org">Poblacion Barangay High School</span>. <span class="per">Galorport</span>, who came from his hometown, <span class="loc">Valencia</span>, <span class="loc">Bohol</span> named the school “<span class="org">Valencia School</span>”. When the sitio became a barrio of <span class="loc">Malaybalay</span>, the resident agreed to name it “<span class="loc">Valencia</span>”. Finally, when the southern portion of <span class="loc">Malaybalay</span> was separated as a new municipality, the petitioners agreed to name the municipality as “<span class="loc">Valencia</span>”. The barrio which was <span class="loc">Valencia</span> is <span class="date">now</span> Barangay <span class="loc">Poblacion</span> and is the seat of the city government of <span class="loc">Valencia</span>.</p><br><br>
