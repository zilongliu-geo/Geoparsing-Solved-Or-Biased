<p><span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is a locality in the <span class="loc">ward of Farringdon</span> Without situated at the <span class="loc">City of London</span>'s northwest in central <span class="loc">London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The principal street of the area is <span class="loc">West Smithfield</span>. A number of valued City institutions are located in the area, such as St Bartholomew's Hospital, the <span class="loc">Charterhouse</span>, and Livery Halls notably those of the Butchers' and Haberdashers' Companies, but <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is best known for its ancient meat market, dating from the 10th century, which is now <span class="loc">London</span>'s only remaining wholesale market in continuous operation since medieval times. The area also contains <span class="loc">London</span>'s oldest surviving church, St Bartholomew-the-Great, founded in 1123 AD. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> has borne witness to many bloody executions of heretics and political rebels over the centuries, including major historical figures such as Scottish patriot Sir William Wallace and Wat Tyler, leader of the Peasants' Revolt, among many other religious reformers and dissenters. Smithfield Market, a Grade II listed-covered market building, was designed by Victorian architect Sir Horace Jones in the second half of the 19th century, and is the dominant architectural feature of the area. Some of its original market premises fell in to disuse in the late 20th century and faced the prospect of demolition. The Corporation of London's public enquiry in 2012 drew widespread support for an urban regeneration plan intent upon preserving Smithfield's historical identity.</p>
