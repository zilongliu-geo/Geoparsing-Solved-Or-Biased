  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hastings</span> is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Adams County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 24,907 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is known as the town where Kool-Aid was invented by <span class="per">Edwin Perkins</span> in <span class="date">1927</span>, and celebrates that event with the Kool-Aid <span class="date">Days</span> festival every <span class="date">August</span>. <span class="loc">Hastings</span> is also known for Fisher Fountain, and during World War II operated the largest Naval Ammunition Depot in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Hastings</span> was founded in <span class="date">1872</span> at the intersection of the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and <span class="loc">Missouri River Railroad</span> and the St. <span class="per">Joseph</span> and <span class="per">Denver</span> City Railroad. It was named for Colonel D. T. <span class="loc">Hastings</span> of the St. <span class="per">Joseph</span> and Grand Island Railroad, who was instrumental in building the railroad through <span class="loc">Adams County</span>. The area was previously open plain: the Donner party passed through on its way to <span class="loc">California</span> in <span class="date">1846</span> and a pioneer cemetery marker in <span class="loc">Hastings</span> bears an inscription taken from <span class="loc">Tamsen</span> Donner's journal: "The country between the Blue and the <span class="loc">Platte</span> is beautiful beyond compare. Never have I seen so varied a country so suitable to cultivation." In the 1870s, railroads lured European immigrants to the new state of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> with advertisements. <span class="loc">Hastings</span>' first settlers were English, from <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>, and were quickly joined by other English, Irish, <span class="loc">Germans</span>, <span class="loc">Danes</span>, and <span class="loc">Germans</span> from <span class="loc">Russia</span>.</p><br><br>
