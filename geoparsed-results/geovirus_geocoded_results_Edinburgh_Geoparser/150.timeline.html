  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Reuters</span> reports that nine people have died from <span class="loc">Ebola</span> in the Republic of Congo <span class="date">this month</span>. The outbreak is in the <span class="loc">Cuvette-Ouest region</span> near the <span class="loc">Gabon</span> border, where a previous outbreak occurred in <span class="date">2003</span>. The government of Congo and the United Nations World Health Organization have announced a quarantine of the <span class="loc">Etoumbi</span> and <span class="loc">Mbomo</span> districts. They are monitoring 84 suspected cases in the two regions. Jean-Vivien <span class="per">Mombouli</span>, adviser to the <span class="org">Congolese Ministry of Health</span>, pointed out the individuals may not actually have the virus; only one confirmed case of <span class="loc">Ebola</span> has been diagnosed thus far. "We will wait for <span class="date">21 days</span> just to be sure then after that, if the person does not get sick, he is out of danger," <span class="per">Mr. Mombouli</span> said of the patients. <span class="loc">Ebola</span> has a five to <span class="date">ten day</span> incubation period. Neighbouring <span class="loc">Uganda</span> has stepped up its surveillance in response to the outbreak. No cure exists for <span class="loc">Ebola</span>, and between 50-90% of those who contract it die. <span class="loc">Zaire</span>/Congo has sustained the largest number, and most severe, outbreaks of the Ebola virus. Although no cure exists, work continues on a vaccine and it is in the human trial stages, as well as research into pharmaceutical treatments.</p><br><br>
