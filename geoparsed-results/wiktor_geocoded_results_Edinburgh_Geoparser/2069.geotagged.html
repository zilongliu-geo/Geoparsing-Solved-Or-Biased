<p><span class="loc">Lexington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">McLean County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,060 at the 2010 census. There are two theories regarding the etymology of the city name. One says it was named for the Battle of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, where General Gridley's father fought. and the other that it was named for the home town of James Brown, the town's co-founder. <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was laid out on 4 January 1836 by Asahel Gridley (1810â€“1881) and James Brown (c. 1802- ?). Gridley was a lawyer and banker from <span class="loc">Bloomington</span> who would eventually become the richest man in <span class="loc">McLean County</span>; Brown was born in <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, and <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, seems to have been his only attempt at founding a town. Its founding was part of a great real estate boom that swept across the nation. Within a few months of the founding of the town seven other new towns were laid out in <span class="loc">McLean County</span>: Concord (now <span class="loc">Danvers</span>), Hudson, <span class="loc">Le Roy</span>, <span class="loc">Livingston</span>, Lytleville, Mt. Hope and Wilksborough. In common with other towns founded during the 1836 boom, and unlike many later towns, <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was designed around a central public square with streets running true north-south and east-west. In the case of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, the original town consisted of 36 blocks, each containing six lots. Like most of the towns of the 1836 era the town was built along the line that divided woodland from prairie; the southeast corner of the town was just within the limits of timber. Like most <span class="loc">Mackinaw River</span> towns, <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was laid out on higher ground some distance from the river itself.</p>
