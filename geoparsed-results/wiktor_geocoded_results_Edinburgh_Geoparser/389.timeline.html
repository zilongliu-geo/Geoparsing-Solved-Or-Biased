  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Lincoln is a city in <span class="loc">Placer County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, part of the <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> metropolitan area. Located in an area of rapid suburban development, it grew 282.1 percent between <span class="date">2000</span> and <span class="date">2010</span>, making it the fastest growing city over 10,000 people in the <span class="loc">U.S</span>. Its <span class="date">2015</span> population was estimated to be 45,837. Lincoln is part of the <span class="loc">Sacramento-Roseville Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The original townsite was surveyed and laid out in <span class="date">1859</span> by <span class="per">Theodore Judah</span> along the proposed line of the <span class="loc">California</span> Central Railroad. The name "Lincoln" was conferred in honor of <span class="per">Charles Lincoln Wilson</span>, one of the organizers and directors of the <span class="loc">California</span> Central Railroad. The CCRR was planned as a rail link between the <span class="loc">cities of Marysville and Sacramento</span> via a connection to the <span class="loc">Sacramento Valley Railroad</span> in <span class="loc">Folsom</span>. Grading from <span class="loc">Folsom</span> to <span class="loc">Marysville</span> commenced in <span class="date">1858</span> and was completed to <span class="loc">Marysville</span> by <span class="date">1860</span>. Track laying began that same year and the rails reached the site of Lincoln in <span class="date">early 1861</span>. At this point, due to a lack of funds, further construction on the <span class="loc">California</span> Central was temporarily halted and Lincoln experienced a small-scale boom as the northern terminus of this new road. Within <span class="date">a few years</span>, however, more investors were found and the line was extended to <span class="loc">Wheatland</span>, in <span class="loc">Yuba County</span>, bringing an end to this early stage of Lincoln's development.</p><br><br>
