<p><span class="loc">Dundee</span> /ˈdʌndiː/ is a city in <span class="loc">Yamhill County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,162 at the 2010 census. The first post office in the area was Ekins, established in 1881. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> is named in honor of the birthplace of William Reid, <span class="loc">Dundee</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. Reid came to <span class="loc">Oregon</span> in 1874 to establish the Oregonian Railway, and made several extensions to the railroad in the western <span class="loc">Willamette Valley</span>. The Ekins post office was closed in 1885 and a new office opened in 1887, named "<span class="loc">Dundee</span> Junction". The name derived from plans to build a bridge across the <span class="loc">Willamette River</span> for the railroad, which would have called for a junction at <span class="loc">Dundee</span> between the west railroad and the new east railroad. The bridge was never built, however, and the post office was renamed "<span class="loc">Dundee</span>" in 1897. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.35 square miles (3.50 km2), of which, 1.33 square miles (3.44 km2) is land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) is water.</p>
