  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Paloma, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> is an unincorporated community in Honey Creek Township, <span class="loc">Adams County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Its main auxiliary route is <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 24 and is within two miles of <span class="loc">Coatsburg</span>, another rural community. During <span class="date">the early 1900s</span> the village was famous for its pickle production and was often nicknamed "Pickleville" because of the vast pickle farms. Paloma is part of the Quincy, IL–MO <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. Paloma is located at 40°1′22″N 91°11′43″W (40.022778°, -91.195278°). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) 62359 includes and surrounds the community. For the 62359 ZCTA in the <span class="date">2000</span> census, which includes Paloma, there were 192 people, 76 households, and 63 families residing in the area. The community was once known as <span class="loc">Pickleville</span>. Local producers shipped pickles to Quincy off a rail platform about a mile west of the present Paloma. <span class="per">Daniel Gooding</span>, an early settler, offered to build the railroad a depot and platform if it would move the Pickleville platform to the town he platted on his land. The railroad agreed, <span class="loc">Gooding</span> built the depot and a railroad conductor's wife was responsible for changing the name of the community, deciding <span class="loc">Pickleville</span> wasn't very fitting. She named it after a small tribe of Indians, the Paloma, a term which is also Spanish for dove.</p><br><br>
