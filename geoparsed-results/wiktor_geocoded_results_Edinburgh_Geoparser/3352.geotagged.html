<p>Mission, the core of which was formerly a separate municipality known as <span class="loc">Mission City</span>, is a district municipality in the Lower Mainland region of the <span class="loc">province of British Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is situated on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Fraser River</span> where it backs onto mountains and lakes overlooking the Central <span class="loc">Fraser</span> Valley eighty kilometres east-southeast of <span class="loc">Vancouver</span>. Mission is the 23rd largest municipality in British Columbia, with a population of 36,426 (2011). Unlike the other <span class="loc">Fraser</span> Valley municipalities, Mission is mostly forested upland with only small floodplains lining the shore of the <span class="loc">Fraser River</span>. Some benches of farmland rise in succession northwards above the core developed area of the city. Mission was once the heart of the berry industry in the <span class="loc">Fraser</span> Valley, with "Home of the Big Red Strawberry" as Mission's slogan in the 1930s and into the 1940s. The more southerly portion of the municipality is bounded on the west by the lower reaches of the Stave River, which consists mostly of the lakewaters of two hydroelectric reservoirs, <span class="loc">Stave Lake</span> and <span class="loc">Hayward Lake</span>. Although the vast majority of the population of Mission lives well to the east of the Stave, over 50% of the northern land area of the municipality is west and north of that river; its extreme northwest corner is on the far side of upper <span class="loc">Alouette</span> Lake. A small portion of the lower Stave still runs free in its last two miles before its confluence with the <span class="loc">Fraser</span> at <span class="loc">Ruskin</span>; its last three-quarters of a mile forms the border with the larger municipality of Maple Ridge to the west.</p>
