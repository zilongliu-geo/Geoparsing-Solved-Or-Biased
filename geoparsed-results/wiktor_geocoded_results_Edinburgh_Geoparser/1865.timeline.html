  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tete</span> is the capital <span class="loc">city of Tete</span> Province in <span class="loc">Mozambique</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Zambezi River</span>, and is the site of two of the four bridges crossing the river in <span class="loc">Mozambique</span>. <span class="per">A Swahili</span> trade center before the Portuguese colonial era, <span class="loc">Tete</span> continues to dominate the west-central part of the country and region, and is the largest city on the <span class="loc">Zambezi</span>. In the local language, <span class="loc">Nyungwe</span>, <span class="loc">Tete</span> (or <span class="loc">Mitete</span>) means "reed." The region was an important <span class="per">Swahili</span> trade center before the Portuguese colonial era. On the east coast of <span class="loc">Africa</span> the Portuguese were drawn to <span class="loc">Mozambique</span> and the <span class="loc">Zambezi</span> river by news of a local ruler, the Munhumutapa, who was said to have had fabulous wealth in gold. In their efforts to reach the Munhumutapa, the Portuguese established in <span class="date">1531</span> two settlements far up the <span class="loc">Zambezi</span> – one of them, at <span class="loc">Tete</span>, some 260 miles from the sea. The Munhumutapa Kingdom and gold mines remained autonomous and mostly isolated from the Portuguese. But in this region of east <span class="loc">Africa</span> – as in <span class="loc">Portuguese Guinea</span> and <span class="loc">Angola</span> in the west – Portuguese involvement became sufficiently strong to survive into <span class="date">the third quarter</span> of the 20th century. Under Portuguese influence <span class="loc">Tete</span> had become a market centre for ivory and gold by the mid-17th century. Given a Portuguese town charter in <span class="date">1761</span>, it became a city of the Portuguese Overseas Province of <span class="loc">Mozambique</span> in <span class="date">1959</span>. After the <span class="org">Portuguese Colonial War</span> in Portuguese <span class="loc">Africa</span> and the <span class="date">April 1974</span> military coup in <span class="loc">Lisbon</span>, the then Portuguese Overseas Province of <span class="loc">Mozambique</span> become an independent state. The newly independent <span class="loc">People's Republic of Mozambique</span>, created in <span class="date">1975</span> after the exodus of <span class="loc">Mozambique</span>'s ethnic Portuguese, descended into civil war between <span class="date">1977</span> and <span class="date">1992</span>.</p><br><br>
