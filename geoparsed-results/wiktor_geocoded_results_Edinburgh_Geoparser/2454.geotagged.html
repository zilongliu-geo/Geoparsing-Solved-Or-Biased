<p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span> with a population of 60,218 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Murphysboro, and its most populous city is <span class="loc">Carbondale</span>, home to the main campus of Southern Illinois University. The county was incorporated on January 10, 1816 and named for Andrew Jackson. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is included in the Carbondale-Marion, <span class="loc">IL Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is located in the southern portion of <span class="loc">Illinois</span> known locally as "<span class="loc">Little Egypt</span>". Human occupation of <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> began about 11,500 years ago. Extensive documentation of the areas indigenous peoples has been conducted and is ongoing. Exploration from the European explorers began with the Joliet-Marquette exploration along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. It was not until the 18th and 19th century when pioneer farmers began to settle in the area's inexpensive land along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River and in the forested Shawnee hills with its one-hundred-foot trees. As early as 1813, Conrad Will, namesake of <span class="loc">Will County</span>, conducted a large salt extraction operation using slave labor on the banks of the <span class="loc">Big Muddy River</span>, south of today's Murphysboro. As this was in the "free" Northwest Territory, Will had to have a legal exemption to own slaves.</p>
