<p><span class="loc">Baltimore</span> (/ˈbɔːltᵻˌmɔːr/, locally: [ˈbɔɫ.mɔɻ]) is the largest city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, and the 26th-most populous city in the country. It is the largest independent city in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> has more public monuments than any other city per capita in the country and is home to some of the earliest National Register historic districts in the nation, including Fell's Point (1969), Federal Hill (1970) and Mount Vernon Place (1971). More than 65,000 properties, or roughly one in three buildings in the city, are listed on the National Register, more than any other city in the nation. Founded in 1729, <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> is the second largest seaport in the Mid-Atlantic. Baltimore's Inner Harbor was once the second leading port of entry for immigrants to the <span class="loc">United States</span> and a major manufacturing center. After a decline in major manufacturing, industrialization and rail transportation, <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> shifted to a service-oriented economy, with the Johns Hopkins Hospital (founded 1889), and Johns Hopkins University (founded 1876), now the city's top two employers.</p>
