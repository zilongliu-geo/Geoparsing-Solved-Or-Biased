<p><span class="loc">Farmington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The community is nestled in a valley among the <span class="loc">Boston</span> Mountains, a subset of the <span class="loc">Ozark</span> Mountains. Although the first settlers came from the Deep South in 1828, the community did not incorporate until 1946. Located immediately west of <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span> in the <span class="loc">Northwest Arkansas metropolitan</span> statistical area, <span class="loc">Farmington</span> has been experiencing a population boom in recent years, as indicated by a 66% growth in population between the 2000 and 2010 censuses. It has been characterized as a bedroom community by the University of Arkansas Community Design Center. The first settlers came from the Deep South in 1828, and the area was known as Engel's Mill until a post office was built in 1868 and the village was renamed. The Civil War was rough on the community, as many residents were Confederate sympathizers despite most of northwest <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> supporting the Union. The Battle of Prairie Grove occurred not far from <span class="loc">Farmington</span>, and the city was subject to raids by both armies as well as unaffiliated guerrillas and roughnecks. Around the 1890s, residents found prosperity by growing strawberries and grapes and shipping them on the St. Louisâ€“San Francisco Railway. The tracks were pulled up during World War II, something the company had wanted to do for years, under the guise of the war effort. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> was incorporated on October 15, 1946.</p>
