<p>Lawrence is a city in <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, on the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 76,377, which had risen to an estimated 78,197 as of 2014. Surrounding communities include <span class="loc">Methuen</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Andover</span> to the southwest, and <span class="loc">North Andover</span> to the southeast. Lawrence and Salem are the county seats of <span class="loc">Essex County</span>. Lawrence is part of the Merrimack Valley. Manufacturing products of the city include electronic equipment, textiles, footwear, paper products, computers, and foodstuffs. Lawrence was the residence of poet Robert Frost for his early school years; his essays and poems were first published in the Lawrence High School newspaper. Native Americans, namely the Pennacook or Pentucket tribe, had a presence in this area. Evidence of farming at Den Rock Park and arrowhead manufacturing on the site of where the <span class="loc">Wood Mill</span> now sits have been discovered. Europeans first settled the <span class="loc">Haverhill</span> area in 1640, colonists from <span class="loc">Newbury</span> following the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span> in from the coast. The area that would become Lawrence was then part of <span class="loc">Methuen</span> and <span class="loc">Andover</span>. The first settlement came in 1655 with the establishment of a blockhouse in Shawsheen Fields, now South Lawrence.</p>
