<p>Bethany is an unincorporated village in the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Ontario</span>, within the single-tier municipality of <span class="loc">Kawartha Lakes</span>. Bethany is centred on Highway 7A. It is located a few kilometers west of <span class="loc">Peterborough</span>, the largest city in the area. It is a gateway community, in that it services the local winter sport ski hill <span class="loc">Devil's Elbow</span> just a few kilometers north of the village. Since 2000 there has been significant real-estate development, mostly in the form of individual dwellings. To the north are downhill and cross-country ski areas, mostly accessible by paved county roads. By 1869, Bethany was a village with a population of 300 in the Township of <span class="loc">Manvers</span>, then part of <span class="loc">Durham County</span>. It was a station of the <span class="loc">Port Hope</span>, <span class="loc">Lindsay</span> and <span class="loc">Beaverton Railway</span>. Since a stream passing through the village afforded power for machinery, it was a good position for a foundry, agricultural implement works and a tannery. The average cost of improved lands was $35 per acre while wild lands were valued at $23. Bethany Public Library is part of the <span class="loc">City of Kawartha Lakes Public Library System</span>, which offers computer access as well as ongoing free programs. The library is in the same building as the municipal offices.</p>
