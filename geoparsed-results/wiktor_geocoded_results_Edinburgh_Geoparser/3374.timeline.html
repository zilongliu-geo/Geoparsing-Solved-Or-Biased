  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Berkeley</span> is a village located in <span class="loc">Cook County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Incorporated in <span class="date">1924</span>, the population at the <span class="date">2010</span> census was 5,209. The town has a commuter railroad station on <span class="org">Metra's Union Pacific</span>/<span class="loc">West Line</span> with service to downtown <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> is on <span class="loc">Cook County</span>'s western border, 14 miles west of the <span class="loc">Chicago Loop</span>. With Interstates 290 and 294 forming its western and part of its southern boundary, and the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific Railroad (formerly the <span class="loc">Chicago</span> &amp; <span class="loc">North Western</span>) and the large Proviso Railyard (a classification yard) to the north, <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> has ready access to the metropolitan region. Yet the transportation corridors that make <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> accessible to distant places also serve to separate the village from its nearest neighbors, creating a small-town atmosphere. <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> is located at 41°53′12″N 87°54′38″W (41.886794, -87.910528). According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> has a total area of 1.4 square miles (3.63 km2), all land. Beginning in <span class="date">1835</span> the area that was to become <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> was home to farmers, most of German and Dutch ancestry. Settling on farms that ranged from 40 to 160 acres, the Dutch tended to be truck farmers, while the Germans did general farming. This small group of farm families established a one-room school called <span class="loc">Sunnyside</span> in <span class="date">1848</span>. <span class="date">Now</span> housed in a larger and newer building, <span class="org">Sunnyside Elementary School</span> still operates <span class="date">today</span>. A short distance west on <span class="per">St. Charles</span> Road (which was completed in <span class="date">1836</span>), farmland was donated for what is <span class="date">now</span> known as Old Settler's Cemetery.</p><br><br>
