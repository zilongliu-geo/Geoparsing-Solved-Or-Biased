<p>Madison (formerly <span onClick="goto_name('Norridgewock')" class="loc">Norridgewock</span>) is a town in <span onClick="goto_name('Somerset County')" class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Maine')" class="loc">Maine</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('United States')" class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,855 at the 2010 census. The area was once territory of the <span onClick="goto_name('Norridgewock')" class="loc">Norridgewock</span> Indians, a band of the Abenaki nation. Early visitors describe extensive fields cleared for cultivation. The tribe also fished the <span onClick="goto_name('Kennebec River')" class="loc">Kennebec River</span>. French Jesuits established an early mission at the village, which was located at <span onClick="goto_name('Old Point')" class="loc">Old Point</span>. But Father Sebastien Rale (or Rasle), appointed missionary in 1694, was suspected of abetting the tribe's raids on English settlements. Governor Joseph Dudley put a price on his head. British troops attacked the village in 1705 and again in 1722, but both times Father Rale escaped into the woods. But on August 23, 1724, during Father Rale's War, soldiers attacked the village unexpectedly, killing 26 warriors and wounding 14, with 150 survivors fleeing to <span onClick="goto_name('Canada')" class="loc">Canada</span>. Among the dead was Father Rale. Settled by English colonists about 1773, the land would be surveyed in 1791. In 1775, Benedict Arnold and his troops would march through <span onClick="goto_name('Norridgewock')" class="loc">Norridgewock</span> Plantation, as it was known, on their way to the ill-fated Battle of <span onClick="goto_name('Quebec')" class="loc">Quebec</span>. The town had originally been settled under the name "<span onClick="goto_name('Norridgewock')" class="loc">Norridgewock</span> Falls." This was later changed to "Bernardstown," after the major land owning family, the Bernards. It was then officially incorporated on March 7, 1804, the town was named after <span onClick="goto_name('United States')" class="loc">United States</span> president James Madison. Farming was an early industry, with hay and cattle the principal products. The native rock is slate, and a quarry was established to extract it. Because of the region's abundant forests, lumbering developed as an industry, with four sawmills operated by water power on the <span onClick="goto_name('Kennebec')" class="loc">Kennebec</span>. Here the <span onClick="goto_name('Norridgewock')" class="loc">Norridgewock</span> Falls drop 90 feet (27 m) over a mile, which attracted other manufacturers as well. In the 19th century, the small mill town had factories which produced carriages, window sash, window blinds, doors and coffins.</p>
