  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Swansea</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Bristol County</span> in southeastern <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. It is located at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Taunton River</span>, just west of <span class="loc">Fall River</span>, 47 miles (76 km) south of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, and 12 miles (19 km) southeast of Providence, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. The population was 15,865 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The villages of <span class="per">Hortonville</span> and <span class="per">Ocean</span> Grove are located in the town. <span class="loc">Swansea</span> was named for the Welsh <span class="loc">city of Swansea</span>, which had been the hometown of some original settlers. <span class="per">John Miles</span>, the founder of the first Baptist Church in <span class="loc">Wales</span>, moved to <span class="loc">Swansea</span> in <span class="date">1662</span>/3. <span class="per">William Brenton</span> had purchased the land from Native Americans. Parts of its territory were originally part of <span class="loc">Rehoboth</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. In <span class="date">1667</span> the first Baptist church in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> relocated to <span class="loc">Swansea</span> from <span class="loc">Rehoboth</span> after experiencing religious intolerance there, and <span class="loc">Swansea</span> was incorporated as an independent town. On <span class="date">June 20, 1675</span>, the first Indian attack of <span class="per">King Philip</span>'s War had all 70 settlers confined to their stockade. By <span class="date">June 25</span> the entire town had been burned, although a handful of the colonists escaped to <span class="loc">Taunton</span>. When the active war ended in <span class="date">1676</span>, the town was soon rebuilt.</p><br><br>
