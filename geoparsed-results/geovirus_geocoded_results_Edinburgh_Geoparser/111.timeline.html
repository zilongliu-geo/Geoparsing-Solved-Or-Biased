  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has asked countries neighbouring <span class="loc">Turkey</span>, specifically mentioning <span class="loc">Armenia</span>, <span class="loc">Azerbaijan</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">Iraq</span>, <span class="loc">Iran</span>, and <span class="loc">Syria</span>, to be cautious and take measures to prevent the avian flu, H5N1, from spreading. The <span class="org">UN</span> also warned that civilians in these countries should be given more information about the disease. Two people have died in <span class="loc">Turkey</span> so far, possibly a third, and more hospitalized, after contracting the flu virus. All 15 confirmed cases in <span class="loc">Turkey</span> had close contact with birds. As of <span class="date">now</span>, the H5N1 virus strain does not pass easily to humans and does not spread at all between humans.</p><br><br>
