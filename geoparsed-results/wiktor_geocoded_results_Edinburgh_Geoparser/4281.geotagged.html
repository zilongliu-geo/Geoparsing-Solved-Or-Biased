<p><span class="loc">Bagdad</span>, <span class="loc">Tamaulipas</span>, <span class="loc">Mexico</span> was a town established in 1848 on the south bank of the mouth of the RÃ­o <span class="loc">Grande</span>. Moreover, this town is also known as the Port of <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> or the Port of <span class="loc">Matamoros</span>, since it is inside the municipality of <span class="loc">Matamoros</span>, <span class="loc">Tamaulipas</span>. Officially declared non-existent in 1880, it is now invisible, covered by the shifting sands of time. A major player in the American Civil War, today few realize it even existed, nor its vital importance to the Confederacy in its struggle against the North. One of the first appearances of <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> was on a map entitled "Map of the Country Adjacent to the Left Bank of the Rio Grande Below <span class="loc">Matamoros</span>, 1847." Cotton was the "white gold" that would sustain the Confederacy during the Civil War, and cotton was literally "King" in south <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Richard King, owner of the famed King Ranch, along with several partners, was a major player in the cotton trade during this time period. The arid brush country was soon a bustle of activity as cotton carts from all parts of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, as well as neighboring states, labored on the rutted, dusty roads to transport the cotton first to <span class="loc">Brownsville</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, and then to <span class="loc">Matamoros</span>, <span class="loc">Tamaulipas</span>. From there it was transported by cart to <span class="loc">Bagdad</span>, where it was placed on ships bound for various ports around the world.</p>
