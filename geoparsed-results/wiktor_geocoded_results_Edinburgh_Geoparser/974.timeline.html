  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Columbus</span> was a borax mining boom town in <span class="loc">Esmeralda County</span>. Its remnants are located on the edge of the <span class="loc">Columbus</span> <span class="loc">Salt Marsh</span>. Settlement came to the <span class="loc">Columbus</span> <span class="loc">Salt Marsh</span> in <span class="date">1865</span> with the raising of a quartz mill. <span class="loc">Columbus</span> was the ideal location for a mill, as it was the only stop for several miles with sufficient amounts of water for the operation of a mill. It wasn't until <span class="date">1871</span> that borax was discovered near the town's site, and as a result <span class="loc">Columbus</span> increased substantially in its importance. Shortly after the discovery of borax by <span class="per">William</span> Troop four borax companies were actively working the deposits on the marsh. <span class="loc">Columbus</span>' zenith occurred around <span class="date">1875</span> when there was around 1,000 people in the town. By that same year many businesses flourished in <span class="loc">Columbus</span> as well as a post office and local newspaper, The Borax Miner. By <span class="date">1881</span> borax mining activity had practically ceased and approximately 100 people were left in the community. Shortly thereafter, all mining and milling operations completely ceased. <span class="per">William Caruthers</span>, in his "Loafing Along Death Valley Trails" (Ontario: Death Valley Publishing Co., <span class="date">1951</span>) says that Francis M. "Borax" Smith discovered the borax at <span class="loc">Columbus Marsh</span>.</p><br><br>
