It is part of the <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 266 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> was named for John W. Harris, who inherited the <span class="loc">Model Farm</span> on what was Thrall's Prairie, the first permanent settlement in the county. The town was laid out on the survey line of the prospective <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and <span class="loc">Alton</span> railroad. The line was graded and prepared, but was abandoned for a line farther north. The proposed line can be seen on the 1969 USGS topographic map of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>. According to Colonel W. F. <span class="loc">Switzler</span>, in 1882, there were a post office, three stores, a confectionary shop, a church, a mill, a blacksmith shop, and the historic school building with the Masonic lodge above. The post office was located in the saddle shop. Reverend Green Carey preached at the Bethlehem Baptist church a few miles south of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> for fifty years and claimed to have joined more than five hundred couples in marriage.</p>
