<p><span class="loc">Palmira</span> (pronounced pälmē'rä) is a city and municipality in southwestern <span class="loc">Colombia</span> in the <span class="loc">Valle</span> del Cauca Department, located about 17 miles (27 km) east from Cali, the department's capital and main city. <span class="loc">Palmira</span> is located in southwestern <span class="loc">Colombia</span>, lying in the <span class="loc">Cauca</span> River valley. 3°31’48” north altitude and 76°81’13” longitude west of <span class="loc">Greenwich</span>. The city covers an area of 448 square miles (1,160 km2). The average temperature is 23°C (73°F) and its altitude is 1000 m (3284 ft) above sea level. According to the historian William Mallama <span class="loc">Lugo</span>, the <span class="loc">city of Palmira</span> arises in 1813 when Don Pedro Simón Cárdenas gave the name of Villa de las Palmas. Its inhabitants are called "Palmireños" or "Palmiranos". Important agricultural products are sugar cane, coffee, rice, corn, and tobacco. The burning of the waste cane is the main source of air pollution in the city. In 2005, <span class="loc">Palmira</span> opened its first large and post modern shopping mall Centro Comercial Llanogrande Plaza, popularly called "<span class="loc">La Catorce</span>", after the department store 'La 14' located in the mall. The indoor/outdoor shopping center has become very popular among Palmireños since its opening as there are no other large shopping malls in the city. Nevertheless, Palmiranos can still do their basic shopping in La Marden or any of its other stores located all throughout the city, specially in <span class="loc">El Centro</span>. Before the mall was built, Palmireños had to travel to <span class="loc">Cali</span> to many of its shopping centers such as La <span class="loc">Catorce</span> <span class="loc">De</span> Calima and Chipichape. <span class="loc">Llanogrande</span> has many restaurants, several outdoor bars, an indoor cinema, casino, and a small amusement park. It is located on the city's southwest side. Its address is <span class="loc">Calle</span> 31 No. 44-239. <span class="loc">Palmira</span> is also known for having many beautiful parks.</p>
