<p><span class="loc">Albany</span> /ˈælbəni/ is a port city in the <span class="loc">Great Southern</span> region of Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 418 km SE of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, the state capital. <span class="loc">Albany</span> is the oldest permanently settled town in Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, predating <span class="loc">Perth</span> and <span class="loc">Fremantle</span> by over two years. At the 2011 Census, <span class="loc">Albany</span>'s population was 30,656, making it the state's sixth-largest population centre. The city centre is at the northern edge of <span class="loc">Princess Royal Harbour</span>, which is a part of <span class="loc">King George Sound</span>. The central business district is bounded by <span class="loc">Mount Clarence</span> to the east and <span class="loc">Mount Melville</span> to the west. The city is in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Albany</span>. <span class="loc">Albany</span> was founded on 26 December 1826 as a military outpost of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> as part of a plan to forestall French ambitions in the region. To that end, on 21 January 1827 the commander of the outpost, Major Edmund Lockyer, formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British Crown. The area was initially named Frederick Town in honour of Prince Frederick, <span class="loc">Duke of York</span> and <span class="loc">Albany</span>. In 1831, the settlement was transferred to the control of the Swan <span class="loc">River Colony</span> and renamed <span class="loc">Albany</span> by Lieutenant-Governor James Stirling.</p>
