Among the original settlers was <span class="per">James Mendenhall</span>, who established a farmstead near present-day <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> in <span class="date">1762</span>. Though <span class="per">Mendenhall</span> moved to <span class="loc">Georgia</span> in <span class="date">1775</span>, his son <span class="per">George</span> remained, and by <span class="date">1816</span>, he founded the village of <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> in honor of his father. The <span class="per">Mendenhall</span> family, who owned and operated the area's first grist and lumber mills, also owned much of the town's original land. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">High Point</span> <span class="loc">City Lake</span> is situated where the original family farmhouse and land was located.</p><br><br>
