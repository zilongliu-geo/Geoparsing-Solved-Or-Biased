  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lerma</span> (formally <span class="loc">Lerma de Villada</span>) is a city and municipality located just east of <span class="loc">Toluca</span> and 54 km west of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> City in <span class="loc">Mexico</span> State, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The city was founded in the early colonial period and named after the <span class="per">Duke of Lerma</span> in <span class="loc">Spain</span>. The municipal area saw two battles of the <span class="org">Mexican War of Independence</span>, the Battle of <span class="loc">Monte de las Cruces</span> and the Battle of <span class="per">Lerma</span>. For a time after independence, the city was the capital of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> State before it was moved to <span class="loc">Toluca</span>. The municipality is in one of the most densely populated areas of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> and is growing. Much of this growth is occurring near the <span class="loc">Toluca-Mexico City</span> highway and on the floodplains of the <span class="loc">Lerma</span> River. The latter has caused significant problems with flooding when the river overflows its banks during the rainy season. The Nahuatl name for the area is <span class="per">Cacamilhuacan</span>, which translates to “crows in the field.” In the early colonial period, the area was called Santa <span class="per">Clara Cacamilhuacan</span>. The municipality has both an Aztec glyph with a crow reflecting its Nahuatl name and a Spanish coat of arms.</p><br><br>
