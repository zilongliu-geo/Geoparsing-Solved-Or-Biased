<p><span class="loc">Uki</span> (/ˈjuːkaɪ/ YEW-ky) is a village situated near <span class="loc">Mount Warning</span> in the Tweed Valley of far <span class="loc">northern New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> in the Tweed Shire. At the 2006 census, <span class="loc">Uki</span> had a population of 203 people. The town's name may have derived from an aboriginal word for "small water plant (like a fern) with a yellow flower and edible root". There are several stories, almost certainly apocryphal, associated with the origins of the name. One is that timber cutters, who were the first non-Aboriginal settlers in the area, marked the finest cedar for export to the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> with "UK1", this eventually becoming UKI, or <span class="loc">Uki</span> as it is known today. There are three approaches to Uki village; from the North it is approximately 15 minutes by road south of the main township of <span class="loc">Murwillumbah</span> along the <span class="loc">Kyogle</span> Road and 4 km past the turnoff to the World Heritage listed <span class="loc">Mount Warning</span> National Park, from the South West along the <span class="loc">Kyogle</span> Road from <span class="loc">Lismore</span>, <span class="loc">Kyogle</span> and <span class="loc">Nimbin</span> and from the East along Smiths Creek Road linking <span class="loc">Uki</span> to the quaint village of Stokers Siding and the Tweed <span class="loc">Valley Way</span> to popular coastal towns including <span class="loc">Brunswick Heads</span> and <span class="loc">Byron Bay</span>. It is also possible to travel to <span class="loc">Mullumbimby</span> from <span class="loc">Uki</span> using gravel back roads and fire trails through the Mount Jerusalem National Park.</p>
