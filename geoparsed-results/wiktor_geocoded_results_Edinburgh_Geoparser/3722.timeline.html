  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Porte</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Harris County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, within the Bay Area of the Houston–Sugar <span class="loc">Land–Baytown metropolitan</span> area. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 33,800. <span class="loc">La Porte</span> is the fourth-largest incorporated city in <span class="loc">Harris County</span>. When <span class="loc">La Porte</span> celebrated its centennial in <span class="date">1992</span>, it was the home of Barbours Cut Terminal, operated by the Port of Houston Authority since <span class="date">1977</span>. <span class="date">Fifteen years later</span>, the Port of Houston's newest addition, Bayport Terminal, was established just south of <span class="loc">La Porte</span>. The area around <span class="loc">La Porte</span> has served an increasingly important role in international trade since <span class="date">the 1970s</span>. The area around modern <span class="loc">La Porte</span> gained fame early in <span class="loc">Texas</span> history as the location of the Battle of <span class="loc">San Jacinto</span> on <span class="date">April 21, 1836</span>, which ended the <span class="loc">Texas</span> Revolution, establishing the independence of the Republic of <span class="loc">Texas</span> from <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The <span class="loc">San Jacinto Monument</span>, in the unincorporated area of <span class="loc">La Porte</span>, commemorates the battle. During the early 20th century, particularly <span class="date">the 1920s and 1930s</span>, <span class="loc">La Porte</span>'s Sylvan Beach became a nationally known tourist destination attracting some of the nation's most well-known entertainers. As a result of changing economics in the Houston area and beach erosion, the tourist business declined while industrial development in the area grew. During World War II and afterward, <span class="loc">La Porte</span>'s economy rapidly shifted toward petroleum/petrochemicals and shipping, which developed as the dominant industries in the Pasadena-Baytown area.</p><br><br>
