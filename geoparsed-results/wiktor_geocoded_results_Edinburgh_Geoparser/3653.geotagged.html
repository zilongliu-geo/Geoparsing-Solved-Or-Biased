<p><span class="loc">Tempel</span>, also known as <span class="loc">De Tempel</span>, is a former municipality and former manorial estate in the Dutch province of <span class="loc">South Holland</span>. It was located about 3 km southwest of the center of the current village of <span class="loc">Berkel</span> en <span class="loc">Rodenrijs</span>. According to the 19th-century historian A.J. van der Aa, <span class="loc">Tempel</span> was named after a manor house that used to be located in the area. around the beginning of the 19th century, the house was long gone. In nearby <span class="loc">Overschie</span> an estate can be found where in the 18th century the owner of <span class="loc">Tempel</span> used to live. He acquired it in 1715, after which the house Berkeloord was renamed to <span class="loc">De Tempel</span>. The manorial rights of <span class="loc">Tempel</span> were also applicable at the estate, even though it was located outside of its territory. After the introduction of the municipal system by the French in 1812, the area belonged to the municipality of <span class="loc">Pijnacker</span>, even though it was completely surrounded by the territory of <span class="loc">Berkel</span> en <span class="loc">Rodenrijs</span>. In 1817, the manorial rights were restored, and <span class="loc">Tempel</span> became a separate municipality, although it was very small (only 0.109 kmÂ²) and had no inhabitants. This was not a problem, as long as the lord of the area was prepared to pay for the municipal government. In 1855, the municipality became part of <span class="loc">Berkel</span> en <span class="loc">Rodenrijs</span>. Since 2007, <span class="loc">Tempel</span> is a part of Lansingerland, when <span class="loc">Berkel</span> en <span class="loc">Rodenrijs</span> merged with <span class="loc">Bergschenhoek</span> and <span class="loc">Bleiswijk</span>.</p>
