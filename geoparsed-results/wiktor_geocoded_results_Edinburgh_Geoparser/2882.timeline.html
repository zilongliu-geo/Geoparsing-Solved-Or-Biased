  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is a county located in the southwest corner of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 802,374. making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The county seat is <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>. The county is named for the first Secretary of the Treasury, <span class="per">Alexander Hamilton</span>. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is part of the Cincinnati-Middletown, <span class="loc">OH-KY-IN Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Most of <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> was originally owned and surveyed by <span class="per">John Cleves Symmes</span>, and the region was a part of the <span class="per">Symmes</span> Purchase. The first European-American settlers rafted down the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> in <span class="date">1788</span> following the American Revolutionary War. They established the towns of <span class="loc">Losantiville</span> (later <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>) and <span class="loc">Cleves</span>. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> was organized in <span class="date">1790</span>, as the second county in the Northwest Territory. Its area then included about one-eighth of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, and had about 2,000 inhabitants (not including the remaining Native Americans). The <span class="loc">United States</span> persuaded most of the <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> and other Indian peoples to remove in the 1820s to locations west of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. Since then, other counties were created from <span class="per">Hamilton</span>, reducing the county to its present size. Rapid growth occurred during the 1830s and 1840s as the area attracted many German and Irish immigrants, especially after the Great Famine in <span class="loc">Ireland</span> and the revolutions in <span class="loc">Germany</span> in <span class="date">1848</span>.</p><br><br>
