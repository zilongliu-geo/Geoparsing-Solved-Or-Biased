  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Charges filed in shots at FBI agent in <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>. <span class="loc">CINCINNATI</span> (AP) &#x97; Police and the FBI say two men from the Cincinnati area have been arrested in a drive-by shooting during which more than a dozen gunshots were fired at an on-duty FBI agent. Twenty-five-year-old Robert Coker was arrested <span class="date">Friday night</span>, and 46-year-old <span class="per">Kenny Davis</span> was arrested <span class="date">Monday</span>. Both were charged with felonious assault and held in the <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> jail. The agent wasn't hit by gunshot, but was cut by flying debris. The FBI has not released the agent's name. Authorities said <span class="date">Monday</span> that the vehicle used in the shooting was searched, and that more suspects were being sought. A message seeking comment was left at the office of Coker's attorney, <span class="per">Peter Rosenwald</span>. It was unclear whether <span class="per">Davis</span> had an attorney.</p><br><br>
