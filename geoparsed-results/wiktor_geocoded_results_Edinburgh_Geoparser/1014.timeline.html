  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Somerset</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Perry County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,481 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Saint Joseph Church</span>, the oldest Catholic church in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, is located just outside <span class="loc">Somerset</span> on State Route 383. The village of <span class="loc">Somerset</span> was established in <span class="date">1810</span> by settlers from <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> at the spot on Zane's Trace located midway between <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> and <span class="loc">Zanesville</span>. <span class="date">Seven years later</span>, parts of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, <span class="loc">Muskingum</span>, and <span class="loc">Washington</span> counties were merged to create <span class="loc">Perry County</span>, and the house of a <span class="loc">Somerset</span> resident was named the first temporary courthouse. In <span class="date">1819</span>, the county government arrange for the erection of a purpose-built courthouse in <span class="loc">Somerset</span>; while most of the building was used for a jail, it also included a courtroom and space for some county offices. <span class="date">Ten years later</span>, a permanent courthouse was constructed on the village's public square. In <span class="date">1833</span>, <span class="loc">Somerset</span> contained county buildings, nine stores, six taverns, about 120 dwelling houses, and more than 600 inhabitants. As the village of <span class="loc">New Lexington</span> grew in importance, its residents began to agitate for the county seat to be moved to their community. From <span class="date">1851</span> to <span class="date">1859</span>, the state legislature passed three separate laws to permit the county seat to be moved; contentious elections and a decision by the <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> of <span class="loc">Ohio</span> saw the county seat move to <span class="loc">New Lexington</span>, back to <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, and finally back to <span class="loc">New Lexington</span>. After it ceased to be used as a courthouse, the building was leased to <span class="loc">Somerset</span> for use as its village hall.</p><br><br>
