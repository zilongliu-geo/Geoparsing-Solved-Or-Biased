<p>Santa <span class="loc">Clara County</span> sex assault conviction overturned. A state appeals court has reversed a Santa <span class="loc">Clara County</span> sexual assault conviction, finding the defendant received a "grossly unfair trial'' because a trial judge allowed the prosecutor to improperly rely on a separate indecent exposure allegation to persuade the jury to return a guilty verdict. In a ruling last week, a divided panel of the <span class="loc">San Jose</span>-based 6th District Court of Appeal overturned Cameron Lee Earle's conviction for assaulting a woman in a local parking lot in December 2004. The appeals court concluded that Earle's trial was tainted because Superior Court Judge Rene Navarro allowed the jury to consider a separate, unrelated misdemeanor indecent exposure charge, which was emphasized heavily by the prosecutor. The 6th District found that the evidence against Earle was weak and circumstantial in the more serious sexual assault case, and that trying the two allegations at the same time allowed prosecutors to exploit the indecent exposure evidence "through spurious legal theories'' to convict Earle. The appellate panel ruled that Earle was entitled to separate trials on the two distinct charges. Justice Nathan Mihara dissented, saying trying the two charges together did not deprive Earle of a fair trial and did not prejudice the outcome. Earle is currently serving his sentence of five years and eight months in prison for his convictions.</p>
