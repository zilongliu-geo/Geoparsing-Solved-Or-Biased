  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Canada</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is named for many Canadian immigrants coming to the area. In <span class="date">1802</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span> returned most of the land to <span class="loc">France</span>. In <span class="date">1803</span>, most of the land for modern day <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was acquired by the <span class="loc">United States</span> from <span class="loc">France</span> as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In <span class="date">1854</span>, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in <span class="date">1861</span> <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In <span class="date">1855</span>, <span class="loc">Marion County</span> was established within the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory, which included the land for modern day <span class="loc">Canada</span>. <span class="per">David Christie</span>, former Speaker of the Canadian Senate, sent his sons to buy 3 square miles (8 km2) near <span class="date">the future</span> site of <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Many Canadian immigrants moved to the area, thus was the source of the community. <span class="loc">Canada</span> was platted on <span class="date">December 15, 1883</span>, but never incorporated. <span class="loc">Canada</span> had a Post Office from <span class="date">1884</span> to <span class="date">1954</span>. As early as <span class="date">1875</span>, city leaders of <span class="loc">Marion</span> held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from <span class="loc">Florence</span>. In <span class="date">1878</span>, <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway and parties from <span class="loc">Marion County</span> and <span class="loc">McPherson County</span> chartered the <span class="loc">Marion</span> and <span class="loc">McPherson Railway</span> Company. In <span class="date">1879</span>, a branch line was built from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">McPherson</span>, in <span class="date">1880</span> it was extended to <span class="per">Lyons</span>, in <span class="date">1881</span> it was extended to <span class="loc">Ellinwood</span>. The line was leased and operated by the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway. The line from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">Marion</span>, was abandoned in <span class="date">1968</span>. In <span class="date">1992</span>, the line from <span class="loc">Marion</span> to <span class="loc">McPherson</span> was sold to Central <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Railway. In <span class="date">1993</span>, after heavy flood damage, the line from <span class="loc">Marion</span> through <span class="loc">Canada</span> to <span class="loc">McPherson</span> was abandoned and removed. The original branch line connected <span class="loc">Florence</span>, <span class="loc">Marion</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span>, <span class="loc">Lehigh</span>, <span class="org">Canton</span>, <span class="loc">Galva</span>, <span class="loc">McPherson</span>, <span class="loc">Conway</span>, <span class="loc">Windom</span>, <span class="loc">Little River</span>, Mitchell, <span class="per">Lyons, Chase</span>, <span class="loc">Ellinwood</span>.</p><br><br>
