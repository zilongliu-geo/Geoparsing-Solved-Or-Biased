  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is the most populous county in the state of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 658,466, making it the most populous county in <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Birmingham</span>, the most populous city in the state. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is included in the <span class="per">Birmingham-Hoover, AL</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was established on <span class="date">December 13, 1819</span>, by the Alabama Legislature. It was named in honor of <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span>. The county is located in the north-central portion of the state, on the southmost edge of the Appalachian Mountains, in the center of the (former) iron, coal, and limestone mining belt of the Southern <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is bordered by <span class="loc">Blount County</span>, <span class="loc">Bibb County</span>, St. <span class="loc">Clair County</span>, <span class="loc">Shelby County</span>, <span class="loc">Tuscaloosa County</span>, and <span class="loc">Walker County</span>, in <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> has a land area of about 1,119 square miles (2,900 km2). Well before <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> was even founded in <span class="date">1871</span>, the county seat of <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was located at <span class="loc">Carrollsville</span> (<span class="date">1819</span> – 21) and <span class="loc">Elyton</span> (<span class="date">1821</span> – 73), and since <span class="date">1873</span> it has been located in <span class="loc">Birmingham</span>, which was named for the English city of the same name in <span class="loc">Warwickshire</span>. That city had long been a center of iron and steel production in <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>. Note that <span class="loc">Elyton</span> has long been a part of <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> itself, since <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> was established by the merger of three towns, and the city has a long history of annexing its neighboring towns and villages, including <span class="loc">North Birmingham</span>.</p><br><br>
