<p>Kent is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and the largest city in <span class="loc">Portage County</span>. It is located along the <span class="loc">Cuyahoga River</span> in Northeast Ohio on the western edge of the county. The population was 28,904 in the 2010 Census and 29,639 in the 2014 estimate. The city is counted as part of the <span class="loc">Akron Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area. Part of the <span class="loc">Connecticut Western Reserve</span>, <span class="loc">Kent</span> was settled in 1805 and was known for many years as Franklin Mills. Settlers were attracted to the area due to its location along the <span class="loc">Cuyahoga River</span> as a place for water-powered mills. Later development came in the 1830s and 1840s as a result of the settlement's position along the route of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Canal</span>. Leading up to the American Civil War, Franklin Mills was noted for its activity in the "Underground Railroad". With the decline of the canal and the emergence of the railroad, the town became the home of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad maintenance shops through the influence of Marvin Kent. In 1864 the town was renamed Kent in honor of and in gratitude for Marvin Kent's efforts. It was incorporated as a village in 1867 and became a city after the 1920 Census. Today Kent is a college town best known as the home of the main campus of Kent State University, founded in 1910, and as the site of the 1970 Kent State shootings.</p>
