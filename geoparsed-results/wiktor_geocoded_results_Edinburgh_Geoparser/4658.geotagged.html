<p>Cornelius is a city in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located in the <span class="loc">Portland</span> metropolitan area, the city's population was 12,147 at the 2010 census. The city lies along Tualatin Valley Highway between Forest Grove to the west and <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> to the east. Cornelius was incorporated in 1893 and is named for founder Thomas R. Cornelius. In 1845, Benjamin Cornelius immigrated to <span class="loc">Oregon</span> with his family, traveling with Joseph Meek. The Cornelius family settled on the Tualatin Plains, near what is now <span class="loc">North Plains</span>. The same year, Benjamin Q. Tucker and Solomon <span class="loc">Emerick</span> staked land claims and established farms on the land that would eventually become Cornelius. At that time, the area was called Free Orchards; there was no actual community, but the name referred to the orchards on the 107 acres (0.43 km2) of land. In 1871, Benjamin Cornelius's son Colonel Thomas R. Cornelius learned that Ben Holladay planned to extend the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and <span class="loc">California Railroad</span> right through Free Orchards. Holladay had been told by Forest Grove and <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> that they would not allow the railroad free right-of-way, so Holladay planned to bypass them, and build Free Orchards into a new city that would become the new county seat of <span class="loc">Washington County</span>.</p>
