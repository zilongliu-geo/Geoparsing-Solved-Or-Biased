Britanni <span class="per">Marie Dighero</span> stood in an aisle of the Coronado Meat Market and Bakery in <span class="loc">South Los Angeles</span>, reading the ingredient list on a package of her favorite fudge cookies into a video camera. She occasionally stumbled over phrases like "propylene glycol mono" and "diesters of fats and fatty acids." "I never read this before, and I'm really sad right <span class="date">now</span>," said Britanni, a high school senior. "If you can't read it, don't eat it," added another student, <span class="per">Jessica Orellana</span>. The spot they were taping, called "Do You Mind Reading What You're Eating? ," will be included on a website the students are developing as part of a broader effort to fight childhood obesity and related diseases, including diabetes. They are working in neighborhoods where a third of the children are overweight and about half are not physically fit -- and where a scarcity of supermarkets is a long-standing source of community ire.</p><br><br>
