The headwaters of the <span class="loc">Wolf River</span> meander and braid their way north and west across northern <span class="loc">Benton County</span> from Baker's Pond, the river's source spring (highest origin of continuous flow) in the <span class="loc">Holly Springs National Forest</span> approximately one mile southwest of where <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 72 passes into <span class="loc">Tippah County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>.
