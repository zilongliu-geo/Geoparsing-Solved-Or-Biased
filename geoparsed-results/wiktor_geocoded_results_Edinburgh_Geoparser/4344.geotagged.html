<p>Temple is a town in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town was named after Temple, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. It is located at the end of <span class="loc">Maine</span> State Route 43 (Temple Road), and is said to be one of only two towns in <span class="loc">Maine</span> to be situated at the end of a public highway. The population was 528 at the 2010 census. Hill-farmers from Temple, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, Old <span class="loc">North Yarmouth</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, and nearby <span class="loc">Farmington</span> settled the town beginning in 1796. It incorporated in 1803. Commercial sawmills operated on Temple Stream in the village for many years in the 1800s and 1900s, providing the town a robust local economy. Logging is still vibrant in Temple, but its timber is now trucked to mills in nearby towns. The town contains a town hall (formerly an elementary school), a post office in the former general store, a theater (formerly the Congregational Church), a fire station, and a youth baseball field, established in 1957, commemorating the life of Larry Boyce, the former Temple Townies player and manager for whom the field is named.</p>
