<p><span class="loc">Wilton</span> is a town and civil parish in <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span> (of which it was once the county town), <span class="loc">England</span>, with a rich heritage dating back to the Anglo-Saxons. Carpets have been manufactured at <span class="loc">Wilton</span> since the 18th century. Today it is overshadowed by its larger neighbour, <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, but still has a range of notable shops and attractions, including Wilton House. The confluence of the rivers Wylye and Nadder is at <span class="loc">Wilton</span>. The history of <span class="loc">Wilton</span> dates back to the Anglo-Saxons in the 8th century AD, and by the late 9th century it was the capital of Wiltunscire, a shire of the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Wessex</span>. It remained the administrative centre of <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span> until the 11th century. <span class="loc">Wilton</span> was of significant importance to the church, with the founding of <span class="loc">Wilton</span> Abbey in AD 771 and a number of other establishments. In AD 871 Alfred the Great fought and lost an important battle there against the Danish armies, leaving him in retreat for several years. Despite further attacks, <span class="loc">Wilton</span> remained a prosperous town, as recorded in the Domesday book. The building of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> Cathedral nearby, however, caused <span class="loc">Wilton</span>'s decline, as the new site of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, with a new bridge over the <span class="loc">River Avon</span>, provided a convenient bypass around <span class="loc">Wilton</span> on the trade routes.</p>
