  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ely</span> (/ˈiːli/ EE-lee) is a cathedral city in <span class="loc">Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, 14 miles (23 km) north-north-east of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> and about 80 miles (129 km) by road from <span class="loc">London</span>. Æthelthryth (Etheldreda) founded an abbey at <span class="loc">Ely</span> in AD 673; the abbey was destroyed in 870 by Danish invaders and was rebuilt by Ethelwold, <span class="per">Bishop of Winchester</span>, in 970. Construction of the cathedral was started in <span class="date">1083</span> by a Norman abbot, Simeon. Alan of Walsingham's octagon, built over <span class="loc">Ely</span>'s nave crossing between <span class="date">1322</span> and <span class="date">1328</span>, is the "greatest individual achievement of architectural genius at <span class="loc">Ely</span> Cathedral", according to architectural historian <span class="per">Nikolaus Pevsner</span>. Building continued until the dissolution of the abbey in <span class="date">1539</span> during the Reformation. The cathedral was sympathetically restored between <span class="date">1845</span> and <span class="date">1870</span> by the architect <span class="per">George Gilbert Scott</span>. As the seat of a diocese, <span class="loc">Ely</span> has long been considered a city; in <span class="date">1974</span>, city status was granted by royal charter. <span class="loc">Ely</span> is built on a 23-square-mile (60 km2) Kimmeridge Clay island which, at 85 feet (26 m), is the highest land in the fens. Major rivers including the <span class="loc">Witham</span>, <span class="loc">Welland</span>, <span class="loc">Nene</span> and <span class="loc">Great Ouse</span> feed into the fens and, until draining commenced in the 17th century, formed freshwater marshes and meres within which peat was laid down. There are two <span class="org">Sites of Special Scientific Interest</span> in the city: a former Kimmeridge Clay quarry, and one of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>'s best remaining examples of medieval ridge and furrow agriculture.</p><br><br>
