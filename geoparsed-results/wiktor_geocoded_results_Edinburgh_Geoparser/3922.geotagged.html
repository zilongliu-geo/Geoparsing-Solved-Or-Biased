<p><span class="loc">Buxton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">York County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 8,034 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Buxton</span> includes the villages of <span class="loc">Salmon Falls</span>/<span class="loc">Tory Hill</span>, <span class="loc">Chicopee</span>, <span class="loc">Groveville</span>, Bar Mills, <span class="loc">West Buxton</span>, and <span class="loc">Buxton</span> Center. The old town Common is east of <span class="loc">Union Falls</span>, which is the location of <span class="loc">Skelton</span> Dam, Operated by Central <span class="loc">Maine</span> Power, and near historic location of the original settlement at <span class="loc">Pleasant Point</span>. The township was granted by the Massachusetts General Court as Narragansett Number 1 in 1728. It was assigned to Philemon Dane of <span class="loc">Ipswich</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and 119 other veterans (or their heirs) who had fought in King Philip's War against the Narragansett Indians in 1675. Settlement was attempted in the early 1740s but abandoned because of the ongoing French and Indian Wars. The first permanent settlement commenced in fall of 1750 near <span class="loc">Salmon Falls</span>, which was within protection of the stockaded blockhouse and trading post built in 1728 a half mile below <span class="loc">Union Falls</span> in present-day Dayton. Amos Chase was one of the pioneers of the town, and his daughter was said to be the first white child born in <span class="loc">Buxton</span>. He was a prominent figure in the area, one of the largest taxpayers, and was the first deacon of the Congregational Church in Pepperellborough (present-day <span class="loc">Saco</span>, <span class="loc">ME</span>). The first schoolhouse in <span class="loc">Buxton</span> was established in 1761 by Rev. Silas Moody. Narragansett Number 1 was incorporated in 1772 as <span class="loc">Buxton</span>. It was named by its minister, Rev. Paul Coffin for the spa town of <span class="loc">Buxton</span> in <span class="loc">Derbyshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, for unknown reasons. <span class="loc">Buxton</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> is often incorrectly cited as the home of his ancestors, but that was Brixton as noted on page 7 of the cited source(2).</p>
