<p>Houston is a city in and one of two county seats of <span class="loc">Chickasaw County</span>, in northern <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. The population was 3,623 at the 2010 census. Judge Joel Pinson donated land for development of a town on the condition that it would be named for <span class="loc">Sam Houston</span>, a childhood friend. In 1909, Houston became home to the first Carnegie library in the state after L.B. Reid, then-superintendent of schools, wrote to Andrew Carnegie, an industrialist and philanthropist who created a matching program for libraries, telling of the need for a public library. Houston hosts the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Flywheel Festival in April and September of every year. Houston is located west of the center of <span class="loc">Chickasaw County</span> at 33°53′53″N 89°0′6″W (33.898090, -89.001646). <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Highway 8 passes through the city, leading east 29 miles (47 km) to <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> and west 18 miles (29 km) to <span class="loc">Calhoun City</span>. <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Highway 15 bypasses the city to the west, crossing Highway 8 within a western extension of the city limits.
