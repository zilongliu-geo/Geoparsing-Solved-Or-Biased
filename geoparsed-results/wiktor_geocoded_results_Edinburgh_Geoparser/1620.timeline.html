  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newport</span> is a suburb of <span class="per">Melbourne, Victoria</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 7 km south-west of <span class="per">Melbourne</span>'s CBD. Its local government area is the City of <span class="loc">Hobsons Bay</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> Census, <span class="loc">Newport</span> had a population of 11,987. <span class="loc">Newport</span> is approximately 10 minutes by car from <span class="per">Melbourne</span> via the West Gate Freeway or a 20-minute train journey from Flinders Street Station. The Yalukit-willam people of the Boon-wurrung Country are the traditional owners of land known as <span class="loc">Newport</span>, with a well researched connection to the area beyond <span class="date">30,000 years</span>. First contact came with European sealers (<span class="date">1803</span>â€“<span class="date">1834</span>) and followed a pattern of violence typical across <span class="loc">Australia</span> at the time. In <span class="date">1835</span> the arrival of <span class="per">John Batman</span> saw a treaty established and a period of relative peace. However, despite this the plight of <span class="org">the Australian</span> Aborigines was dire, as they were increasingly denied ownership and access to their lands. European settlement began in <span class="loc">Newport</span> at what was then called <span class="loc">Williamstown</span> Junction around <span class="date">1862</span>, with a Telegraph Office and Post Office by <span class="date">1869</span>. It was renamed <span class="loc">Newport</span> in <span class="date">1881</span>. The Newport Railway Workshops played a key role in the development of the suburb, formerly the main workshops of the Victorian Railways. The workshops are just south of the <span class="loc">Newport</span> railway station. The Newport Power Station is another feature of the suburb, the chimney of which remains one of the tallest towers in <span class="per">Melbourne</span> at 183 metres. The original coal-fired generators were replaced in <span class="date">1981</span> with a single 500MW gas-fired generator and operates during peak-load periods.</p><br><br>
