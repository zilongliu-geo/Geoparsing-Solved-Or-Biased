<p><span class="loc">Alberton</span> is a town situated on the <span class="loc">East Rand</span> of <span class="loc">Gauteng Province</span> in <span class="loc">South Africa</span> which celebrated its centenary year in 2005. As of 2007 it had a population of 202,202. It is known as a typical bedroom community, a community primarily residential in character, with most of its workers commuting to work in nearby suburbs or cities. The town has multiple access roads to all major freeways in <span class="loc">Gauteng</span>. <span class="loc">Alberton</span> is situated on the banks of the Natal Spruit close to the major urban centres of <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span> (15 kilometres southeast) and <span class="loc">Pretoria</span> (76 kilometres). At the age of 13 a boy by the name of Johannes Petrus Meyer bought 11 hectares of his father’s farm <span class="loc">Elandsfontein</span>. He later built a house next to the Alberton stream or <span class="loc">Natalspruit</span>, close to where the civic centre stands today, and married. After his wife died in 1870 at the birth of their fourth daughter, he decided to start a general store and built his farmhouse mansion in 1890. The house was miraculously left unharmed during the Anglo Boer War of 1899–1902 and can still be seen today from the bypassing N12 freeway.</p>
