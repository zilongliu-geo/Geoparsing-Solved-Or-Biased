<p><span class="loc">Goma</span> is a city in the eastern <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>. It is located on the northern shore of Lake Kivu, next to the Rwandan <span class="loc">city of Gisenyi</span>. The lake and the two cities are in the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift system. <span class="loc">Goma</span> lies only 13 to 18 km due south of the crater of the active Nyiragongo Volcano. The recent history of <span class="loc">Goma</span> has been dominated by the volcano and the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, which in turn fuelled the First and Second Congo Wars. The aftermath of these events was still having effects on the city and its surroundings in 2010. The city was captured by rebels during the M23 rebellion in late 2012, but has since been retaken by government forces. <span class="loc">Goma</span> is capital of <span class="loc">North Kivu province</span>, ethnically and geographically similar to <span class="loc">South Kivu</span> (capital <span class="loc">Bukavu</span>); the two provinces are known as "the Kivus". The Rwandan Genocide of 1994 was perpetrated by the <span class="loc">Hutu</span>-dominated provisional Rwandan government on the Tutsi population and <span class="loc">Hutu</span> moderates. In response the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), formed by Tutsi refugees in <span class="loc">Uganda</span>, which already controlled large areas of northern <span class="loc">Rwanda</span> following its 1990 invasion and the ongoing Civil War, overthrew the <span class="loc">Hutu</span> government in <span class="loc">Kigali</span> and forced it to relocate to the border town of <span class="loc">Gisenyi</span>. As the RPF captured ground, thousands of <span class="loc">Hutu</span> refugees fled before it, many ending up in <span class="loc">Gisenyi</span>. Then, from July 13 to July 14, 1994, 10,000â€“12,000 refugees per hour crossed the border into <span class="loc">Goma</span> as the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> refugee crisis took shape. The massive influx created a severe humanitarian crisis, as there was an acute lack of shelter, food and water. Shortly after the arrival of nearly one million refugees, a deadly cholera outbreak claimed thousands of lives in the <span class="loc">Hutu</span> refugee camps around <span class="loc">Goma</span>.</p>
