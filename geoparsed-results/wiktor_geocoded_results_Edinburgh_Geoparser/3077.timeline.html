  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is an affluent neighborhood in northwest <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span>, known for its large homes and tree-lined streets and more recently for being a military superfund site of former <span class="loc">Camp Leach</span>. It houses most of the main campus of American University, which gives its name to the neighborhood to <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>'s northeast, American University Park. The neighborhood houses the main campus of American University at 4400 Massachusetts Avenue, the <span class="loc">Wesley Theological Seminary</span> at 4500 Massachusetts Avenue, and the former <span class="org">Washington College</span> of Law campus at 4801 Massachusetts Avenue and 4910 Massachusetts Avenue, which has since been moved to nearby Tenleytown neighborhood. <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> <span class="per">Avenue</span> and <span class="per">Loughboro</span> Road are to its south, <span class="loc">Dalecarlia Parkway</span> is to its west, and Massachusetts Avenue is to its northeast. Paradoxically, the neighborhood to the northeast is called American University Park, even though the bulk of the main campus is located in <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>'s residents include notable media personalities (e.g., <span class="per">Ann Compton</span>, <span class="per">Jim Vance</span>), lawyers (e.g., United States Attorney General <span class="per">Eric Holder</span>, <span class="per">Brendan Sullivan</span>), politicians, corporate officers, and elite <span class="loc">Washington</span> society (e.g., <span class="loc">Washington</span> Nationals principal owners <span class="per">Ed Cohen</span> and <span class="per">Debra Cohen</span>). After the second world war, General of the <span class="org">Army</span> <span class="per">Omar Bradley</span> moved to a house on Indian lane in <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>. <span class="per">Richard Nixon</span> lived in neighboring <span class="loc">Wesley Heights</span> before becoming President; his immediate predecessor, <span class="per">Lyndon B. Johnson</span>, after becoming Vice President under <span class="per">John F. Kennedy</span>, purchased a three-story mansion named <span class="loc">Les Ormes</span> (The Elms) in <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> along 52nd Street NW that had previously been the home of socialite and ambassador <span class="per">Perle Mesta</span>. George H. W. Bush also lived in the neighborhood prior to his White House <span class="date">years</span>. Presently it is the residence of the ambassador of <span class="loc">Algeria</span>. <span class="per">Warren Buffett</span> and sister <span class="per">Doris Buffett</span> lived on 49th Street during their <span class="date">years</span> attending <span class="org">Wilson High School</span>.</p><br><br>
