<p><span class="loc">Empalme</span> is a city surrounded by a municipality located on the south-central coast of the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Sonora</span>. According to the 2005 census the population of the city was 40,630 inhabitants, while the municipality, which has an area of 708.53 km² (273.56 sq mi), reported 50,663 inhabitants. Except for its coastline on the <span class="loc">Gulf of California</span> (Sea of <span class="loc">Cortes</span>), the municipality is entirely surrounded by the much larger municipality of <span class="loc">Guaymas</span>. In Spanish, the word empalme means "junction". At first, the community site was called Kilómetro Nueve because it was nine kilometers out of the port <span class="loc">city of Guaymas</span>. Then for a while it was called <span class="loc">El Empalme</span> meaning of course, the junction. The El was soon dropped. Unlike other towns or cities in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">Empalme</span> was built completely by foreigners, specifically the Utah Construction Company under contract to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company. Very few native materials were used in the construction. The founders owned a major railroad, affording easy transportation of materials and personnel. The purpose of the settlement was to provide repair facilities for SP operations in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, with a large shop and roundhouse. They still exist today, although unused; repair and maintenance now being done in <span class="loc">Guadalajara</span>, <span class="loc">Jalisco</span>. Hundreds of the homes built originally still exist in <span class="loc">Empalme</span>, their design and materials unchanged.</p>
