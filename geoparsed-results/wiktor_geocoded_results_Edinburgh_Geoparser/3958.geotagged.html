<p><span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Allegheny County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, along the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>, adjoining <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. The population was 8,370 at the 2010 census. The borough was incorporated in 1867. It is located in the Northgate School District. There is a public park and library, the Andrew Bayne Memorial Library. The land on which the borough currently sits was once part of the Depreciation Lands reserved for Revolutionary War veterans. The first landowners in the area were James Robinson and Hugh Henry Brackenridge, purchasing parcels in 1799 and 1792 respectively. At the time of its organization as a borough, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> had exactly the minimum population for such a designation: 300 residents. Residents of the area tried unsuccessfully to obtain improvements from Ross Township, but officials were opposed to development along <span class="loc">Venango</span> Trail (today Route 19). In response, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> was incorporated as a borough independent of Ross on September 7, 1867. The name of the borough was chosen by J. J. East, a linguist and early resident of the borough, and means "beautiful view." <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is located at 40°29′38″N 80°3′13″W.</p>
