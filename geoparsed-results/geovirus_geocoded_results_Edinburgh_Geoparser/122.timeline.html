  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Lead poisoning has taken the lives of at least 163 individuals in the northern Nigerian state of Zamfara in <span class="date">recent weeks</span>. Sometime during <span class="date">March</span> residents of remote villages began illegally mining gold in areas of high lead concentration. There have been a total of 355 reported cases, setting the fatality rate at 46%. According to <span class="per">Henry Akpan</span>, chief epidemiologist at <span class="org">Nigeria's Ministry of Health</span>, 111 of the 163 recorded deaths have been children, many only <span class="date">several years</span> old. <span class="per">Akpan</span> further said that officials had seen young children playing in contaminated water located near the mining sites. The government had found through their yearly immunization program that there were almost no children living in the villages of Zamfara. Adults from the area reported that the children had died of malaria. However, after an investigation, health officials concluded that there was an abnormally large amount of lead circulating in the villagers' bodies. <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>'s government has requested assistance from international organizations, including the World Health Organization and <span class="org">the US Centers for Disease Control</span> and Prevention, in averting a widespread outbreak. The <span class="org">Ministry</span> has meanwhile organized two camps for villagers suffering from the poison.</p><br><br>
