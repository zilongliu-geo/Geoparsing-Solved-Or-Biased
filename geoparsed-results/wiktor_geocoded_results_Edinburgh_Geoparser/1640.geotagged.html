<p><span class="loc">Cuba</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Crawford County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,356 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Cuba</span> was platted in 1857 when it was certain the railroad would be extended to that point. It was named after the island of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>. President Harry S. Truman visited <span class="loc">Cuba</span> during a tour of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66. He surveyed the property that would eventually become <span class="loc">Indian Hills Lake</span>. <span class="loc">Indian Hills Lake</span> was originally known as "<span class="loc">Indian Head Lake</span>" because the skull of a Native American was found during excavation. Bette Davis and Amelia Earhart also visited the town. Their visits are commemorated in the Viva Cuba Mural Project. <span class="loc">Cuba</span> was designated as the Route 66 Mural City by the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> legislature in recognition of Viva Cuba's Outdoor Mural Project. The beautification group consulted with Michelle Loughery, a Canadian muralist who helped create the vision and two of the murals. The group commissioned twelve outdoor murals along the Route 66 corridor. Interstate 44 now runs through <span class="loc">Cuba</span>. <span class="loc">Cuba</span> was also the site of the first Adopt a Highway program in the <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The Wagon Wheel Motel is a historic landmark and has been a presence on Route 66 since the 1930s. The guest cottages and old Wagon Wheel Cafe building underwent renovations beginning in 2009.</p>
