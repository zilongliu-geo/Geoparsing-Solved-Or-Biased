  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santee</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Orangeburg County</span> along the Santee River Valley in central <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It has become a resort town of note located centrally north-south along the Atlantic Seaboard of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. The region has been rural, with a primarily agricultural economy typical of <span class="loc">Orangeburg County</span>, but it is <span class="date">now</span> known primarily for its several golf courses in proximity to <span class="loc">Lake Marion</span>, <span class="loc">Santee State Park</span> and other <span class="loc">Lake Marion</span> attractions. Interstate 95 connects its attractions easily with tourists' traveling by automobile. I-95 crosses a narrow arm of the lake into the town lands, along a picturesque causeway. <span class="loc">Lake Marion</span> is a man-made hydroelectric reservoir, which at 110,000 acres (450 km2, 173 sq mi) is one of the fifty largest lakes in the country. The population was 740 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The town has been undergoing economic and population growth, and development as rural niches are supplanted by bedroom communities. Construction of the Santee Cooper Regional Water System can provide millions of gallons of potable water per day to the surrounding five counties centered about <span class="loc">Santee</span>. The system was coordinated by the <span class="org">U.S. Department of Agriculture</span> and funded by the <span class="org">Army Corps of Engineers, USEPA</span>, and the <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> <span class="loc">Department of Commerce</span>. The plant was completed and operational as of <span class="date">1 June 2008</span>. Work to connect the plant to the five counties (<span class="loc">Berkeley</span>, <span class="loc">Orangeburg</span>, <span class="loc">Dorchester</span>, <span class="loc">Calhoun</span>, and <span class="loc">Sumter</span>) is underway and being overseen and funded by the same parties. Currently, the RWS serves the town of <span class="loc">Santee</span>, with pipeline rapidly being installed to other locations. Incoming businesses from this project are projected to bring thousands of jobs to the area.</p><br><br>
