<p>Firefighters honored for heroism. As the roaring fire consumed the yacht, Nicholas DiGiacomo gave one of the trapped passengers his air pack and mask, put himself at the mercy of the thick smoke and used his power saw to cut open an escape route in the yacht's hull. The Miami-Dade Fire Rescue firefighter saved both passengers at the Miami Beach Marina on March 31, 2008. On Friday, he received the Silver Medal of Valor. More than 60 firefighters and police received awards for their acts of bravery in 2008, such as saving babies from burning buildings, snatching swimmers from rough seas and pulling people out of wrecked cars. CBS4 anchor Michael Williams presented dozens of awards, including one to firefighter Anthony Oro, who held onto a woman's hand for two hours on May 14 beneath the sweltering sun while fellow firefighters cut away at the car in which she was trapped. Another award was given to firefighter and diver Augustin Hondares, whose Fire Rescue unit responded April 20 when a child's parents were trapped under water in a car. Hondares drove to the canal, so he had no time to put on his scuba gear. He instead held his breath, dove into the cold, murky water and pulled out one passenger. He then dove back in, located the second passenger, and had Lt. Richard Rosell pull the man out. Although both parents later died at the hospital, Hondares, Rosell and others received awards for their heroic efforts. DiGiacomo credited teamwork for helping firefighters save two people from the burning yacht. '' We couldn't fathom not getting them out,'' he said. Those thoughts ``can't even creep in.'' Fire Chief Herminio Lorenzo said the firefighters earned their awards by taking their skills and sense of honor with them to all places, on and off the job. '' The individuals we honor today are those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty . . . who went beyond logic and common sense -- to save somebody,'' he said.</p>
