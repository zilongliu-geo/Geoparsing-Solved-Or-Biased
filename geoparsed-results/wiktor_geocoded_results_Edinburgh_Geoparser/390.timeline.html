  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Lincoln is a town in the historic area of <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,362 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, including residents of Hanscom Air Force Base that live within town limits. Lincoln was settled by Europeans in <span class="date">1654</span>, as a part of Concord. It was split from Concord, and incorporated as a separate town in <span class="date">1754</span>. Due to their "difficulties and inconveniences by reason of their distance from the places of Public Worship in their respective Towns," local inhabitants petitioned the General Court to be set apart as a separate town. The new town comprised parts "nipped" off from the adjacent towns of <span class="per">Concord, Weston</span> and <span class="per">Lexington</span>, it was sometimes referred to as "Niptown." Chambers Russell, a Representative in the <span class="org">Court in Boston</span>, was influential in the town's creation. In gratitude, Russell was asked to name the new town. He chose Lincoln, after his family home in <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. His homestead in Lincoln was later known as the <span class="org">Codman House</span> property, which was occupied after his death by his relatives, the Codman family.</p><br><br>
