  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is a rural-suburban town in the eastern central portion of <span class="loc">Essex County</span> in <span class="loc">eastern Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it had a population of 7,764. Currently the town has no manufacturing industry and no industrially-zoned land. Its location on the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> provides easy access to the Atlantic seashore with its reservations, beaches and boating. The town includes many historic houses, pastoral landscapes, and old stone walls that accompany winding tree-lined roads. It also has a rich equestrian heritage, which remains strong due to the influence of the many horse farms and of Myopia Hunt Club, which holds frequent equestrian events, including polo most <span class="date">Sunday</span> <span class="date">afternoons</span>. (Myopia also hosts a <span class="date">Thanksgiving</span> Day fox hunt each year that the public may attend.) Thus, the visitor to <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> may well share the secondary roads with horse and pony riders. <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is closely tied to neighboring <span class="loc">Wenham</span>, sharing a school system, library, recreation department, commuter rail station and newspaper. In <span class="date">2010</span>, the community of Hamilton-Wenham was listed among the "Best Places to Live" by Boston Magazine.</p><br><br>
