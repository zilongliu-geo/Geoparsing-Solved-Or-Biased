  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Buin</span>, a town on <span class="loc">Bougainville Island</span>, and the capital of the <span class="loc">South Bougainville District</span>, in the Autonomous Region of <span class="loc">Bougainville</span>, in eastern <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span>. The island is in the northern <span class="loc">Solomon</span> Islands Archipelago of the <span class="loc">Melanesia region</span>, in the <span class="loc">South Pacific Ocean</span>. It is a government-established town in the jungle, <span class="date">now</span> inland from the coast, where its sea landing predecessor of the same name was located. The town is in an autonomous region of <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span> established in <span class="date">2000</span>, and was the former <span class="loc">North Solomons Province</span> (<span class="date">1976</span>-<span class="date">2000</span>). <span class="loc">Buin</span> and <span class="loc">Bougainville Island</span> gained world attention with the <span class="date">1942</span> Japanese invasion and subsequent Allied <span class="loc">Bougainville</span> Campaign in World War II. After the war, the present day town of <span class="loc">Buin</span> was established, inland to the north from its original location, which had been a minimal point of sea-landing on the coast. In <span class="date">the late 1960s</span> <span class="loc">Buin</span> became a regional centre of government, commercial, and education activity. After <span class="org">Bougainville Copper Ltd.</span> was established, it came to national prominence as the source of a large proportion of the country's financial base. The town was isolated from contact and commercial activity during <span class="date">the 1990s</span> <span class="org">Bougainville Civil War</span>. In <span class="date">2000</span> it became within the Autonomous Region of <span class="loc">Bougainville</span> in <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span>, upon the Autonomous Region's establishment.</p><br><br>
