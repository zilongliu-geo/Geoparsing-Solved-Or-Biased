  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Stanton</span> is an unincorporated community located within <span class="loc">Readington Township</span> in <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The community dates back to the 17th century and was settled by the Dutch. It was originally called <span class="per">Housel</span>'s after Johannes <span class="per">Housel</span>, who had a farmstead along Dreahook Road in the mid-18th century. After the death of <span class="per">William Housel</span> (who started a school in the community), the last owner of the <span class="per">Housel</span> farmstead, it then carried the name of Waggoner's Hill after landowner <span class="per">William</span> Waggoner. The community took the descriptive name of <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> during the beginning of the 20th century and would finally become known as <span class="loc">Stanton</span> to distinguish it from another <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>. The name "<span class="org">Stanton</span>" was taken from <span class="per">James Logan</span>'s <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> estate: <span class="loc">Stenton</span>, which in turn is named for the Scottish village where his father was born. <span class="per">Logan</span> was a proprietor of <span class="loc">West Jersey</span>, a mayor of <span class="per">Philadelphia</span>, and a Chief Justice of the <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. <span class="per">Logan</span> Way in <span class="loc">Readington</span> is named after him, as well as <span class="loc">Logan Circle</span> and the <span class="per">Logan</span> neighborhood in <span class="per">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="per">Logan</span> Township in <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. In the 1830s, a Reformed Church and a general store were built, both of which are present <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
