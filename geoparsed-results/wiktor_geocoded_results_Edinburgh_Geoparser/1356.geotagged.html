The city is a major regional suburban <span class="loc">East Bay</span> center within the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> Bay Area, and is 29 miles (47 km) east of <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>.

The focal point of downtown Concord is <span class="loc">Todos Santos</span> Plaza, which encompasses an entire city block and is known for its farmers market, free summer concerts, and large number of surrounding restaurants. Much of the area immediately around downtown has recently been redeveloped, with new high-density apartment and condominium projects to take advantage of the proximity to public transportation and to the area surrounding the park. Despite this, some crime and homelessness remain issues in the downtown area.</p>
