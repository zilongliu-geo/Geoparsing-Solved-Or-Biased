  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Freemason Bogdanov</span> Joins Sochi Mayor Race. Former presidential candidate <span class="per">Andrei Bogdanov</span> on <span class="date">Wednesday</span> became the latest entry into the crowded <span class="loc">Sochi</span> mayoral election, saying the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> resort could become “the Nice of Russia.” <span class="per">Bogdanov</span>, 39, is the former head of the now-defunct Democratic Party of <span class="loc">Russia</span>, which was widely seen as a Kremlin-controlled project to draw votes away from actual opposition candidates and give voters a tame liberal option. “Sochi should become the Nice of <span class="loc">Russia</span>, where the majority can earn a living through small businesses,” <span class="per">Bogdanov</span> told The Moscow Times on <span class="date">Wednesday</span> after submitting his registration papers to the Sochi elections commission. The mayoral election in <span class="loc">Sochi</span>, which is slated to host the <span class="date">2014</span> <span class="date">Winter</span> Olympics, has become one of the year’s most intriguing political events. Several high-profile candidates, including opposition politician <span class="per">Boris Nemtsov</span> and businessman <span class="per">Alexander Lebedev</span>, have already announced that they would run for the post. <span class="per">Bogdanov</span>’s bid brings to the election one of the country’s most curious political actors. Though virtually unknown nationally, <span class="per">Bogdanov</span> was the only independent candidate who managed to get on the ballot of the <span class="date">2008</span> presidential election by collecting 2 million signatures to support his campaign. Critics call <span class="per">Bogdanov</span> a Kremlin stooge and say his inclusion on the presidential ballot was merely a Kremlin move to have a token liberal in the election, which <span class="per">Dmitry Medvedev</span> won by a landslide. Promising to make <span class="loc">Russia</span> an <span class="org">EU</span> member, <span class="per">Bogdanov</span> captured a measly 1.3 percent of the vote. <span class="per">Bogdanov</span>, who also who heads up the country’s largest Masonic lodge, told The Moscow Times by telephone <span class="date">Wednesday</span> that he would again run as an independent in the Sochi election. Twenty-two candidates had applied to get on the ballot as of <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, Interfax reported. The deadline to register for the <span class="date">April 26</span> election is <span class="date">Thursday</span>. State Duma Deputy <span class="per">Andrei Lugovoi</span>, who faces murder charges in <span class="loc">Britain</span> in connection with the <span class="date">2006</span> poisoning death of <span class="per">Alexander Litvinenko</span> in <span class="loc">London</span>, had expressed interest in running but announced <span class="date">this week</span> that he would not enter the race. The United <span class="loc">Russia</span> candidate, acting Sochi Mayor Anatoly Pakhomov, is seen as a favorite in the election.</p><br><br>
