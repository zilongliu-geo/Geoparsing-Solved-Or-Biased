  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Allahabad</span> (/əˈlɑːhəbɑːd/), also known as <span class="loc">Prayag</span> (/prəˈjɑːɡ/) and Ilahabad, is a city in the Indian state of <span class="loc">Uttar Pradesh</span> and the administrative headquarters of <span class="loc">Allahabad District</span>, the most-populous district in the state. As of <span class="date">2011</span>, <span class="loc">Allahabad</span> is the seventh most-populous city in the state, fifteenth in the Northern <span class="loc">India</span> and thirty-sixth in <span class="loc">India</span>, with an estimated population of 1.11 million in the city and 1.21 million in its metropolitan region. In <span class="date">2011</span> it was ranked the world's 130th fastest-growing city. <span class="loc">Allahabad</span>, in <span class="date">2013</span>, was ranked the third most livable city in the state (after <span class="per">Noida</span> and <span class="per">Lucknow</span>) and twenty-ninth in the country. The city's original name – Prayaga, or "place of offerings" – comes from its position at the <span class="loc">Sangam</span> (confluence) of the <span class="loc">Ganga</span>, <span class="loc">Yamuna</span> and mythical Sarasvati rivers. It is the second-oldest city in <span class="loc">India</span>, and plays a central role in Hindu scriptures. <span class="loc">Allahabad</span> was originally called <span class="loc">Kaushambi</span> (<span class="date">now</span> a separate district) by the Kuru rulers of <span class="loc">Hastinapur</span>, who developed it as their capital. Since then, <span class="loc">Allahabad</span> has been a political, cultural and administrative centre of the <span class="loc">Doab region</span>. Mughal emperor <span class="loc">Akbar</span> renamed it Ilahabad, which the British changed to <span class="loc">Allahabad</span>. In <span class="date">1833</span> it became the seat of the <span class="per">Ceded</span> and <span class="per">Conquered</span> Provinces region before its capital was moved to <span class="loc">Agra</span> in <span class="date">1835</span>. <span class="loc">Allahabad</span> became the capital of the North-Western Provinces in <span class="date">1858</span>, and was the capital of <span class="loc">India</span> for <span class="date">a day</span>. The city was the capital of the <span class="loc">United Provinces</span> from <span class="date">1902</span> to <span class="date">1920</span> and remained at the forefront of national importance during the struggle for Indian independence.</p><br><br>
