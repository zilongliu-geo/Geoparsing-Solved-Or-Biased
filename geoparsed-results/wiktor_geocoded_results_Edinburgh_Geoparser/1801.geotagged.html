<p><span class="loc">Holbrook</span> (<span class="loc">Navajo</span>: TÊ¼iisyaakin) is a city in <span class="loc">Navajo County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. According to the 2010 census, the population of the city was 5,053. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Navajo County</span>. <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> was founded in 1881 or 1882, when the railroad was built, and named to honor the first chief engineer of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Early Settlements and Exploration The <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> area was inhabited first by the Anasazi, then Puebloans, then the <span class="loc">Navajos</span> and Apaches. In 1540 (some seventy years before <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> or the Pilgrims) <span class="loc">Coronado</span> searched for the Seven Cities of <span class="loc">Cibola</span> and camped some sixty miles east of <span class="loc">Holbrook</span>. <span class="loc">Coronado</span> sent an expedition west to find the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span>, and they crossed the Little Colorado some twenty-five miles east of <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> and found a wonderland of colors they named "El Desierto Pintada" - The <span class="loc">Painted Desert</span>. The expedition was then lead by the Hopis to the Grand Canyon. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Settlements After the Mexican-American War ended in 1848 the area was ceded to the Untied States. In 1851 to 1857 the U.S. Army sent three expeditions along the 35th parallel, the third lead by Lt. Beale who created a ten foot wide wagon road. The area was known as <span class="loc">Navajo</span> Springs for a spring a dozen miles NE of <span class="loc">Holbrook</span>. Soon after a store and saloon was established at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Rio Puerco</span> and Little Colorado Rivers two miles east of <span class="loc">Holbrook</span>, and the area became known as Horsehead Crossing.</p>
