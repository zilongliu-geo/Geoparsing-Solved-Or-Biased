<p>Fire damages N.W. Rochester house; two dogs injured. Fire damaged a two-story house at 3537 Seventh Street Northwest tonight. The lone occupant of the house, an adult woman, evacuated safely, but two dogs in the basement had to be rescued, and their condition was questionable due to smoke inhilation, according to Rochester Fire Department Capt. Mark Keefe. The dogs were taken immediately to a vet clinic. Firefighters found one of the dogs under a bed, and the other in a kennel. The dogs had nearly lost consciousness, and "the guys said they looked like rag dolls when they took them out," Keefe said. Firefighters gave the dogs oxygen once they had cleared the house, and they began to breathe better. The dogs appeared to be black cocker spaniels, a firefighter said. The fire was reported at 9:00. The occupant was out of the house when firefighters arrived. Flames were showing in the basement, and were knocked down in about 10 minutes, Keefe said. Much of the house was damaged by smoke and water. The fire appears to have begun in the laundry room, Keefe said. The cause is under investigation. Firefighters mop up after dousing a fire in the basement of this house at 3537 Seventh Street N.W. late Tuesday night.</p>
