  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Karak</span> (Chinese: 加叻) is a small town in the <span class="loc">Bentong district</span> of <span class="loc">Pahang</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. It is well known as a rest town (Bandar Persinggahan) of Federal route  from <span class="loc">Kuala Lumpur</span> to <span class="loc">Kuantan</span>. It also gives its name to the famous Karak Highway, which links it to <span class="loc">Kuala Lumpur</span>. Famous Malaysian actors and actress, <span class="per">Daniel Razlan</span>, Mohd Farid Kamarudin, Nona bakar, <span class="loc">Sawiyah</span> <span class="per">Jeli</span> and <span class="per">Kalsom</span> <span class="loc">Kadir</span> currently live here. Nona Bakar was pioneer for program TV <span class="loc">Nona</span> at TV3. With its location at the foothills of <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>’s main mountain range, the Titiwangsa Mountain Range, this town is an important water catchment area not just for <span class="loc">Pahang</span> but for the <span class="loc">Klang</span> Valley as well. The Government has plans to build a massive RM2bil pipeline linking the <span class="loc">Pahang River</span> area to <span class="loc">Selangor</span> and the <span class="loc">Klang Valley</span>. Part of the pipeline will pass through <span class="loc">Karak</span>. Ironically, however, the main complaint in this town is the constantly disrupted water supply. Much of the problem stems from an aged water treatment plant, which has been in service for over <span class="date">30 years</span> and thus is inadequate even for a town the size of <span class="loc">Karak</span>.</p><br><br>
