<p>Bisha (Arabic: بيشة‎, Bīšah), also known as Qal`at <span class="loc">Bishah</span> (Arabic: قلعة بيشة‎, Qalʿat Bīšah), is a town in the south-western Saudi Arabian province, 'Asir. It is located at 20°0′0″N 42°36′0″E. Bisha was its own province before merging with its neighboring province, 'Asir. Bisha has a population of 205,346 according to the 2010 Census, with nearly 240 villages and 58 larger settlements that are spread out on both sides of the <span class="loc">Bisha</span> Valley (the longest valley in the <span class="loc">Arabian Peninsula</span>). The city is located to the south of the <span class="loc">Arabian Peninsula</span>, which is almost entirely under the administration of the <span class="loc">Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</span>. It stands at an altitude of approximately 610 meters (2,000 ft.) above sea level. The Bisha area is of immense agricultural importance due to high soil fertility, abundant water, and palm cultivation. There are around 3,000,000 palm trees, among other trees of multiple varieties, and their fruits are sold widely to cities in the vicinity. Ibn Saud then set out to conquer the surrounding region with the goal of bringing it under the rule of a single Islamic state. Ibn Dawwas of <span class="loc">Riyadh</span> led the most determined resistance, allied with forces from <span class="loc">Al Kharj</span>, <span class="loc">Al Ahsa</span>, and the <span class="loc">Banu Yam</span> clan of <span class="loc">Najran</span>. However, Ibn Dawwas fled and <span class="loc">Riyadh</span> capitulated to the Saudis in 1774, ending long years of wars, and leading to the declaration of the first Saudi State, with <span class="loc">Riyadh</span> as its capital.</p>
