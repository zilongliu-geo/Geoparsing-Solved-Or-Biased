<p>Churchill is a town in the <span class="loc">Latrobe</span> Valley, located in central <span class="loc">Gippsland</span> in the east of Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The town had a population of 4,588 at the 2006 census, and is part of the <span class="loc">Latrobe City</span> local government area. The town was named in honour of former British leader Sir Winston Churchill. Churchill was formerly known as Hazelwood, Victoria and began as a service centre for the Hazelwood Power Station and future replacement for <span class="loc">Yallourn</span> and <span class="loc">Morwell</span> townships. The site was chosen for its pleasant location at the foot of the Strzelecki Ranges, overlooking Hazelwood pondage. It was relatively free from air pollution, is not above rich coalfields and is in close proximity to the larger towns and power stations in the <span class="loc">Latrobe</span> Valley. Construction of Churchill began in 1965. In that year the first two houses in Churchill were completed and occupied by the Arch and Ayers families who received morning paper deliveries from Yinnar General Store, and milk delivery from John Koedijk. Within a week five more families arrived and so the town began to grow street by street. The town was sufficiently advanced for the Post Office to open on 11 April 1966. The shopping centre in Churchill was officially opened on July 1967, the first two shops (butcher and pharmacy) having opened 19 May 1967. In that year many new traders opened for business. All the shop keepers were offered a commission house in Churchill for their use. The Churchill Newsagency opened in 1967 and was run by Ian and Winifred <span class="loc">Jones</span> who had previously run the Yinnar General Store. A Tattersalls agency was established in 1975. The Churchill Newsagency business was later purchased in April 1978 by Jack and Olive <span class="loc">Robson</span></p>
