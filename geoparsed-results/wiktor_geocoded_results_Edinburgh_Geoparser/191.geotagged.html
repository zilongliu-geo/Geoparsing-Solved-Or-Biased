<p>Esperanza is a first class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Agusan del Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 51,897 people. It renowned as the "Tilapia Capital of the Province" and has an official moniker of "The Home of Cultural Diversity". Esperanza is politically subdivided into 47 barangays. In July 1917, a flood and storm swept through <span class="loc">Agusan del Sur</span> in Barangay Cubo of Esperanza. After the storm, a Manobo woman named Bilay Ocampo was on the banks of the muddy <span class="loc">Wawa River</span> where she eventually found a figure where it washed up from the river. The 21-karat gold figure dating to around 850 to 950 C.E. weighs 4 lbs and depicts a woman sitting in the lotus position in Buddhism, is ornamented with jewelry on her body, and wears a headdress. This figure turned out to be a representation of the Bodhisattva Tara. Now known as the "Golden Tara", after its discovery, it was handed to the former Deputy Governor Bias Baclagon then it was passed to the Agusan Coconut Company, because of a debt. It was then being sold and was purchased for 4,000 pesos by the wife of American Governor-General Leonard Wood, Faye Cooper-Cole, who was the curator of <span class="loc">Chicago</span> Field Museumâ€™s Southeast Asian department. They then donated the Golden Tara to the Field Museum in <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span> where it is currently held in the <span class="loc">Grainger</span> Hall of Gems. Dr. H. Otley Beyer, known as the father of Philippine Archaeology and Anthropology, tried to encourage the government to buy the artifact however all attempts failed due to lack of funds.</p>
