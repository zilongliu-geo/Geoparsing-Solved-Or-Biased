<p><span class="loc">Ona</span> is a village and an island group located in Sandøy Municipality in Møre og <span class="loc">Romsdal county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. The tiny island of <span class="loc">Ona</span> and the larger island of Husøy are separated by a shallow 15-metre (49 ft) wide waterway. The two islands are collectively referred to as <span class="loc">Ona</span>. The islands are located 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) northwest of the island of Sandøya. The historic village of <span class="loc">Ona</span> covers most of the tiny island of <span class="loc">Ona</span>. On the Onakalven cliff, the highest point on <span class="loc">Ona</span>, is the Ona Lighthouse which was built in 1867. The lighthouse and the tiny island itself has become a well known tourist spot in Western <span class="loc">Norway</span>. It has a ferry connection with the other islands in Sandøy and to the island of <span class="loc">Gossa</span> in <span class="loc">Aukra Municipality</span>. The island has a population of about 40, with a gradually diminishing population for the last 50 years. <span class="loc">Ona</span> has been populated for centuries because of the proximity to the fishing grounds further out to the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>, and fishing has traditionally been the only source of income. Lately, several pottery artists have moved to the island.</p>
