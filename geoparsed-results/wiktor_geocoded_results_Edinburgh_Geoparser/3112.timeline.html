  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Camden</span> is a city in, and the county seat of, <span class="loc">Kershaw County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,838 in the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, <span class="per">Camden</span> has a total area of 10.68 square miles (27.7 km2), of which 10.07 square miles (26.1 km2) is land and 0.61 square miles (1.6 km2) (5.71%) is water. <span class="per">Camden</span> is the oldest inland city and fourth oldest city in <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. It is near the center of the Cofitachequi chiefdom that existed in the 1500s. In <span class="date">1730</span>, <span class="per">Camden</span> became part of a township plan ordered by King <span class="per">George II</span>. <span class="loc">Kershaw County</span>’s official web site states, “Originally laid out in <span class="date">1732</span> as the town of <span class="loc">Fredericksburg</span> in the <span class="loc">Wateree River</span> swamp (south of the present town) when King <span class="per">George II</span> ordered eleven inland townships established along <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>'s rivers, few of the area settlers chose to take lots surveyed in the town, choosing the higher ground to the north. The township soon disappeared.” In <span class="date">1758</span>, <span class="per">Joseph Kershaw</span>, from <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> came into the township, established a store and renamed the town Pine Tree Hill. <span class="per">Camden</span> became the main inland trade center in the colony. <span class="per">Kershaw</span> suggested that the town be renamed <span class="per">Camden</span>, in honor of <span class="per">Lord Camden</span>, the champion of colonial rights.</p><br><br>
