<p>Authorities are currently working with employees of AirTran Airways to find passengers who sat near a teenage girl with bacterial meningitis on AirTran flights 687 and 862 on Saturday. After falling "seriously ill" during the second flight, from <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span> to <span class="loc">Wichita</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> the girl was diagnosed with meningitis, an infection of the brain and spinal cord, at Wichita's Wesley Medical Center. Although meningitis cannot be transferred merely through casual contact, AirTran notified the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday, and are attempting to track the passengers who sat near the girl on the two flights.</p>
