It is the second most important city of the department and is the rice capital of the center of the country. It is flanked by the Magdalena and Coello rivers. <span class="loc">El Espinal</span> is known for the manufacture of typical musical instruments and its cuisine is known for tamales and the suckling pig, which are the typical dishes of the region. It has a total length of 231 km², an urban area of 4.26 km², and a rural area of 212.74 km². The town is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="loc">Espinal</span>. Despite its low elevation, <span class="loc">El Espinal</span> has a temperate climate with abundant rainfall from March to May and from October to November. The increased solar radiation during these months due to the position of the sun increases temperatures in the jungle and favors the formation of storms in the mountainous areas. In contrast, the more dry seasons of the year are from January to February and from July to August. Frost occurs in rural areas, mist is extremely rare, and 10 days out of the year are foggy. Historians report that between the years 1930 to 1940 there were many hailstorms.</p>
