<p><span class="loc">Palu</span> is a chartered city (kota) on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, 1,650 kilometres (1,030 miles) northeast of <span class="loc">Jakarta</span>, at 0°54′S 119°50′E, at the mouth of <span class="loc">Palu</span> River. It is the capital of the province of <span class="loc">Central Sulawesi</span> of a long, narrow bay. Because of its sheltered position between mountain ridges, the climate is unusually dry. At the 2010 Census <span class="loc">Palu</span> had a population of around 336,300, not including those living in neighbouring regencies. In April 1958 during the Permesta rebellion in <span class="loc">North Sulawesi</span>, the <span class="loc">USA</span> supported and supplied the rebels. Pilots from a CIA <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>-based front organisation, Civil Air Transport, flying CIA B-26 Invader aircraft, repeatedly bombed and machine-gunned targets in and around <span class="loc">Palu</span>; destroying vehicles, buildings, a bridge and a ship. On 24 January 2005 at 04:10 (UTC+8), an earthquake with magnitude 6.2 Richter scale occurred in the city. According to the local meteorological office, the epicenter of the earthquake was around 1.249° S, 119.922° E, some 16 kilometres (10 miles) southeast of <span class="loc">Palu</span> at the depth of 30 kilometres (19 miles) of Bora Village's hot spring, Biromaru sub-district, Donggala Regency. Panic ensued as most people sought refuge in the highlands for fear of a repeat disaster like the tsunami as occurred in Aceh. The earthquake killed one person, injured four others, and destroyed 177 buildings.</p>
