He was listed in critical condition when he was admitted to the hospital Monday. Police have said they do not know whether Mangini was wearing a seat belt, but his airbags did deploy when he lost control of his car and crashed head-on into a tree in <span class="loc">Berlin</span>. Mangini was transported from the scene by Life Star after firefighters cut the door and the roof from his car. Berlin police are investigating the crash. Witnesses who saw the crash or Mangini prior the crash are asked to call Officer Robert Canto at (860) 828-7080.</p>
