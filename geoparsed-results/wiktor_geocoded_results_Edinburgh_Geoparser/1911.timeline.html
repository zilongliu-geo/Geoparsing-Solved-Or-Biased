  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Safi</span> (Berber: <span class="loc">Asfi</span>, ⴰⵙⴼⵉ; Arabic: أسفي‎, Portuguese: <span class="loc">Safim</span>) is a city in western <span class="loc">Morocco</span> on the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>. The capital of <span class="loc">Safi Province</span>, it has a population of 282,227 (<span class="date">2004</span> census), but is also the centre of an agglomeration which has an estimated 793,000 inhabitants (<span class="date">1987</span>). The city was under protectorate by the Portuguese Empire from <span class="date">1488</span> to <span class="date">1541</span>, the fortress built by <span class="loc">Vasco da Gama</span>'s brother-in-law to protect the city, under Portuguese rule is still there <span class="date">today</span>. <span class="loc">Safi</span> is the main fishing port for the country's sardine industry, and also exports phosphates, textiles and ceramics . During the Second World War, <span class="loc">Safi</span> was one of the landing sites for Operation Torch. The city's name as it is locally pronounced is "Asfi", which was Latinized as "Safi" and "Safim" under Portuguese rule. "Asfi" means flood or river estuary in <span class="loc">Berber</span> and comes from the Berber root "sfi/sfey" which means to flood, to spill or to pour. 11th-century geographer Al-Idrisi gave an apparently false explanation to the origin the name "Asfi" as he linked it to the Arabic word "Asaf" (regret); Asafi (my regret). He based this claim on a strange story about some sailors from al-Andalus who sailed to discover the other end of the Atlantic ocean but got lost and landed on some island where the natives captured them and sent them back on their ships blindfolded. The ships eventually ended on the shores of "Asfi" and locals helped the lost sailors and told them that they were <span class="date">two months</span> away from their native land al-Andalus. Upon hearing this one of the sailors responded by saying: "Wa asafi" (Oh my regret). Al-Idrisi wrote that from that time the city carried the name "Asafi". This story is thought to be a legend and unlikely explanation of the origin of the name.</p><br><br>
