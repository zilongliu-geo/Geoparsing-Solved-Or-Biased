  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Nogales</span> is a city in the mountainous western region of the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Veracruz</span>. It serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of <span class="loc">Nogales</span>. It is situated at 18°49′N 97°10′W, at an altitude of 1280 m. In the <span class="date">2005</span> INEGI Census, the city reported a total population of 21113. The name "Nogales" is the Spanish for walnut trees. This part of <span class="date">the future</span> state of <span class="loc">Veracruz</span> was brought under Aztec sway in or around <span class="date">1450</span> under Emperor Moctezuma Ilhuicamina. Following the Spanish conquest of <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, the area was awarded to the conquistador Ojeda el Tuerto. <span class="loc">Ojeda</span> introduced sugar cane into the area, and the <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="per">Juan Bautista</span> Nogales sugar mill – one of the earliest, if not the very first on the American continent – was later established there. In <span class="date">1627</span>, <span class="per">Rodrigo de Vivero</span> y Aberrucia, owner of the sugar mill at the time, was named <span class="org">the First Count of the Valley</span> of <span class="loc">Orizaba</span> by <span class="per">Philip III</span> of <span class="loc">Spain</span>. On <span class="date">27 October 1812</span>, during <span class="org">the War of Independence</span>, the sugar mill was taken by surprise by General <span class="per">José María Morelos</span>, who used it as a staging post for his attack on the royalist forces in <span class="loc">Orizaba</span> <span class="date">the next day</span>.</p><br><br>
