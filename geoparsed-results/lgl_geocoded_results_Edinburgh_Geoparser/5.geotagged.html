<p>Water boil advisory issued in downtown <span class="loc">Pineville</span>. Service was interrupted Monday night when a valve to a 6-inch water main blew on the corner of Lakeview and Harrison streets, forcing interruption of water services to the hospital and many residents between Shamrock Street and the levee. With service restored, that area is now under the customary "water boil advisory" that normally follows depressurizing of a water line.</p>
