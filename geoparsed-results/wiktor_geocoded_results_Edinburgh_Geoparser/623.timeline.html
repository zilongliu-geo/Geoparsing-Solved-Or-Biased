  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Belmont</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, the capital <span class="loc">city of Western Australia</span>, and is located 7 kilometres (4 mi) east of <span class="loc">Perth</span>'s central business district (CBD) on the southern bank of the <span class="loc">Swan River</span>. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Belmont</span>. The suburb, part of a land grant assigned to <span class="per">Captain Francis Henry Byrne</span> in <span class="date">1831</span>, was believed to have been named <span class="loc">Belmont</span> after <span class="per">Byrne</span>'s estate in <span class="loc">England</span>. The land was purchased by Shepherd Smith of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> in <span class="date">1882</span>, who subdivided it in <span class="date">1897</span>–<span class="date">1898</span>. The suburb was known as "<span class="loc">Belmont</span> Park" until being renamed in <span class="date">1968</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, the suburb is mixed-use in character. The western part of the suburb is primarily industrial and commercial, while the east and north are more residential, with various motels and other accommodation along Great Eastern Highway which forms the suburb's north-western boundary. It contains two public schools—Belmont Primary School, and <span class="loc">Belmont City</span> College (formerly <span class="org">Belmont Senior High School</span>)—as well as Centenary Park, Signal Hill Bushland, the Belgravia Residential Estate and a 500-metre (1,600 ft) section on the south bank of the <span class="loc">Swan River</span>.</p><br><br>
