  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Site of proposed casino near <span class="loc">Chinatown</span> going to auction. Developers are planning to sell 22 acres near <span class="loc">Chinatown</span> – the site of a proposed Asian-themed casino – at a bankruptcy auction <span class="date">May 16</span>. The site of the proposed <span class="org">Dragon</span> <span class="loc">City Hotel</span> and Resort is bound by Valley View Boulevard, Spring Mountain Road, Wynn Road and Desert Inn Road. The land took <span class="date">seven years</span> to assemble and is zoned for a 28-story, 2,200-room hotel with 500,000 square feet of gaming, restaurant, entertainment and meeting space, according to a press release issued by <span class="org">Chartwell Group</span>, which is overseeing the auction. The sale, subject to approval by a bankruptcy court judge, is a "highly strategic opportunity for buyers to acquire a fully entitled casino site in an unparalleled location," <span class="per">Michael E. Berland</span>, executive vice president and principal of <span class="org">Chartwell Group</span>’s Accelerated Marketing Division, said in a statement. Bidding will start at $27.5 million. The <span class="org">Dragon</span> City resort is one of multiple proposals for Asian-themed casinos in <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> that have not come to fruition. Even before the recession, financing for off-Strip casinos by industry newcomers was difficult at best. In an interview with In Business <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> in <span class="date">2006</span>, businessman <span class="per">Andrew Lai</span> said his proposed resort had the potential to draw Asian tourists from the Strip and would be a place where Asians – a growing segment of casino customers – would feel at home.</p><br><br>
