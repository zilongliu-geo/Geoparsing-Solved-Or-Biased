<p><span class="loc">Thornton</span> is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Sefton</span>, in <span class="loc">Merseyside</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Situated to the north east of <span class="loc">Crosby</span>, it is a residential area of semi-detached and detached housing which dates mainly from the 1930s. Many of the houses, particularly those around Edge Lane and <span class="loc">Water Street</span>, feature notably long gardens. The A565 Liverpool-Southport road serves the area. At the 2001 Census the population of the village and civil parish was recorded as 2,262, falling to 2,139 at the Census 2011. Historically part of <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>. During the compilation of the Domesday Book in 1086, the settlement of Torent√∫n is recorded, along with the settlement of <span class="loc">Homer Green</span>, which far outdates any claim that <span class="loc">Ince Blundell</span> is the oldest village in <span class="loc">Sefton</span>. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> was combined with <span class="loc">Crosby Village</span> and <span class="loc">Blundellsands</span> to form the <span class="loc">Great Crosby</span> urban district. The district subsequently became part the municipal <span class="loc">borough of Crosby</span> in 1937. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> was still served by <span class="loc">West Lancashire</span> Council until the formation of the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Sefton</span> on 1 April 1974. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> still however retains Parish Council status and therefore has a historical boundary.</p>
