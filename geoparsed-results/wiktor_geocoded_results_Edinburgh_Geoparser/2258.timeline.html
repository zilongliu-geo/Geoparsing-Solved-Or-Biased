  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Balla</span> (pronounced <span class="loc">Bal</span>) (Irish: <span class="loc">Balla</span>, meaning "wall"), is a small town in <span class="loc">County Mayo</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span> on the N60 National secondary road, the main road between <span class="loc">Castlebar</span> and <span class="loc">Claremorris</span>. The economy of the village survives mainly on passing trade, from the busy N60 which carries over 7,000 vehicles through the village every day. <span class="loc">Balla</span> has only one street. It is notable for its round tower. It used to be a significant shop and market centre. It fell into decline and lost its railway station, but has enjoyed something of a revival as a residential area for people working in <span class="loc">Castlebar</span>. In early times the village was known as 'Ros Dairbhreach', meaning 'The Height of the <span class="loc">Oak Wood</span>'. The continuing importance of the oak to the local community is reflected in the appropriately named "Dawn Oak <span class="date">2000</span>" project. At the beginning of the 21st century, <span class="date">2000</span> oak trees were planted, creating a new wood in <span class="loc">Balla</span>'s town park. According to Adrian Room in A Dictionary of Irish Placenames, the name refers to the Tobar Mhuire, known in English as the Blessed Well, i.e., of the Blessed <span class="org">Virgin</span> Mary) to the west of <span class="loc">Balla</span>. This was enclosed by a wall in the 7th century, traditionally by St. <span class="per">Mo Chua</span>.</p><br><br>
