<p><span class="loc">Gladstone</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Clay County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, is a suburb of <span class="loc">Kansas City</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The <span class="loc">City of Gladstone</span> has the advantage of being located only 10 minutes from downtown <span class="loc">Kansas City</span>, and 10 minutes from <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> International Airport. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 26,365. How did <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> get its name? There are two versions of the story, so you’ll have to decide which one you prefer. One version is told in a beautiful, framed calligraphy scroll which was signed and presented to the City on July 4, 1976 by two members of the first City Council who were instrumental in the City’s incorporation in 1952. The story goes that when the Petition for Incorporation was presented to the Circuit Court of <span class="loc">Clay County</span>, the bearers were informed the Petition was incomplete because the name of the proposed new city was not shown. As time was of the essence (<span class="loc">Kansas City</span> had plans to annex this area), a hurried meeting was called and Mrs. Maria Harless, who later became the first City Clerk, suggested the name of <span class="loc">Gladstone</span>. At that time, much publicity was being given to Southwestern Bell Telephone Company’s opening of the new <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> telephone exchange in this area. Mrs. Harless reasoned that the publicity this name received would also provide some much-needed publicity for this newborn city. Thus, the name <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> was borrowed from the telephone company.</p>
