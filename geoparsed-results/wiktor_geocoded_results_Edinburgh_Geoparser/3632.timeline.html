  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Davenport is a <span class="loc">district of Stockport</span>, <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span> in the North West region of England.The <span class="date">2011</span> census gave a total population (including <span class="loc">Cale Green</span>) of 14,924. Davenport's name arose from the building of Davenport railway station at the behest of the Davenport family who since the later 14th century had owned nearby <span class="loc">Bramall</span> Hall in the neighbouring village of <span class="loc">Bramhall</span>. The family, in its turn, took its name from their ancestral estate of that name located between <span class="loc">Holmes Chapel</span> and <span class="loc">Congleton</span>, in mid-Cheshire, an estate recorded in the Domesday Book of <span class="date">1086</span>, where it is listed as 'Deneport'. Originally Davenport's expansion in the 1850s consisted of three key routes; <span class="loc">Bramhall</span> Lane, Kennerley <span class="per">Road</span> and <span class="per">Buxton</span> Road, all of which remain in place <span class="date">today</span>. The aforementioned railway station is positioned at Davenport's main road junction, and allows travel by rail towards <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">Stockport</span>, <span class="loc">Hazel Grove</span>, and <span class="loc">Buxton</span>. <span class="date">The 1900s</span> saw an increase in construction of residential houses and commercial developments. Later, the aftermath of World War II saw the demolition of larger, older properties, standing in quite extensive gardens, to make way for the building of smaller private residences and flats in Davenport.</p><br><br>
