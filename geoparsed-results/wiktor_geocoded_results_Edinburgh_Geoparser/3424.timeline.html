  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Austin</span> (/ˈɒstɪn, ˈɔː-/) is the capital of the <span class="loc">US</span> state of <span class="per">Texas</span> and the seat of <span class="loc">Travis County</span>. Located in Central <span class="per">Texas, Austin</span> is the 11th-most populous city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> and the fourth-most populous city in <span class="per">Texas</span>. It is the fastest growing of the largest 50 <span class="loc">US</span> cities. <span class="per">Austin</span> is also the second largest state capital in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, after Phoenix, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. As of <span class="date">July 1, 2014</span>, <span class="per">Austin</span> had a population of 912,791 (<span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> estimate). The city is the cultural and economic center of the Austin–Round Rock metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 1,943,299 as of <span class="date">July 1, 2014</span>. In the 1830s, pioneers began to settle the area in central <span class="per">Austin</span> along the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span>. After Republic of <span class="per">Texas</span> Vice President <span class="per">Mirabeau B. Lamar</span> visited the area during a buffalo-hunting expedition between <span class="date">1837</span> and <span class="date">1838</span>, he proposed that the republic's capital, then located in Houston, be relocated to the area situated on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> near the present-day Congress Avenue Bridge. In <span class="date">1839</span>, the site was officially chosen as the republic's new capital (the republic's seventh and final location) and was incorporated under the name <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. Shortly thereafter, the name was changed to <span class="per">Austin</span> in honor of <span class="per">Stephen F. Austin</span>, the "Father of <span class="per">Texas</span>" and the republic's first secretary of state.</p><br><br>
