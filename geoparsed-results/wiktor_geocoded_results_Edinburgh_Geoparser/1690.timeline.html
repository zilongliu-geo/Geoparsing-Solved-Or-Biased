  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pandan</span> is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Antique</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. In the <span class="date">2010</span> census data, it had a population of 32,494 people. <span class="loc">Pandan</span> is also one of the Antique Province's industrialized towns and a major tourist destination for its natural wonders, its cold spring, the <span class="loc">Bugang River</span> and white beaches along the <span class="loc">Pandan Bay</span> from Barangay Mag-aba to Barangay Duyong. <span class="loc">Pandan</span> consists of 34 barangays, of which 15 lie along the coast, 12 are inland, and 7 are upland. The Philippine dialect generally spoken in the <span class="loc">province of Antique</span> is called Kinaray-a (Kee-nah-rye-ah). The people of Pandan—called "Pandananons"—uses a version of Kinaray-a which differs somewhat with that used by most of the other Antique residents. The Pandananon version is more similar to the dialect spoken in <span class="loc">Aklan province</span>, which shares a boundary with <span class="loc">Pandan</span>. Thus, for example, the English word "No" is "Wara" in Kinaray-a but "Uwa" or "Wa" in Pandananon. E.g. "There is no electricity <span class="date">today</span>" translates into "Wara ti sulo kadya" in Kinaray-a, but "Uwa it iwag kaya" in Pandananon. Pandananons also speak and understand the Hiligaynon language.</p><br><br>
