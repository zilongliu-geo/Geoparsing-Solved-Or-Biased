<p><span class="loc">Wilton</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Wilton</span> Junction) is a city in Cedar and Muscatine Counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. The population was 2,839 at the 2010 census. The <span class="loc">Muscatine County</span> portion of <span class="loc">Wilton</span> is part of the Muscatine Micropolitan Statistical Area.

The first white settler to build a home the area that was to be known as <span class="loc">Wilton</span> in the new state of <span class="loc">Iowa</span> (1846) was Mr. Christian Marolf who came in July 1849, and erected of a small log house opposite the German Lutheran church. When he built his home Mr. Marolf could only see one the home of Mr. Stearns just west of town on the south side of the <span class="loc">Moscow</span> road. Mr. Marolf was soon followed by Mr. Ben Maurer in 1850 whose land now comprises <span class="loc">North Wilton</span> and Peter Marolf in 1851, which is now known as Marolf's addition. <span class="loc">North Wilton</span> is at present (1947) not within the corporate limits of <span class="loc">Wilton</span>. The city was once home to the Wilton German English College from 1894 to 1905. The campus of the college was later turned into City Park, and some of the college's buildings remain to this day.</p>
