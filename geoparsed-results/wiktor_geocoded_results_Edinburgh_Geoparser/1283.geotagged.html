<p>Long Beach is a city in <span class="loc">Pacific County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,392 at the 2010 census. Long Beach began when Henry Harrison Tinker bought a land claim from Charles E. Reed in 1880. He platted the town and called it "Tinkerville." Long Beach was officially incorporated on January 18, 1922. From 1889 to 1930, a narrow gauge railroad called the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company ran up the whole peninsula. The Long Beach depot was built between First and Second Streets on the east side of the track, which ran north along "B" Street. A major destination in Long Beach was Tinker's Hotel, later renamed the Long Beach Hotel, and built very close to the station. This was the second hotel built at the site by Henry Harrison Tinker, the founder of Long Beach. Tinker's first hotel burned down in 1894. He built another one just a few feet to the east and south of the rail depot. The image in the gallery shows a crowd waiting for the train sometime between 1901 and 1907. Just across the tracks (which doubled in this area) from Tinker's Hotel in Long Beach was the Portland Hotel. The Portland Hotel, owned by the Hanniman family featured an enormous round (and unique) turret-like structure. The Portland Hotel burned down on December 6, 1914, and was not replaced. The Driftwood Hotel was another common Long Beach destination.</p>
