  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Estancia is a second class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Iloilo</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 42,666 people. Estancia is located in the northern part of the <span class="loc">Iloilo Province</span> approximately 135 kilometres (84 mi) from the provincial capital of <span class="loc">Iloilo City</span>. Estancia was originally a ranch for a wealthy Spaniard named Rodrigo who intermarried with a local woman. Estancia is not known for its agricultural products nor livestock but rather for its location as it is adjacent to <span class="loc">Carles</span>' impressive marine resources. Estancia has a fishport and a pier - these being one of the most developed in northern visayas, a banking industry, cable television, a hospital (adjacent only, that belongs to the Municipality of <span class="loc">Balasan</span>) and resorts. Estancia is known around the country as a center for commercial fishing, so much so that it shares to carries the name "Alaska of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, with <span class="loc">Carles</span> (The true <span class="loc">Alaska</span> of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>) as a testament to its location adjacent to <span class="loc">Carles</span>' bountiful marine resources. The reason for this is that <span class="loc">Carles</span> lies in the <span class="loc">Visayan Sea</span> triangle, an imaginary triangle extending from the <span class="loc">provinces of Iloilo</span>, <span class="loc">Negros</span>, <span class="loc">Cebu</span>, <span class="loc">Samar</span>, and <span class="loc">Masbate</span>. This triangle is a part of the "Sulu-Sulaweisi Triangle" of the <span class="loc">Sulu Sea</span> and neighboring <span class="loc">Indonesia</span> where a large concentration of marine organisms coupled with climate conditions support a massive marine ecosystem. Various commercial species are harvested along <span class="loc">Carles</span>' waters, namely mackerel, barracuda, sardines, shad, pompano, grouper, squid, cuttlefish, shrimp, prawns, shells, seaweed and others, this all are catches from <span class="loc">Carles</span>' water territory and brought to Estancia's fishport.</p><br><br>
