<p><span class="loc">Detroit</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was named for <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, in the 1890s because of the large number of people from <span class="loc">Michigan</span> in the community. The population was 202 at the 2010 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Salem Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The original townsite of <span class="loc">Detroit</span> was inundated in the summer of 1952 when the Corps of Engineers finished <span class="loc">Detroit</span> Dam on the <span class="loc">Santiam River</span>. The community was relocated about 1⁄2 mile (0.80 km) northwest of the original site, on Route 22, and was incorporated as a city the same year. Located near <span class="loc">Detroit Lake</span> and <span class="loc">Detroit Lake State Park</span>, <span class="loc">Detroit</span>'s economy is dependent on tourism. The community suffered from a drought in 2001, when <span class="loc">Detroit Lake</span> was little more than the <span class="loc">Santiam River</span> through the summer. In 2010, by a vote of 47–37 citizens in <span class="loc">Detroit</span> voted down a ballot measure that would have changed the city's name to <span class="loc">Detroit Lake</span>, the name of the neighboring reservoir and one of the most visited summer sites in <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. The proposal was put forth by Doug DeGeorge, a builder and motel owner who resides in <span class="loc">Arizona</span> and wanted to disassociate the town from <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, and its close ties to "crime, corruption, failing schools and a shaky auto industry". Doug DeGeorge was not present on the day of the city counsel vote, but repercussions from his comments had phone lines flooded with angry calls from <span class="loc">Michigan</span> residents. Voters chose to keep the original name of the city, however, most residents and tourists still call it <span class="loc">Detroit Lake</span>. Gary Brown, a city councilman in <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, disagreed with the proposal, saying local residents would have made a big mistake because the <span class="loc">Motor City</span> will one day return to its previous glory.</p>
