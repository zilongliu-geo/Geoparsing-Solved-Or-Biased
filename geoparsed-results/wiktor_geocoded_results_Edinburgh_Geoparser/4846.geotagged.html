<p>Grafton is a suburb of <span class="loc">Auckland City</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. The suburb is named for the Duke of Grafton, a patron of the first Governor of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, William Hobson, and the grandfather of a subsequent Governor, Robert FitzRoy. Once known as '<span class="loc">Grafton Heights</span>', denoting its history as a well-off suburb in Auckland's earliest decades. According to the 2001 census, Grafton has a population of 2,052. The suburb is characterised by its many historic buildings, many of them essentially unchanged from the early decades of the 20th century. While the extents of the suburb have shrunk with the motorway and arterial road construction of the middle 20th century, the remaining smaller suburb thus has a highly cohesive structure, which is recognised, for example, in the residential zoning which discourages demolition of existing buildings. Grafton has a local resident's association, abbreviated as the GRA. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> Bridge: Spanning <span class="loc">Grafton</span> Gully and connecting the Auckland CBD with Grafton and parts further east this was the largest piece of Civil Engineering in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. When it was completed in 1910 it was the largest reinforced concrete arched bridge in the world, spanning almost 300 metres.</p>
