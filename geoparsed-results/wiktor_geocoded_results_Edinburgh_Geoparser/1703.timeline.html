  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Marlborough</span> (often spelled <span class="loc">Marlboro</span>) is a city in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 38,499 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> became a prosperous industrial town in the 19th century and made the transition to high technology industry in the late 20th century after the construction of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Turnpike. <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> was declared a town in <span class="date">1660</span>. It was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1890</span> when it changed its Municipal charter from a <span class="loc">New England</span> town meeting system to a Mayorâ€“council government. <span class="per">Christopher Allen</span> was recorded as marshal of <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> in <span class="date">1638</span> and married to <span class="per">Mary Wetherbee</span>. <span class="per">John Howe</span>, Jr. in <span class="date">1656</span> was a fur trader and built a house at the intersection of two Indian trails, <span class="loc">Nashua Trail</span> and <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> path. He could speak the language of the Algonquian Indians though the local tribe referred to themselves as the Pennacooks. The settlers were welcomed by the Indians because they protected them from other tribes they were at war with. In the 1650s, several families left the nearby town of <span class="loc">Sudbury</span>, 18 miles west of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, to start a new town. The village was named after <span class="loc">Marlborough</span>, the market town in <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It was first settled in <span class="date">1657</span> by 14 men led by <span class="per">Edmund Rice</span>, <span class="per">John Ruddock</span> and <span class="per">John Howe</span>; in <span class="date">1656</span> Rice and his colleagues petitioned the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> to create the town of <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> and it was officially incorporated in <span class="date">1660</span>. Rice was elected a selectman at <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> in <span class="date">1657</span>. <span class="per">Sumner Chilton Powell</span> wrote, in Puritan Village: The Formation of a New <span class="loc">England</span> Town, "Not only did Rice become the largest individual landholder in <span class="loc">Sudbury</span>, but he represented his new town in the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> legislature for <span class="date">five years</span> and devoted at least eleven of his <span class="date">last fifteen years</span> to serving as selectman and judge of small causes."</p><br><br>
