  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Paradise is an unincorporated town and census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, adjacent to the city of <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>. The population was 223,167 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. As an unincorporated town, it is governed by the <span class="org">Clark County Commission</span> with input from the Paradise Town Advisory Board. Paradise was formed on <span class="date">December 8, 1950</span>. Paradise contains McCarran International Airport; the <span class="org">University of Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>; and most of the <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> Strip. Paradise contains most tourist attractions in the <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> area, excluding downtown. Despite this, the name Paradise remains relatively unknown. All Paradise ZIP codes have <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> mailing addresses. The southern part of the <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> Valley was referred to as Paradise Valley as early as <span class="date">1910</span>, owing to a high water table that made the land particularly fertile for farming. County commissioners established a Paradise school district in <span class="date">1914</span>. In <span class="date">1950</span>, mayor Ernie Cragin of <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>, looking to fund an ambitious building agenda and pay down the city's rising debt, sought to expand the city's tax base by annexing the <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> Strip which was unincorporated territory. A group of casino executives, led by <span class="per">Gus Greenbaum</span> of the Flamingo, lobbied the county commissioners for township status which would prevent the city from annexing the land without the commission's approval. The commission voted to create the unincorporated township of Paradise on <span class="date">December 8, 1950</span>.</p><br><br>
