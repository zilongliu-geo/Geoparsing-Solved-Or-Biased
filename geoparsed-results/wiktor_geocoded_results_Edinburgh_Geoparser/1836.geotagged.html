<p>Oni (Georgian: ონი) is a town in Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo <span class="loc">Svaneti region</span> (mkhare), <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. Historically and ethnographically, it is part of <span class="loc">Racha</span>, a historic highland province in western <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. The town also serves as an administrative center of the Oni district (raioni). Oni is situated in a deep gorge on the left bank of <span class="loc">Rioni</span> River, some 830 metres (2,723 feet) above sea level and 210 kilometres (130 miles) northwest of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>’s capital Tbilisi. The territory of modern-day Oni has been inhabited since the Bronze Age. Archaeology revealed the artifacts of Colchian culture, particularly a collection of Colchian coins dating back to the 6th-3rd centuries BC. Oni is first chronicled in the 15th century, though a legend has it that the town was founded by the 2nd BC king Pharnajom of <span class="loc">Iberia</span>. Located on the crossroads from Northern Caucasus, <span class="loc">Kartli</span> (central <span class="loc">Georgia</span>), Imereti (western <span class="loc">Georgia</span>) and Lower <span class="loc">Rach</span>’a, Oni developed into a typical late medieval commercial town and was contested between the kings of Imereti and the princes of <span class="loc">Rach</span>’a. The town was absorbed by Imperial <span class="loc">Russia</span> in 1810, and made it, in 1846 a center of the <span class="loc">Rach</span>’a district. During the Soviet Union, the town was united with a number of surrounding villages into the Oni district, which is currently administered as a part of the Racha-Lechkhumi and Lower <span class="loc">Svaneti region</span>.</p>
