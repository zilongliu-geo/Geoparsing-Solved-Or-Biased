  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Avoyelles task force arrests 14. The Task Force officers began their night at the Cottonport Fire Station and arrested 14 in the Cottonport area through the night clearing 18 warrants during the four-hour operation. All arrests were without incident, the Sheriff’s Office said. They were arrested on outstanding warrants for issuing worthless checks, probation violations and narcotic violations. Anderson again urged all who have a reason to believe there may be an outstanding warrant for their arrest to contact the <span class="loc">Avoyelles Parish</span> Sheriff’s Office immediately in order to resolve any issues. They may contact the Warrant Division at (318) 619-3946 or the Patrol Division at (318) 619-3947.</p><br><br>
