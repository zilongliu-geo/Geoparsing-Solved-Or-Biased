<p><span class="loc">Mars</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,699 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Mars</span> is located in southern <span class="loc">Butler County</span> at 40°41′48″N 80°0′44″W (40.696594, -80.012205), about halfway between the <span class="loc">cities of Pittsburgh and Butler</span>. The small community is nestled in a small valley along <span class="loc">Breakneck</span> Creek. <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Route 228 bypasses the borough to the south, leading east 4 miles (6 km) to <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Route 8 and west 8.5 miles (13.7 km) to Interstates 79 and 76 in Cranberry Township. The <span class="loc">Mars-Evans City</span> Road leads out of town to the north. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the <span class="loc">borough of Mars</span> has a total area of 0.5 square miles (1.2 km2), all land. <span class="loc">Mars</span> is home to the popular roadside attraction the <span class="loc">Mars</span> "Spaceship" or "Flying Saucer". It is also home to the <span class="loc">Mars</span> Station, one of the last railroad depots still standing from the now defunct Pittsburgh and Western Railroad. In 1873, Samuel Parks constructed a home and a water-powered gristmill along <span class="loc">Breakneck</span> Creek. Parks decided to have a post office placed in his home, so he received help from his friend Samuel Marshall to help establish it. The name of the post office became <span class="loc">Overbrook</span>. In 1877, the <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, New Castle and Lake Erie Railroad was constructed through <span class="loc">Overbrook</span>, and had a station built there. In 1882, the name of the community was changed to <span class="loc">Mars</span> since the railroad already had a stop with the name "Overbrook". No one is sure how the name "<span class="loc">Mars</span>" came into being. Some say it was Park's wife who enjoyed astronomy, or it was shortened after Samuel Marshall's name. On March 6, 1895, <span class="loc">Mars</span> was incorporated as a borough.</p>
