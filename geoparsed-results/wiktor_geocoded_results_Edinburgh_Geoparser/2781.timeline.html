  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">New Brighton</span> is a seaside resort forming part of the town of <span class="loc">Wallasey</span>, in the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Wirral</span>, in the metropolitan <span class="loc">county of Merseyside</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is located at the northeastern tip of the <span class="loc">Wirral</span> Peninsula, within the historic county boundaries of <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>, and has sandy beaches which line the <span class="loc">Irish Sea</span>. <span class="loc">New Brighton</span> is home to the <span class="loc">UK</span>'s longest promenade at 3.5 kilometres. At the <span class="date">2001</span> Census, the population of the electoral ward of <span class="loc">New Brighton</span> stood at 14,450 (6,869 males, 7,581 females), increasing at the <span class="date">2011</span> Census to 14,859 (7,237 Males, 7,622 Females). Up to the 19th century, the area had a reputation for smuggling and wrecking, and secret underground cellars and tunnels are still rumoured to exist. It also had a strategic position at the entrance to the <span class="loc">Mersey</span> Estuary. The <span class="loc">Perch Rock</span> battery was completed in <span class="date">1829</span>. It mounted 18 guns, mostly 32 pounders, with 3 6-inch guns installed in <span class="date">1899</span>. Originally cut off at high tide, coastal reclamation has since made it fully accessible. In <span class="date">1830</span>, a <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> merchant, <span class="per">James Atherton</span>, purchased much of the land at <span class="loc">Rock Point</span>, which enjoyed views out to sea and across the <span class="loc">Mersey</span> and had a good beach. His aim was to develop it as a desirable residential and watering place for the gentry, in a similar way to <span class="loc">Brighton</span>, one of the most elegant seaside resorts of that <span class="org">Regency</span> period – hence "<span class="loc">New Brighton</span>". Substantial development began soon afterwards, and housing began to spread up the hillside overlooking the estuary –  a former gunpowder magazine being closed down in <span class="date">1851</span>.</p><br><br>
