<p><span class="loc">Florencia</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [floˈɾensja]) is a municipality and town in the Ciego de Ávila <span class="loc">Province of Cuba</span>. It is located in the western part of the province, south of <span class="loc">Chambas</span>. This municipality merged in 1976 as result of the new political and administrative division of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>. <span class="loc">Florencia</span> was formerly the barrios of Guadalupe, <span class="loc">Tamarindo</span> and Marroquí which were separated from the municipality of Moron. The municipality is a mountain region with rivers, forest and caves with subterranean rivers. A huge hydraulic complex was constructed under Fidel's government in 1991 named "Liberación de <span class="loc">Florencia</span>" ("<span class="loc">Florencia</span> Independence") since the <span class="loc">Florencia</span> area was the first quarter taken by local revolutionary forces in the <span class="loc">province of Camagüey</span> on December 14, 1958. This hydraulic complex is located in the fertile valleys of <span class="loc">Florencia</span> and <span class="loc">Tamarindo</span> and it reinforces the beauty of this Cuban area. Unlike other municipalities in this province, <span class="loc">Florencia</span> is the only one where its economy is basically tobacco. <span class="loc">Florencia</span> is also the seat of the municipal government and the biggest city with around 7,000 people. Other towns are <span class="loc">Tamarindo</span>, Las Pojas, Lowrey, Guadalupe and Marroquí.</p>
