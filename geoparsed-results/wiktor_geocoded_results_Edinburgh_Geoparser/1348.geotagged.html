<p><span class="loc">Lake County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 10,866. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Two Harbors</span>. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> was founded on February 20, 1855, as <span class="loc">Superior County</span>, though its name was changed on March 3, of that year to Saint <span class="loc">Louis County</span>. On March 1, 1856, Saint <span class="loc">Louis County</span> became <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, while <span class="loc">Newton County</span> to the west was renamed Saint <span class="loc">Louis County</span>. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the area had long been inhabited by Native American groups. At the time of European contact, the principal Native American groups in the region were the Dakota (Sioux) and Ojibwe (also called Anishinabe or <span class="loc">Chippewa</span>). The economy of these groups was based on hunting, fishing and gathering, with wild rice being of particular importance. The first Europeans to explore the area were the French in the late 17th century who were followed by trappers, fur traders, missionaries, and explorers. <span class="loc">Beaver Bay</span> was the first city in <span class="loc">Lake County</span> in 1855. In 1868, iron ore was discovered on the Vermilion Range by George Stuntz. In 1884, the first shipment of ore left <span class="loc">Agate Bay</span>, marking Minnesota's entry into the iron ore industry. During the late 1880s, commercial fishing began on <span class="loc">Lake Superior</span> with the coming of Swedish and Norwegian immigrants to the <span class="loc">North Shore</span>. In 1890, the Merritt brothers discovered the Mesabi Range. The Two Harbors Lighthouse was built on <span class="loc">Agate Bay</span> in 1892. Ten years later, five <span class="loc">Two Harbors</span> businessmen signed the articles of incorporation for a new mining company named 3M. Today, 3M Corporation has over 70,000 employees worldwide and produces more than 50,000 adhesive household products, now has its headquarters in <span class="loc">Saint Paul</span>.</p>
