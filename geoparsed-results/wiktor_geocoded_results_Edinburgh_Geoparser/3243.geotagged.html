<p><span class="loc">Charlestown</span> (Cornish: Porth Meur, meaning great cove) is a village and port on the south coast of <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, and in the civil parish of <span class="loc">St Austell Bay</span>. It is situated approximately 2 miles (3 km) south east of <span class="loc">St Austell</span> town centre. The port at <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> developed in the late-18th century from the fishing village of <span class="loc">West Polmear</span>. Whereas other areas of <span class="loc">St Austell</span> have seen much development during the 20th century, <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> has remained relatively unchanged. <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> grew out of the small fishing village of <span class="loc">West Polmear</span> (or West Porthmear), which consisted of a few cottages and three cellars, in which the catch of pilchards were processed. The population amounted to nine fishermen and their families in 1790. Before the harbour was built, trading vessels landed and loaded on the beach. Charles Rashleigh who moved to <span class="loc">Duporth</span> Manor, just outside the village, used plans prepared by John Smeaton to begin the construction of a harbour and dock in 1791. After building the outer pier, he excavated a natural inlet to form the main dock and a shipyard at its inner end that demolished when the dock was extended. The first dock gates were completed in 1799. To maintain water levels in the dock, a leat was constructed, which brought water from the <span class="loc">Luxulyan</span> Valley, some 4 miles (6.4 km) away.</p>
