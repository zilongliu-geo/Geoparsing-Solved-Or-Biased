<p><span class="loc">Conway</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Carroll County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the most populous community in the county, and the most populous in the state north of <span class="loc">Hanover</span>. The population was 10,115 at the 2010 census, more than 1/5 of the total population of <span class="loc">Carroll County</span>. Parts of the White Mountain National Forest are in the west and north of the town. Cathedral Ledge (popular with climbers) and Echo Lake State Park are in the west. Villages within the town include <span class="loc">Conway</span>, <span class="loc">North Conway</span>, <span class="loc">Center Conway</span>, <span class="loc">Redstone</span> and <span class="loc">Kearsarge</span>, as well as a portion of the village of <span class="loc">Intervale</span>. The region was once home to the <span class="loc">Pequawket</span> Indians, an Algonquian Abenaki tribe. Along the <span class="loc">Saco</span> River they fished, hunted or farmed, and lived in wigwams sheltered within stockades. In 1642, explorer Darby Field of <span class="loc">Exeter</span> paddled up the <span class="loc">Saco</span> in a canoe, and would report seeing "Pigwacket," an Indian community stretching from present-day <span class="loc">Conway</span> to <span class="loc">Fryeburg</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>. The <span class="loc">Pequawket</span> tribe dwindled from disease, probably smallpox brought from abroad. In May 1725, during Dummer's War, 36 men from <span class="loc">Dunstable</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> led by John Lovewell skirmished with the <span class="loc">Pequawket</span>. The <span class="loc">Pequawket</span> losses are not known but the result of the day's battle was the withdrawal of the tribe from the area.</p>
