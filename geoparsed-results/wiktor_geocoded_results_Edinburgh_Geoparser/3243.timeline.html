  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Charlestown</span> (Cornish: Porth Meur, meaning great cove) is a village and port on the south coast of <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, and in the civil parish of <span class="loc">St Austell Bay</span>. It is situated approximately 2 miles (3 km) south east of <span class="loc">St Austell</span> town centre. The port at <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> developed in the late-18th century from the fishing village of <span class="loc">West Polmear</span>. Whereas other areas of <span class="loc">St Austell</span> have seen much development during the 20th century, <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> has remained relatively unchanged. <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> grew out of the small fishing village of <span class="loc">West Polmear</span> (or West Porthmear), which consisted of a few cottages and three cellars, in which the catch of pilchards were processed. The population amounted to nine fishermen and their families in <span class="date">1790</span>. Before the harbour was built, trading vessels landed and loaded on the beach. <span class="per">Charles Rashleigh</span> who moved to <span class="loc">Duporth</span> Manor, just outside the village, used plans prepared by <span class="per">John Smeaton</span> to begin the construction of a harbour and dock in <span class="date">1791</span>. After building the outer pier, he excavated a natural inlet to form the main dock and a shipyard at its inner end that demolished when the dock was extended. The first dock gates were completed in <span class="date">1799</span>. To maintain water levels in the dock, a leat was constructed, which brought water from the <span class="loc">Luxulyan</span> Valley, some 4 miles (6.4 km) away.</p><br><br>
