  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mayda</span> (variously known as <span class="loc">Maida</span>, <span class="loc">Mayd</span>, <span class="loc">Mayde</span>, Brazir, Mam, Asmaida, Asmayda, Bentusle, <span class="per">Bolunda</span> and <span class="per">Vlaanderen</span>) is a non-existent island in the North Atlantic that has been shown on several published maps at various points in history. It was most often represented as being crescent-shaped and its position has varied widely over time. Early maps drew the island west of Brittany and southwest of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, but it later moved towards <span class="loc">the Americas</span> (<span class="loc">Newfoundland</span>, <span class="loc">Bermuda</span>, <span class="loc">West Indies</span>). It was shown on a Rand McNally relief map as late as <span class="date">1906</span>. The island first appeared under the name of Brazir, on the <span class="org">Pizigani brothers</span>' <span class="date">1367</span> map. It was crescent shaped and sited southwest of the island of <span class="loc">Brasil</span>, on the same latitude of southern Brittany. It appeared as Asmaidas on a map of the <span class="loc">New World</span> accompanying Waldseemüller's <span class="date">1513</span> edition of Ptolemy's Geography. Ortelius (in Theatrum Orbis Terrarum) placed a crescent-shaped island in the traditional location of <span class="loc">Mayda</span> with the name "Vlaenderen". While submerged land of the appropriate shape has been found in the area of early maps (at 46°23′N 37°20′W, 20 fathoms down), it is not necessarily that of <span class="loc">Mayda</span>.</p><br><br>
