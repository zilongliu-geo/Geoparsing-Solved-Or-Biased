  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Weston is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) located in <span class="org">Franklin</span> Township, in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the CDP's population was 1,235. Situated on the east side of the <span class="loc">Millstone River</span> north of <span class="loc">East Millstone</span> and south of <span class="loc">Zarephath</span> (which has grown to include some of the area once considered Weston), early names used for the area were <span class="per">Schenck</span>'s Mill, Van Neste's Mill and <span class="loc">Frogtown</span>. Historically, an area on the west side of the river in what is <span class="date">now</span> part of the <span class="loc">borough of Manville</span> was also referred to as Weston. The Weston Causeway is the only bridge across the <span class="loc">Millstone River</span> between <span class="loc">East Millstone</span> and the confluence with the <span class="loc">Raritan River</span> near South Bound Brook. Heinrich/<span class="per">Henry Schenck</span> built a grist mill on the east bank of the Millstone here, probably in the 1740s. His brother, <span class="per">Peter</span>, built a mill upstream at Blackwells Mills about the same time and both were called <span class="per">Schenck</span>'s Mill. Three of <span class="per">Henry</span>â€™s sons, <span class="per">Abraham, John</span> and <span class="per">Henry</span> were in the second graduating class of 14 students of the newly founded <span class="org">Queen's College</span> that later became <span class="org">Rutgers University</span>.</p><br><br>
