<p><span class="loc">Remedios</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈmeðjos]), also known as <span class="loc">San Juan de los Remedios</span>, is a city and municipality located 3 miles (4.8 km) from the northern coast of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, in the center of the island. It is the oldest Spanish settlement in the former <span class="loc">Las Villas</span> province. It is now part of the province of <span class="loc">Villa Clara</span>. It was declared a City by Isabella II of <span class="loc">Spain</span>, when the Island was still a colony. <span class="loc">Remedios</span> is the Cradle of the Parrandas, possibly the Caribbean's largest and oldest traditional festivity. Its patrons are <span class="loc">San Juan Bautista</span> and the Virgin of the Buenviaje. <span class="loc">Remedios</span> is located about 4 hours away by bus from <span class="loc">Havana</span>, around 50 minutes from <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> and there is less than an hour from there to beach resorts in the Santa María - <span class="loc">Las Brujas</span> cays both situated north of the province. The municipality limits to the north with <span class="loc">Caibarien</span>, to the south with <span class="loc">Camajuani</span> and <span class="loc">Placetas</span>, and to the east with <span class="loc">Yaguajay</span> ( <span class="loc">Sancti Spiritus</span>) It is recognized as the eighth oldest city in <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, but its real date of foundation has been obscured over time, and it may be the second Spanish settlement on the island. Historians place the foundation date sometime between 1513 and 1524 by Spanish nobleman Vasco Porcallo de Figueroa, originally founded by him on the 13th of April 1514. Documents reflect that this settlement was only preceded by <span class="loc">Baracoa</span> (1511) and (Bayamo)(1512). Considering these facts some believe it was actually founded before <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> (1514). Rumor has it that Vasco, in order to avoid tax payments to the crown, maintained the village hidden from the knowledge of the King of Spain as long as he could, but the village grew quickly, and at some point it had to be recognized. Through his wife, the daughter of the <span class="loc">Cacique</span> of Sabaneque, Vasco received a huge land grant as a personal fief from Gobernor Diego Velazquez as stipulated by Spanish law, therefore it had no municipal entity to govern the town. Upon Vasco's death in <span class="loc">Puerto Principe</span> in 1550 the town obtained its charter.</p>
