<p>Mansa is the capital of the <span class="loc">Luapula Province</span> of <span class="loc">Zambia</span>, and headquarters of <span class="loc">Mansa District</span>. It takes its name from the local Chief Mansa and the small <span class="loc">Mansa</span> River which flows west to the <span class="loc">Luapula</span> River. During British rule the city was named <span class="loc">Fort Rosebery</span>. In a province of beautiful rivers, waterfalls, lakes and wetlands, Mansa serves administrative and commercial functions, being situated on a relatively featureless plateau between the <span class="loc">Luapula</span> River to the west and <span class="loc">Lake Bangweulu</span> to the east. It does have the merit of being reasonably well located at the crossroads of the Copperbelt-Congo Pedicle-Chembe-Kawambwa road running south to north (partly paved), and the Serenje-Samfya-Luapula Valley road (all paved) running south-east to north-west. The main highway to the <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> via Luwingu branches off the Kawambwa road north of <span class="loc">Mansa</span>, and is paved near <span class="loc">Kasama</span>. In colonial times Mansa was called <span class="loc">Fort Rosebery</span> and was also the headquarters of the province. The first <span class="loc">Fort Rosebery</span>, however was situated in the <span class="loc">Luapula</span> Valley around 1900, where most of the province's population live, near Mambilima. After an outbreak of sleeping sickness in the valley some years later it was moved to the present site in the belief that the higher plateau site would be more healthy.</p>
