<p>Ashley is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">East Cambridgeshire</span> <span class="loc">district of Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, about 4 miles (6.4 km) east of Newmarket. The modern village consists of the two ancient <span class="loc">parishes of Ashley and Silverley</span>. Ashley covers 2,250 acres (910 ha) and in the 2011 census had a population of 749. Ashley is in the electoral area of <span class="loc">Cheveley ward</span>. Ashley and Silverley were both mentioned in the Domesday Book. In 1086 Silverley had a total population off 22 households and had land for 8 plough teams. The Domesday Book does not give the population of Ashley, but Ashley only had land for 4 plough teams. In 1086, the tenant-in-chief in both Ashley and Silverley was Aubrey de Vere. In the 13th century, the manors of both Ashley and Silverley were owned by the Knights Hospitallers of <span class="loc">Chippenham</span>. Silverley was the larger of the two villages and so the villages at that time were known as Silverley cum Ashley. However, since the Hospitaller's manor house was situated in Ashley, by the end of the 13th century the villages became known as Ashley cum Silverley.</p>
