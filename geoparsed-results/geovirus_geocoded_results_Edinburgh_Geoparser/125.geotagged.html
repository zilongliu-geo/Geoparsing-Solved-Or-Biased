<p><span class="loc">Kenya</span>'s livestock minister, Mohammed Kuti, said today that cattle rustlers have killed eleven people near the central town of <span class="loc">Isiolo</span>. Kuti, who is also the member of parliament for <span class="loc">Isiolo</span>, said the rustlers raided in a village in the area early in the day. "The eleven people were killed when rustlers stormed a village in Kisima area early this morning," he commented. The state-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation puts the number of attackers at 300, and stated that they stole an unknown number of livestock. Cattle rustling is common in <span class="loc">Kenya</span>, and the extended drought has heightened competition for scarce sources of food. In mid-September, 30 people were killed in a shootout as rustlers from the Pokot tribe attacked the Samburu tribe and made off with hundreds of cattle.</p>
