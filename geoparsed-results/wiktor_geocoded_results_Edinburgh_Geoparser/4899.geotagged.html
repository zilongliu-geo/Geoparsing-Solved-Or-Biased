<p>Oak Park is a city in south <span class="loc">Oakland County</span> of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. It is a northern suburb of the <span class="loc">city of Detroit</span>, which is located in neighboring <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, and part of its metropolitan area. As of the 2010 census, the population of Oak Park is 29,319. This area was designated as within Royal Oak Township; it was first settled by European Americans in 1840, but remained sparsely populated for many decades following. The first major housing development was constructed in 1914 at the time of the Great War, when the township sold land to the Majestic Land Company to be developed as the Oak Park subdivision. The subdivision was incorporated as a village on May 3, 1927. Two petition drives during the Great Depression to dissolve the village government and return it to the township, citing "excessively high cost of village government," failed in 1931 and 1933, respectively. The village incorporated as city on October 29, 1945 following the end of World War II. Stimulated by the GI Bill which aided veterans in buying new housing, highways to improve commuting, and planned developments in the late 1950s, Oak Park from 1950 to 1960 was named as "<span class="loc">America</span>'s Fastest <span class="loc">Growing City</span>". Its population increased sevenfold, from 5,000 to more than 36,000. Much of its population were second and third-generation children of European immigrants who had settled in <span class="loc">Detroit</span> in the early 20th century. These included many Jewish Americans descended from immigrant ancestors from the Russian Empire, including present-day <span class="loc">Poland</span> and <span class="loc">Ukraine</span>. Major civic improvements in this period included construction of an outdoor swimming pool and an ice rink in Major Park (now known as Shepherd Park, after former mayor David Shepherd, but long known informally as Oak Park Park).</p>
