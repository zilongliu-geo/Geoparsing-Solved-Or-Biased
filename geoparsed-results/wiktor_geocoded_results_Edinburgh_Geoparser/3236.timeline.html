  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Rodrigues</span> (French: île <span class="loc">Rodrigues</span>) is a 108 square km autonomous outer island of the <span class="loc">Republic of Mauritius</span> in the <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span>, about 560 kilometres (350 mi) east of <span class="loc">Mauritius</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Mascarene Islands</span> which include <span class="loc">Mauritius</span> and Réunion. It is of volcanic origin surrounded by coral reef, and just off its coast lie some tiny uninhabited islands. The island used to be the tenth <span class="loc">District of Mauritius</span>; it gained autonomous status on <span class="date">10 December 2002</span>, and it is governed by the <span class="org">Rodrigues Regional Assembly</span>. The capital of the island is <span class="loc">Port Mathurin</span>. Its inhabitants are Mauritian citizens. As of <span class="date">2014</span>, the island's population was about 41,669, according to Statistics <span class="loc">Mauritius</span>. Most of the inhabitants are of mixed African and French descent. Its economy is based mainly on fishing, farming, handicraft and a developing tourism sector. The island (together with Agaléga and <span class="loc">Saint Brandon</span>) forms part of the larger territory of the <span class="loc">Republic of Mauritius</span> with the President as head of state and the Chief Commissioner as head of government. The island was named after the Portuguese explorer D. <span class="per">Diogo Rodrigues</span> in <span class="date">February 1528</span>. Many maps also describe it as <span class="per">Diego Roiz</span>. From the 10th century, Arabs have been known to visit the <span class="loc">Mascarene Islands</span>. A 12th-century map by the Arab geographer Ash-Sharif al-Idrisi supposedly contains them, and the Cantino planisphere of c.1500 and some other contemporary maps clearly show the three islands of the Mascarenes as <span class="per">Dina</span> <span class="loc">Arobi</span> (or Harobi), <span class="per">Dina</span> <span class="per">Margabin</span> and <span class="per">Dina</span> Moraze. These are apparently corrupted transliterations or transcriptions of the Arabic ديفا هاراب Diva Harab ("<span class="loc">Desert Island</span>"), ديفا مغربين Diva Maghrebin ("<span class="loc">Western Island</span>") and ديفا ماشريق Diva Mashriq ("<span class="loc">Eastern Island</span>"). While the second clearly refers to Réunion, sources disagree about which of the other is <span class="loc">Mauritius</span> and which one <span class="per">Rodrigues</span>, which are both to the east of Réunion and arranged in a somewhat stylised way on these maps. However, even in its original state, <span class="per">Rodrigues</span> had some karst, while <span class="loc">Mauritius</span> even after suffering <span class="date">500 years</span> of deforestation can by no means be called "desert" even in a colloquial sense.</p><br><br>
