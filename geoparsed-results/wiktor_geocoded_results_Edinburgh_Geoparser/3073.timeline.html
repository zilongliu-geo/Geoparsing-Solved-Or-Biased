  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is a city situated on the <span class="loc">Illinois River</span> in <span class="loc">Bureau County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The population was 5,398 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census, and 5,558 in <span class="date">2010</span>. It is part of the Ottawa–Streator <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is located at 41°19′38″N 89°12′3″W (41.327154, -89.200752). According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> has a total area of 7.468 square miles (19.34 km2), of which 7.37 square miles (19.09 km2) (or 98.69%) is land and 0.098 square miles (0.25 km2) (or 1.31%) is water. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> lies in the valley of <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span>. The hills on either side of this valley were, and are to some extent <span class="date">today</span>, laced with springs that still feed <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span>. There were numerous springs in the town itself. One in the vicinity of the once Hunter-Doherty Lumber yard was so large and fast-flowing that the Indians had an encampment there. Remains of this encampment were visible in the early <span class="date">days</span> of the town. There was a large spring that flowed from the side of the hill between East <span class="per">St. Paul</span> Street and East <span class="loc">Devlin</span> Street, down a gully into <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span>. Springs still feed the pond of water at the foot of Number One slag dump on East <span class="per">St. Paul</span> Street. This area is <span class="date">now</span> the "Coal Mine Park" owned by Spring Valley PRIDE. The first drinking water supply was piped from large springs on North Sixth Street.</p><br><br>
