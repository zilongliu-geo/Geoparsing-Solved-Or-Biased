<p><span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> is a Canadian urban community located in Nova Scotia's Halifax Regional Municipality. Formerly a city, <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> is located on the eastern shore of <span class="loc">Halifax Harbour</span>. <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> has been nicknamed the City of Lakes, after the large number of lakes located within its boundaries. On April 1, 1996, the provincial government amalgamated all the municipalities within the boundaries of <span class="loc">Halifax County</span> into a single-tier regional government named the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> and its neighbouring <span class="loc">city of Halifax</span>, the town of <span class="loc">Bedford</span> and the Municipality of the <span class="loc">County of Halifax</span> were dissolved. The former <span class="loc">city of Dartmouth</span> forms part of the urban core of the larger regional municipality and is officially designated as part of the "capital district" by the Halifax Regional Municipality. At the time that the <span class="loc">City of Dartmouth</span> was dissolved, the provincial government altered its status to a separate community to <span class="loc">Halifax</span>; however, its status as part of the metropolitan "Halifax" urban core existed prior to municipal reorganization in 1996. <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> is still an official geographic name that is used by all levels of government for legal purposes, postal service, mapping, 9-1-1 emergency response, municipal planning, and is recognized by the Halifax Regional Municipality as a civic addressing community. The official place name did not change, due to the confusion with similar street names, land use planning set out by the former "<span class="loc">City of Dartmouth</span>," and significant public pressure. Today the same development planning for Downtown Dartmouth and the rest of the region is still in force, as well as specific bylaws created prior to April 1, 1996.</p>
