  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hampton</span> is a suburb in <span class="per">Melbourne, Victoria</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 14 kilometres (9 mi) south-east of <span class="per">Melbourne</span>'s central business district. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Bayside</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> Census, <span class="per">Hampton</span> had a population of 12,482. <span class="per">Hampton</span> is in a wealthy bayside area of <span class="per">Melbourne</span>, wedged between the suburbs of <span class="loc">Brighton</span> and <span class="loc">Sandringham</span>. <span class="per">Hampton</span> has a vibrant shopping centre along the main road, <span class="per">Hampton Street</span>, boasting more than 50 cafes and restaurants plus numerous fashionable boutiques. <span class="per">Hampton</span>, like <span class="loc">Brighton</span>, started off as a place of market gardens in the 1840s and 1850s, supplying fruits and vegetables for <span class="per">Melbourne</span>. In the 1850s, interest started to grow in the beaches in the area as places for daytrips and holidays for Melbournians, particularly <span class="loc">Picnic Point</span>, on the beautiful bay foreshore of <span class="per">Hampton</span>. This expanded when a railway line was built to <span class="loc">Brighton</span> Beach in the 1860s. In <span class="date">1887</span>, the railway line was extended to <span class="loc">Sandringham</span>, with a station servicing <span class="loc">Picnic Point</span>. It was called Retreat, after the Retreat Hotel at the Point. However, several landmarks in the area, including the beach, had been named <span class="per">Hampton</span>, after a local market gardener Dyas <span class="per">Hampton</span>, and as wealthy landowners began buying subdivided land in the area, they favored the name <span class="per">Hampton</span> as it sounded more regal. The name was set when the station was renamed <span class="per">Hampton</span>. <span class="org">Hampton Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">1 July 1909</span>.</p><br><br>
