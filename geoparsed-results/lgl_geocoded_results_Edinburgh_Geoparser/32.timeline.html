  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Casino's sprinklers were off before fire. Joliet's building inspector says the sprinkler system of the Empress Casino's pavilion was disconnected when a fire destroyed the building. <span class="per">David Mackley</span> said <span class="date">Tuesday</span> the sprinklers had been shut off just before <span class="date">Friday</span>'s blaze because work was being done on them. The fire doors also weren't working, but he says it isn't unusual for both items to be temporarily out of commission when a building is undergoing a renovation like the $50 million project at the Empress. The casino itself wasn't heavily damaged, and the fire sparked by a construction worker was contained to the pavilion area. <span class="per">Mackley</span> says workers had a fire watch in place and fire extinguishers, but the fire spread too quickly.</p><br><br>
