  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rog</span> (pronounced [ˈɾoːk]; German: <span class="loc">Hornwald</span>, Gottscheerish: Hoarnwald) is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is <span class="date">now</span> included in the Southeast <span class="loc">Slovenia</span> Statistical Region. Its territory is <span class="date">now</span> part of the village of <span class="loc">Trnovec</span>. <span class="loc">Rog</span> (German: <span class="loc">Hornwald</span>) is named after Big Mount <span class="loc">Rog</span> (Slovene: Veliki <span class="loc">Rog</span>, German: Hornbühel, Hornbühel, or Hornbichl, 1099 m), the highest elevation in the area. The name of the Kočevje <span class="loc">Rog</span> Plateau (German: <span class="loc">Hornwald</span>) is also derived from this mountain. One of the meanings of the Slovene common noun rog is 'prominent/exposed hill', paralleled by one of the meanings of the German common noun Horn 'highest peak'. A steam-powered sawmill owned by the <span class="loc">Auersperg</span> noble family operated at <span class="loc">Rog</span> from <span class="date">1894</span> until <span class="date">1932</span>, employing up to 400 workers. The settlement had its own electric plant and waterworks. In <span class="date">1931</span> and <span class="date">1936</span> the settlement had three houses and 44 residents. After it shut down operations, the facilities were dynamited in <span class="date">1938</span> and the 50 km narrow gauge railway was pulled up and sold for scrap. Only three watchmen remained, and they were evicted from the area in the <span class="date">fall of 1941</span>. <span class="date">Today</span> the site, including cisterns and remains of the sawmill, are registered as cultural heritage.</p><br><br>
