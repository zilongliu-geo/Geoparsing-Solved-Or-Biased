  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mardana</span> is a village in the state of <span class="loc">Madhya Pradesh</span> located on the banks of the river <span class="loc">Narmada</span> in <span class="loc">India</span>. The village falls under the Nimarregion (pronounced Nimadh/Nimad/Nimarh) in <span class="loc">Malwa</span>. The region predominantly speaks the local dialect "Nimadi" and Hindi. Nearest airport is Indore and nearest railway station is <span class="loc">Sanawad</span>. <span class="loc">Mardana</span> can also be accessed by boat from <span class="loc">Maheshwar</span>. Locals say that the village gets it name from <span class="loc">Bhai</span> <span class="loc">Mardana</span>, one of the first followers of <span class="per">Guru Nanak Dev</span>. Ruins near the village school indicate that a small fort was constructed in the village. The fort is said to be the capital of Raja Mordhvaj who died at Prayagraj. The ruins show the sinhasana (seat) of Maharaja Mayuradhvaja in a cave. The fort has a hidden ghat (gupt ghat) and a guhavasi <span class="loc">Shiva</span>. The village was also among the sites selected by Malwa queen Rani Ahilyabai to build her capital because of its history and mentions in the vedic puranas. However, her priest advised against it. She later constructed a fortified ghat and temple of Mayuresvara Shiva in the village.</p><br><br>
