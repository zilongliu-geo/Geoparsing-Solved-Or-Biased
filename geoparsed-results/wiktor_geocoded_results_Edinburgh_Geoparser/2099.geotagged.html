<p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 116,229. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Watertown</span>. The county is named after Thomas Jefferson, third President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>. It is adjacent to <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span>, southeast from the Canadian border of <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> comprises the Watertown-Fort Drum, <span class="loc">NY Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The <span class="loc">U.S</span>. Tenth Mountain Division is based at <span class="loc">Fort Drum</span>. <span class="loc">When counties</span> were established in the Province of <span class="loc">New York</span> in 1683, the present <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was part of <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of <span class="loc">New York</span> State as well as all of the present State of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> and, in theory, extending westward to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of <span class="loc">Gloucester County</span>, both containing territory now in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. On March 12, 1772, what was left of <span class="loc">Albany County</span> was split into three parts, one remaining under the name <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. One of the other pieces, <span class="loc">Tryon County</span>, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of <span class="loc">Tryon County</span> was approximately 5 miles (8.0 km) west of the present <span class="loc">city of Schenectady</span>, and the county included the western part of the <span class="loc">Adirondack Mountains</span> and the area west of the <span class="loc">West Branch of the Delaware River</span>. The area then designated as <span class="loc">Tryon County</span> now includes 37 <span class="loc">counties of New York State</span>. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of <span class="loc">New York</span>.</p>
