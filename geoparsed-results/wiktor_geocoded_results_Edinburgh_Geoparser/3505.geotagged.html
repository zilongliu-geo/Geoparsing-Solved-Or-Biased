<p>Clinton is a town in <span class="loc">Dutchess County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,312 at the 2010 census. The town is named after George Clinton, an early governor of <span class="loc">New York</span>. The town is in the northwest quadrant of <span class="loc">Dutchess County</span>. It contains over 70 miles (110 km) of roads. Clinton was first settled around 1755. The town was part of the Great Nine Partners Patent of 1697. The town was established in 1786 from territory from the towns of "Charlotte" and <span class="loc">Rhinebeck</span>. In 1821, Clinton split to form the current towns of <span class="loc">Hyde Park</span> and <span class="loc">Pleasant Valley</span>. Clinton participated in the Civil War with men enlisting in the 128th and 150th regiments. After the war ended, dairy farmers brought their milk by wagon to the creamery in the hamlet of Clinton Corners by the tracks of the <span class="loc">Poughkeepsie</span> and Eastern Railway. This rail line continued to the Grove Amusement Park at the southeast end of <span class="loc">Upton Lake</span> and the ice house at the northeast end of the lake. After the <span class="loc">Poughkeepsie</span> and Eastern declined with the advent of the automobile, the park closed. During the last half of the 20th century, the town of Clinton has transformed from an agricultural to a residential center.</p>
