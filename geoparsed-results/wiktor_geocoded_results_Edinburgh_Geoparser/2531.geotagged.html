<p>Adrian is a city in <span class="loc">Malheur County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, near the confluence of the <span class="loc">Snake River</span> and the <span class="loc">Owyhee River</span>. The population was 177 at the 2010 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, ORâ€“ID Micropolitan Statistical Area. In 1913, <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Short Line Railroad built a branch into this part of <span class="loc">Malheur County</span>. There was a post office called <span class="loc">Riverview</span> on the east side of the <span class="loc">Snake River</span> and because the railroad did not want a station of the same name on the west side, the name Adrian was suggested by Reuben McCreary, who platted the townsite. The name was chosen to honor his birthplace, Adrian, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. Riverview post office was established in 1911, but moved across the river in 1915 and the name changed to Adrian in 1919. It was previously thought that the city was named for James Adrian, a sheep rancher, but he did not arrive in the area until 1916. Adrian is located on the Southern Alternate route of the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trail, a longer route that eliminated the need to cross the <span class="loc">Snake River</span>.</p>
