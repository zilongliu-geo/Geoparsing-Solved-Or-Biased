  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a county located in the southwestern corner of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 26,446. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Altus</span>. According to the <span class="org">Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture</span>, the county was named for two historical figures: President <span class="per">Andrew Jackson</span> and Confederate General <span class="per">Stonewall Jackson</span>. One source states only that the county was named for the former President, while an earlier source states it was only named for General <span class="per">Stonewall Jackson</span>. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Altus</span>, <span class="loc">OK</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. After a dispute over the Adams-On√≠s Treaty of <span class="date">1819</span>, both the governments of the <span class="loc">United States</span> and the state of <span class="loc">Texas</span> claimed ownership of some 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km2) in what was then operated as <span class="loc">Greer County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Litigation followed, and in the case of <span class="loc">United States</span> v. State of <span class="loc">Texas</span> 162 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 1 (<span class="date">1896</span>), issued on <span class="date">March 16</span>, the <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span>, having original jurisdiction over the case, decided in favor of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Greer County</span> was then assigned to the Oklahoma Territory on <span class="date">May 4, 1896</span>, and when <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> became a state, in addition to becoming <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, the region was also further split into <span class="loc">Greer</span>, <span class="loc">Harmon</span>, and part of <span class="loc">Beckham counties</span>.</p><br><br>
