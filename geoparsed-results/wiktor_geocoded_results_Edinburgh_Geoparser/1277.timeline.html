  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Avondale</span> is a Canadian town located on Newfoundland's <span class="loc">Avalon Peninsula</span> in the province of <span class="loc">Newfoundland and Labrador</span>. The community is situated at the southwestern head of <span class="loc">Conception Bay</span> in Division 1. It is located 59 km (37 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">St. John</span>'s and 72 km (45 mi) northeast of <span class="loc">Placentia</span>. Prior to <span class="date">January 1, 1898</span> <span class="loc">Avondale</span> was known as Salmon Cove but was renamed to avoid confusion with two other nearby communities of the same name in the Port de <span class="per">Grave</span> and <span class="per">Brigus</span> Districts. The name <span class="loc">Avondale</span> was suggested by the parish priest Rev <span class="per">John Roe</span> because of the resemblance to his native area in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, taking the name from <span class="per">Thomas Moore</span>'s poem, "<span class="org">The Meeting of the Waters</span>". Earliest record of settlement per Fishing Room Grants is for <span class="per">John Mahaney</span> in <span class="date">1773</span>, a census of 1812 reports 12 inhabitants. Settlers to the area were primarily Irish Roman Catholic with a smaller number of Jersey French and English. <span class="loc">Avondale</span> incorporated the communities of Salmon Cove, Gasters, Northern Arm, and Southern Arm. In <span class="date">1863</span>, the <span class="org">Anglo American Telegraph Company</span> set up a repeater station which was eventually taken over by the <span class="org">Reid Newfoundland Railway Company</span> in the late 1880s when the Newfoundland Railway was constructed through the area and a station was built. In addition to the railway station, it also hosted a post office, a money order office, and one church. It functioned as a lumbering, fishing and farming settlement in what was known as the Harbour Main District. The population dwindled in <span class="date">the early 1900s</span> as men began migrating to the eastern <span class="loc">US</span> (<span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span>) to find work.</p><br><br>
