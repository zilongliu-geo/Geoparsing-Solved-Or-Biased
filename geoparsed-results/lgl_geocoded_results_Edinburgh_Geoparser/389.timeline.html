  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Man gets <span class="date">two years</span> in state jail facility for fleeing from police. Man gets <span class="date">two years</span> in state jail facility for fleeing from police A 54-year-old <span class="loc">Palestine</span> man has been sentenced to the maximum <span class="date">two years</span> in a state jail facility after pleading guilty to fleeing from <span class="loc">Palestine</span> police approximately 1 1/<span class="date">2 years ago</span>. <span class="per">Gary Wilson</span>, 54, of <span class="loc">Palestine</span> was sentenced to <span class="date">two years</span> in a state jail facility <span class="date">Friday</span> at the <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> Courthouse by 87th State District Judge <span class="per">Deborah Oakes</span> <span class="loc">Evans</span>. In mid-January, <span class="per">Wilson</span> had pled guilty to the state jail felony offense of evading arrest with a motor vehicle, stemming from an <span class="date">August 2007</span> incident during which he fled from local police after they had received a report of an intoxicated driver, according to <span class="per">Stanley Sokolowski</span>, assistant district attorney for <span class="loc">Anderson County</span>. On <span class="date">Aug. 17, 2007</span>, <span class="loc">Palestine</span> police say they received a call from a “concerned citizen” who reported that <span class="per">Wilson</span> was intoxicated and operating a motor vehicle. After receiving the call, <span class="loc">Palestine</span> police officer <span class="per">Gary Rayford</span> attempted to stop a <span class="date">2001</span> <span class="org">Cadillac</span> near the intersection of <span class="loc">West Palestine</span> <span class="per">Avenue</span> and <span class="per">Delmar</span> Street, according to <span class="per">Sokolowski</span>. “The vehicle (which was operated by <span class="per">Wilson</span>) refused to stop,” according to the assistant district attorney. The vehicle’s driver ran multiple stop signs and red lights and also traveled in the wrong lane of traffic at one point, he added. <span class="per">Wilson</span> ultimately pulled into the driveway of a residence in the <span class="date">1200</span> block of North <span class="per">John Street</span>, according to <span class="per">Sokolowski</span>. “He (<span class="per">Wilson</span>) got out of the vehicle...he didn’t stop and they (officers) had to take him to the ground,” the assistant district attorney said. Officers believed <span class="per">Wilson</span> to be intoxicated and discovered “at least two open containers” in his vehicle, <span class="per">Sokolowski</span> said. <span class="per">Wilson</span> already had an “extensive criminal history relating to DWIs” and also was sentenced to <span class="date">five years</span> in the <span class="org">Texas Department of Criminal Justice</span> on an arson conviction in the mid-1990s, according to <span class="per">Sokolowski</span>. <span class="per">Wilson</span> was sentenced <span class="date">Friday</span> following a hearing of approximately 45 minutes. Although receiving the maximum state jail sentence, he was not assessed a fine. Some may portray the <span class="date">August 2007</span> incident as a “victimless crime” since no one was injured, but <span class="per">Sokolowski</span> disagrees, saying innocent peoples’ lives are put at risk when an intoxicated driver flees from police and runs red lights and stop signs in the process. “My feeling is it’s one of the most dangerous things that can occur out there,” <span class="per">Sokolowski</span> said. --------- <span class="per">Paul Stone</span> may be contacted via e-mail at pstone@palestineherald.com</p><br><br>
