<p><span class="loc">Monte Negro</span> is a mountain top site that at existed around 200 BC and at one time consisted of an average of 2,900 people. Its use was short lived due to a lack of rural sites (only terracing throughout the mountain). Some of the architecture of <span class="loc">Monte Negro</span> is very distinct using columns and structures no higher than six meters. The site is rich with ceramics and designs imported from the nearby <span class="loc">Monte Alban</span>. The buildings excavated at <span class="loc">Monte Negro</span> consist mostly of rectangular platforms arranged around small patios. One set of buildings is aligned along streets over 100 meters long. The streets ran east-west, and another set running north-south giving the site an L shape. The largest plaza in <span class="loc">Monte Negro</span> is 20 m x 20 m and is surrounded with a temple and other buildings. These substructures are made of limestone blocks and rubble with column bases. Walls had stone foundations with adobe blocks. Columns along the structural bases supported thatched roofs. The columns are the most distinguishing part of the architecture of the site. The columns are made of stacked uneven cut stones arranged in a column in order to fill the column with rubble. The columns were about 3 m in height and were associated with both elite residences and temples. To access the adobe structures at the top of the platforms, stone stairways were used.</p>
