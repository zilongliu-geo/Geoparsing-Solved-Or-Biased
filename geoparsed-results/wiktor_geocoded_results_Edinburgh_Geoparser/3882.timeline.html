  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Linton</span> is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">Maidstone District</span> of <span class="loc">Kent</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The parish is located on the southward slope of the Greensand ridge, south of <span class="loc">Maidstone</span> on the A229 <span class="loc">Hastings</span> road. The name <span class="loc">Linton</span> comes from Old English, probably meaning Lilla's village. The steepness of the hill through it is explained because of its position on the slope of the ridge. The village has a population of about 500. According to the reference quoted below "The 13th century church of <span class="loc">St Nicholas</span> contains an interesting and varied collection of monuments, including some by EH <span class="loc">Baily</span>, who sculpted the figure of Nelson in Trafalgar Square". <span class="loc">Linton Park</span> is a Grade I listed mansion to the east of the village. Built in <span class="date">1730</span> by <span class="per">Robert Mann</span>, it was later home to <span class="per">Sir Horatio Mann</span>, the fourth and fifth <span class="per">Earls Cornwallis</span> and <span class="per">Fiennes Cornwallis</span>, 1st <span class="per">Baron Cornwallis</span>. It served as headquarters to the army encampment at neighbouring <span class="loc">Coxheath</span> during the late 18th and early 19th <span class="date">centuries</span>. There is one public house 'The <span class="org">Bull</span>' which is opposite the church. There is a children's playground off a lane near the bottom of the hill which can be found at the end of a path just above the turning for Wheelers Lane. <span class="org">Cornwallis Academy</span> is a secondary school located in the village.</p><br><br>
