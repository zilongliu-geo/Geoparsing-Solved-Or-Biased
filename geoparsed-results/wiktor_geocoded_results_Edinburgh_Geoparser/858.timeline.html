  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">China</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="per">Shelby</span> Township, <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. It spans <span class="per">Shelby</span> and <span class="per">Madison</span> Townships and was for <span class="date">years</span> largely defined by the existence of a general store in <span class="per">Madison</span> Township and the former <span class="loc">St. Anthony</span>'s Catholic Church in <span class="per">Shelby</span> township. Razor's Fork runs between the two sections. <span class="loc">Indiana</span> State Road 62 runs parallel to Razor's Fork in <span class="per">Madison</span> Township, and then crosses the stream and heads north to <span class="loc">Canaan</span>. The origin of the name is not known. In her history of <span class="loc">St. Anthony</span>'s Church, area resident Elma Schafer related a story, which she said was confirmed by Catholic priests, that <span class="loc">China</span> stemmed from the name of Father Munnschina, a priest. In <span class="date">the late 1960s</span>, <span class="per">Mrs. Frances Ringwald</span>, whose daughter <span class="per">Edith</span> and son <span class="per">William</span> "Bud" Thomas, operated the <span class="loc">China</span> store, said she was told that the site had mulberry trees, which suggested silk, which suggested <span class="loc">China</span>. However, <span class="loc">China</span> post office opened on <span class="date">January 30, 1833</span> and closed on <span class="date">November 29, 1838</span>, <span class="date">years</span> before the arrival of the German Catholics who founded <span class="loc">St. Anthony</span>'s and who were served by Munnschina. The first <span class="loc">China</span> postmaster was <span class="per">Moses Wilder</span>, a Presbyterian minister who had arrived in nearby <span class="per">Madison</span> by <span class="date">1830</span>, as an agent of the <span class="org">American Tract Society</span>.</p><br><br>
