<p>Andrade (formerly, Cantu) is a small unincorporated community in the southeasternmost corner of the state of <span class="loc">California</span>, in <span class="loc">Imperial County</span>. The community is located entirely within the Fort <span class="loc">Yuma Indian Reservation</span>. It is directly across the border from <span class="loc">Los Algodones</span>, the northernmost town of the municipality of <span class="loc">Mexicali</span>, in <span class="loc">Baja California</span>, and in all of <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The ZIP Code is 92283. The community is inside area code 760. <span class="loc">Pilot Knob</span> Station served as a stop on the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line and Butterfield Overland Stage line and its successors until the railroad arrived in 1877. The <span class="loc">Pilot Knob</span> Station was located at what is now Andrade, near the bank of the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> at the foot of <span class="loc">Pilot Knob</span>, for which it was named. Andrade is named after Mexican General Guillermo Andrade. The General sold the land for the settlement to the California Development Company. The town was named in 1912 with establishment of the post office. A post office operated at Andrade from 1909 to 1910 and from 1912 to 1942. The name Cantu commemorated Col. Esteban Cantu, governor of the northernmost district of <span class="loc">Baja California</span> from 1915 to 1920.</p>
