  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">La Luz</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Otero County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,615 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is located immediately north of Alamogordo and lies in the eastern edge of the <span class="loc">Tularosa</span> Basin and on the western flank of the <span class="loc">Sacramento Mountains</span>. Until <span class="date">1848</span>, <span class="loc">La Luz</span> was a part of <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The CDP gets its name from the Spanish word for "light." <span class="loc">La Luz</span> is located at 32°58′35″N 105°56′44″W (32.976378, -105.945497). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 10.7 square miles (28 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">La Luz</span> sits at the opening of <span class="per">La Luz</span> <span class="loc">Canyon Creek</span> whose headwaters are high in the <span class="loc">Sacramento Mountains</span>. The waters of <span class="loc">La Luz</span> and <span class="loc">Fresnal</span> creeks are used by both the much larger <span class="loc">city of Alamogordo</span> just to the south of <span class="loc">La Luz</span> and by <span class="loc">La Luz</span> in a ditch or acequia system. The <span class="loc">City of Alamogordo</span> has constructed a large reservoir to the south of <span class="loc">La Luz</span> to impound these waters. Native Americans lived in the area for thousand of <span class="date">years</span> prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the late 16th Century. The Mescalero Apache homelands covered an area of south central <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> including the <span class="loc">Sacramento Mountains</span> and the <span class="loc">Tularosa Basin</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, the ancestral homelands of the <span class="org">Apache</span> have been reduced to those lands contained in the Mescalero Apache Reservation approximately 30 miles northeast of <span class="loc">La Luz</span>. There is some dispute over the founding of <span class="loc">La Luz</span>. By some accounts it was founded by Franciscan friars as early as the early 18th Century and called Nuestra Señora De <span class="loc">La Luz</span> (Our Lady of the Light). Early maps of the area include this notation and <span class="loc">La Luz</span> Canyon may have served as an early pass over the <span class="loc">Sacramento Mountains</span> connecting with the Peñasco river which eventually flows into the <span class="loc">Pecos</span> River near present-day <span class="loc">Artesia</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>. The <span class="loc">Sacramento Mountains</span> reach a height of 9,000 feet.</p><br><br>
