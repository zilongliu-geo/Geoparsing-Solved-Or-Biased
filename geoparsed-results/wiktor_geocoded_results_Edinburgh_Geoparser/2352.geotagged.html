<p><span class="loc">Peru</span> is a city in, and the county seat of, <span class="loc">Miami County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 11,417 at the 2010 census, making it the most populous city in <span class="loc">Miami County</span>. <span class="loc">Peru</span> is located along the <span class="loc">Wabash</span> River, which divides the city in two. Residents usually pronounce the name of <span class="loc">Peru</span> like the name of the South American nation of <span class="loc">Peru</span> is commonly pronounced in American English. Elderly Hoosiers commonly use the archaic pronunciation of /ˈpɪəruː/ PEE-roo. On August 18, 1827, Joseph Holman bought land near the confluence of the <span class="loc">Mississinewa</span> and <span class="loc">Wabash Rivers</span> from John B. Richardville, the chief of the Miami Indians. The sale was approved on March 3, 1828 by President John Quincy Adams. On March 12, 1829, Holman had the land surveyed and laid out into the town of <span class="loc">Miamisport</span>. <span class="loc">Peru</span> was founded in 1834 by William N. Hood, who had bought 210 acres of land from Miamisport's founder Joseph Holman five years earlier. By 1835, court was being held in <span class="loc">Peru</span> rather than <span class="loc">Miamisport</span>, and the name "Miamisport" quietly disappeared as <span class="loc">Peru</span> became the dominant community in the area. Frances Slocum was reunited with members of her family near <span class="loc">Peru</span> in 1837, after nearly sixty years of captivity among Native Americans.</p>
