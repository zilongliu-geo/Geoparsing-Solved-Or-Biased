  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Clinton is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,606 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place Clinton, please see the article Clinton (CDP), <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Clinton was first settled in <span class="date">1654</span> as a part of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>. It was officially incorporated as a separate town on <span class="date">March 14, 1850</span>, and named after the DeWitt Clinton Hotel in <span class="loc">New York</span>, a favorite place of the town's founders, <span class="per">Erastus Brigham Bigelow</span> and his brother <span class="per">Horatio</span>. Clinton became an industrialized mill town, using the <span class="loc">Nashua River</span> as a source for water power. In <span class="date">1897</span>, construction began on the <span class="loc">Wachusett</span> Dam, culminating in the filling of the <span class="loc">Wachusett</span> Reservoir in <span class="date">1908</span>. This flooded a substantial portion of Clinton and neighboring towns, which had to be relocated. A noteworthy feature of the <span class="loc">Boston</span> metropolitan public water service was begun in <span class="date">1896</span> in the <span class="loc">Wachusett</span> lake reservoir at Clinton. The basin excavated there by <span class="date">ten years</span> of labour, lying 385 ft. above high-tide level of <span class="loc">Boston</span> harbour, had a capacity of 63,068,000,000 gallons of water and was the largest municipal reservoir in the world in <span class="date">1911</span>, yet was only part of a system planned for the service of the greater metropolitan area.</p><br><br>
