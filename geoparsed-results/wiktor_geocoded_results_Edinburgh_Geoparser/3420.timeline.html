  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tigre</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈtiɣɾe], Tiger) is a town in the <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> Province, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, situated in the north of Greater <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, 28 km (17 mi) north of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> city. <span class="loc">Tigre</span> lies on the Paraná Delta and is an important tourist and <span class="date">weekend</span> attraction, easily reached by bus and train services, including the scenic <span class="per">Tren de la Costa</span>. It is the principal town of the Tigre <span class="per">Partido</span>. The town sits on an island created by several small streams and rivers and was founded in <span class="date">1820</span>, after floods had destroyed other settlements in the area, then known as the <span class="per">Partido de las Conchas</span>. The area's name derives from the “tigres” or jaguars that were hunted there, on occasions, in its early <span class="date">years</span>. The area was first settled by Europeans who came to farm the land, and the port developed to serve the <span class="org">Delta</span> and to bring fruit and wood from the <span class="org">Delta</span> and ports upstream on the Paraná river. <span class="loc">Tigre</span> is still an important timber processing port. The “<span class="per">Puerto de Frutos</span>” (fruit port) is <span class="date">now</span> a crafts fair located in the old fruit market by the riverside. The Naval Museum is also nearby. Antiques shops, riverside restaurants and pubs, the casino and <span class="per">Parque de la Costa</span>, an amusement park and its renowned natural beauty make <span class="loc">Tigre</span> a popular tourist destination throughout the year.</p><br><br>
