It is part of the <span class="loc">Pittsfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 6,756 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Dalton</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1755</span> and officially incorporated in <span class="date">1784</span>. The town was named after <span class="per">Tristram Dalton</span>, the Speaker of the <span class="org">Massachusetts House of Representatives</span> at the time of the town's incorporation. <span class="per">Dalton</span> was settled as a rural-industrial community, with mills set up along the <span class="loc">East Branch of the Housatonic River</span> and small patches of farmland in other areas. In <span class="date">1801</span>, <span class="per">Zenas Crane</span>, <span class="per">Henry Wiswall</span> and <span class="per">John Willard</span> set up a paper mill along the river which, by <span class="date">1844</span>, had begun producing banknote paper, which was purchased by banks all the way to <span class="loc">Boston</span>. The company, <span class="org">Crane &amp; Co.</span>, still is the largest employer in town, making paper products, stationery, and, since <span class="date">1873</span>, has been the only supplier of paper for the Federal Reserve Note, the <span class="loc">United States</span>' paper money. The town <span class="date">now</span> has a mix of small town and suburban qualities, and was served by trolleys to <span class="loc">Pittsfield</span> for <span class="date">many years</span>.</p><br><br>
