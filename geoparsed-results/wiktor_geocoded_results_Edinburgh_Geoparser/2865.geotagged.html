<p>Duncan, <span class="loc">Colorado</span> was a post office in <span class="loc">Saguache County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span> about 8 miles <span class="loc">south of Crestone</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. Only one house remains, John Duncan's cabin. The place, considered a ghost town, was on the Luis Maria Baca Grant No. 4 but is now within <span class="loc">Rio Grande National Forest</span>. The town was platted by John Duncan, lots were sold, gold mines promoted, home were built, businesses established, even a newspaper, The Duncan Eagle, but as the town, and many of the associated mines, were on the property of the Baca Grant the residents of the town were forced to move when title to the Grant was confirmed in 1897 and court orders to evict the residents of Duncan were enforced by <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Marshals in 1900. Some of the residents of Duncan moved to a new townsite, just off the Grant property to the south, Liberty, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. There was a post office at Duncan from November 21, 1892 to September 15, 1900. In 2011 plans were announced by Historicorps to renovate the cabin which will be made available for public rental.</p>
