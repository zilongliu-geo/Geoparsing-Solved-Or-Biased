  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>An "aggressive" strain of Avian Flu has been detected in two tufted ducks in <span class="loc">Oskarshamn</span>, southeast <span class="loc">Sweden</span>. This makes <span class="loc">Sweden</span> the ninth country in the <span class="org">EU</span> to confirm Avian Flu on their soil. Some 35–40 wild birds were found dead. The birds were brought to <span class="loc">Uppsala</span>, where an analysis confirmed the presence of an "aggressive" form of Avian Flu. Tests at a laboratory in the <span class="loc">UK</span> will later eventually confirm whether the birds died of the lethal H5N1. <span class="loc">Sweden</span>'s Minister of Agriculture, <span class="per">Ann-Christin Nykvist</span>, said at a press conference the discovery was "serious but not unexpected." <span class="loc">Sweden</span> has been on high alert since the virus was found on the German island Rügen in the <span class="loc">Baltic Sea</span>.</p><br><br>
