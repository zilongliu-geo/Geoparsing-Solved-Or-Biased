  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, and determined by the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> to include the mean center of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> population in <span class="date">1910</span>. The population was 137,974 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The county seat is <span class="loc">Bloomington</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Bloomington</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was formed in <span class="date">1818</span> from portions of <span class="loc">Orange County</span>. It was named for <span class="per">James Monroe</span>, fifth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, who was serving at the time the county was organized. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is divided between the basins of the East Fork and West Fork of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>'s <span class="loc">White River</span>. The southern part of the county drains to the East Fork, primarily via <span class="loc">Salt Creek</span> and its tributaries, such as <span class="loc">Clear Creek</span> (known as "<span class="loc">Jordan River</span>" on <span class="loc">Indiana</span> University <span class="loc">Bloomington</span> campus). The northern part drains to the West Fork. Several artificial reservoirs have been constructed by damming the county's creeks. The largest of them is <span class="loc">Lake Monroe</span>, a large reservoir on the <span class="loc">Salt Creek</span> in the south-eastern part of the county, is used both for recreational purposes and to supply the city with drinking water. Until <span class="date">the late 1960s</span>, the main source of water supply was the smaller <span class="loc">Lake Lemon</span> (constructed <span class="date">1953</span>), in the northeastern part of the county; <span class="date">now</span> it's the backup water source, and is mainly used for recreation.</p><br><br>
