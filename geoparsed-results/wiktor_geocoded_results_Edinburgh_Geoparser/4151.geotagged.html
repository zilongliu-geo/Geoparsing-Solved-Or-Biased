<p><span class="loc">Karonga</span> is a township in the <span class="loc">Karonga District</span> in <span class="loc">Northern Region</span> of <span class="loc">Malawi</span>. Located on the western shore of <span class="loc">Lake Nyasa</span>, it was established as a slaving centre sometime before 1877. As of 2008 estimates, <span class="loc">Karonga</span> has a population of 42,555. Some time before 1877 <span class="loc">Karonga</span> existed as the stronghold of <span class="loc">Mlozi</span>, a famous Arab slaver. In 1883 a British trading post, which formed the basis of the modern town, was opened there. British explorer Sir Harry Johnston bought the post in 1895 and ended the slave trade on <span class="loc">Lake Nyasa</span>'s western shore. At this point <span class="loc">Karonga</span> became an important commercial and agricultural center. According to Lonely Planet, the town "still bears a strong Swahili-Arab influence today." A recent discovery of pre-historic tools and remains of hominids in <span class="loc">Malawi</span>'s remote northern district of <span class="loc">Karonga</span> provides further proof that the area could be the cradle of humankind. Professor Friedemann Schrenk of the Goethe University in <span class="loc">Frankfurt</span> told Reuters News that two students working on the excavation site in September, 2009 had discovered prehistoric tools and a tooth of a hominid. "This latest discovery of prehistoric tools and remains of hominids provides additional proof to the theory that the Great Rift Valley of <span class="loc">Africa</span> and perhaps the excavation site near <span class="loc">Karonga</span> can be considered the cradle of humankind." Schrenk said. The site also contains some of the earliest dinosaurs which lived between 100 million and 140 million years ago and early hominids believed to have lived between a million and 6 million years ago. The discovery was at Malema excavation site 10 km (6.2 mi) from <span class="loc">Karonga</span>.</p>
