  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Clovis</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Curry County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with a population of 37,775 as of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, and a <span class="date">2014</span> estimated population of 39,860. <span class="loc">Clovis</span> is located in the <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> portion of the <span class="loc">Llano Estacado</span>, in the eastern part of the state. A largely agricultural community, closely bordering <span class="loc">Texas</span>, it is noted for its role in early rock music history and for nearby <span class="loc">Cannon Air Force Base</span>. After the discovery of several Clovis sites in eastern <span class="loc">North America</span> in <span class="date">the 1930s</span>, the Clovis people came to be regarded as the first human inhabitants who created a widespread culture in the <span class="loc">New World</span>. Clovis people are considered to be the ancestors of most of the indigenous cultures of <span class="loc">the Americas</span>. The <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span>, &amp; Santa Fe Railway system helped to establish <span class="loc">Clovis</span> over <span class="date">a hundred years ago</span>, and for that railroad and its successor BNSF Railway continues to be a major hub of operations. Also notable is the <span class="org">Southwest Cheese Company</span>, the largest cheddar cheese producer in <span class="loc">North America</span>. It is the principal city of the <span class="org">Clovis Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which is part of the larger Clovis-Portales Combined Statistical Area.</p><br><br>
