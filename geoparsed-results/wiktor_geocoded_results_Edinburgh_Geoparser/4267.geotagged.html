<p><span class="loc">Langar</span> is a small village about four miles south of <span class="loc">Bingham</span> in <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span> and the <span class="loc">Vale of Belvoir</span>. To the south of the <span class="loc">parish of Langar</span> cum <span class="loc">Barnstone</span>, on Langar Airfield, it borders <span class="loc">Clawson</span>, <span class="loc">Hose</span> and <span class="loc">Harby</span>, the <span class="loc">district of Melton and Leicestershire</span>. At <span class="loc">Hose</span> Lane it meets <span class="loc">Colston Bassett</span>. It passes northwards, crossing <span class="loc">Harby</span> Lane, where it follows a tributary of the <span class="loc">River Smite</span>. At Langar Lane Bridge, it briefly meets <span class="loc">Cropwell Bishop</span>, for around 300 metres, then borders the parish of <span class="loc">Wiverton Hall</span>, following the start of the <span class="loc">River Smite</span>, and briefly following <span class="loc">Bingham</span> Road at Wiverton Smite Bridge. It passes on the western edge of <span class="loc">Northfield Farm</span>, then the east side of <span class="loc">Smite Hill Farm</span> (outside the parish). Near the point where the former railway crossed the <span class="loc">River Smite</span>, it meets Whatton-in-the-Vale. It meets <span class="loc">Granby</span> at <span class="loc">Granby</span> Lane, which it follows and the <span class="loc">River Whipling</span>, east of <span class="loc">Barnstone</span> (part of the parish). The boundary follows southwards, to the east of the former <span class="loc">Bingham</span> to <span class="loc">Melton</span> railway, and south of <span class="loc">Granby Gap</span> woods (outside the parish) it meets <span class="loc">Leicestershire</span>.</p>
