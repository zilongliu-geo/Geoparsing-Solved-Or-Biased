<p><span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> (/ˈbweɪnəs ˈɛəriːz/ or /ˈaɪrɪs/, Spanish: [ˈbwenos ˈaiɾes]) is the capital and largest <span class="loc">city of Argentina</span>, and the second-largest metropolitan area in <span class="loc">South America</span>. It is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la <span class="loc">Plata</span>, on the continent's southeastern coast. The Greater <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> conurbation, which also includes several <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> Province districts, constitutes the third-largest conurbation in Latin <span class="loc">America</span>, with a population of around seventeen million. The city of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> is neither part of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> was federalized and removed from <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of <span class="loc">Belgrano</span> and <span class="loc">Flores</span>; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Ciudad Autónoma de <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> (Autonomous City of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>). Its citizens first elected a chief of government (i.e. mayor) in 1996; before, the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic.</p>
