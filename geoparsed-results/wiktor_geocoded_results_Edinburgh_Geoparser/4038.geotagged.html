<p>Brooklyn is a mostly residential neighborhood in southeast <span class="loc">Portland</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. It sits along the east side of the <span class="loc">Willamette River</span> in the vicinity of Reed College. Founded as a neighborhood in the late 1860s, the neighborhood today is a middle-class area comprising mainly single family homes, interspersed with remaining industrial sites along the river and a large railyard. This railyard is home to Southern Pacific 4449 as well as several other large antique steam and diesel-electric locomotives. The area of the neighborhood was inhabited by Clackamas people before settlement by whites. The first white settler in the area of was Giddeon Tibbets, who acquired the land in the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850. He settled the area in 1851, building a family home and grist mill. <span class="loc">Tibbets</span> named the area "Brookland" due to the river, creeks, and lakes on his property. In 1868 <span class="loc">Tibbets</span> subdivided the property into smaller lots and allowed the Oregon Central Railroad to cross the property. The rail line and the subdivision quickly brought in a large number of residents to the neighborhood, which acquired its current name of "Brooklyn". The influx lead to the construction of a town square at the corner of <span class="loc">Powell Boulevard</span> and <span class="loc">Milwaukie Avenue</span>. In the 1890s, the neighborhood received an influx of largely Roman Catholic German-Americans. While many of the German street/landmark names were changed during World War I, the neighborhood continues to bear the traces of this period today, with several older German-American businesses, as well as the Sacred Heart Catholic Church and the 1891 Johan Poulsen House. In 1908, The contracting firm Giebisch and Joplin built this neighborhood's original sewer system.  In the 1920s, the neighborhood changed drastically as a part of a city-wide construction effort. The construction of the Ross Island Bridge over the <span class="loc">Willamette</span> destroyed the town square. At the same time, many of the streams and ponds in the neighborhood were filled in. The construction of McLoughlin Boulevard (<span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 99E) severed the neighborhood's connection to the <span class="loc">Willamette</span> waterfront. The construction of an overpass on 17th avenue also divided the neighborhood in two.</p>
