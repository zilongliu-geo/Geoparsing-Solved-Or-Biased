  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kediri</span> is an Indonesian city, located near the <span class="loc">Brantas</span> River in the province of <span class="loc">East Java</span> on the island of <span class="loc">Java</span>. Archaeological artefacts discovered in <span class="date">2007</span> appeared to indicate that the region around <span class="loc">Kediri</span> may have been the location of the Kediri kingdom, a Hindu kingdom in the 11th century. The city is a major trade centre for the Indonesian sugar and cigarette industry. The <span class="loc">Brantas</span> River valley was known as the site of classical Javanese culture, particularly between the 10th and 15th <span class="date">centuries</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Kediri</span> was established by <span class="per">King Airlangga</span> on the banks of the upper <span class="loc">Brantas</span> river in <span class="date">1042</span>. It was originally called Dahanapura or <span class="loc">Daha</span>. After the death of <span class="per">Airlangga</span> his kingdom was divided into two parts: the kingdom of <span class="loc">Panjalu</span> in the west, and the kingdom of <span class="loc">Janggala</span> in the east. <span class="loc">Daha</span> became the capital of <span class="loc">Panjalu</span>, and later the capital of the Kediri kingdom. Over the <span class="date">centuries</span>, control of the city passed to the Singhasari, Majapahit, <span class="loc">Demak</span> and <span class="loc">Mataram</span> kingdoms. The name "Kediri", or "Kadiri", is derived from the Sanskrit word <span class="loc">Khadri</span>, meaning Indian Mulberry, indicative of the mulberry trees (locally known as pac√© or mengkudu) which grew in the area.</p><br><br>
