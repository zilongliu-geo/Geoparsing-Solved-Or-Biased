  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lake County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Florida</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 297,052. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Tavares</span>, and its largest city is <span class="loc">Clermont</span>. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> is included in the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, <span class="loc">FL Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> was created in <span class="date">1887</span> from portions of <span class="loc">Sumter County</span> and <span class="loc">Orange County</span>. It was named for the many lakes contained within its borders. During the Great Depression, citrus became the leading industry in <span class="loc">Lake County</span>. In <span class="date">1949</span> the <span class="loc">Groveland</span> <span class="per">Four, Ernest Thomas</span>, <span class="per">Charles Greenlee</span>, <span class="per">Samuel Shepherd</span> and <span class="per">Walter Irvin</span>, were wrongly convicted of rape. The convictions were eventually overturned by the <span class="loc">U. S.</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> in a case argued by NAACP special counsel <span class="per">Thurgood Marshall</span>. However, <span class="per">Ernest Thomas</span> had already been killed by a posse. <span class="per">Samuel Shepard</span> and <span class="per">Walter Irvin</span> were shot by <span class="loc">Lake County</span> Sheriff <span class="per">Willis McCall</span> while being transferred, in handcuffs, to the <span class="loc">Lake County</span> jail. The descendants of the Groveland Four petitioned <span class="loc">Florida</span> <span class="per">governor Rick Scott</span> in <span class="date">2012</span> for an apology from the State of <span class="loc">Florida</span>, citing new evidence from an FBI file on the case that no rape ever occurred. The <span class="date">2012</span> book Devil in the Grove documents this episode.</p><br><br>
