  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Unemployment climbs slightly in county, state. <span class="loc">Boone County</span>’s unemployment rate reached 7.7 in <span class="date">February</span>. That number is less that the national and state average, but it is a 6 percent increase from <span class="date">January</span>. According to information released <span class="date">Friday</span> by the <span class="org">Indiana Department of Workforce Development</span>, <span class="loc">Boone County</span>’s unemployment rose from 7.3 percent in <span class="date">January</span> to 7.7 in <span class="date">February</span>. State unemployment was 9.4 percent in <span class="date">February</span> and the national rate for <span class="date">that month</span> was 8.1 percent. <span class="loc">Boone County</span>’s rate places it in the middle of surrounding counties. According to Bureau of Labor Statists data, neighboring counties and their rates include: <span class="loc">Hamilton</span>, 6 percent; <span class="loc">Hendricks</span>, 7.3 percent; <span class="loc">Marion</span>, 8.7 percent; <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, 9.1 percent, and Clinton, 10.5 percent. <span class="loc">Boone County</span> has a workforce of 27,733 and in <span class="date">February</span>, 25,588 individuals were employed, compared to 2,145 out of work. At 7.7 percent unemployment, <span class="loc">Boone County</span>’s figure is near the middle of <span class="loc">Indiana counties</span> — it was 42nd of the state’s 92 counties. An overview of the stateIndiana’s unemployment rate grew slightly in <span class="date">February</span> to 9.4 percent, keeping the state’s jobless rate at the highest level since the recession of <span class="date">the early 1980s</span>. <span class="date">February</span>’s jobless report shows 324,000 Indiana residents looking for work — about 4,000 more than in <span class="date">January</span>. That pushed the state’s jobless rate up slightly from <span class="date">January</span>’s 9.3 percent. <span class="date">February</span>’s numbers suggest that an increase in heavy construction jobs amid the lingering recession is starting to offset continued drops in auto manufacturing, said <span class="per">Teresa Voors</span>, commissioner of the <span class="org">Indiana Department of Workforce Development</span>. “We expect to see continued growth as outdoor construction resumes, but this may not completely negate extended furloughs and layoffs in the automobile industry in the coming <span class="date">months</span>,” <span class="per">Voors</span> said. Indiana’s 0.1 percentage-point <span class="date">February</span> jobless increase was the smallest among it and neighboring states. <span class="loc">Illinois</span> reported the largest increase, up 0.8 points to 8.6 percent. Ohio’s rose 0.6 points to 9.4 percent, while Kentucky’s climbed 0.5 points to 9.2 percent. Michigan’s rate climbed 0.4 points to 12.0 percent. <span class="date">February</span>’s national jobless rate was 8.1 percent.</p><br><br>
