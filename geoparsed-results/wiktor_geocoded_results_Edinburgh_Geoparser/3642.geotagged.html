<p><span class="loc">Rio Verde</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a master planned community. The population was 1,811 at the 2010 census. The area surrounding the <span class="loc">Rio Verde</span> community, northeast of <span class="loc">Scottsdale</span>, was settled by small farmers in the 1880s, who grew hay and alfalfa to provide for the nearby Fort McDowell US Army camp (1865-1890) (now the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation). In the late 1890s, William W. Moore acquired several of the small farm plots on the <span class="loc">Verde River</span>, combining them into what became the Box Bar Ranch. After his death in 1929, Moore's sons, Glen and Lin Moore, operated the Box Bar as a partnership, under the name "Moore Bros Cattle Co.", with grazing leases both east and west of the <span class="loc">Verde River</span>. Lin Moore also ran the X2 Ranch, known as "Moore's Well", 12 miles (19 km) to the west, where he and his wife, Ada Lucille, had homesteaded in the 1920s. William Moore's father, Ransom B. Moore, had emigrated to <span class="loc">Arizona</span> from <span class="loc">California</span> in 1883 and ranched for many years on the Reno Ranch, just west of the community of Punkin <span class="loc">Center</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. Ransom Moore, founder of what is now Banning, <span class="loc">California</span>, also served as <span class="loc">Gila County</span>'s delegate to the 16th Arizona Territorial Legislative Assembly in 1891.</p>
