  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dover</span> (/ˈdoʊvər/) is the capital and second-largest city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="per">Delaware</span>. It is also the county seat of <span class="loc">Kent County</span>, and the principal city of the <span class="loc">Dover</span>, <span class="loc">DE</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of <span class="loc">Kent County</span> and is part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden, PA-NJ-DE-MD Combined Statistical Area. It is located on the St. <span class="loc">Jones River</span> in the <span class="loc">Delaware River</span> coastal plain. It was named by <span class="loc">William Penn</span> for <span class="loc">Dover</span> in <span class="loc">Kent</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. As of <span class="date">2010</span>, the city had a population of 36,047. <span class="loc">Dover</span> was founded as the court town for newly established <span class="loc">Kent County</span> in <span class="date">1683</span> by <span class="loc">William Penn</span>, the proprietor of the territory generally known as the "Lower Counties on the <span class="loc">Delaware</span>." Later, in <span class="date">1717</span>, the city was officially laid out by a special commission of the <span class="per">Delaware General Assembly</span>. The capital of the state of <span class="per">Delaware</span> was moved here from <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> in <span class="date">1777</span> because of its central location and relative safety from British raiders on the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River. Because of an act passed in <span class="date">October 1779</span>, the assembly elected to meet at any place in the state they saw fit, meeting successively in <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>, <span class="loc">Lewes</span>, <span class="loc">Dover</span>, New Castle, and <span class="loc">Lewes</span> again, until it finally settled down permanently in <span class="loc">Dover</span> in <span class="date">October 1781</span>. The city's central square, known as The Green, was the location of many rallies, troop reviews, and other patriotic events. To <span class="date">this day</span>, The Green remains the heart of <span class="loc">Dover</span>'s historic district and is the location of the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> and the <span class="loc">Kent County Courthouse</span>.</p><br><br>
