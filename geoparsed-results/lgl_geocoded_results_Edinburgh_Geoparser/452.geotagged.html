<p>Monument For Sale. There are 12 houses for sale on Monument Avenue. That’s up almost 60% from last year. This could be your chance to snap up a Monument mansion for a cool million (or two). Houses range from the low end at $620,000 up to two million and change. The biggest house clocks in at 7,526 square feet at 2031 Monument Ave. with five kitchens, six living rooms, ten office spaces plus five bedrooms. Its asking price is $899,000. The brick mansion designed by architect William Lawrence Bottomley who designed several houses in the Virginia area as well as <span class="loc">New York</span> is for sale at 2714 Monument Ave for $2,195,000. It features formal living and dining rooms, a powder room, an octagonal library and a gourmet kitchen. Marianne Donohue, a real estate agent with Long &amp; Foster, says there’s no real reason for the increase. The market varies from year to year. She does say that house prices are down in the <span class="loc">Richmond</span> area and that there is more inventory on the market than in the past. “But it’s a great time to buy a house,“ <span class="loc">Donohue</span> says. “The rates are great. And there’s an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers with no interest. “</p>
