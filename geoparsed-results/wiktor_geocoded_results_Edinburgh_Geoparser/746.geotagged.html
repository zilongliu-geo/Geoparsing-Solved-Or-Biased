<p><span class="loc">Windsor</span> is a town lying <span class="loc">west of Sydney</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Windsor</span> is located in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Hawkesbury</span>. It sits on the <span class="loc">Hawkesbury River</span>, on the north-western outskirts of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> metropolitan area. At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Windsor</span> had a population of 1,803. <span class="loc">Windsor</span> is the third-oldest place of British settlement on the Australian continent. Settlement at the location was first established about 1791, near the head of navigation on the <span class="loc">Hawkesbury River</span> (known as Deerubbin in Dharuk) and taking advantage of the fertile river flats for agriculture. The area was originally called <span class="loc">Green Hills</span>, but renamed <span class="loc">Windsor</span> (after <span class="loc">Windsor</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>). The town was officially proclaimed in a Government and General Order issued from Government House, <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, dated 15 December 1810, Governor Lachlan Macquarie having "marked out the district of <span class="loc">Green Hills</span>", which he "... called <span class="loc">Windsor</span>", after Windsor-on-the-Thames. While in <span class="loc">Windsor</span>, Macquarie ordered the main institutions of organised settlement to be erected, such as a church, school-house, gaol and "commodious inn" (The Macquarie Arms). Of these new buildings, the most outstanding was Francis Greenway's Saint Matthew's Anglican Church, for which Macquarie himself chose the site. Samuel Marsden, principal chaplain of the colony, consecrated the church on 8 December 1822.</p>
