<p>Alma was the name of a community located in southeastern <span class="loc">Pointe Coupee Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The community was located east of <span class="loc">Lakeland</span>. The area is currently home to <span class="loc">Pointe Coupee Parish</span>'s only operating sugar mill, Alma Plantation. Alma is one of only 11 sugar mills still operating in the state of <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>. It produces raw sugar and blackstrap molasses. During the harvesting of sugar cane, known locally as "the grinding season", Alma Plantation becomes one of the area's largest employers. Sugar cane is brought to this mill for processing from a number of surrounding parishes. The community was located on land once owned by <span class="loc">Pointe Coupee</span>'s celebrated philanthropist, Julien Poydras. The original Alma Plantation House was constructed in 1789 along the banks of <span class="loc">False River</span>. After the death of Poydras, David Barrow, a member of one of <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>'s most prominent families, purchased the property. In 1938, Alma Plantations's 13-ton locomotive, "Dixie" was sold off to the Mississippi River Sugar Belt Railroad. The Alma Plantation home is no longer open to the public, but the sugar mill and a country store are open to visitors.</p>
