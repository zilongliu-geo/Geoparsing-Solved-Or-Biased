<p>Augusta is a city in <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 9,274. The confluence of the <span class="loc">Whitewater River</span> and the <span class="loc">Walnut River</span> was originally inhabited by Osage people, who found the land ideal for hunting and fishing. In 1868, C. N. James settled in the area and built a log cabin to serve also as a general store and trading post. Around that same time, a post office was established in the settlement, and as the first postmaster, C. N. James named the post office and the town in honor of his wife, Augusta James. In 1877, the <span class="loc">Florence</span>, <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company built a branch line from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>. In 1881 it was extended to <span class="loc">Douglass</span>, and later to <span class="loc">Arkansas City</span>. The rail line was leased and operated by the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway. Service from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">El Dorado</span> was abandoned in 1942. The original branch line connected <span class="loc">Florence</span>, Burns, <span class="loc">De Graff</span>, <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>, <span class="loc">Augusta</span>, <span class="loc">Douglass</span>, Rock, <span class="loc">Akron</span>, <span class="loc">Winfield</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas City</span>.</p>
