<p>Colton is an unincorporated community located in <span class="loc">Clackamas County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, on <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 211. Colton is located between the <span class="loc">cities of Estacada and Molalla</span>. Colton was named in about 1892 by two residents, Joshua Gorbett and a man named Cole, who each wanted to name the community after the other. The Post Office Department thought "Gorbett" would be confused with <span class="loc">Corbett</span>, so the community was named "Colton" instead. The Colton post office was established the same year. Its ZIP Code is 97017. The community has historically had a large Swedish population, and was once a significant logging town. Today the economy is dominated by horticulture and Christmas tree farming. Colton is located on <span class="loc">Milk Creek</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Molalla River</span>, in a broad canyon eroded in a plateau of volcanic basalts and ash of the nearby Western Cascades. <span class="loc">Canyon Creek</span>, which drains <span class="loc">Green Mountain</span>'s slopes to the South, joins <span class="loc">Milk Creek</span> just east of the community. Primary and secondary students in Colton are served by the Colton School District, which includes Colton Elementary School, Colton Middle School, Colton High School.</p>
