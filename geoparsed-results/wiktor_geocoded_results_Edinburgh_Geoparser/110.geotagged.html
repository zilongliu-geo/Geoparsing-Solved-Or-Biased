<p><span class="loc">Richmond</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 3 km south-east of Melbourne's Central Business District in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Yarra</span> municipality. The 2011 Census listed Richmond's population as 26,121. Three of the 82 designated major activity centres identified in the <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> 2030 Metropolitan Strategy are located in Richmondâ€”the commercial strips of Victoria Street, Bridge Road and <span class="loc">Swan Street</span>. The diverse suburb has been the subject of gentrification since the early 1990s and now contains an eclectic mix of expensively converted warehouse residences, public housing high-rise flats and terrace houses from the Victorian-era. The residential segment of the suburb exists among a lively retail sector. <span class="loc">Richmond</span> was home to the Nine Network studios, under the callsign of GTV-9, until the studios moved to Docklands in 2011. Dimmeys is long associated with <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, although it is located in the neighbouring suburb of <span class="loc">Cremorne</span>. The suburb is well known for its popular factory outlets along Bridge Road, remaining an attraction to the area. <span class="loc">Richmond</span> is well known for its vibrant and popular Little Saigon area along Victoria Street; however, the area is also recognised for the illicit drug dealing (especially heroin) that occurs in both street-based and domestic contexts.</p>
