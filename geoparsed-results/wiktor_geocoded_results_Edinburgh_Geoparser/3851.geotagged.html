<p>Providence is the capital and most populous city in <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. Founded in 1636, it is one of the oldest cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located in <span class="loc">Providence County</span>, and is the third-largest city in the <span class="loc">New England</span> region after <span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">Worcester</span>. Providence has a city population of 179,154 and is part of the 38th-largest metropolitan population in the country, with an estimated population of 1,604,291, exceeding that of <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> by about 60%, as it extends into southern <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. This can be considered in turn to be part of the Greater <span class="loc">Boston</span> commuting area, which contains 7.6 million people. The city is situated at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Providence River</span>, at the head of <span class="loc">Narragansett Bay</span>. Providence was founded by Roger Williams, a religious exile from the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span>. He named the area in honor of "God's merciful Providence", which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle. After becoming one of the first cities in the country to industrialize, Providence became noted for its jewelry and silverware industry. Today, the <span class="loc">city of Providence</span> is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning, which has shifted the city's economy into service industries, though it still retains significant manufacturing activity.</p>
