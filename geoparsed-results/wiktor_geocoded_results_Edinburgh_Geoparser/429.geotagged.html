<p><span class="loc">La Paz</span> is a fifth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Leyte</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 19,133 people. The legend of <span class="loc">La Paz</span>, bordering on fiction and history, is an interesting one. It is said that long ago, a fisherman from <span class="loc">Samar</span> named Capuyong came to <span class="loc">Abuyog</span> to market his catch. There he met and fell in love with Casinas and they were married according to pre-Spanish customs. After marriage, they left <span class="loc">Abuyog</span> to look for a place in which to live. Coming to a river that is now called <span class="loc">Gibuga</span>, they followed its source until they reached a tributary that was named <span class="loc">Cabadyangan</span> River where they decided to stay. They had three children: <span class="loc">Garcia</span>, Gabic and Badol. Gabic left for <span class="loc">Hindang</span>, while Badol settled in <span class="loc">Dagami</span>. <span class="loc">Garcia</span>, the eldest, stayed home. He married a certain <span class="loc">Agustina</span> of <span class="loc">Abuyog</span> with whom he had 18 children. Meanwhile, the Spaniards had settled in <span class="loc">Abuyog</span>. They found it difficult to convert Casinal and Capuyong to Christianity. The couple clung obstinately to their religion. Condemned to die for refusing to embrace the new religion, they were tied to a jar full of stones and flung off the coast of <span class="loc">Dulag</span>.</p>
