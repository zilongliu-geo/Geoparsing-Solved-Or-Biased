<p><span class="loc">Plainville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Rooks County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 1,903. It was named from its setting upon the plains. Washington Irving Griffin settled along a freight trail in an area known as <span class="loc">Paradise Flats</span> in 1877. In order to establish a post office, Griffin completed a US Postal Service application that required the signature of the local Justice of the Peace. While reviewing the application, Justice of the Peace Lambert P. Darland suggested the name “Plainville”. Griffin operated the Plainville post office and a small store from his sod house, the first structure in what would become the <span class="loc">city of Plainville</span>. In 1888, <span class="loc">Plainville</span> filed for incorporation with 500 residents. Dan E. Miller was elected the first mayor. The first city council consisted of Dr. Volney M. Gray, <span class="loc">Murray</span> C. Knox, John Mullin, George Brooks and David E. Mickey. Union Pacific Railroad established an east-west route through <span class="loc">Plainville</span> in August of 1888. The train tracks ran parallel to <span class="loc">Mill Street</span>, approximately one block to the north. Plainville Mill &amp; Elevator Co., (est. 1893) was a major employer and purchaser of locally grown wheat. The original mill was destroyed by fire in 1899 and soon replaced by a larger mill. The flour produced by the mill was of such fine quality, the company won a gold medal at the 1904 World’s Fair. The mill was again destroyed by fire in 1950. Plainville Mill &amp; Elevator Co. was located on the northeast corner of <span class="loc">Mill Street</span> and Meridian Street next to the railroad tracks.</p>
