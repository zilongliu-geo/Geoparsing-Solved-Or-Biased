For the place in <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>, see <span class="loc">Abak</span>, <span class="loc">FATA</span>. <span class="loc">Abak</span> is a town and Local Government Area in <span class="loc">Akwa Ibom State</span>, <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. The LGA was previously part of <span class="loc">Cross River State</span>. It was later sub divided into other local government areas such as Oruk Anam, Etim Ekpo, <span class="loc">Ukanafun</span> and <span class="loc">Ika</span>. Notable tribes include the Annang. The major economic activities of the people of this area before and after the Nigerian civil war was palm produce exported through river port at Ekpene Okpo, Ntak Ibesit, a distance of about 8 km from <span class="loc">Abak</span> town. <span class="loc">Abak</span> to say the least, is the shadow of its former self due to politically motivated neglect by successive governments in Akwa Ibom state.<span class="loc">Abak</span> before the civil war, was the economic hub of the former South Eastern <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. The major economic activities of the people is palm produce. Before the Nigerian civil war, <span class="loc">Abak Division</span> was the major producer of palm oil and kernel exported through river ports at Ntak Ibesit and <span class="loc">IKOT Okoro</span>. <span class="loc">Abak</span> became the seat of Government in <span class="date">1902</span> after conquest by war against the British colonial invaders at the valley lying between <span class="loc">Ediene</span> and <span class="loc">Abak Clans</span>. The outcome of that conquest was the penetration into the hinterland by the colonial soldiers and eventual installation of the government. Valley in the local language is called “Aba-ag” and fighting is “Anwan.” By joining the two words “Aba- ag” and “Anwan” the names “Aba-ag Ikot Anwan” was given to the newly established entity. The seat of Government kept growing until <span class="date">1957</span> and <span class="date">1958</span> when it gained the status of Divisional Council Headquarters. At the establishment, the area included the present <span class="loc">Ukanafun</span>, Oruk Anam, Etim Ekpo, <span class="loc">Ika</span> and the present <span class="loc">Abak</span>. All the places mentioned here have been developed to become full-fledged local government areas.</p><br><br>
