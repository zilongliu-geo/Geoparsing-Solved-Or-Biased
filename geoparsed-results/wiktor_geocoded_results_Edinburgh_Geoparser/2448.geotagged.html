<p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a county located in the western portion of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 674,158. making it the second-most populous county in the state (after St. <span class="loc">Louis County</span>). Although Independence retains its status as the original county seat, <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> serves as a second county seat and the center of county government. The county was organized December 15, 1826 and named for President Andrew Jackson (elected 1828). <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is the central county of the <span class="loc">Kansas City</span>, <span class="loc">MO-KS Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> was home to members of the <span class="loc">Osage</span> Native American tribe. The first known European explorers were French trappers who used the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River as a highway for explorations and trading with Native American tribes. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> was a part of New <span class="loc">France</span>, until the British victory in the French and Indian War in 1763 resulted in the cession of this territory to <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>'s ally, <span class="loc">Spain</span>. <span class="loc">Spain</span> was forced by the Third Treaty of <span class="loc">San Ildefonso</span> in 1800 to return its Louisiana Territory (of which modern <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> then formed a part) to <span class="loc">France</span>, which in turn sold it to the <span class="loc">United States</span> in the <span class="loc">Louisiana Purchase</span> of 1803.</p>
