  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lancaster</span> /ˈlæŋkəstər/, or /ˈlæŋˌkæstər/ is the county town of <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is situated on the <span class="loc">River Lune</span> and has a population of 45,952. <span class="per">Lancaster</span> is a constituent settlement of the wider <span class="loc">City of Lancaster</span>, a local government district which has a population of 138,375  and encompasses several outlying settlements, including neighbouring <span class="loc">Morecambe</span>. Long existing as a commercial, cultural and educational centre, <span class="per">Lancaster</span> is the settlement that gives <span class="loc">Lancashire</span> its name. <span class="per">Lancaster</span> has several unique ties to the British monarchy; the <span class="org">House of Lancaster</span> was a branch of the English royal family, whilst the Duchy of <span class="per">Lancaster</span> holds large estates on behalf of <span class="per">Elizabeth II</span>, who herself is also the <span class="per">Duke of Lancaster</span>. <span class="per">Lancaster</span> was granted city status in <span class="date">1937</span> for its "long association with the crown" and because it was "the county town of the King's Duchy of <span class="per">Lancaster</span>". With its history based on its port and canal, <span class="per">Lancaster</span> is an ancient settlement, dominated by <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> Castle. It is also home to the campus-based <span class="org">Lancaster University</span> and a campus of the <span class="org">University of Cumbria</span>. It is known that there existed a permanent Roman fort on the hill where <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> Castle <span class="date">now</span> stands by the end of the <span class="date">1st century AD</span>, and possibly as early as <span class="date">the 60s</span>, based on the Roman coin evidence. The coin evidence also suggests that the fort was not continuously inhabited in these early <span class="date">years</span>. The fort was rebuilt in stone around <span class="date">102 AD</span>. The fort underwent a few more extensions, and at its largest area it was 9–10 acres (4–4 ha). The evidence suggests that the fort remained active into the early 5th century, which was the end of the Roman occupation of <span class="loc">Britain</span>.</p><br><br>
