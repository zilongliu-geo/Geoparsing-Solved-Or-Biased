  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Nain</span> or <span class="loc">Naina</span> (Inuit: Nunajnguk) is the northernmost permanent settlement in the Canadian province of <span class="loc">Newfoundland and Labrador</span>, located about 370 kilometres by air from Happy Valley-Goose Bay. The town was established as a Moravian mission in <span class="date">1771</span> by <span class="per">Jens Haven</span> and other missionaries. As of <span class="date">2011</span>, the population is 1,424 mostly Inuit and mixed Inuit-European. On <span class="date">December 1, 2005</span>, <span class="loc">Nain</span> became the administrative capital of the autonomous region of Nunatsiavut which is the name chosen by the <span class="loc">Labrador</span> Inuit when the <span class="loc">Labrador</span> Inuit Land Claims Agreement Act was successfully ratified by the Canadian Government and the Inuit of <span class="loc">Labrador</span>. <span class="loc">Hopedale</span>, further south, is the legislative capital. The land claim cedes limited self-rule for the Nunatsiavut government in Northern <span class="loc">Labrador</span> and North-Eastern Quebec, granting title and aboriginal rights. The land that comprises the Nunatsiavut government is called the <span class="loc">Labrador</span> Inuit Settlement Area, or LISA, which amount to approximately 72,500 km2 (28,000miles2). The Inuit of <span class="loc">Labrador</span> do not own this land per se, but they do have special rights related to traditional land use as aboriginals. That said, the <span class="loc">Labrador</span> Inuit will own 15,000 km2 (6,100miles2) within the Settlement Area, officially designated as <span class="loc">Labrador</span> Inuit Lands. The Agreement also provides for the establishment of the Torngat Mountains National Park Reserve, consisting of about 9,600 square kilometres (3,700 sq mi) of land within LISA. Nunatsiavut is not to be confused with the Nunavut territory.</p><br><br>
