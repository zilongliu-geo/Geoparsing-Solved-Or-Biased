  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Czech foreign minister 'not happy' with Israeli policies. The Czech <span class="org">EU</span> presidency is not happy with some Israeli policies and an EU-Israel summit is unlikely to take place in <span class="date">the next three months</span>, Czech Foreign Minister <span class="per">Karel Schwarzenberg</span> said on <span class="date">Tuesday</span>. "We are not happy with some of the steps of the Israeli government, namely construction works close to <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> but also access to <span class="loc">Gaza</span>, which is <span class="date">today</span> very limited," daily Lidove Noviny quoted <span class="per">Schwarzenberg</span> as saying. "The new Israeli government has not raised much excitement either." <span class="per">Schwarzenberg</span> said it was unlikely that the Czech presidency would hold an EU-Israel summit as earlier planned. Senior <span class="org">EU</span> officials have sent messages to <span class="per">Benjamin Netanyahu</span> making it clear that a refusal to adopt the "two-state solution" means freezing any upgrade in relations between <span class="loc">Israel</span> and <span class="loc">Europe</span>. International trepidation over the incoming government's righward orientation prompted <span class="per">President Shimom</span> <span class="loc">Peres</span> to launch a campaign <span class="date">a few days ago</span> whose aim is to convince the world that the "Netanyahu-Lieberman-Barak" government will advance the peace process with the Palestinians. In a phone call <span class="date">late last week</span> to mark the 30th anniversary of Israeli-Egyptian peace, <span class="loc">Peres</span> told Egyptian President <span class="per">Hosni Mubarak</span> that the agreements signed by <span class="loc">Israel</span> contain an obligation to promote a regional peace agreement as well as separate agreements with each of <span class="loc">Israel</span>'s neighbors. "In addition," <span class="loc">Peres</span> said, "the new government will be obligated to honor all of the international agreements that have been signed." Sources close to <span class="loc">Peres</span> said <span class="date">yesterday</span> that the president has transmitted similar messages in his talks with foreign leaders, which are expected to continue through <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, when the new government is to be sworn in. <span class="loc">Peres</span> made an official visit to <span class="loc">Prague</span> on <span class="date">Monday</span>, where he met with the president, prime minister and foreign minister of the <span class="loc">Czech Republic</span>. The Czechs are the current president of the European Union, and according to sources in the President's Residence in <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>, <span class="loc">Peres</span> intends to take advantage of his visit to present the coalition agreements to his hosts and to stress the new government's commitment to the peace process. "It will be one of the main topics of the visit," the source said. In addition, immediately after the swearing-in ceremony for <span class="per">Netanyahu</span> on <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, <span class="loc">Peres</span> will launch a media blitz of interviews to the foreign press to explain the policies of the new government.</p><br><br>
