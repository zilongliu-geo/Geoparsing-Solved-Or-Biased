  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newport</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Cocke County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,945 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 7,242 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The estimated population in <span class="date">2014</span> was 6,880. It is located along the <span class="loc">Pigeon River</span>. The Great Indian Warpath passed through what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Newport</span> en route to the ancient <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> hunting grounds of northeastern <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The Warpath crossed the <span class="loc">Pigeon River</span> at a point approximately 0.2 miles (0.3 km) east of the McSween Memorial Bridge (US-321), in an area where the river is normally low enough to walk across. The first European traders to the area, arriving in the mid-18th century, called this point along the <span class="loc">Pigeon River</span> the "War Ford". During the American Revolution, the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> aligned themselves with the British, and launched sporadic attacks against early Euro-American settlers in the Holston valley. In the waning <span class="date">months</span> of the conflict in <span class="date">1782</span>, a detachment led by Gen. <span class="per">Charles McDowell</span> of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> crossed the mountains into what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> to join up with Col. <span class="loc">John Sevier</span>'s local forces and initiate an aggressive campaign against the hostile <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>. In August of <span class="date">that year</span>, <span class="loc">Sevier</span> crossed the Pigeon at War Ford, attacking and killing several <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> camped along the river's banks. This assault was one of the final engagements of the Revolution.</p><br><br>
