<p><span class="loc">Orange County</span> is located in southern <span class="loc">Indiana</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of 2010, its population was 19,840, an increase of 2.8% from 19,306 in 2000. The county seat is <span class="loc">Paoli</span>. The county has four incorporated settlements with a total population of about 8,600, as well as several small unincorporated communities. It is divided into 10 townships which provide local services. One <span class="loc">U.S.</span> route and five <span class="loc">Indiana</span> state roads pass through or into the county. <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was formed from parts of <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, <span class="loc">Gibson County</span> and <span class="loc">Washington County</span> by an act approved on December 26, 1815; it took effect on February 1, 1816. The same year, the county seat was established in <span class="loc">Paoli</span>, which was named after Pasquale Paoli Ash, the 12-year-old son of the Governor, at the time, of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> . The first courthouse was a temporary log structure that was built for $25; a more permanent structure of stone was completed in 1819 at a cost of $3,950.  In 1847, plans were made for a new larger courthouse, which was completed in 1850 at a cost of $14,000. This building is the second oldest courthouse in the state that has been continuously used since its construction. Like the oldest in <span class="loc">Ohio County</span>, it is a Greek Revival building with two stories and a Doric portico supported by fluted columns; it has ornamental iron stairs and a clock tower. In 1970, the clock tower was damaged by fire.</p>
