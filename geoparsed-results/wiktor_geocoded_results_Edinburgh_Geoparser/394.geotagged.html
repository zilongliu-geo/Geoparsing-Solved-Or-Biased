<p>Lincoln is a town on <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span> in the <span class="loc">Niagara Region</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The town's administrative and commercial centre is in the community of <span class="loc">Beamsville</span>. Lincoln's location between the southern shore of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span> and the <span class="loc">Niagara Escarpment</span> provides for a moderate climate with mild winters. The area is known in <span class="loc">Canada</span> for its orchards, vineyards, wineries and restaurants that feature local produce and wines. Fruit crops grown in Lincoln include cherries, peaches, apples and pears, and during the summer attract many tourists from all over <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, particularly <span class="loc">Toronto</span>. Lincoln's earliest known inhabitants were Neutral Indians. Archaeologists from the Royal Ontario Museum found evidence of a Neutral encampment with a long house about two kilometers east of <span class="loc">Beamsville</span>, on Cave <span class="loc">Springs Farm</span>. Until vandals destroyed them about 30 years ago, there were a number of Indian faces carved in stone high on the Escarpment wall nearby. The Neutrals were decimated by the <span class="loc">Iroquois</span> in 1653. When the first European settlers arrived in 1777, there were only a few semi-migrant native people living in the caves near <span class="loc">Beamsville</span>.</p>
