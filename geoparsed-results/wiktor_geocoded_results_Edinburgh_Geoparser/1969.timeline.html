  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Dinkletown</span> and <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span>) is an incorporated town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,644 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is included in the <span class="loc">Harrisonburg</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> is also home to <span class="org">Bridgewater College</span>, a private, coeducational, four-year liberal arts college founded in <span class="date">1880</span>, historically associated with <span class="org">the Church of the Brethren</span>. Among the first families of European descent in the area was the <span class="per">Dinkle</span> family. Around <span class="date">1810</span>, <span class="per">John Dinkle</span> built a sawmill and a grist mill on the <span class="loc">North River</span>, a tributary of the South Fork of the <span class="loc">Shenandoah River</span>. The tiny community was first called <span class="loc">Dinkletown</span>. The area was known as McGill's <span class="org">Ford</span> before the Dinkles moved here. The name was changed to <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span>, because it was a flatboat port at a bridge. Even after it was no longer a port, the bridge was still there, hence the final renaming as <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span>. During the American Civil War, some troop transit and skirmishes happened nearby. The Valley Campaigns of <span class="date">1864</span> involved the region. In the late 19th century, the world's longest single-span wooden covered bridge stood where Main Street crosses the <span class="loc">North River</span>; representations of the long-gone bridge still appear in the town emblems.</p><br><br>
