<p><span class="loc">Valparaiso</span> (/ˌvɑːlpəˈreɪzoʊ/ vahl-pə-RAY-zoh) is a city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Porter County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 31,730 at the 2010 census. The site of present-day <span class="loc">Valparaiso</span> was included in the purchase of land from the Potawatomi Indians by the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Government in October 1832. Chiqua's town or Chipuaw was located a mile east of the current Courthouse along the <span class="loc">Sauk</span> Trail. Chiqua's town existed from at or before 1830 until after 1832. The location is just north of the railroad crossing on State Route 2 and County Road 400 North. Located on the ancient Indian trail from <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> to <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, the town had its first log cabin in 1834. Established in 1836 as <span class="loc">Portersville</span>, county seat of <span class="loc">Porter County</span>, it was renamed to <span class="loc">Valparaiso</span> (meaning "Valley of Paradise" in Old Spanish) in 1837 after Valparaíso, <span class="loc">Chile</span>, near which the county's namesake David Porter battled in the Battle of <span class="loc">Valparaiso</span> during the War of 1812. The city was once called the "<span class="loc">City of Churches</span>" due to the large number of churches located here at the end of the 19th Century.</p>
