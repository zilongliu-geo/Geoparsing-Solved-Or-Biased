  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Agua Fria</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa <span class="loc">Fe County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,051 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="loc">Agua Fria</span> Village is a "Traditional Historic Community" (THC) as designated by the <span class="org">Santa Fe Board of County Commissioners</span> in <span class="date">1995</span> and subsequent Santa <span class="loc">Fe County</span> Ordinance #1996-16, as allowed by State Statute (3-7-1.1 and 3-2-3 (C) NMSA <span class="date">1978</span>). <span class="loc">Agua Fria</span> is located at 35°39′33″N 106°0′45″W (35.659143, -106.012412). The traditional boundaries of the Village are from <span class="loc">Camino</span> <span class="per">Carlos Rael</span> (west boundary of Frenchy's <span class="per">Field Park</span>) on the east to San Felipe Road on the west (rejected Cienguilla Grant boundary), to <span class="loc">Arroyo de los Chamisos</span> on the south (present day <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Place Mall), to <span class="loc">Arroyo de los Frijoles</span> on the north (the arroyo is a City of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> walking trail, but it might be described as <span class="loc">Las Companas</span> subdivision---just north of State Road 599). The present day THC boundaries are much smaller (basically Siler Road on east, Lopez lane and Jemez Road on west, <span class="loc">Rufina</span> Street on south and State Road 599 on north).</p><br><br>
