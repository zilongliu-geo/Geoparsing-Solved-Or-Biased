<p><span class="loc">Lake County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Florida</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 297,052. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Tavares</span>, and its largest city is <span class="loc">Clermont</span>. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> is included in the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, <span class="loc">FL Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> was created in 1887 from portions of <span class="loc">Sumter County</span> and <span class="loc">Orange County</span>. It was named for the many lakes contained within its borders. During the Great Depression, citrus became the leading industry in <span class="loc">Lake County</span>. In 1949 the <span class="loc">Groveland</span> Four, Ernest Thomas, Charles Greenlee, Samuel Shepherd and Walter Irvin, were wrongly convicted of rape. The convictions were eventually overturned by the <span class="loc">U. S.</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> in a case argued by NAACP special counsel Thurgood Marshall. However, Ernest Thomas had already been killed by a posse. Samuel Shepard and Walter Irvin were shot by <span class="loc">Lake County</span> Sheriff Willis McCall while being transferred, in handcuffs, to the <span class="loc">Lake County</span> jail. The descendants of the Groveland Four petitioned <span class="loc">Florida</span> governor Rick Scott in 2012 for an apology from the State of <span class="loc">Florida</span>, citing new evidence from an FBI file on the case that no rape ever occurred. The 2012 book Devil in the Grove documents this episode.</p>
