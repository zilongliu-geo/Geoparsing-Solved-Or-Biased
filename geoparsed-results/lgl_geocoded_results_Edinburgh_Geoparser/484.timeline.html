  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> murder still haunts family <span class="date">15 years later</span>. At first, the <span class="date">Christmas</span> cards from their son's old boss arrived year after year at the <span class="per">Mauro</span> home, always remembering the promising young engineer, gunned down in broad daylight at Applied Materials. Then, eventually, the cards stopped. So, too, did the calls from police. What hasn't stopped are the restless <span class="date">nights</span>, lying awake, tormented with the same piercing questions about a murder that happened <span class="date">15 years ago today</span>. Who would have wanted <span class="per">Matthew</span> D. <span class="loc">Flores</span> dead? Why would anyone want to kill the handsome, charismatic husband and father — a decorated <span class="org">Army</span> veteran who led a seemingly ordinary life? "It's been <span class="date">15 years</span>, it is still an unsolved homicide and nothing has ever come about," said <span class="per">Mike Mauro</span>, Flores' stepfather. "We're still hoping someday, someone will call us and say, 'Here's what happened and here's the reason.' " But the mystery surrounding the case still haunts them as they wait in frustration for <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> police to find their son's shooter, a phantom-like killer who slipped away without a trace from the parking lot of Building 12 on <span class="date">March 24, 1994</span>. But there was one potentially explosive piece of evidence caught on a grainy security videotape — a black and white <span class="org">Ford</span> Explorer, seen circling the parking lot before the shooting, then leaving only seconds after Flores was shot. The driver has never been found. "The most puzzling thing about this case is that it was so busy that morning, yet we didn't have as many witnesses as you would think there would be,'' said <span class="per">Capt. Stewart Cusimano</span>, who's been at the department for <span class="date">29 years</span>. "That's what was really lacking here." Flores, 26, had just left the <span class="org">Army</span> where he had served as a lieutenant during Operation Desert Storm. He had moved his wife and 8-month-old daughter, <span class="per">Danielle</span>, to <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> for a job at Applied Materials where he was to train for <span class="date">a few months</span> before transferring to the company's Dallas office. "He had paid his dues and put himself through college,'' said his mother, <span class="per">Ellen Mauro</span>, from her home in <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, where Flores grew up. "This was his big chance and he never got to enjoy it." In <span class="date">the 15 years</span> since Flores' death, <span class="per">Mauro</span> hounded the FBI, congressional leaders and former <span class="org">U.S. Attorney General</span> <span class="per">Janet Reno</span> for help in her son's case. She even sought out psychics. Nothing panned out. "I spent <span class="date">more than five years</span> going everywhere and anywhere to anyone who I thought could help,'' she said, "and all I would get were doors slammed in my face or letters saying, 'We can't help you.' '' His widow, Denise, a nurse who lives in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, never remarried and both she and <span class="per">Danielle</span> always wonder why Flores' life was taken so brutally. "We lived very ordinary lives,'' she said. "There have been so <span class="date">many days</span> and <span class="date">nights</span> when I've thought of every possible scenario and nothing makes sense." <span class="per">Danielle</span> knows her father only through videos and photographs, including one near the Golden Gate Bridge taken <span class="date">days</span> before his death, where's he's holding her in his arms. Flores' case has appeared on "Unsolved Mysteries," airing periodically over the <span class="date">years</span> and occasionally generating new leads. "We've probably spent more time on this case than any other case that I can recall," <span class="per">Cusimano</span> said. More recently, <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> police had consultants look at the case, submitted new evidence to the lab and reviewed the surveillance tape. Detectives also took a new look at his military connections, exploring his relationships and assignments. Flores had no known enemies, so there's a question whether it could have been a case of mistaken identity. "There are no facts that can substantiate a theory," <span class="per">Cusimano</span> said. The family, however, remains frustrated with police. <span class="per">Cusimano</span> said he understands. "I don't blame them. I'm frustrated. This is one of those cases that I have always taken a personal interest in." At Applied Materials, the executives who knew Flores are gone. His old boss, <span class="per">Gary Robertson</span>, who found him in the parking lot <span class="date">that day</span>, no longer wants to talk about the case. And, since Flores had been at the tech company just <span class="date">days</span>, not many knew him. Still, a reminder of him lingers at the company's sprawling campus. There, near the dull forbidding concrete Building 12 on Oakmead Village Drive, is a scarcely noticeable barren tree planted in Flores' honor. Next to it lies a tombstone-like granite monument ensconced in a cluster of rocks with a plaque. It says simply: <span class="per">Matthew</span> D. Flores, <span class="date">1967</span>-<span class="date">1994</span>. Murder victim <span class="per">Matthew Flores</span> was killed in <span class="date">1994</span> in the Applied Materials parking lot. The case is still unsolved.

Not the woman who heard the shot and turned to see his kneeling body, slumped next to the driver's door of his sedan. Nor the other drivers who entered the parking lot just before he was shot once in the back of the head at point-blank range. None of the security cameras captured the shooting, and there was no shell casing from a weapon or sign of a struggle. None of his belongings were taken.</p><br><br>
