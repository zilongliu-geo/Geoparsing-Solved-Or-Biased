  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is an unincorporated town and census-designated place and part of <span class="loc">Las</span> <span class="loc">Vegas Township</span> in <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located 2 miles (3 km) west of the <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> Strip. The population was 178,395 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> was formed in <span class="date">May, 1981</span>. After purchasing the land occupied by <span class="loc">Stardust International Raceway</span>, <span class="loc">Pardee Homes</span> began developing a master-planned housing community called <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> southwest of <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> in the mid-1970s. By <span class="date">1981</span>, residents grouped together to solicit the <span class="org">Clark County Commission</span> to create an unincorporated town, which it did <span class="date">that May</span>. The town originally encompassed 1 square mile (3 km2), but <span class="date">now</span> occupies much of the southwest quarter of the <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> Valley, totaling 33.4 square miles (90 km2). The predominant boundaries of <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> are Sahara Avenue on the north, Decatur Boulevard on the east, Warm Springs Road on the south, and Hualapai Way on the west. The area mostly consists of housing subdivisions, with strip malls lining the large boulevards that connect suburban <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> to the Strip. The northern part of <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> includes areas of rural-estate zoning, with large parcels of land on blocks of 1⁄64 square mile (40,000 m2). The southern part of <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is quickly developing – <span class="date">fifteen years ago</span>, very little south of Tropicana Avenue was developed within <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>.</p><br><br>
