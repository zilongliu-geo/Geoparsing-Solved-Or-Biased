  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Pen is a town and taluka in <span class="loc">Raigad district</span> of Indian state of <span class="loc">Maharashtra</span>. It is famous for world class Ganesh idols. It is geographical and cultural center of <span class="loc">Raigad district</span>. <span class="org">Name of Pen</span> is derived from the term "पेणे" or "Pene", which means 'A place to rest'. Although no one is certain about the origin of Pen, historians think it probably dates back to the times of Buddha. Due to its vantage location, Pen developed as a port city (present day Antora port was commonly referred as "Pen Port"), with trade links as far as <span class="loc">Egypt</span>. It had a very prosperous marketplace where exchange of goods to and from deccan took place. The <span class="loc">Kolaba District</span> Gazettee gives Pen's history as follows During the period of shilahar kings, many temples of goddesses were built, including Jagdumba of <span class="loc">Vashi</span>. In the period of Chalukyas, grand temples of <span class="loc">Shiva</span>, like Rameshwar(रामेश्वर), Pataneshwar(पाटणेश्वर), Goteshwar(गोटेश्वर) and Vyaghreshwar(व्याघ्रेश्वर)were constructed In Shivaji era, Shayistekhan's raid on deccan led to major fights in Pen taluka between <span class="per">Moghals</span> and <span class="per">Marathas</span>. Initially moghal army led by Sardar Taherkhan occupied Pen's fort of Mahalmeera and looted surrounding villages, which included desecration of grand temple of Goteshwar. Shivaji's army fought back with vengeance. They defeated Kartalabkhan in nearby Umbarkhind and officer <span class="loc">Balakhi</span>, near Ratangad. Stronghold of Mahalmeera was also taken back on <span class="date">27th Feb 1662</span> and <span class="date">the following day</span>, after a valiant struggle, Pen's Bastion (presently, the site of Tehsil office) was secured by Shivaji's army. In this conquest, Sardar Vaghoji Tupe fought mesmerizing battle against equally skillful moghal officer but at the crucial moment, <span class="loc">Tupe</span> dealt a decisive blow which killed the officer and ensured Maratha victory. Vaghoji was also critically injured and died soon afterwards. Shivaji Maharaj himself visited Pen on two occasions, on <span class="date">6 August 1668</span> and <span class="date">11 May 1674</span>.</p><br><br>
