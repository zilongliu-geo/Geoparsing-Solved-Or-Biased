  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Belmont</span> is a southern suburb of <span class="per">Geelong, Victoria</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The name means "beautiful hill". <span class="loc">Belmont</span> is geographically separated from the Geelong central business district by the <span class="loc">Barwon River</span>. The suburb is primarily residential, with some light industry along Barwon Heads Road. The suburb is part of the <span class="loc">City of Greater Geelong</span> local government area. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Belmont</span> had a population of 13,616. The area has been inhabited by the Wathaurong people for <span class="date">at least 25,000 years</span>. The first European to settle in the area was Dr. <span class="per">Alexander Thomson</span>, later mayor of <span class="per">Geelong</span>, who took up a pastoral run in <span class="date">1836</span>, and subsequent purchases of crown land were managed from his homestead 'Kardinia'. Early white settlement was hampered by the lack of a secure bridge over the <span class="loc">Barwon River</span>. The first wooden bridge opened <span class="date">early in 1848</span>, and was tolled by the <span class="loc">South Barwon Road</span> Board. <span class="date">Four years later</span>, on <span class="date">23 May 1852</span>, the bridge was swept away in a flood. From <span class="date">December</span> <span class="date">that year</span> a government punt operated at the site, and by <span class="date">late 1853</span> two government punts were used to form a pontoon bridge. In <span class="date">1859</span> a secure iron bridge was opened as a replacement. By the mid-to-late 1850s a township had developed, with a general store and a number of pubs. The Post Office opened on <span class="date">21 January 1860</span>.</p><br><br>
