<p>Lowell is a city in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. With an estimated 2014 population of 109,945, it is the fourth-largest city in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, after <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">Worcester</span>, and <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, and the second-largest in what the U.S. Census Bureau defines as <span class="loc">Boston</span>'s metropolitan area. Incorporated in 1826, Lowell became known as the cradle of the American Industrial Revolution, and many of the city's historic sites have been preserved by the National Park Service. Lowell is home to the University of Massachusetts Lowell, a <span class="loc">Carnegie</span>-classified research university and the second largest public university in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Along with <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, <span class="loc">Lowell</span> is one of <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>'s historical county seats prior to the abolition of county government in 1997. Founded in the 1820s as a planned manufacturing center for textiles, Lowell is located along the rapids of the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span>, 25 miles northwest of <span class="loc">Boston</span> in what was once the farming community of <span class="loc">East Chelmsford</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The so-called <span class="loc">Boston</span> Associates, including Nathan Appleton and Patrick Tracy Jackson of the Boston Manufacturing Company, named the new mill town after their visionary leader, Francis Cabot Lowell, who had died five years before its 1823 incorporation. As Lowell's population grew, it acquired more land from neighboring towns, and diversified into a full-fledged urban center. Many of the men who composed the labor force for constructing the canals and factories had immigrated from <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, escaping the poverty and Potato Famines of the 1830s and 1840s. The mill workers, young single women called Mill Girls, generally came from the farm families of <span class="loc">New England</span>.</p>
