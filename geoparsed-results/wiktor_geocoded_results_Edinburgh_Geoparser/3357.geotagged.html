<p><span class="loc">Saavedra</span> is a barrio (neighbourhood) of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. It is located in the Northern end of the city, close to <span class="loc">Belgrano</span> and <span class="loc">Villa Urquiza</span>. Its northern border is Avenida <span class="loc">General Paz</span>. Among the main features of the neighbourhood is the Parque <span class="loc">Saavedra</span> (English: <span class="loc">Saavedra</span> Park), which has large picnic areas and sports facilities. Many inhabitants of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> pass through <span class="loc">Saavedra</span> en route to their weekends in the country. The neighbourhood's most famous son is tango singer Roberto Goyeneche. Also, it was the cradle of Platense football club. The main characters of Adolfo Bioy Casares's novel El Sueño de los Héroes (English: Dream of Heroes) live in <span class="loc">Saavedra</span>. The interchange between the Pan-American Highway and Avenida <span class="loc">General Paz</span> is at <span class="loc">Saavedra</span>'s northern end. Points south were the site of extensive demolition during the late 1970s tenure of military-appointed Mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore, who planned a network of new expressways including one through <span class="loc">Saavedra</span>, one of the city's most residential barrios. Never built, the demolished stretch was converted into Avenida Roberto Goyeneche. <span class="loc">Saavedra</span> is also home to an important Philips manufacturing facility, as well as the Dot Baires Shopping Center, the city's largest.</p>
