The population was 5,590 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The Town of <span class="loc">Riga</span> is southwest of the <span class="loc">City of Rochester</span> on the western border of the county. Locally, the town's name is pronounced RYE-ga, instead of REE-ga like the capital of <span class="loc">Latvia</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.3 square miles (91 km2), of which, 35.2 square miles (91 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) of it (0.37%) is water. <span class="loc">Riga</span> is bordered on the north by the town of <span class="loc">Ogden</span>, on the east by the town of Chili, on the west by <span class="loc">Genesee County</span>, and on the south by <span class="loc">Genesee County</span> and the town of <span class="loc">Wheatland</span>. Interstate 490 crosses the town. In the 18th century, the lands of present day <span class="loc">Riga</span> were part of the "Mill Seat Tract" deeded by Native Americans to <span class="loc">Phelps</span> and <span class="loc">Gorham</span>. Soon thereafter, <span class="per">Robert Morris</span> of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> acquired the land and sold it to the <span class="per">Sir William Pultney</span>'s estate in <span class="loc">England</span>.</p><br><br>
