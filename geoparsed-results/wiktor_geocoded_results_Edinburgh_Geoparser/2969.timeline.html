  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Consolacion</span> is a first income class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Cebu</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It is about 12 1⁄2 kilometres (7.8 mi) from <span class="loc">Cebu City</span>, within Metro <span class="loc">Cebu</span>, and stretches some 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from north to south with 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) at its widest. <span class="loc">Consolacion</span> is bounded on the north by <span class="loc">Liloan</span>, <span class="loc">Cebu</span>, on the south by the <span class="loc">city of Mandaue</span>, on the west by the Mactan Channel and on the east by the <span class="loc">city of Cebu</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 106,649. In the <span class="date">2013</span> election, it had 62,960 registered voters. <span class="loc">Consolacion</span> comprises 21 barangays distributed over its 37 km2 (14.3 sq mi): <span class="loc">Consolacion</span> was a component barangay first founded in <span class="date">1871</span> with a population of 14,248. Before this, it was only a barrio of the municipality of <span class="loc">Mandaue</span>. <span class="loc">Consolacion</span> became a separate town in <span class="date">1871</span>. However, in <span class="date">1902</span> and <span class="date">1903</span>, unable to maintain its status as an independent municipality, it reverted to <span class="loc">Mandaue</span>. In <span class="date">1920</span>, <span class="loc">Consolacion</span> was again made an independent municipality after a petition was accepted by the governor. So grateful were the townspeople to the Spanish governor that they named their new town after his daughter – Consolacion – and they also chose <span class="loc">San Narciso</span> as their patron saint, the namesake of the governor's wife, <span class="per">Narcisa</span>.</p><br><br>
