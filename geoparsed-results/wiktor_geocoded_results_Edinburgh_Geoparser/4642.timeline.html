  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Walpole</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Cheshire County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,734 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town's central settlement, where 605 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Walpole</span> census-designated place (CDP), and is east of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 12. The town also includes the villages of <span class="loc">North Walpole</span> and <span class="loc">Drewsville</span>. The town was first granted in <span class="date">1736</span> by Colonial Governor <span class="per">Jonathan Belcher</span> of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> as Number 3, third in a line of <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> fort towns. It would be settled as early as <span class="date">1736</span>, and called <span class="loc">Great Falls</span> or <span class="loc">Lunenburg</span>. <span class="per">Colonel Benjamin Bellows</span>, for whom <span class="loc">Bellows Falls</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, is named, built a large fort here for defense against Indian attack. After the border between <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> was fixed (with Number 3 on the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> side of the line), the town was regranted by Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span> as Bellowstown, after its founder. It would be incorporated in <span class="date">1756</span>. The grant was renewed in <span class="date">1761</span>, when the town was renamed <span class="per">Walpole</span>, in honor of Sir <span class="per">Robert Walpole</span>, 1st <span class="per">Earl of Orford</span>, and first Prime Minister of <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>.</p><br><br>
