  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Catalina</span>, also known as the Vegetable Bowl of the North, is a fifth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the latest <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 13,597 people. With an area of 968 hectares (2,390 acres) it is the smallest municipality in the province and the only municipality in <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span> which has an urban status for all its barangays based on National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB). The feast of the town is celebrated every <span class="date">25th day of November</span> to celebrate the feast day of <span class="loc">Saint Catherine</span> of Alexandria (town's patron saint). When the Augustinians were busy with the Christianization of the <span class="loc">Ilocos Region</span>, a group of missionaries sailed westward through the river known as "<span class="loc">El Mestizo</span>" to the place <span class="date">now</span> called <span class="loc">Santa Catalina</span>. They were also looking for fresh water, since the area where he landed yielded only salty water. When they finally found a fresh water spring up north, and were busy quenching their thirst, some of them saw an image of a beautiful lady near the place where he drank, which disappeared after a few minutes. One of them recognized the image as that of <span class="loc">Saint Catherine</span> of Alexandria. The Augustinians returned to Villa <span class="loc">Fernandina</span> (<span class="loc">Vigan</span>) and reported this matter to their superiors. This resulted in the construction of a church in the town with <span class="loc">Saint Catherine</span> of Alexandria as the patron saint. It was also declared that <span class="loc">Santa Catalina</span> be the name of the town.</p><br><br>
