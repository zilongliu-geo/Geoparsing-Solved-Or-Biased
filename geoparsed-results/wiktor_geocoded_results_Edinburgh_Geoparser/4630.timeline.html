  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Savannah is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Savannah is located along <span class="loc">North Carolina Highway</span> 116 and <span class="loc">US</span> 441, south of <span class="loc">Dillsboro</span> and southeast of <span class="loc">Webster</span>. It has its own fire department, a community center, and a couple of businesses lining <span class="loc">US</span> 441 and NC 116, and little else except homes. Savannah Township was originally settled after the Indian Removal Act of <span class="date">1830</span>. The first settlers in the area were homesteaders, and they built their farmsteads in the valley and hills located in the area. The area has several cemeteries and churches, the origins of which go back to this period of time. The present church buildings are much more modern than the originals, though. The valley was formed over <span class="date">millions of years</span> by the erosive power of <span class="loc">Savannah Creek</span>, which flows north-west, following the course of <span class="loc">US</span> 441 and later NC 116 before emptying into the <span class="loc">Tuckasegee River</span> near <span class="loc">Webster</span>. The area was home to several small communities, some with their own school, store, community center, and post office. <span class="loc">Greens Creek</span>, Gay, Viewpoint, <span class="loc">Olivet</span>, and East Fork were the five communities that made up Savannah. In <span class="date">the 1920s</span>, new schools at <span class="loc">Greens Creek</span> and Gay opened, consolidating three one-room schools in each community. <span class="date">The 1920s</span> also led to the opening up of the <span class="org">Savannah Communities</span> to the outside world, via the two-lane paved <span class="loc">US</span> 441 built during the decade, near the present five-lane road. <span class="loc">US</span> 441 was a modern two-lane and paved highway from <span class="org">Franklin</span> to <span class="loc">Dillsboro</span> at the time.</p><br><br>
