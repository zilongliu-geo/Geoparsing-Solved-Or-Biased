<p><span class="loc">Soo</span> (曽於市, Soo-shi) is a city located in northeastern Kagoshima Prefecture, <span class="loc">Japan</span>. It is near Miyakonojō, <span class="loc">Miyazaki</span>. As of 2011, the city has an estimated population of 38,647 and a population density of 99 persons per km². This is down from the 2006 population data, which was an estimated population of 43,752 and a population density of 112 persons per km². The total area is 390.39 km². <span class="loc">Soo</span> is one of the many small cities in <span class="loc">Japan</span> that have a steadily decreasing population. Much of <span class="loc">Soo</span> is mountainous and covered with forest. It rains, but it rarely snows. <span class="loc">Soo</span> is located in <span class="loc">Kagoshima</span> so it also receives ash from its volcanoes, most notably: Shinmoedake and Sakurajima. <span class="loc">Soo</span> is a land-locked city and is in middle of the <span class="loc">Osumi</span> Peninsula. The modern <span class="loc">city of Soo</span> was established on July 1, 2005, from the merger of the towns of Ōsumi (Iwagawa), <span class="loc">Sueyoshi</span> and <span class="loc">Takarabe</span> (all from <span class="loc">Soo District</span>). All of <span class="loc">Soo</span> had a train system, but due to low use most of it was torn out and paved into a running path. There are three small un-manned train stations in <span class="loc">Takarabe</span> (Northern <span class="loc">Soo</span>) that connect to trains going to Miyazaki Prefecture and to <span class="loc">Kagoshima City</span>. They are: <span class="loc">Takarabe Station</span>, <span class="loc">Kitamata Station</span>, and Osumi-Okawara Station</p>
