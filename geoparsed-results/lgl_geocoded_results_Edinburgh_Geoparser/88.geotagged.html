<p>19-year-old killed in fiery crash. <span class="loc">EAST HAMPTON</span> â€” Police are investigating a fiery one-car crash early Thursday morning that took the life of 19-year-old Robert Kochuk of <span class="loc">East Hampton</span>. Police say Kochuk was driving south on North Main Street around 1:30 a.m. Thursday when he lost control of his Chevrolet S-10 pickup, veered off the left side of the road and struck a garbage can and a tree before the vehicle burst into flames. Kochuck, who did not have any passengers, was killed in the collision. Excessive speed seems to be a contributing factor in the crash, said Sgt. Michael Green of the <span class="loc">East Hampton Police</span> Department. Firefighters from the <span class="loc">East Hampton Volunteer Fire</span> Department extinguished the fire.</p>
