  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Democrats blast <span class="per">Bill McCollum</span>'s public service ads. <span class="org">Florida Attorney General</span> <span class="per">Bill McCollum</span> appears in nearly every frame of a 30-second, widely run commercial warning parents and children about sex offenders online. '' This ad needed a message. It needed a messenger,'' he said <span class="date">Thursday</span>. ``It couldn't be just done with words.'' But Gov. <span class="per">Charlie Crist</span> and Chief Financial Officer <span class="per">Alex Sink</span> -- whose public service announcements were nominated for regional Emmy awards <span class="date">last year</span> -- stayed out of the ads. And unlike <span class="per">McCollum</span>, a Republican who hired his <span class="date">2006</span> campaign media consultant to produce and air his ad, <span class="per">Crist</span> and <span class="per">Sink</span> sought competitive bids for the ad contracts. '' CFO Sink wanted to make sure Floridians were getting the best deal possible, so she required a competitive bidding process,'' said <span class="per">Kyra Jennings</span>, a spokeswoman for the Democratic officeholder. ``There's also a big distinction from the attorney general's ads in that they feature him so prominently.'' <span class="per">McCollum</span>'s $1.4 million media blitz has become a target for the <span class="org">Florida Democratic Party</span>, which says the ads cross the line from public service announcements into political commercials. Party spokesman <span class="per">Eric Jotkoff</span> singled out a $550 expenditure for makeup among the production costs. '' While the attorney general claims that this ad campaign was about promoting public safety, it shouldn't take a $550 makeup job in a vain attempt to make him look good politically,'' he said. <span class="per">McCollum</span> is expected to run for reelection in <span class="date">2010</span>, though he may run for governor if <span class="per">Crist</span> does not seek another term. Asked about the makeup after he did a cybercrime presentation at <span class="org">Westpine Middle School</span> in Sunrise, <span class="per">McCollum</span> said, ``I didn't know how much the makeup artist costs. It's a package . . . the makeup comes with it.'' In his most extensive comments on the ads since The Miami Herald wrote about them <span class="date">last week</span>, <span class="per">McCollum</span> emphasized that they were bought not with tax dollars, but with money from settlements with companies accused of hiding the costs of cellphone services. The ads run by <span class="per">Crist</span> and <span class="per">Sink</span> were funded with taxpayer money. <span class="per">McCollum</span> said he hired his former campaign consultant, <span class="per">Chris Mottola</span>, because the state's competitive bidding process was ''very slow, very complicated.'' He cited an exemption in state law that allows him to use a no-bid contract for ``artistic services.'' The ad shows <span class="per">McCollum</span> speaking directly to the camera about the dangers of Internet sex predators, with children walking school hallways and using a laptop in the background. '' The development of the ad is artistic. It's how you present it,'' <span class="per">McCollum</span> said. ``You got 30 seconds to be able to tell somebody something.'' The governor's ''Explore Adoption'' campaign <span class="date">last year</span> included five different television videos, including one featuring a boy with his adoptive father at the batting cages. The cost of producing and airing the videos, as well as related radio and billboard ads, was about $650,000. Sink's ''My Safe Florida Homes'' ads, which cost $1.06 million, show consumers on their computers applying for free hurricane inspections. For the attorney general's ads, <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>-based <span class="per">Mottola</span> received 10 percent of the cost of the television time, plus about $38,000 for production, according to <span class="per">McCollum</span>'s office. That means he earned about $136,000 on the deal -- more than the $87,511 he was paid by <span class="per">McCollum</span> during the <span class="date">2006</span> campaign. '' We felt as a team that we had the very best in the business to make this film at a very good price,'' <span class="per">McCollum</span> said. ```I would expect if we continue to run this ad we would probably use him again to make the buy.'' <span class="per">McCollum</span> has approval from the Florida Legislature to spend another $1.1 million in settlement cash on the cybercrime ad. It is currently airing in <span class="loc">South Florida</span> in English and Spanish, where it ran for part of <span class="date">January</span> and <span class="date">all of February</span>. It also ran for <span class="date">six weeks</span> over the <span class="date">summer</span> in <span class="loc">Tampa</span>, <span class="loc">Orlando</span>, <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span>, <span class="loc">Tallahassee</span>, <span class="loc">Pensacola</span>, <span class="loc">Panama City</span> and <span class="loc">Gainesville</span>. <span class="per">McCollum</span>'s office released an e-mail from a mother who said that until she saw the ad, she didn't know where to turn when her daughter received naked pictures on her cellphone. '' The good news is that we've gotten their attention,'' <span class="per">McCollum</span> said. ``I don't care if anyone wants to criticize the ad. It's been effective.''</p><br><br>
