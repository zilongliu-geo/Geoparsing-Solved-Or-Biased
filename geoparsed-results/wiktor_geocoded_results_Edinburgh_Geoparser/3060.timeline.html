  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Trenton is the capital city of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Mercer County</span>, as well as briefly the former capital of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city's metropolitan area is grouped with the <span class="loc">New York</span> metropolitan area by the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, but directly borders the <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> metropolitan area and is part of the Federal Communications Commission's <span class="org">Philadelphia Designated Market Area</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, Trenton had a population of 84,913, making it the state's 10th-largest municipality. The Census Bureau estimated that the city's population was 84,034 in <span class="date">2014</span>. Trenton dates back at least to <span class="date">June 3, 1719</span>, when mention was made of a constable being appointed for Trenton, while the area was still part of <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>. Boundaries were recorded for Trenton Township as of <span class="date">March 2, 1720</span>, a courthouse and jail were constructed in Trenton around <span class="date">1720</span> and the Freeholders of <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span> met annually in Trenton. Trenton became <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>'s capital as of <span class="date">November 25, 1790</span>, and the <span class="loc">City of Trenton</span> was formed within Trenton Township on <span class="date">November 13, 1792</span>. Trenton Township was incorporated as one of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>'s initial group of 104 townships by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on <span class="date">February 21, 1798</span>. On <span class="date">February 22, 1834</span>, portions of Trenton Township were taken to form <span class="loc">Ewing Township</span>. The remaining portion of Trenton Township was absorbed by the <span class="loc">City of Trenton</span> on <span class="date">April 10, 1837</span>. A series of annexations took place over a 50-year period, with the city absorbing <span class="loc">South Trenton</span> borough (<span class="date">April 14, 1851</span>), portions of Nottingham Township (<span class="date">April 14, 1856</span>), both the <span class="loc">Borough of Chambersburg Township and Millham Township</span> (both on <span class="date">March 30, 1888</span>), as well as <span class="loc">Wilbur Borough</span> (<span class="date">February 28, 1898</span>). Portions of <span class="loc">Ewing Township</span> and <span class="loc">Hamilton Township</span> were annexed to <span class="loc">Trenton</span> on <span class="date">March 23, 1900</span>.</p><br><br>
