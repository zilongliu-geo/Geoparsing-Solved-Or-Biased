  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Monterey</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,850 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the Cookeville, <span class="org">Tennessee Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. Around the beginning of the twentieth century, <span class="loc">Monterey</span> was a resort town that boasted seven hotels and drew <span class="date">summer</span> people who came to enjoy the cool temperatures and mountain scenery. With the invention of the automobile, <span class="loc">Monterey</span> became less of a resort town. The hotels closed and the town's economy became dependent on railroad maintenance, coal mining, and logging. The <span class="loc">Standing Stone</span> was a 13-foot (4.0 m)-tall rock that once stood upright on a sandstone ledge in the area. It was the legendary boundary between <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> and <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> territory and marked the <span class="loc">Cherokee Tallonteeskee</span> Trail. The 8-foot (2.4 m) remnant of this stone is preserved in <span class="loc">Monterey</span>, where a <span class="loc">Standing Stone</span> Celebration of Native <span class="loc">American Heritage</span> is held each <span class="date">October</span>. The red brick <span class="org">Monterey High School</span> building was torn down in <span class="date">early 2013</span>; a new high school is currently under construction where the old building stood. <span class="loc">Monterey</span> is located at 36°8′43″N 85°15′57″W (36.145291, -85.265757).</p><br><br>
