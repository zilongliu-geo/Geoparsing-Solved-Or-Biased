  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Newcastle</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,752 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The village of <span class="per">Newcastle</span> is located in the western part of the town, on the <span class="loc">Damariscotta River</span>. Together with the village of <span class="loc">Damariscotta</span> linked by the Main Street bridge, they form the Twin Villages (see Damariscotta-Newcastle CDP). Originally called <span class="loc">Sheepscot Plantation</span>, <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> was first settled in the 1630s by fishermen and around 50 families. Around 1649-50, <span class="per">John Mason</span> purchased a considerable tract of land from the sachems Chief <span class="per">Robinhood</span> and Chief Jack Pudding. The territory was claimed in <span class="date">1665</span> by the <span class="loc">Duke of York</span>. Renamed New Dartmouth, the plantation was attacked and destroyed in <span class="date">1676</span> during <span class="per">King Philip</span>'s War. When the war was over, some of the inhabitants returned. But it was destroyed again in <span class="date">1689</span> during <span class="per">King William</span>'s War, and the village was not reoccupied for <span class="date">about 40 years</span>. In <span class="date">1730</span>, <span class="per">Colonel David Dunbar</span>, the superintendent and governor of the <span class="loc">Province of Sagadahoc</span>, resettled it as <span class="per">Newcastle</span>, named in honor of the <span class="per">Duke of Newcastle</span>.</p><br><br>
