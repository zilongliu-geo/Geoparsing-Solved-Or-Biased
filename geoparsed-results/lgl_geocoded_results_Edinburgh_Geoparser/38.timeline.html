  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Arlington</span> woman ran framing shop, practiced Baha’i faith. <span class="per">ARLINGTON</span> — Jahan Nazarian was born into a Jewish family in western <span class="loc">Iran</span>’s <span class="loc">Kermanshah province</span> on <span class="date">May 2, 1923</span>. In her 20s, she married <span class="per">Noorallah Moayyad</span>, a man of the Baha’i faith, which advocates the unity of world religious and teaches that leaders such as <span class="per">Jesus, Muhammad</span> and Buddha were all divine prophets. After growing up Jewish, " she had to embrace Christianity and then embrace <span class="loc">Islam</span>, and she understood that religions come in succession and improve," said <span class="per">Ms. Moayyad</span>’s daughter-in-law <span class="per">Nadia Moayyad</span> of <span class="loc">Southlake</span>. <span class="per">Ms. Moayyad</span> died <span class="date">Saturday</span> of complications from a stroke. She was 85. After <span class="date">30 years</span> of raising a family and practicing Baha’i in <span class="loc">Iran</span>, <span class="loc">Ms.</span> <span class="per">Moayyad</span> and her husband moved to <span class="loc">North Texas</span> in <span class="date">1973</span>, <span class="per">Nadia Moayyad</span> said, in part to be near their five children, who were all living in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. None has been able to return since the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Khomeini supplanted the Shah of <span class="loc">Iran</span>. "All of the Baha’is had to leave <span class="loc">Iran</span> during the revolution because of the religious persecution," <span class="per">Nadia Moayyad</span> said. "We don’t know when we will ever go back until there is religious freedom and then respect for all faiths." <span class="per">Ms. Moayyad</span> spoke only French and <span class="loc">Farsi</span> when she moved to <span class="per">Arlington, Nadia</span> <span class="per">Moayyad</span> said. She soon learned English so she could get her driver’s license. The Moayyads started a business, U Frame It, in <span class="per">Arlington</span>. After her husband died in <span class="date">1992</span>, she allowed two grandchildren to take over the store, although she still worked there for <span class="date">several years</span>. "She was a very kind and loving lady," <span class="per">Nadia Moayyad</span> said. "I think her presence there was always felt with the customers." <span class="per">Ms. Moayyad</span>’s funeral will be observed by a family saddened by the loss but bolstered by the Baha’i belief that death is a new beginning. "It’s not a sad occasion," <span class="per">Nadia Moayyad</span> said. "It’s really a birth to a world where our soul is going to live eternally." Other survivors include sons Parviz <span class="per">Moayyad</span> of <span class="per">Houston, Edward</span> <span class="per">Moayyad</span> of <span class="loc">Southlake</span> and <span class="loc">Hamid</span> <span class="per">Moayyad</span> of <span class="loc">Colleyville</span>; daughters <span class="loc">Parvin</span> <span class="per">Davari</span> and <span class="per">Nasrin</span> Sadeghan, both of <span class="loc">California</span>; 13 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</p><br><br>
