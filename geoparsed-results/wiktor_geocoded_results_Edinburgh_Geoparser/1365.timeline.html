  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Concord</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,072 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The unincorporated community of <span class="org">Concord</span> is located in the town. The first non-Native American settlers in the region consisted entirely of settlers from <span class="loc">New England</span> as well as settlers from Upstate <span class="loc">New York</span> whose parents had moved to that region shortly after the American Revolution. These were "Yankee" settlers, meaning they were descended from the English Puritans who settled <span class="loc">New England</span> during the colonial era. They were primarily members of the <span class="per">Congregational Church</span> though due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before coming to what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>. The <span class="per">Congregational Church</span> subsequently has gone through many divisions and some factions are <span class="date">now</span> known as the Church of <span class="per">Christ</span>, <span class="per">United Church</span> of <span class="per">Christ</span> and <span class="per">Church</span> of God. When the <span class="loc">New England</span> settlers arrived in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="org">Concord</span> there was nothing but a dense virgin forest and wild prairie. New Englanders and <span class="loc">New England</span> transplants from Upstate <span class="loc">New York</span> were the vast majority of <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>'s inhabitants during <span class="date">the first several decades</span> of its history. As a result of this heritage <span class="org">Concord</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> was named after <span class="org">Concord</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. On <span class="date">February 1, 1860</span>, <span class="per">Charles Ingalls</span> married <span class="per">Caroline Quiner</span> in <span class="org">Concord</span>. Their daughter was <span class="per">Laura Ingalls Wilder</span>, author of the Little House on the Prairie books.</p><br><br>
