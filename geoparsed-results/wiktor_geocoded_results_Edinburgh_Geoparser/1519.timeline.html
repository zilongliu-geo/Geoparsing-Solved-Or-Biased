  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Easton is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">South Kesteven district</span> of <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is situated almost 2 miles (3.2 km) north from <span class="loc">Colsterworth</span>, and 1 mile (1.6 km) east from the A1 road. The village has no church, but is part of the North and <span class="loc">South Stoke</span> with <span class="loc">Easton Parish</span>, which contains the church of <span class="per">St Andrew</span> and <span class="per">St Mary</span> at <span class="loc">Stoke Rochford</span>, situated just inside Easton civil parish. The A1 within the parish was straightened when converted to a dual-carriageway in <span class="date">1960</span>. The village is still largely the same size as it was at the time of the Domesday Book. <span class="per">Sir Henry Cholmeley</span> bought the manor in <span class="date">1592</span>; his direct descendant <span class="per">Sir Montague Cholmeley</span> rebuilt the village in the early 19th century. <span class="loc">Easton Hall</span> was built by <span class="per">Sir Henry Cholmeley</span>, partly rebuilt in <span class="date">1805</span>, and enlarged in the Victorian period. It was damaged while being used by the army during the Second World War, and was pulled down in <span class="date">1951</span>. The 12 acres of gardens were abandoned in <span class="date">1951</span> but a major renovation project began in <span class="date">2001</span>. The <span class="per">Cholmeley</span> family still live in the village and are responsible for the <span class="date">2005</span> renovation of the hall's gardens.</p><br><br>
