<p><span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> (formerly Imelda) is a fifth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Romblon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> was known in Spanish times as <span class="loc">Cagbagacay</span>, after a bamboo plant called "bagacay" in the local dialect, which was in abundance in the area. Back then it was still a barrio of Guintigui-an town. In 1910, barrio <span class="loc">Cagbagacay</span> was renamed <span class="loc">Concepcion</span> after its patron the Immaculada <span class="loc">Concepcion</span>. On 12 September 1982, barrio <span class="loc">Concepcion</span> (<span class="loc">Norte</span>) together with barrios <span class="loc">Bonga</span> and <span class="loc">Concepcion Sur</span> were organized and created into a new municipality by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 234, authored by Assemblyman Nemesio Ganan Jr. The new municipality was named "Imelda", in honor of then First Lady Imelda Marcos, as well as to distinguish the town from <span class="loc">Concepcion</span> municipality on Maestro de Campo Island, also in <span class="loc">Romblon</span>. After the People Power Revolution in 1986 which toppled the regime of dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the town was renamed <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> on 17 April 1988 by virtue of Republic Act No. 6651, again in honor of its patron the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Three new barangays were added to the municipality: <span class="loc">San Isidro</span>, <span class="loc">Paroyhog</span>, and <span class="loc">Sto</span>. <span class="loc">Nino</span>.</p>
