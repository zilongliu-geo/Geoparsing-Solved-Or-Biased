<p><span class="loc">Norwood</span> is a town and census-designated place in <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Norwood</span> is part of the Greater Boston area. As of the 2010 census, the population was 30,602. The town was named after <span class="loc">Norwood</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Norwood</span> is on the <span class="loc">Neponset River</span>, which runs all the way to Boston Harbor from <span class="loc">Foxborough</span>. The Town of <span class="loc">Norwood</span>, officially formed in 1872, was until that time part of <span class="loc">Dedham</span>, known as the "mother of towns", as fourteen of the present communities of eastern <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> lay within its original borders. Long used as a hunting ground by Indians, <span class="loc">Norwood</span> was first settled by Ezra Morse in 1678. He set up a sawmill in what is now <span class="loc">South Norwood</span>, the part of town to which the first concentration of families, almost all of whom were farmers, migrated over the next half-century. During the American Revolution, there was a Minuteman company organized in the area. Its captain, Aaron Guild, on learning of the British marching on Lexington and Concord, to seize the munitions stored there, rode to join the fight and arrived in time to fire on the British at Concord Bridge and participate in the running battle that chased the Redcoats back to <span class="loc">Boston</span>.</p>
