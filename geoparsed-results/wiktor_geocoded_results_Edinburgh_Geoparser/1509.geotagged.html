<p>Livingston is a name sometimes applied to the northeastern portion of <span class="loc">West Brighton</span>, a neighborhood located on the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> of the New <span class="loc">York City</span> borough of <span class="loc">Staten Island</span>. While official boundaries do not exist for any designated places on <span class="loc">Staten Island</span>, <span class="loc">Livingston</span> is most commonly regarded as being enclosed by Bement Avenue on the west, the Kill Van Kull shoreline on the north, Henderson Avenue on the south, and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on the east. It is dominated by large, older homes built before 1900, and its streets are shaded by spreading oak and elm trees. One of the first Europeans to settle the area was Francis Lovelace, the second governor of the <span class="loc">New York</span> colony, who in 1668 started farming in the area that would become Livingston. The original name for the district was <span class="loc">Elliotville</span>, after a renowned ophthalmologist, Samuel MacKenzie Elliot, who by 1840 had acquired more than 30 homes in the community. The present name of Livingston was coined by officials of the <span class="loc">Staten Island</span> Railway who bought the mansion of resident Anson Livingston and then gave that name to a station built near the current intersection of <span class="loc">Richmond</span> Terrace and Bard Avenue. This station was situated on the now-defunct <span class="loc">North Shore</span> branch of the railway, on which passenger service ceased in 1953; the tracks on this branch are still there, but all traces of the Livingston station have been removed, as is the case with the two other former stations on either side (Sailors' Snug Harbor and <span class="loc">West Brighton</span>).</p>
