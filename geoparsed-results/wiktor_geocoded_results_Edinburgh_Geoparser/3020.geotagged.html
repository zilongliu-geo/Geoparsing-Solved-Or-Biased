<p>Stanton is a city located in <span class="loc">western Orange County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The population was 38,186 at the 2010 census, up from 37,403 at the 2000 census. The city was incorporated in 1956 and operates under the Council-Manager form of government, providing a full range of municipal services. Stanton is bounded by Cypress on the west, <span class="loc">Anaheim</span> on the north, and east, and Garden Grove on the east and south. On November 6, 1905, the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> Interurban Railway started service on the Santa Ana Line. It ran along an almost perfectly straight line between Watts and <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span>. Access to transportation allowed the population of the rural area which is now Stanton and <span class="loc">West Anaheim</span> to grow. In 1908, the privately owned Pacific Electric Railway leased the Santa Ana Line and took over the service which extended its regional light-rail system. By 1928, the impressive thousand mile system allowed residents convenient travel throughout <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and Orange Counties. See 1928 Map. The passenger service to <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> was discontinued in 1950, shortly after the railway was taken over by the Metropolitan Transportation Agency. The easement still runs through town and is empty or used for parking. It intersects Beach/Pacific and Cerritos/Western.</p>
