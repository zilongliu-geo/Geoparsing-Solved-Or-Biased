<p>Quincy (/ˈkwɪnsi/ KWIN-see), known as <span class="loc">Illinois</span>'s "<span class="loc">Gem City</span>," is a city on the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River and the county seat of <span class="loc">Adams County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census the city held a population of 40,633, up from 40,366 in 2000. During the 19th Century, Quincy was a thriving transportation center as riverboats and rail service linked the city to many destinations west and along the river. It was once <span class="loc">Illinois</span>' second-largest city, surpassing <span class="loc">Peoria</span> in 1870. The city holds several historic districts, including the Downtown Quincy Historic District and the South Side German Historic District showcasing the architecture of Quincy's many German immigrants from the late-19th century. Today, Quincy remains a prominent river city. It has been twice recognized as an <span class="loc">All-America City</span> and is a participant in the Tree City <span class="loc">USA</span> program. In the fall of 2010, Forbes Magazine listed Quincy as the eighth "Best Small City To Raise A Family." Quincy's location along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River has attracted settlers for centuries. The first known inhabitants to the region were of the Illiniwek tribe. Years later, following numerous incursions, the <span class="loc">Sauk</span>, <span class="loc">Fox</span> and <span class="loc">Kickapoo</span> also called the site home.</p>
