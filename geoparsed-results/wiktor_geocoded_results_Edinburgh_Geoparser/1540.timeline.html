  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Elizabeth is a statutory town which is the most populous municipality in <span class="loc">Elbert County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,358 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 1,434 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. According to records of the area, the first settler was a man named Peter I. Van Wormer in <span class="date">1859</span> on <span class="loc">Running Creek</span>, which <span class="date">today</span> runs through Elizabeth. Following him on his journey was pioneer and trapper <span class="per">Justin Marlow</span>. Aside from <span class="per">Marlow</span>, others followed establishing small ranches in the area that was then forested with ponderosa pines in an open glade-like habitat suitable for both ranching and timber operations. The <span class="org">Elbert County History</span> is not clear on when exactly the mill that eventually caused the formation of the town of Elizabeth was set up. It was apparently on the far north end of the land belonging to <span class="per">Thomas Phillips</span> (who settled in the area in <span class="date">1865</span>) and to the east of the creek to provide water to the steam engine. This first mill was wiped out in a flood and thereafter was reestablished by <span class="per">Alden Bassatt</span> on the west side of the creek near what is <span class="date">today</span> Main Street in Elizabeth. Thereafter it was sold to the <span class="org">Weber brothers</span> of <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and became known as the Weber Mill. <span class="per">P.P. Gomer</span> set up another mill operation in <span class="date">1860</span> or <span class="date">1861</span> to the north of the Weber operation on <span class="per">Leroy Evans</span>' Ranch.</p><br><br>
