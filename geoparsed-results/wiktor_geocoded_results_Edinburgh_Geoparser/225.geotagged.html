The city has a council-manager form of government. Its mayor is Patrick Moeller and the City Manager is Joshua Smith. Most of the city is in the <span class="loc">Hamilton City</span> School District. The industrial city is seeking to revitalize through the arts; it was officially declared the "<span class="loc">City of Sculpture</span>" in 2000. Its initiative has attracted many sculpture installations to the city, which founded the Pyramid Hill Sculpture Park. Hamilton, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, was founded by European Americans in 1791 as <span class="loc">Fort Hamilton</span> (named to honor Alexander Hamilton). The northwest frontier military fort was built to serve as a supply station for the troops of generals Arthur St. Clair and later Anthony Wayne. Their armies entered the <span class="loc">Miami</span> Valley to drive out the <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> and <span class="loc">Miami</span> during the Northwest Indian War of the 1790s. The Indians hoped to maintain their territory here, but, following the American Revolutionary War, the <span class="loc">United States</span> wanted to open it for European-American settlement and succeeded in pushing out the indigenous peoples.</p>
