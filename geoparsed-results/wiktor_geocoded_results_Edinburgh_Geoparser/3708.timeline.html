  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Surin</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Thailand</span>, capital of <span class="loc">Surin province</span>, 7005431000000000000♠431 km east-north-east of <span class="loc">Bangkok</span>. It is the site of the annual Surin Elephant Round-up. In <span class="date">2000</span>, <span class="loc">Surin</span> had a population of 41,582. <span class="loc">Surin</span> has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw). Winters are dry and warm. Temperatures rise until <span class="date">April</span>, which is hot with the average daily maximum at 35.9 °C (96.6 °F). The monsoon season runs from <span class="date">late April</span> through eary <span class="date">October</span>, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although <span class="date">nights</span> remain warm. The earliest known historical period is the Dvaravati. This was an Indian-based culture, which diffused through the north-east region of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Thailand</span>. <span class="org">Evidence</span> of this culture is found in <span class="loc">Surin region</span> dating to between the 7th to 11th <span class="date">centuries</span> CE. It was in this period that Buddhism became the dominant religion of the region. Following the Dvaravati period, the powerful Khmer Empire expanded its influence throughout what is <span class="date">now</span> the <span class="loc">southern Isan region</span> of <span class="loc">Thailand</span>. This period covers the 7th to 13th <span class="date">centuries</span> CE. <span class="loc">Surin</span> was an important part of the ancient Khmer empire. Temple ruins and a substantial ethnic Khmer minority remain part of <span class="loc">Surin</span>. Khmer stone inscriptions date from c. 600 CE. Over <span class="date">the next several centuries</span> a growing number of Khmer sites were constructed in the province, most notably Prasat Sikhoraphum. These sites would have formed part of the network of Khmer infrastructure centred on Prasat Phanom Rung.</p><br><br>
