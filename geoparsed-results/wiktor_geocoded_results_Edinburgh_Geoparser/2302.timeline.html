  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Billings (Russian: Би́ллингс) is a rural locality (a selo) in <span class="loc">Iultinsky District</span> of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, <span class="loc">Russia</span>. Population: 211 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census);  Municipally, it is incorporated as Billings Rural Settlement in Chaunsky Municipal District. Like <span class="loc">Mys Shmidta</span>, Billings is named after a nearby cape, which in turn was named after British Captain <span class="per">Joseph Billings</span> (<span class="date">1758</span>—<span class="date">1806</span>) who was at the service of the Russian <span class="org">Imperial</span> Navy during Catherine the Great's reign. The cape itself marks the point of separation between the <span class="loc">Chukchi Sea</span> and the <span class="loc">East Siberian Sea</span>. <span class="per">Joseph Billings</span> was an English-born member of the Russian navy who in <span class="date">1785</span>, together with <span class="per">C. G. Sarychevym</span>, was part of the expedition that mapped and researched the coast of North-Eastern <span class="loc">Siberia</span>. Using reindeer, he crossed <span class="loc">Chukotka</span> as far as <span class="loc">Kolyuchinskaya Guba</span> and mapped the area. The local Chukchi people originally called the place "Valkyran", meaning a dugout of whale jaws. This is in reference to the remains of an ancient Inuit camp consisting of a number of homes dug into the soil and constructed of wood and the bones of the <span class="loc">Greenland</span> whale.</p><br><br>
