  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cervantes</span> is a fourth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 16,573 people. The municipality is officially the <span class="date">Summer</span> Capital of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>. It has a relatively cooler climate than most of lowland <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span> due to its geographical location and proximity to <span class="loc">Mountain Province</span> and <span class="loc">Benguet</span>. The municipality is home to the Bessang Pass Natural Monument. Municipality of <span class="loc">Cervantes</span> lies along the Southeastern tip of the province. It is bounded by the Municipalities of <span class="loc">Mankayan</span> and <span class="loc">Bakun</span> (<span class="loc">Benguet</span>) on the South; by <span class="loc">Alilem</span> (<span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>) on the Southeast, by <span class="loc">Suyo</span> and <span class="loc">Sigay</span> (<span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>) on the West; by <span class="loc">Gregorio del Pilar</span> (<span class="loc">Concepcion</span>) on the <span class="per">Northwest</span> and <span class="per">Quirino</span> (Angaki) on the North; and by <span class="loc">Tadian</span> (<span class="loc">Mt. Province</span>) on the East. It is cut Southwesterly by the biggest and longest river in the area, the <span class="loc">Abra River</span>. It is almost isolated from the rest of <span class="loc">Ilocos Region</span> due to its location and natural barriers. It could be reached from <span class="loc">Metro Manila</span> in two (2) ways. One way is by a 3-4 hour mini-bus ride through Cervantes-Tagudin Road, after a 5-6 hour bus ride from <span class="loc">Metro Manila</span>, via the City of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> (<span class="loc">La Union</span>). The other is by the lengthy but reasonably wide <span class="loc">Cervantes</span>- Baguio Road, which could take about 4–5 hours of bus ride from the beautiful <span class="loc">City of Baguio</span>, after some 6–7 hours of bus ride from Manila.</p><br><br>
