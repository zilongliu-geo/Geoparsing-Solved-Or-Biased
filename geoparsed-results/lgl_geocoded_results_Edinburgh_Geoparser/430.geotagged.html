<p>Kaine signs legislation to allow ‘Choose Life’ license plates. Gov. Timothy M. Kaine has signed legislation to permit "Choose Life" license plates. Virginia joins 23 other states that offer the plate -- some after lengthy court battles. Kaine's predecessor as governor, fellow Democrat Mark R. Warner, vetoed legislation to allow such a license plate in 2003. "I sign this legislation today in keeping with the commonwealth's longtime practice of approving special plates with all manner of political and social messages," Kaine said in a statement. "Furthermore, if Planned Parenthood -- an organization that is already a recipient of state budget funds -- or another similar organization ever chooses to seek a specialty license plate in Virginia, I believe the constitution would require the state to approve that plate to protect against any viewpoint discrimination." Sen. Ken Cuccinelli, R-Fairfax, attached the proposal onto a bill that also adds plates honoring the Washington Capitals, the Blue Ridge Parkway and others to the 200 specialty plates the Department of Motor Vehicles already offers. Under law, more than 350 people must sign up for a plate before DMV can produce it. Cuccinelli said 450 people have prepaid for the plate. After the first 1,000 plates are sold, $15 of the $25 fee would go to crisis pregnancy centers.</p>
