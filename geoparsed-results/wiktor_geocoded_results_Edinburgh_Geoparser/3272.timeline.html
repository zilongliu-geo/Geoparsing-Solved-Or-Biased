The town lies 200 metres (660 ft) above sea level. It is a small town servicing a mainly dairy farming region. Although close to <span class="loc">New Plymouth</span>, the town has the usual stores and services for town and country. <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> was named by <span class="per">Philip Colin Threkeld</span> for <span class="loc">Inglewood Forest</span> in <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. The settlement was founded in <span class="date">1873</span>, and its name rapidly progressed from Moatown to Milton, before being renamed to <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> in <span class="date">1875</span> to avoid confusion with Milton in the <span class="loc">South Island</span>. A number of buildings are listed by the <span class="org">New Zealand Historic Places Trust</span>. Of those, the Railway Station and Yard is the only one listed as Category I. The Shoe Store Building on the corner of <span class="loc">Rata</span> and <span class="loc">Richmond Streets</span> is one of eight listed as Category II.</p><br><br>
