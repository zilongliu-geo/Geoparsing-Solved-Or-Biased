<p><span class="loc">Croydon</span> is an inner northern suburb of Adelaide, <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is located in the City of Charles Sturt. The land on which the suburb now stands was purchased in 1853 by Alfred Watts and Philip Levi. They laid out the Village of <span class="loc">Croydon</span> in 1855, comprising <span class="loc">Croydon Farm</span> of 40 acres (16 ha) and lots of up to 5 acres (2.0 ha). The village may have been named for <span class="loc">Croydon</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, then a part of <span class="loc">Surrey</span>, the same county in which Levi had been born. <span class="loc">Croydon</span> lies on the western side of South Road, in the section between Port Road and Torrens Road. It is a small inner western suburb of Adelaide. The 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 1,350 persons in <span class="loc">Croydon</span> on census night. Of these, 50.1% were male and 49.9% were female. The majority of residents (66.6%) are of Australian birth, with other common census responses being <span class="loc">Italy</span> (7.4%), <span class="loc">Greece</span> (5.9%) and <span class="loc">England</span> (2.2%). The age distribution of <span class="loc">Croydon</span> residents is similar to that of the greater Australian population. 69.5% of residents were over 25 years in 2006, compared to the Australian average of 66.5%; and 30.5% were younger than 25 years, compared to the Australian average of 33.5%.</p>
