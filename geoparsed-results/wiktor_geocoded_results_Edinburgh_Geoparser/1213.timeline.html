  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Bedford</span> is a suburban community of <span class="loc">Halifax</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It was an independent town from <span class="date">1980</span>-<span class="date">1996</span>. <span class="loc">Bedford</span> lies on the northwestern end of <span class="loc">Bedford Basin</span>, an extension of the <span class="loc">Halifax Harbour</span> and ends just before <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> Highway 102 and Bedford Bypass next to <span class="per">Lower Sackville</span> . <span class="loc">Bedford</span> is located at the junctions of Trunks 1, 2, and 7. <span class="org">Father Le Loutre's War</span> began when <span class="per">Edward Cornwallis</span> arrived to establish <span class="loc">Halifax</span> with 13 transports on <span class="date">June 21, 1749</span>. By unilaterally establishing <span class="loc">Halifax</span> the British were violating earlier treaties with the Mi'kmaq (<span class="date">1726</span>), which were signed after Father Rale's War. The British quickly began to build other settlements. To guard against Mi'kmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in <span class="loc">Halifax</span> (<span class="date">1749</span>), <span class="loc">Bedford</span> (<span class="per">Fort Sackville</span>) (<span class="date">1749</span>), <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> (<span class="date">1750</span>), <span class="loc">Lunenburg</span> (<span class="date">1753</span>) and <span class="loc">Lawrencetown</span> (<span class="date">1754</span>). The history of <span class="loc">Bedford</span> began when Governor <span class="per">Edward Cornwallis</span> organised his men and began the construction of a road leading to <span class="loc">Minas Basin</span> on the <span class="loc">Bay of Fundy</span> after establishing the garrison at <span class="loc">Halifax</span>. To protect it, he hired <span class="per">John Gorham</span> and his Rangers to erect a fort on the shore of <span class="loc">Bedford Basin</span>. It was named <span class="per">Fort Sackville</span> after <span class="per">Lionel Sackville</span>, 1st <span class="per">Duke of Dorset</span>. The area around the fort became known as <span class="per">Sackville</span> until the mid-1850s when it became <span class="loc">Bedford</span>.</p><br><br>
