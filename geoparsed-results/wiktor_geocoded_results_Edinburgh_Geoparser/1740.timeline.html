The <span class="loc">city of Lafayette</span> is the fourth-largest in the state, with a population of 120,623 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The combined statistical area of <span class="loc">Lafayette–Opelousas-Morgan City</span> was 611,774 according to 2012 estimates. <span class="per">Lafayette</span> is the parish seat of <span class="loc">Lafayette Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>.

The American city was founded as <span class="loc">Vermilionville</span> in <span class="date">1821</span> by <span class="per">Jean Mouton</span>, a French-speaking man of Acadian descent. In <span class="date">1884</span>, it was renamed for <span class="per">General Lafayette</span>, who fought with and significantly aided the American Army during the American Revolutionary War.

There is also a strong <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> Creole influence in the area.</p><br><br>
