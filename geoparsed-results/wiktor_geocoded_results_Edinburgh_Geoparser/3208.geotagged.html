<p>Warren is a town in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,705 at the 2010 census. The center of population of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> is located in Warren. It is set between the two ranges of the <span class="loc">Green Mountains</span>, with approximately 25% of the town under <span class="loc">Green Mountain National Forest</span> ownership. Sugarbush Resort located here is a ski resort, and the town is traversed by the Long Trail, a hiking trail running from the Massachusetts border to the Canadian border. Granted on November 9, 1780, Warren was chartered on October 20, 1789, to John Throop and 67 others. It was named for Dr. Joseph Warren, Revolutionary War patriot. The first settlers, Samuel Lard and Seth <span class="loc">Leavitt</span>, arrived in 1797. Mills were built on the <span class="loc">Mad River</span> to grind grain or manufacture lumber and clapboards. On the fertile intervales, farmers grew hay. By 1839, when the town's population was 766, cattle and about 4000 sheep grazed the hills. Milk and maple syrup were important goods. A ski resort was developed here in the 20th century. It began in the late 1930s with the first ski tow established in the <span class="loc">Mad River</span> Valley, erected by the Warren Outing Club. In 1958, Damon Gadd and Jack Murphy founded Sugarbush Ski Area on the northeast side of Lincoln Peak. A three-seat gondola was installed, at that time the nation's longest lift, which had been manufactured in <span class="loc">Italy</span>. Eventually this evolved into what is today Sugarbush Resort.</p>
