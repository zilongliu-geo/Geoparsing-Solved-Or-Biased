<p><span class="loc">Minot</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Androscoggin County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,607 at the 2010 census. The town includes the villages of <span class="loc">West Minot</span> and <span class="loc">Minot</span> Center. It is part of both the Lewiston-Auburn, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> statistical area and the Lewiston-Auburn, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> <span class="loc">New England</span> city and town area. Present-day <span class="loc">Minot</span> was part of Bakerstown Plantation, granted in 1765 by the Massachusetts General Court to Captain Thomas Baker and his company of soldiers for their services to the state at the 1690 Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. It replaced a 1736 grant at what is now <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, ruled invalid in 1741 because of a prior claim from the descendants of John Mason. In 1795, Bakerstown Plantation was incorporated as <span class="loc">Poland</span>, named after Chief Poland, a noted local Indian sachem. On February 18, 1802, the northeastern part of <span class="loc">Poland</span> was set off as <span class="loc">Minot</span>, named after George Richards <span class="loc">Minot</span> (judge) (1758â€“1802), historian and judge of the General Court who had aided in the town's incorporation. The first settler was Moses Emery from <span class="loc">Newbury</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in 1772. At that time there were several Indians of the Anasagunticook tribe living in the immediate area. The surface of the town is uneven, in some parts hilly, but with good soil for agriculture, the principal early occupation. Mills were erected at various water power sites, and products included lumber, clapboards, shingles, boxes, shooks and barrel staves. There was also manufacturing in leather, particularly boots, shoes, saddles and harnesses. In 1842, land was set off to form Auburn, to which more land was ceded in 1873. <span class="loc">Mechanic Falls</span>, the industrial village astride the border with <span class="loc">Poland</span>, was set off in 1893. The population in 1859 was 1,734. Today, <span class="loc">Minot</span> is gradually transitioning into a bedroom community of the <span class="loc">cities of Auburn and Lewiston</span>.</p>
