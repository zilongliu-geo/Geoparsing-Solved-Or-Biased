  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>With 186,000 cases of Chikungunya, a viral fever, on the island of Réunion, nearly one quarter of the population of that French overseas département has officially been affected since <span class="date">Mar. 2005</span>. The epidemic has gotten markedly worse in <span class="date">the past few months</span>, with the worst point being 45,000 new cases in the week from <span class="date">Jan. 30</span> to <span class="date">Feb. 5</span>. The Prime Minister <span class="per">Dominique de Villepin</span> has stated on <span class="date">Wednesday</span> (<span class="date">Mar. 1</span>) that "Nine out of ten patients were struck since <span class="date">the beginning of the year</span>. No one could have anticipated the progression of it." The virus is also present in the <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span> in <span class="loc">Seychelles</span>, in Mauritious and especially in <span class="loc">Mayotte</span>, where the line of 2000 cases would have been crossed, according to <span class="per">Xavier Bertrand</span>, minister of <span class="org">French Health</span>. That represents a doubling in <span class="date">10 days</span>. According to Philippe Renault, medical epidemiologist of the <span class="loc">CIRE</span> (Regional Epidemiological Intervention Center of the Rhône-Alpes), the propagation of the epidemic will show the first signs of stabilization, at a very high level. He urged against drawing hasty conclusions, however. "An infectious disease can reach a plateau, then start again. It is necessary to wait until the decrease is clear on all the indicators."</p><br><br>
