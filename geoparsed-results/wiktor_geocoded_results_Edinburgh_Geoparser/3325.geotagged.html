<p>Paradise was a small town in <span class="loc">Muhlenberg County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town was located 10.5 miles east-north-east of <span class="loc">Greenville</span> and was formerly called Stom's Landing (sometimes incorrectly spelled Stum). It was once a trading post along the <span class="loc">Green River</span>, but it no longer exists. It was torn down in 1967 by the Tennessee Valley Authority due to health concerns over its proximity to a nearby coal-burning electric plant, Paradise Fossil Plant. Paradise was settled in the early nineteenth century when it was known as Stom's Landing, for Leonard Stom who founded the ferry there. It may have once been named <span class="loc">Monterey</span>. The origin of its final name of Paradise is not known. It is postulated the name was descriptive, for settlers who considered the setting to be paradise. A post office was established at Paradise on March 1, 1852; it closed in 1967. In 1959, the TVA built a coal plant at the former site of Paradise. The coal-fired plants remain controversial and the Paradise permits in particular, have been criticized by environmentalists for non-compliance with the Clean Air Act. Since construction of new scrubbers on Unit 3 at Paradise, the plant's emissions from the massive unit have dropped dramatically in recent years; this in turn has led to a dramatic drop in toxic emissions from the plant overall.</p>
