  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mir</span> (Belarusian: Мір; Russian: Мир; both meaning "world" and "peace"; but the name most likely originates from the name of the river the settlement is situated on) is an urban settlement in Kareličy (Карэлічы) raion, Hrodna Voblast, <span class="loc">Belarus</span> (53°27′N 26°28′E) on the banks of <span class="loc">Miranka</span> River, about 85 kilometers southwest of the national capital, <span class="loc">Minsk</span>. Prior to <span class="date">1939</span> the town was in <span class="loc">Poland</span>. Mir village was founded sometime prior to <span class="date">1345</span>. It is home to a late medieval castle, which made the town the target of many attacks over the <span class="date">centuries</span>. The town belonged to the Illinicz family (Korczak coat of arms) first and then to the Radziwiłł family. It was destroyed by the Swedish forces in <span class="date">1655</span> (Deluge) and again by the Swedes during the Great <span class="org">Northern War</span> in <span class="date">1706</span>. In <span class="date">1792</span>, the Lithuanian division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth army under <span class="per">Józef Judycki</span> was routed by the invading <span class="org">Imperial</span> Russian army corps under Boris Mellin (see Battle of <span class="loc">Mir</span>). During the Napoleonic invasion of <span class="loc">Russia</span> in <span class="date">1812</span>, Russian <span class="org">Imperial</span> cavalry, artillery and cossack regiments ambushed and routed the Duchy of <span class="loc">Warsaw</span> 3 uhlan divisions (Battle of <span class="loc">Mir</span> (<span class="date">1812</span>)). The retreating Russians, withdrawing east, abandoned the town and dynamited the castle. During the Middle Ages it was first located in the Principality of <span class="loc">Polotsk</span>, after the Battle on the river Nemiga in the Principality of <span class="loc">Minsk</span>, then was taken over by Kievan <span class="loc">Rus</span>' but after the Mongol Invasion the <span class="loc">Rus</span>' rule diminished and since <span class="date">1242</span> <span class="loc">Mir</span> belonged to the expanding and dynamic Duchy of <span class="loc">Lithuania</span>.</p><br><br>
