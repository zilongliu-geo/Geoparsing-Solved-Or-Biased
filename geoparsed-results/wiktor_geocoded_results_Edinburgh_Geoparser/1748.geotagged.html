<p>Meridian is the sixth largest city in the state of <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Lauderdale County</span> and the principal city of the Meridian, Mississippi Micropolitan Statistical Area. Along major highways, the city is 93 mi (150 km) east of Jackson, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>; 154 mi (248 km) <span class="loc">west of Birmingham</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>; 202 mi (325 km) northeast of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>; and 231 mi (372 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Memphis</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. Established in 1860 at the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and Southern Railway of <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, Meridian's economy was built on the railways and goods transported on them. It became a strategic trading center. During the American Civil War, much of the city was burned to the ground by General William Tecumseh Sherman in the Battle of Meridian. Rebuilt after the war, the city entered a "<span class="loc">Golden Age</span>", becoming the largest city in <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> between 1890 and 1930 and a leading center for manufacturing in the South. It had 44 trains coming in and out daily. Union Station, built in 1906, is now a multi-modal center, giving access to the Meridian Transit System, Greyhound Buses, and Trailways, averaging 242,360 passengers per year. Although the economy slowed with the decline of the railroad industry, the city has diversified, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people in 2010. The population within the city limits, according to 2008 census estimates, is 38,232, but a population of 232,900 in a 45-mile (72 km) radius and 526,500 in a 65-mile (105 km) radius, of which 104,600 and 234,200 people respectively are in the labor force, feed the economy of the city.</p>
