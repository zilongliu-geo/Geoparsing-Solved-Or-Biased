  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Seaside is a city in <span class="loc">Clatsop County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The name Seaside is derived from Seaside House, a historic <span class="date">summer</span> resort built in the 1870s by railroad magnate <span class="per">Ben Holladay</span>. The city's population was 6,457 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. About <span class="date">January 1, 1806</span>, a group of men from the <span class="per">Lewis</span> and <span class="per">Clark</span> Expedition built a salt-making cairn at the present site of Seaside. The Native American name for the Clatsop village near the cairn was Ne-co-tat. The city was incorporated on <span class="date">February 17, 1899</span>. In <span class="date">1912</span>, <span class="per">Alexandre Gilbert</span> (<span class="date">1843</span>â€“<span class="date">1932</span>) was elected <span class="org">Mayor of Seaside</span>. <span class="per">Gilbert</span> was a French immigrant, a veteran of the <span class="org">Franco Prussian War</span>. After living in <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> and <span class="loc">Astoria</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="per">Gilbert</span> moved to Seaside where he had a beach cottage (built in <span class="date">1885</span>). <span class="per">Gilbert</span> was a real estate developer who donated land to <span class="org">the City of Seaside</span> for its one and a half mile long Promenade, or "Prom," along the Pacific beach. In <span class="date">1892</span> he added to his beach cottage. The <span class="org">Gilbert House</span>, since the mid-1980s operated commercially as the <span class="per">Gilbert</span> Inn, still stands at Beach Drive and A Avenue. <span class="per">Gilbert</span>'s "<span class="per">Gilbert</span> Block" office building on <span class="loc">Broadway</span> also survives.</p><br><br>
