<p>Aurora (/əˈrɔərə/, /əˈrɔːrə/) is a Home Rule Municipality in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, spanning <span class="loc">Arapahoe</span> and <span class="loc">Adams</span> counties, with the extreme southeastern portion of the city extending into <span class="loc">Douglas County</span>. Aurora is one of the principal cities of the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area (Metro Denver). The city's population was 325,078 in the 2010 census, which made it the third most populous city in the state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span> and the 54th most populous city in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area had an estimated population of 2,645,209 on July 1, 2012 (the 21st most populous MSA in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>). However, Denver and Aurora combined make up less than half of the Denver Metro Area's population and Aurora has approximately half the population of Denver. The estimated population of Denver-Aurora, CO Combined Statistical Area was 3,214,218 on July 1, 2012 (16th most populous CSA). Aurora originated in the 1880s as the town of Fletcher, taking its name from Denver businessman Donald Fletcher who saw it as a real estate opportunity. He and his partners staked out four square miles east of <span class="loc">Denver</span>, but the town - and <span class="loc">Colorado</span> - struggled mightily after the Silver Crash of 1893. At that point Fletcher skipped town, leaving the community with a huge water debt. Inhabitants decided to rename the town Aurora in 1907, after one of the subdivisions composing the town, and Aurora slowly began to grow in Denver's shadow becoming the fastest-growing city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Aurora is composed of hundreds of subdivisions thus carries the name of one of the original development plats from which it sprang.</p>
