  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Stanton</span> is a small village situated at the eastern end of the <span class="loc">Weaver Hills</span>, <span class="loc">Staffordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="org">Stanton</span> is located 146 miles (235.0 km) north-west of <span class="loc">London</span> and 18.4 miles (29.6 km) east of <span class="loc">Stoke-on-Trent</span>.
