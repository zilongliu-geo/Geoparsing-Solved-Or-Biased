<p><span class="loc">Newcastle</span> is a Canadian urban neighbourhood in the <span class="loc">city of Miramichi</span>, <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span>. Prior to municipal amalgamation in 1995, it was an incorporated town and the shire town of <span class="loc">Northumberland County</span>. Situated on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Miramichi River</span>, the former town is sometimes referred to as <span class="loc">Miramichi</span> West. Being a former shire town, <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> is the location of several government offices and the county court house. It was an important transportation centre as it was located at the head of navigation on the <span class="loc">Miramichi River</span> and had wharves for the export of lumber and other forest products. During the mid-1870s the Intercolonial Railway was built through the town, placing it on the mainline between <span class="loc">Halifax</span> and <span class="loc">Montreal</span>. The town's most prosperous days are considered to be the years prior to World War I. It later reached a peak population of about 6,500. <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> was first settled by Scottish settlers, led by William Davidson (lumberman) in the late 18th century, and was originally called <span class="loc">Miramichi</span>. Early settlers changed the name due to pronunciation and spelling troubles. Throughout its history, the town's economy was largely based around the forest industry. A shipbuilding industry developed in the area during the late 18th century, largely to facilitate overseas lumber exports, including masts for the British navy. The Great <span class="loc">Miramichi</span> Fire of 1825, the advent of steel-hulled ships, and perhaps over-cutting of <span class="loc">White Pine</span>, contributed to a long-term decline in the town's econonomy. Pulp and paper production eventually replaced lumber exports as the mainstay of the town's economy. <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> remained the industrial heart of the <span class="loc">Miramichi</span> valley, its large pulp and paper mill employing hundreds.</p>
