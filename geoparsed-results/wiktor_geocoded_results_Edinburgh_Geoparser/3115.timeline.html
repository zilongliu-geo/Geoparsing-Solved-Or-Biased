  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Camden is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Ouachita County</span> in the southern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. Long an area of Native-American villages, the French also made a permanent settlement here because of its advantageous location above the <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> River. In <span class="date">2000</span>, Camden had a population of 13,154, but it lost 7.4 percent of its residents and recorded 12,183 in <span class="date">2010</span>. The municipality in <span class="date">2010</span> was 56 percent African American. Camden is the principal city of the <span class="org">Camden Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which includes all of <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> and <span class="loc">Calhoun</span> counties. Indigenous peoples of various cultures had lived along the rivers of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> for <span class="date">thousands of years</span> and created complex societies. Mississippian culture peoples built massive earthwork mounds along the <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> River beginning about <span class="date">1000 AD</span>. In <span class="date">1783</span>, this area was part of New <span class="loc">France</span>. A French trader named <span class="loc">Fabre</span> settled on a bluff above the <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> River and called the settlement Ã‰core <span class="loc">Fabre</span> (Faber's Bluff). This was the first European permanent settlement of what would become Camden. He traded with the <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> and other American Indians who inhabited the area.</p><br><br>
