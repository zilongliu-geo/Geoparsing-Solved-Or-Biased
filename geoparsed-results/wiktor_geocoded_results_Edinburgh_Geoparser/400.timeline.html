  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lincoln</span> is a city in the province of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> in <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. It is the capital of the <span class="loc">district of Lincoln</span> (<span class="per">Lincoln Partido</span>). The <span class="loc">district of Lincoln</span> was established on <span class="date">July 19, 1865</span>, during a redistricting of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> Province. The first settlement of the <span class="loc">city of Lincoln</span> occurred in <span class="date">1871</span>. The name <span class="per">Lincoln</span> was chosen as a tribute to the recently assassinated <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span>, 16th President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> (<span class="date">1861</span> to <span class="date">1865</span>), and enactor of the Emancipation Proclamation. <span class="per">Lincoln</span>'s economy is dominated by agriculture. The main crops are wheat, maize, soy and sunflowers. The district is home to around 500,000 cows and is responsible for 10% of <span class="loc">Argentina</span>'s honey production. Bees are bred and nourished as champions to compete in international honey producing competitions. Carnivals held in <span class="per">Lincoln</span> are the main tourist attraction, featuring carrozas, cabezudos, mechanical attractions and a non-stop music and general party ambience. Recently, the city hosts as well the <span class="per">Lincoln</span> Rock Festival. Both events contribute to the arrival of the so-called turistas gasoleros (inexpensive tourism).</p><br><br>
