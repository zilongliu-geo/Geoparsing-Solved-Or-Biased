<p><span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 336,463, making it the fourth-most populous county in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Chattanooga</span>. The county was named for Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Chattanooga</span>, <span class="loc">TN-GA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> was formed on October 25, 1819 from portions of <span class="loc">Rhea County</span> and Indian land. It was named after Alexander Hamilton, an officer in the American Revolutionary War, member of the Continental Congress, the first <span class="loc">US</span> Secretary of Treasury, and one of the founding fathers of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> was the site of an important saltpeter mine during the Civil War. <span class="loc">Saltpeter</span> is the main ingredient of gunpowder and was obtained by leaching the earth from caves. Lookout Mountain Cave was a major source of saltpeter during the Civil War. The mine was operated by Robert Cravens, who owned the property where the cave is located. In May 1861, Cravens contracted with the Tennessee Military and Financial Board to deliver 20,000 pounds of saltpeter. On the 24th of the same month, he reported that he had ten hoppers already set up in his cave. Cravens was also mining <span class="loc">Nickajack</span> Cave in nearby <span class="loc">Marion County</span>. In 1862 he quit mining at Lookout Mountain Cave and rented the cave to the Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau, which mined the cave from June 1862 through July 1863. Mining ceased when <span class="loc">Chattanooga</span> was occupied by Federal forces in 1863.</p>
