  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The <span class="loc">United States Department of Agriculture</span> has announced that 5 out of 11 wild migratory Green-winged Teals have tested positive for a "low pathogenic sub type" of the H5 and N1 Avian Flu virus or Bird Flu virus, but also say that this is not the same type of Avian Flu that has killed over 150 people worldwide and that the detection poses "no threat to humans." "Initial tests confirm that these wild duck samples do not contain the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain that has spread through birds in <span class="loc">Asia</span>, <span class="loc">Europe</span> and <span class="loc">Africa</span>. These samples were collected from apparently healthy birds and initial test results indicate the presence of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus, which poses no threat to human health," said the USDA in a statement on its website. Samples from the ducks were retrieved on <span class="date">September 24, 2006</span> and were found in the <span class="loc">Rice Lake</span> area of <span class="loc">Fulton County</span> located in <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The USDA and the <span class="org">Illinois Department of Natural Resources</span> tested the samples as part of a Bird Flu monitoring program. The USDA also says that they do not expect to find any "additional cases of common strains of avian influenza in birds." "These strains of the virus include LPAI H5N1, commonly referred to as "North American" H5N1, which is very different from the more severe HPAI H5N1 circulating overseas," said the statement. The ducks are not believed to be infected with the deadly H5N1 virus, but officials say both subtypes H5 and N1 have been found in the samples.</p><br><br>
