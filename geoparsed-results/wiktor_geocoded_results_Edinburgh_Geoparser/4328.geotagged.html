<p><span class="loc">Nashville</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Lowndes County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located 1.4 mi (2.3 km) west of the Alabama state line, on the east bank of the <span class="loc">Tombigbee</span> River, <span class="loc">Nashville</span> was once an important shipping port and river crossing location. The site was settled by Daniel Young, a blacksmith, in 1824, and the place became known as "Young's Bluff". In 1833, a road was constructed west from Young's Bluff to intersect the Robinson Road (which connected the <span class="loc">cities of Columbus</span>, Jackson, and <span class="loc">Natchez</span>, and is the second oldest road in <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>), and another was constructed east into <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. Road traffic passed through the community and then crossed the river on a ferry owned by Young. Another early settler, <span class="loc">Nimrod</span> N. Nash, opened a store there, and then purchased Young's property in 1834. He renamed the town "<span class="loc">Nashville</span>", and sold lots to settlers. In addition to the successful ferry service, <span class="loc">Nashville</span>'s stores supplied local farmers with goods, it had a post office established in 1837, and its port had facilities to store cotton until steamboats arrived in the late autumn-early winter, when water level would rise. Despite this, <span class="loc">Nashville</span> never experienced significant growth, and the town did not incorporate. It never had more than two stores, and in census of 1840, the population was about 55 whites, and an undetermined number of slaves.</p>
