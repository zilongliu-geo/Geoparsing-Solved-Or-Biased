<p><span class="loc">Matara</span> (Sinhalese: මාතර, <span class="loc">Tamil</span>: மாத்தறை) (originally Mahathota) is a major city in <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>, on the southern coast of <span class="loc">Southern Province</span>, 160 km from <span class="loc">Colombo</span>. It is a major commercial hub, and it is the administrative capital of <span class="loc">Matara District</span>. It was gravely affected by the Asian tsunami in December 2004. <span class="loc">Matara</span> historically belongs to the area that was called the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Ruhuna</span>, which was one of the three kingdoms in <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> (Thun Sinhalaya තුන් සිංහලය). <span class="loc">Matara</span> was previously called Mahathota. The <span class="loc">Nilwala</span> River runs through <span class="loc">Matara</span> and there was a wide area where ferries used to cross. Hence, the town was called Maha Thota which was derived from the Sanskrit word Maha Theertha, which means "the great ferry". According to Thotagamuwe <span class="loc">Sri</span> <span class="loc">Rahula</span> <span class="loc">Thera</span>'s Paravi Sndesaya King Weerabamapanam made <span class="loc">Matara</span> as his capital and named it "Mapatuna". The temple in the middle of the town is also built by ancient kings, and now it is a very popular sacred place among the Buddhists in the area. In the 16th and 18th centuries, <span class="loc">Matara</span> was ruled by the Portuguese and the Dutch respectively.</p>
