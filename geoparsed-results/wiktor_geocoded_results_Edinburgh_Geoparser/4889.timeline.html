  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kawit</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Cavite</span> <span class="loc">El Viejo</span>) is a first class urban municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Cavite</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 78,209 people in a land area of 22.86 square kilometers. <span class="loc">Kawit</span> is the birthplace of <span class="per">Emilio Aguinaldo</span>, the first president of the <span class="loc">Republic of the Philippines</span>. It is also the location of his home, the <span class="per">Aguinaldo</span> Shrine, where independence from <span class="loc">Spain</span> was declared on <span class="date">June 12, 1898</span>. From <span class="date">1895</span> to <span class="date">1897</span>, he served as the town's chief executive. The name <span class="loc">Kawit</span> is derived from the Tagalog word kawit (hook) which is suggestive of its location at the base of a hookshaped shoreline along <span class="loc">Manila Bay</span> extending to the tip of <span class="loc">Cavite City</span>. Legend, however, gives another version on how the town got its name. <span class="date">One day</span> a Spanish visitor asked a native blacksmith about the name of the village. The latter was busy at the time pounding on the anvil a piece of hot metal that looked like a hook. He hesitated to speak, not understanding what the stranger was asking, but when pressed for an answer, and thinking that he wanted to know what he was doing, he merely said kawit (hook). The Spaniards left muttering the word kawit. In the course of the time the word kawit evolved into "cauite," and finally "cavite".</p><br><br>
