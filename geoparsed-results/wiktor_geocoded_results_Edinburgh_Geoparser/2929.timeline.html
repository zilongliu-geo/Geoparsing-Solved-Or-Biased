  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Northumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,390 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is located 88 miles (141 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and 71 miles (114 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, in the Anthracite Coal Region. It is completely encompassed by <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> Township. Sawmill operator, <span class="per">Albert Bradford</span>, gave <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> its name because of its elevation and beautiful setting in the mountains. He decided that it deserved a special name and named it after the holy mountain in <span class="loc">Israel</span>. <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> began as a logging town. Coal wasn't discovered until <span class="date">1790</span> by <span class="per">Isaac Tomlinson</span>. It took <span class="date">twenty-four years</span> until the first shipment of anthracite was shipped from the borough. <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> Inn was opened in <span class="date">1812</span> by <span class="per">Richard Yarnall</span> and was strategically located on the <span class="org">Centre</span> Turnpike (also known as the Reading-Sunbury Road or Old Reading Road) halfway between <span class="loc">Pottsville</span> and <span class="loc">Danville</span>. During the latter part of <span class="date">1854</span> the <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="loc">Sunbury Railroad</span> was completed from <span class="loc">Shamokin</span> to Mt. <span class="loc">Carmel</span>, which led to the opening and development of a number of collieries in the region. During the same year, the <span class="loc">Locust Mountain</span> Coal and Iron Company commenced making extensive openings and improvements upon their valuable coal lands in the vicinity of Mt. <span class="loc">Carmel</span>, building breakers for two collieries - the <span class="loc">Coal Ridge</span> and <span class="loc">Locust Mountain</span> collieries. The township was erected in <span class="date">1854</span>, formed from part of Coal Township; by <span class="date">1862</span> the borough was incorporated within the township.</p><br><br>
