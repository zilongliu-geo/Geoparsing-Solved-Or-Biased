<p>Clinton is a community in the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Ontario</span>, located in the municipality of Central Huron. Established in 1831, Clinton first began when Jonas Gibbings, Peter and Stephen <span class="loc">Vanderburg</span> cleared out a small area to start. Clinton started to grow in 1844 when William Rattenbury laid out the plans to began making a village. In 1954, Clinton's population was 2625 people. Today, it has an estimated population of 3201. Clinton is known as <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s home of radar and has a huge radar antenna in the downtown due to its association with RCAF Station Clinton during World War II. Clinton was known as The Corners or "<span class="loc">Rattenbury</span> Corner" in its earlier days. It was named after Sir Henry Clinton, who distinguished himself during the Peninsular War. The School On Wheels, a school car that visited remote Northern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> communities to educate children who would otherwise not have access to school, is permanently on display in Clinton as a museum about education. Clinton was the home of the highly influential 19th-century ethnologist and anthropologist Horatio Hale, who involved himself locally in real estate development and other business and educational endeavours. Several of the streets in the centre of the town were personally named by him. Hale is interred in the municipal cemetery north of the community.</p>
