<p><span class="loc">Kingston</span> (/ˈkɪŋstən/ or <span class="loc">US</span> /ˈkɪŋztən/) is the capital and largest <span class="loc">city of Jamaica</span>, located on the southeastern coast of the island. It faces a natural harbour protected by the <span class="loc">Palisadoes</span>, a long sand spit which connects the town of <span class="loc">Port Royal</span> and the <span class="loc">Norman</span> Manley International Airport to the rest of the island. In <span class="loc">the Americas</span>, <span class="loc">Kingston</span> is the largest predominantly <span class="loc">English-speaking city</span> south of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The local government bodies of the <span class="loc">parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew</span> were amalgamated by the <span class="loc">Kingston</span> and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the <span class="loc">Kingston</span> and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). Greater <span class="loc">Kingston</span>, or the "Corporate Area" refers to those areas under the KSAC; however, it does not solely refer to <span class="loc">Kingston Parish</span>, which only consists of the old downtown and <span class="loc">Port Royal</span>. <span class="loc">Kingston Parish</span> had a population of 96,052, and St. Andrew parish had a population of 555,828 in 2001. <span class="loc">Kingston</span> is only bordered by <span class="loc">Saint Andrew</span> to the east, west and north. The geographical border for the <span class="loc">parish of Kingston</span> encompasses the following communities, <span class="loc">Tivoli Gardens</span>, <span class="loc">Denham Town</span>, downtown <span class="loc">Kingston</span>, National Heroes Park, <span class="loc">Kingston Gardens</span>, <span class="loc">Rae Town</span>, <span class="loc">Bournemouth Gardens</span>, <span class="loc">Norman Gardens</span>, <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Rennock</span> Lodge, <span class="loc">Port Royal</span> along with portions of Allman Town, Franklyn Town and Rollington Town.</p>
