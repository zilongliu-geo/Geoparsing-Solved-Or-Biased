  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Lancaster</span> and <span class="per">Lancashire</span> councils offer business help. TWO councils are joining forces to offer financial help to new and existing small businesses in the <span class="loc">Lancaster district</span>. <span class="loc">Lancaster City</span> Council's rent grant scheme and <span class="org">Lancashire County Council</span>'s ‘Kickstart’ micro credit scheme both offer help to firms - and can be accessed as a single package. Rent grants can boost new and early stage businesses by offering up to £2,500 or 50 per cent of the first year’s basic rent on premises in the District. To qualify, businesses must have been trading for <span class="date">less than three years</span>, employ no more than 10 full time staff and operate in sectors including manufacturing, new media, the environment, creative industries and community enterprises. Kickstart offers loans up to £5,000 funded by <span class="org">Lancashire County Council</span>’s economic development company. To find out more, call 01524-582279.</p><br><br>
