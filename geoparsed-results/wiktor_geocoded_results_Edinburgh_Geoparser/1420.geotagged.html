<p><span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,735 at the 2010 census. The town includes Fairfield Center, <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> village and <span class="loc">Hinckley</span>, and borders the <span class="loc">city of Waterville</span> to the south. It is home to the Good Will-Hinckley School, Lawrence High School and Kennebec Valley Community College. The area was territory of the Canibas tribe of Abenaki Indians residing at Taconnet village, once located downriver at the confluence of the Sebasticook and Kennebec rivers in what is today <span class="loc">Winslow</span>. In 1692 during King William's War, the village was burned, so the Canibas tribe abandoned the area. The French and Indian Wars finally ended in 1763, leaving the region open for English colonization. Fairfield Plantation, named for its fair aspect, was first settled in 1774. Benedict Arnold and his troops rested and re-provisioned here in 1775 during their march up the <span class="loc">Kennebec River</span> to the Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. Following the Revolutionary War, Fairfield Plantation developed as a trade and agricultural town, with farms producing hay, grain and potatoes. It was noted for the number and quality of its cattle. On June 18, 1788, it was incorporated as <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>. By 1790, the community had 492 inhabitants. In 1837, it produced 11,531 bushels of wheat and a large quantity of wool.</p>
