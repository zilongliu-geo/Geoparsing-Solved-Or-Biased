<p>This article is about the town of <span class="loc">Walpole</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place <span class="loc">Walpole</span>, please see the article Walpole (CDP), <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Walpole is a town in <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and also encompasses the entirely distinct entity of Walpole (CDP), with its much smaller area of 2.9 square miles and smaller population of 5198 at the 2010 census. Walpole Town, as the Census refers to the actual town, is located about 13 miles (21 km) south of Downtown Boston and 23.5 miles (37.8 km) north of Providence, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. The population was 24,070 at the 2010 census. Walpole was first settled in 1659 and was considered a part of <span class="loc">Dedham</span> until officially incorporated in 1724. The town was named after Sir Robert Walpole, de facto first Prime Minister of <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>. It started out as a territory that was claimed by the Neponset Native American tribe. The Neponset tribe officially claimed the area that is now Walpole, and some of its surrounding territory in 1635. The town of <span class="loc">Dedham</span> was not included in this claim, so they began to negotiate with the Neponset tribe to gain land. In 1636, a deal was made between the town of <span class="loc">Dedham</span> and the Neponsets to grant <span class="loc">Dedham</span> lands that now comprise the towns of <span class="loc">Walpole</span>, <span class="loc">Norwood</span>, <span class="loc">Westwood</span>, <span class="loc">Medfield</span>, <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> and <span class="loc">Dover</span> as well as <span class="loc">Dedham</span>. The land given to <span class="loc">Dedham</span> in this deal currently includes parts of 16 different towns.</p>
