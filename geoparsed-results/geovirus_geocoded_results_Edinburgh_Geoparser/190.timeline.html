  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A species of treefrog that was <span class="date">three years</span> from being declared extinct was found in <span class="date">July</span> in the tropical northeast of <span class="loc">Australia</span>. A local university Ph.D. candidate, <span class="per">Robert Puschendorf</span>, along with volunteer researchers stumbled upon the armoured mistfrog (Litoria lorica) while surveying a related species near <span class="loc">Mareeba</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>. The researchers thought they were catching a similar torrent treefrog (Litoria nannotis), until they examined a specimen more closely. The Associated Press reported that PCR lab results showed that the mistfrogs were not unaffected by the devastating chytridiomycosis, a pandemic disease affecting almost all frog species. Remarkably, they may actually be immune to fatal effects of the fungal infection. <span class="per">Puschendorf</span> plans to publish a paper on the new findings of this Lazarus species.</p><br><br>
