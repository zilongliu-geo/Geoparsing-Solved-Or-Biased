  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Richmond</span> is a suburban town in southwest <span class="loc">London</span>, 8.2 miles (13.2 km) west-southwest of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. The town is on a meander of the <span class="loc">River Thames</span>, with a large number of parks and open spaces, including <span class="loc">Richmond Park</span>, and many protected conservation areas, which include much of <span class="loc">Richmond Hill</span>. A specific <span class="org">Act of Parliament</span> protects the scenic view of the <span class="loc">River Thames</span> from <span class="per">Richmond</span>. <span class="per">Richmond</span> was founded following <span class="per">Henry VII</span>'s building of <span class="per">Richmond</span> Palace in the 16th century, from which the town derives its name. (The Palace itself was named after <span class="per">Henry</span>'s earldom of <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">North Yorkshire</span>.) During this era the town and palace were particularly associated with <span class="per">Elizabeth I</span>, who spent her last <span class="date">days</span> here. During the 18th century <span class="loc">Richmond</span> Bridge was completed and many Georgian terraces were built, particularly around <span class="per">Richmond Green</span> and on <span class="loc">Richmond Hill</span>. These remain well preserved and many have listed building architectural or heritage status. The opening of the railway station in <span class="date">1846</span> was a significant event in the absorption of the town into a rapidly expanding <span class="loc">London</span>. <span class="per">Richmond</span> was formerly part of the ancient parish of <span class="loc">Kingston upon Thames</span> in the <span class="loc">county of Surrey</span>. In <span class="date">1890</span> the town became a municipal borough, which was later extended to include <span class="loc">Kew</span>, Ham, <span class="loc">Petersham</span> and part of <span class="loc">Mortlake</span> (<span class="loc">North Sheen</span>). The municipal borough was abolished in <span class="date">1965</span> when, as a result of boundary changes, <span class="per">Richmond</span> was transferred to <span class="loc">Greater London</span>.</p><br><br>
