  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is a community in the town of <span class="loc">Halton Hills</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> and is part of the <span class="loc">Regional Municipality of Halton</span>. It is situated on the <span class="loc">Credit River</span>, located approximately 60 km west of <span class="loc">Toronto</span>, making it part of the <span class="org">Greater Toronto Area</span>. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> takes its name from <span class="per">George Kennedy</span>, who settled in the area in <span class="date">1821</span>. By <span class="date">1650</span>, the once plentiful Hurons had been wiped out by European diseases, and the <span class="loc">Iroquois</span>. The region was <span class="date">now</span> open to the Algonquian Ojibwa (also known as <span class="loc">Mississauga</span>), who moved in. By <span class="date">1850</span> the remaining Mississauga natives were removed to the Six Nations reserve, where the New Credit Reserve was established. Commencing in <span class="date">1781</span>, the British government purchased blocks of land from the Mississauga Nation. In <span class="date">1818</span>, they purchased land that later became the townships of <span class="per">Esquesing</span> and <span class="per">Nassagaweya</span>. The task of laying out the townships fell to <span class="per">Timothy Street</span> and <span class="per">Abraham Nelles</span>. <span class="per">Charles Kennedy</span> was hired by <span class="per">Nelles</span> to survey the northern part of the townships, and <span class="per">Charles Kennedy</span> received a significant parcel of land as payment for his work.</p><br><br>
