<p><span class="loc">Rockville</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Hanover County</span> in the <span class="loc">Central Region</span> of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of Virginia. <span class="loc">Rockville</span> was named after early 19th century postmaster, William Rock. Prior to the name "Rockville," the community was named "Dentonsville," after postmaster Allen Denton, the descendent of colonial settler Thomas Denton, whose tavern ("Denton's Tavern") exists today as a private residence. When Allen Denton sold the tavern to William Rock, the name of the community also changed to reflect the new postmaster. The community formerly consisted primarily of farmland. Today many <span class="loc">Rockville</span> residents commute to jobs in <span class="loc">Richmond</span>. Additional information on the early history of <span class="loc">Rockville</span> is available from Gary L. Denton, Attorney at Law, 14453 <span class="loc">Riverside Drive</span>, <span class="loc">Ashland</span>, VA 23005. While most of the land in the area is still farmland, some of the land has been developed into subdivisions. One example of this is <span class="loc">Carrington</span> Glen, a rural conservation development (meaning 70% of the land remains undeveloped and undisturbed by development) of new homes on an old farm tract. Other large neighborhoods in the area include <span class="loc">Shop Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Willoughby</span>.</p>
