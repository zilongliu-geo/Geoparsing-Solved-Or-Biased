<p>Meridian is a city located in <span class="loc">Ada County</span> in <span class="loc">US</span> state of Idaho. It is the 3rd-largest city in the state of Idaho. As of 2010, the population of Meridian was 75,092, and a 2014 estimate placed the population at approximately 85,000. Having recently surpassed the <span class="loc">eastern Idaho cities</span> of Pocatello and Idaho Falls, the 2010 census placed Meridian as the third-largest city in Idaho behind <span class="loc">Boise</span> and <span class="loc">Nampa</span>, all in the Treasure Valley. Meridian is the state's fastest-growing city, with an 81.5 percent increase in population since 2000. The town was established in 1891 on the Onweiler farm north of the present site and was called Hunter. Two years later an I.O.O.F. lodge was organized and called itself Meridian because it was located on the <span class="loc">Boise</span> Meridian and the town was renamed. The Settlers' Irrigation Ditch, 1892, changed the arid region into a productive farming community which was incorporated in 1902. Meridian was incorporated in 1903. The information in the following sections (Irrigation, Village, Rail Transportation, and Creamery) is found on the displays in the Meridian City Hall Plaza.</p>
