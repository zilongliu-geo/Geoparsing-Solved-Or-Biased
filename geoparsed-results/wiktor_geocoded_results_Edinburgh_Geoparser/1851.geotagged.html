<p><span class="loc">Farmington</span> is a town located in <span class="loc">Hartford County</span> in the <span class="loc">Farmington Valley</span> area of central <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 25,340 at the 2010 census. As an affluent suburb of <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, it is home to the world headquarters of several large corporations including Carrier Corporation, Otis Elevator Company, and <span class="loc">Carvel</span>. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> was originally inhabited by the Tunxis Indian tribe. In 1640, a community of English immigrants was established by residents of <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, making <span class="loc">Farmington</span> the oldest inland settlement west of the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> and the twelfth oldest communities in the state. Settlers found the area ideal because of its rich soil, location along the floodplain of the <span class="loc">Farmington River</span>, and valley geography. The town and river were given their present names in 1645, which is considered the incorporation year of the town. The town's boundaries were later enlarged several times, making it the largest in the <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> Colony. The town was named after <span class="loc">Farmington</span>, in <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> has been called the "mother of towns" because its vast area was divided to produce nine other central <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> communities. The <span class="loc">borough of Unionville</span>, in Farmington's northwest corner, was once home to many factories harnessing the water power of the <span class="loc">Farmington River</span>.</p>
