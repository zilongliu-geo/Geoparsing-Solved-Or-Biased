  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Lincoln is a town on <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span> in the <span class="loc">Niagara Region</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The town's administrative and commercial centre is in the community of <span class="loc">Beamsville</span>. Lincoln's location between the southern shore of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span> and the <span class="loc">Niagara Escarpment</span> provides for a moderate climate with mild winters. The area is known in <span class="loc">Canada</span> for its orchards, vineyards, wineries and restaurants that feature local produce and wines. Fruit crops grown in Lincoln include cherries, peaches, apples and pears, and during the <span class="date">summer</span> attract many tourists from all over <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, particularly <span class="loc">Toronto</span>. Lincoln's earliest known inhabitants were Neutral Indians. Archaeologists from the Royal <span class="org">Ontario Museum</span> found evidence of a Neutral encampment with a long house about two kilometers east of <span class="loc">Beamsville</span>, on Cave <span class="loc">Springs Farm</span>. Until vandals destroyed them <span class="date">about 30 years ago</span>, there were a number of Indian faces carved in stone high on the Escarpment wall nearby. The Neutrals were decimated by the <span class="loc">Iroquois</span> in <span class="date">1653</span>. When the first European settlers arrived in <span class="date">1777</span>, there were only a few semi-migrant native people living in the caves near <span class="loc">Beamsville</span>.</p><br><br>
