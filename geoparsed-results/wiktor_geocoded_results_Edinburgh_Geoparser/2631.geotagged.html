<p><span class="loc">Karak</span> (Chinese: 加叻) is a small town in the <span class="loc">Bentong district</span> of <span class="loc">Pahang</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. It is well known as a rest town (Bandar Persinggahan) of Federal route  from <span class="loc">Kuala Lumpur</span> to <span class="loc">Kuantan</span>. It also gives its name to the famous Karak Highway, which links it to <span class="loc">Kuala Lumpur</span>. Famous Malaysian actors and actress, Daniel Razlan, Mohd Farid Kamarudin, Nona bakar, <span class="loc">Sawiyah</span> Jeli and Kalsom <span class="loc">Kadir</span> currently live here. Nona Bakar was pioneer for program TV <span class="loc">Nona</span> at TV3. With its location at the foothills of <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>’s main mountain range, the Titiwangsa Mountain Range, this town is an important water catchment area not just for <span class="loc">Pahang</span> but for the <span class="loc">Klang</span> Valley as well. The Government has plans to build a massive RM2bil pipeline linking the <span class="loc">Pahang River</span> area to <span class="loc">Selangor</span> and the <span class="loc">Klang Valley</span>. Part of the pipeline will pass through <span class="loc">Karak</span>. Ironically, however, the main complaint in this town is the constantly disrupted water supply. Much of the problem stems from an aged water treatment plant, which has been in service for over 30 years and thus is inadequate even for a town the size of <span class="loc">Karak</span>.</p>
