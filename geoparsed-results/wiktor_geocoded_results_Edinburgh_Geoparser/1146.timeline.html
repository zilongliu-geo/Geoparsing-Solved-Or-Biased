  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Eden is a residential settlement on the eastern edge of <span class="loc">Carrickfergus</span> in <span class="loc">County Antrim</span>, <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>, located within a larger electoral ward area of the same name. It is intersected by the Larne Road, a small section of the extensive Antrim Coast Road that connects <span class="loc">Carrickfergus</span> to <span class="per">Whitehead</span> and the major ferry port of <span class="loc">Larne</span>. In <span class="date">April 2008</span>, <span class="loc">Carrickfergus Borough</span> Council established the Eden Allotments, a five hectare allotment site intended to be a hub of community activity as well as promoting gardening activities and 'home-grown' cultivation of vegetables. It has been highly publicised in local newspapers and has received praise from local government for its environmentally friendly aims. It is currently believed to be the largest allotment site on the island of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. Eden is served by <span class="org">Eden Primary School</span>. The school is located on a 3.4 acre plot of land within residential Eden and takes children from a larger surrounding catchment area which includes <span class="loc">Carrickfergus</span> and occasionally <span class="per">Whitehead</span>. Eden was served by Eden railway station until <span class="date">1977</span>, when NI Railways nationalised their services and closed many railway stations, including nearby Kilroot railway station. There is <span class="date">now</span> no station between <span class="per">Downshire</span> and <span class="per">Whitehead</span>.</p><br><br>
