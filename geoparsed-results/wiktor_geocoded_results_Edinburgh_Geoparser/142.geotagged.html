<p><span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> (/ˌbjuːnəˈvɪstə/ BEW-nə-VIS-tə) is an independent city located in the <span class="loc">Blue Ridge Mountains</span> region of Virginia in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 6,650. The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines the independent cities of <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> and <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, along with surrounding <span class="loc">Rockbridge County</span>, for statistical purposes. Formerly named "Hart's Bottom", "<span class="loc">Green Forest</span>" or "Green Valley" until 1888, and chartered as a town in 1890, <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> was granted a city charter on February 15, 1892. The <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> Downtown Historic District, Buena Vista Colored School, <span class="loc">Cedar Hill</span>, Glen Maury, <span class="loc">Old Courthouse</span>, Southern Seminary <span class="loc">Main Building</span>, and W.N. Seay House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Founded by Benjamin C. Moomaw in the late 1800s, the town consisted only of a simple tannery at the intersection of two railroads and a canal. The <span class="loc">Richmond</span> and <span class="loc">Alleghany Railroad</span> and the <span class="loc">Shenandoah Valley Railroad</span>, stood alongside the James River Canal that had been used to transport materials from the Atlantic ports of Virginia to <span class="loc">Lexington</span> since the 18th century, but by the founding of the city had been converted for the distribution of water power. After opening the tannery, Moomaw opened a pulp mill and a canning factory. In 1882 Appold &amp; Sons Tannery opened, and the first public school opened in 1885.</p>
