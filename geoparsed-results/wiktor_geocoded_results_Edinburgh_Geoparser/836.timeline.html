  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Manchester</span> is a small incorporated town in northeastern <span class="loc">Carroll County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located just south of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> state line and north of <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>. The population was 4,808 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Manchester</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1834</span> and is the second oldest incorporated area in <span class="loc">Carroll County</span> after <span class="loc">Westminster</span>, which was incorporated in <span class="date">1818</span>. The town was originally formed as a part of <span class="loc">Baltimore County</span>, before the creation of <span class="loc">Carroll County</span> in <span class="date">1837</span>. It is governed by an elected mayor and an elected five-person town council. <span class="loc">Manchester</span> lies in the humid continental climate region, marked by cold and snowy winters but humid and hot summers. This climate is ideal for growing farmed crops in the <span class="date">summer</span> such as sweet corn and squash, leaving much of the outlying area marked with large tracts of farmland. <span class="loc">Manchester</span> is a rural commuting town where residents travel to work in the greater <span class="loc">Baltimore Metropolitan</span> Area and the greater <span class="loc">Washington Metropolitan</span> Area. The Town of <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, officially incorporated in <span class="date">1834</span>, was originally known as "<span class="loc">Manchester</span> <span class="loc">Germantown</span>". However, the name <span class="loc">Germantown</span> referred to a community west of <span class="loc">Manchester</span> that was later incorporated with the town. The town was originally laid out in <span class="loc">Baltimore County</span> and remained a part of that county until the creation of <span class="loc">Carroll County</span> on <span class="date">January 19, 1837</span>.</p><br><br>
