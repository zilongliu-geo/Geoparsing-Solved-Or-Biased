<p><span class="loc">Canterbury</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windham County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5234 at the 2010 census. The area was first settled in the 1680s as <span class="loc">Peagscomsuck</span>, consisting mainly of land north of <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, south of New <span class="loc">Roxbury</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> (now <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>) and west of the <span class="loc">Quinebaug</span> River, <span class="loc">Peagscomsuck</span> Island and the <span class="loc">Plainfield</span> Settlement. In 1703 it was officially separated from <span class="loc">Plainfield</span> and named The Town of <span class="loc">Canterbury</span>. In 1832, Prudence Crandall, a schoolteacher raised as a <span class="loc">Quaker</span>, stirred controversy when she opened a school for black girls in town. The Connecticut General Assembly passed the "<span class="loc">Black Law</span>" which prohibited the education of black children from out of state, but Crandall persisted in teaching, and was briefly jailed in 1832. Mobs forced the closure of the school in 1834, and Crandall married the Reverend Calvin Philco that same year and moved to <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> repealed the <span class="loc">Black Law</span> in 1838, and later recognized Crandall with a small pension in 1886, four years before her death. In 1995, the Connecticut General Assembly designated Prudence Crandall as the state's official heroine because she opened the first Academy for young black women. The school still stands in <span class="loc">Canterbury</span>, and currently serves as the Prudence Crandall Museum and is a National Historic Landmark. In 2009 a life-size bronze statue of Prudence Crandall with one of her African American students was installed in the state capital.</p>
