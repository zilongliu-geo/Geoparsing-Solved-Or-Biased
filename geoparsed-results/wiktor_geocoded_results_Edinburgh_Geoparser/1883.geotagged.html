<p><span class="loc">Salisbury</span> /ˈsɔːlzbəri/ is a northern suburb in <span class="loc">Adelaide</span>, <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is the seat of the <span class="loc">City of Salisbury</span>, and in the South Australian Legislative Assembly electoral <span class="loc">district of Ramsay</span> and the Australian House of Representatives divisions of <span class="loc">Wakefield</span> and <span class="loc">Port Adelaide</span>. The suburb is a service area for the <span class="loc">City of Salisbury</span> district, with an abundance of parklands, shops, cafes and restaurants. Parabanks Shopping Centre is also located in <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, which includes <span class="loc">Harris</span> Scarfe and Big W as its signature retailers. The <span class="loc">City of Salisbury</span> is situated 25 kilometres north of <span class="loc">Adelaide</span>. It covers 161 square kilometres stretching from the beaches at Gulf <span class="loc">St Vincent</span> to the <span class="loc">Adelaide</span> Hills. The terrain is mostly flat with the <span class="loc">Little Para River</span> winding its way through the district to the sea. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, and the surrounding northern suburbs are perceived to have a relatively high crime rate. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> was founded when John Harvey began selling town allotments in 1848, from land he had purchased along the <span class="loc">Little Para River</span> in the previous year. The town was named after <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> which was close to his wife's hometown. There is a <span class="loc">Wiltshire Street</span> near <span class="loc">Park Terrace</span> in the city centre, parallel to John Street. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> started its life as a service centre for the surrounding wheat and hay farms. Salisbury Post Office opened around March 1850. It grew slowly (from a population of 400-500 in 1881) until 1940 when the establishment of an explosives and filling factory doubled the population almost overnight. The factory, which covered 4.5 square miles, was in production by mid 1942 and by January 1943 employed 6,500 persons producing 135,000 shells, bombs and mines weekly.</p>
