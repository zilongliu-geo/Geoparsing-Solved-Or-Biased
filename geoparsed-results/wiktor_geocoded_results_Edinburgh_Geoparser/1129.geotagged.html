<p>Brighton /ˈbraɪtən/ is a seaside resort and the largest part of the <span class="loc">City of Brighton and Hove</span> situated in <span class="loc">East Sussex</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically in the Rape of <span class="loc">Lewes</span> in <span class="loc">Sussex</span>, Brighton forms a part of the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation. Brighton is at the heart of the Greater <span class="loc">Brighton City</span> Region, a partnership of local authorities and other organisations that signifies Brighton's wider regional economic significance. Over half of the city's area is open downland, most of which lies within the South Downs National Park and forms part of the UNESCO-recognised Brighton and Lewes Downs biosphere reserve. Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The ancient settlement of "Brighthelmstone" was documented in the Domesday Book (1086). The town's importance grew during the Middle Ages as the <span class="loc">Old Town</span> developed, but it languished in the early modern period, affected by foreign attacks, storms, a suffering economy and a declining population. During the modern period, Brighton began to attract more visitors following improved road transport to <span class="loc">London</span> and becoming a boarding point for boats travelling to <span class="loc">France</span>. The town also developed in popularity as a health resort for sea bathing as a purported cure for illnesses.</p>
