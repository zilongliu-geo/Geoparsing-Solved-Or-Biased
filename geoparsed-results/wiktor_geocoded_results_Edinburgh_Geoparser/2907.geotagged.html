<p>Pili (Central Bicolano: Banwaan kan Pili; Rinconada Bikol: BanwƒÅan ka Pili; English: Municipality of Pili; <span class="loc">Tagalog</span>: Bayan ng Pili) is a first class municipality and the capital of the province of <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span> in the <span class="loc">Bicol Region</span> of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 82,307 people, making Pili the second largest municipality of the province in terms of population. The municipality was classified as 1st class in terms of income classification in 2007. Pili is one of the municipalities comprising the metropolitan area of Metro Naga, serving as the center for agro-industrial development. The name of the town has many disputed etymologies. The most popular is it might be derived from the "Pili nut" (Canarium ovatum), the fruit which is among the symbol of the <span class="loc">Bicol region</span>. However, historians are convinced that it came from the Bicol word "pili", which means "to choose" or "the chosen", probably the reason why the town was hailed as the provincial capital and not its neighboring <span class="loc">Naga City</span>.</p>
