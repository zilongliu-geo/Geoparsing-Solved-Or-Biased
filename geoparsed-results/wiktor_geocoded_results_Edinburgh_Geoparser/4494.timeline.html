  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santee</span> is a suburban city of <span class="loc">San Diego</span> in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, with a population of 53,413 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Although it is a part of the <span class="loc">East County</span> region, <span class="loc">Santee</span> is located just 18 miles (29 km) from the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. The city is connected to the coastline by State Route 52, a six-lane freeway that runs from Interstate 5 in <span class="loc">La Jolla</span> to State Route 67 in <span class="loc">El Cajon</span>. The city is bisected by the <span class="loc">San Diego River</span>, a linear greenbelt that includes parks, trails and more than 1,100 acres (450 ha) of natural riparian habitat. The region was the homeland of the Kumeyaay people. These original residents established the village of Sinyeweche on the banks of the <span class="loc">San Diego River</span> in the present day Santee area. The city is named after Milton Santee, the second husband of <span class="per">Jennie Blodgett</span>, whose first husband was <span class="per">George A. Cowles</span>, a pioneer rancher and businessperson in the <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span> area. In <span class="date">2010</span>, the city was populated by 19,272 households, of which 64 percent had incomes greater than $45,000 annually. In <span class="date">2009</span>, the median household income was $78,872 per year, according to the <span class="org">San Diego Association of Governments</span>. In <span class="date">2010</span>, <span class="loc">Santee</span> had one of the lowest crime rates among cities in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span>. Unlike most of the county's coastal cities, <span class="loc">Santee</span> still has sizable portions of vacant land suitable for development. It is a growing suburban community that in <span class="date">recent years</span> has added upscale housing, a major corporate business park and expansive shopping centers, along with a destination recreational complex called Sportsplex <span class="loc">USA</span> <span class="loc">Santee</span>.</p><br><br>
