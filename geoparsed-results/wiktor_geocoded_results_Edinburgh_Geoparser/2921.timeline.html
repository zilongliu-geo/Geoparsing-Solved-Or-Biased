  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> is the fifth-largest city in the State of <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and is the county seat of <span class="loc">Washington County</span>. Lying in the <span class="loc">Tualatin</span> Valley on the west side of the <span class="loc">Portland</span> metropolitan area, the city hosts many high-technology companies, such as <span class="org">Intel</span>, that comprise what has become known as the Silicon Forest. At the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, the city's population was 91,611. For <span class="date">thousands of years</span> before the arrival of European-American settlers, the Atfalati tribe of the Kalapuya lived in the <span class="loc">Tualatin</span> Valley near the later site of <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span>. The climate, moderated by the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>, helped make the region suitable for fishing, hunting, food gathering, and agriculture. Settlers founded a community here in <span class="date">1842</span>, later named after <span class="per">David Hill</span>, an Oregon politician. Transportation by riverboat on the <span class="loc">Tualatin River</span> was part of Hillsboro's settler economy. A railroad reached the area in the early 1870s and an interurban electric railway <span class="date">about four decades later</span>. These railways, as well as highways, aided the slow growth of the city to about 2,000 people by <span class="date">1910</span> and about 5,000 by <span class="date">1950</span>, before the arrival of high-tech companies in <span class="date">the 1980s</span>.</p><br><br>
