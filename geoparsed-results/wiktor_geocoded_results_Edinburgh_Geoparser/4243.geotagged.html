<p><span class="loc">Compton</span> is a city in southern <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, situated south of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. <span class="loc">Compton</span> is one of the oldest cities in the county and on May 11, 1888, was the eighth city to incorporate. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city had a total population of 96,455. It is known as the "<span class="loc">Hub City</span>" due to its geographic centrality in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>. Neighborhoods in <span class="loc">Compton</span> include Sunny Cove, Leland, Downtown <span class="loc">Compton</span>, and <span class="loc">Richland</span> Farms. The city is generally a working class city with some middle-class neighborhoods, and is home to a relatively young community, at an average 25 years of age, compared to the American median age of 35 (2010 data). In 1784, the Spanish Crown deeded a tract of over 75,000 acres (300 km2) to Juan Jose Dominguez in this area. The tract was named <span class="loc">Rancho San Pedro</span>. Dominguez's name was later applied to the <span class="loc">Dominguez Hills</span> community south of <span class="loc">Compton</span>. The tree that marked the original northern boundary of the rancho still stands at the corner of Poppy and Short streets. The rancho was subdivided and parcels were sold within the Californios of Alta <span class="loc">California</span> until the lands were ceded after the Mexican-American war in 1848. American immigrants acquired most of the rancho lands after 1848.</p>
