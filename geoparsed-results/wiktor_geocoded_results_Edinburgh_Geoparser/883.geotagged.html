<p>Wilson is a city in <span class="loc">Lynn County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city was established in 1912 by William Green of Shiner. Green intended to settle this part of Texas with German emigrant farmers on old Wilson County School lands located in <span class="loc">Lynn County</span>, hence the city's name. Wilson is the birthplace of Jerry "Bo" Coleman, a radio disc jockey in Lubbock who was a friend and associate of Buddy Holly and Waylon Jennings. In 1923, Wilson, with only twenty residents, was among thirty-seven communities that applied to become the home of the new Texas Tech University, which was instead located to the north in Lubbock. Wilson offered the choice of six thousand acres for the institution, three times the amount required in the legislation authored by State Senator William H. Bledsoe of Lubbock, whose district included <span class="loc">Lynn County</span>. The institution could have picked any arrangement of land I Wilson without disturbing any individual or even moving a fence. Wilson lies on the level high plains of the <span class="loc">Llano Estacado</span> in West Texas. It is located at 33°19′01″N 101°43′27″W (33.3170352 -101.7240454).</p>
