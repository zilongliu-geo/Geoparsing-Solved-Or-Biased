<p><span class="loc">Panama</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Chautauqua County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 479 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Panama</span> is in the northwest part of the town of Harmony, at the junction of State Route 474 (Main Street) and County Route 33. The village is named after <span class="loc">Panama Rocks</span>, a large rock formation south of the village. Paleozoic fossils are visible in the outcrops. This site has become a tourist attraction, and the owners charge admission at the gate. The village of <span class="loc">Panama</span> was incorporated in 1861. Among many early settlers was George Hawkins, who purchased Lot 50 in 1825. He was born in 1802 in <span class="loc">Oneida County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. About 1827 he married Rhoda Powers (born 1806). Together they cleared land to make a living. George died in 1883 and Rhoda in 1900. Rhoda's father was Simeon Powers, who established a Baptist church in the area. George's parents are unknown. Both are buried in Panama Union cemetery under one headstone. The U.S. Post Office at <span class="loc">Panama</span> was established in 1826. That was the first, officially recorded, use of the name "<span class="loc">Panama</span>". The traditional story is that <span class="loc">Panama</span> got its name from someone who had been across the <span class="loc">Isthmus of Panama</span>, and said local rock formations reminded him of <span class="loc">Panama</span>'s rocks. It is possible that this person was Moses Cushman Marsh, who operated a trading company in <span class="loc">Panama</span>, and was <span class="loc">Panama</span>'s first postmaster. He had previously had a business in <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, and he may have been across the <span class="loc">Isthmus of Panama</span>.</p>
