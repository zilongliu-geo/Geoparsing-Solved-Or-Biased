  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Utah County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the Provoâ€“Orem, <span class="loc">Utah Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is located in the southwest corner of Cedar Valley about 50 miles (80 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span> and 5 miles (8.0 km) south of Cedar Fort on <span class="loc">Utah</span> State Route 73, west of <span class="loc">Utah Lake</span>. The population was 119 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town was founded in <span class="date">1855</span> when <span class="per">John Carson</span>, his four brothers, and others settled in the Cedar Valley. The settlement was soon known as <span class="loc">Frogtown</span>. The population ballooned after the arrival of <span class="org">Johnston's Army</span> in 1858-59, sent to <span class="loc">Utah</span> to suppress the rumored rebellion there. The army established a nearby camp called Camp Floyd, and the population grew to over 7,000, including 3,500 troops (nearly one-third of the entire <span class="org">U.S. Army</span> at that time), teamsters, gamblers, and camp followers of various persuasions. With no rebellion taking place, the troops were recalled in <span class="date">1861</span>, sent east to fight for the <span class="org">Union</span> with the outbreak of the Civil War.</p><br><br>
