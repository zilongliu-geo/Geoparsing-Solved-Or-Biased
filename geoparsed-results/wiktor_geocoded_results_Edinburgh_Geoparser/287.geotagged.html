<p><span class="loc">Banga</span> is a third class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Aklan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. This small town has repeatedly won national competitions for the "Most Beautiful Town" contests in the country. It is the site of the Aklan State University. <span class="loc">Banga</span> is politically subdivided into 30 barangays. The history of <span class="loc">Banga</span> dates back to the 15th century upon the arrival in <span class="loc">Panay Island</span> of the Ten Datus from <span class="loc">Borneo</span>. While some sceptics considered the account a legend, Banganhons still believe that one of the rulers named Datu <span class="loc">Manduyog</span>, ruled over the area with his seat of government located in <span class="loc">Bakan</span>, the town's older name. His capital was at the foot of the <span class="loc">Manduyog</span> Hill that was named after him. Being a legitimate successor to Datu Dangandanan who ruled what was called Akean in the late 1390s, Datu <span class="loc">Manduyog</span> became the Akeanon ruler in 1437 and made <span class="loc">Bakan</span> the capital. Another version of Banga's history from Panublion cited that Banga's ancient site was the present location of <span class="loc">Malinao</span>. In 1792, the town transferred across the <span class="loc">Aklan River</span> to the foot of <span class="loc">Manduyog</span> Hill. Several prominent families decided to remain in the “old town”, which became a barrio and named <span class="loc">Malinao</span> after a placid tributary of the <span class="loc">Aklan River</span>.</p>
