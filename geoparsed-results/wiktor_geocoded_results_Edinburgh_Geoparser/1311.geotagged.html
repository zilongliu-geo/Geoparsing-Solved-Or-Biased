<p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 20,234. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Blair</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is included in the Omaha-Council Bluffs, <span class="loc">NE-IA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. In the <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> license plate system, <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is represented by the prefix 29 (it had the twenty-ninth largest number of vehicles registered in the county when the license plate system was established in 1922). <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is located in eastern <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> on the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. It was explored as early as 1739 by Pierre Antoine and Paul Mallet, who were on a trapping expedition to <span class="loc">Canada</span>. In 1804, Lewis and Clark reported the establishment of the new <span class="loc">United States</span> government to a council of Indian chiefs near the present site of <span class="loc">Fort Calhoun</span>. As a result of this Council, <span class="loc">Fort Atkinson</span> was established in 1819 and served as a key midwestern outpost until its abandonment in 1827. The first permanent settlement in <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was made in 1854. In that same year, the county was organized as one of the eight original counties proclaimed by acting Governor Thomas B. Cuming; it was later reorganized in 1855. The county seat has been located in three different towns: <span class="loc">Fort Calhoun</span>, <span class="loc">DeSoto</span>, and finally at <span class="loc">Blair</span>, its present site since 1869.</p>
