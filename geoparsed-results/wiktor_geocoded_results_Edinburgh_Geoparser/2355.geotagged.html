<p><span class="loc">Peru</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Nemaha County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 865 at the 2010 census. Peru State College is located in <span class="loc">Peru</span>. The first attempt to settle the community occurred in 1853 when some residents of <span class="loc">Peru</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. However troops from Fort Kearney forced them to leave because <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> Territory was still occupied by the <span class="loc">Otoe</span> (tribe). They then temporarily settled across the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River at <span class="loc">Sonora</span> (now Watson, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>). In 1857 a community formed around a trading post called <span class="loc">Mount Vernon</span> on the bluffs above the river on the <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> side. In 1857 settlers founded <span class="loc">Peru</span> down the hill from <span class="loc">Mount Vernon</span> directly on the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. In 1861 a Methodist school called Mount Vernon Academy opened. In 1867 the school (which became Peru State College) became the state's first normal school. Floods in the 1860s changed the course of the river pushing it nearly a mile from <span class="loc">Peru</span>. An 1867 flood caused the <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> community of <span class="loc">McKissick Island</span> northeast of <span class="loc">Peru</span> to be surrounded by <span class="loc">Missouri</span> land and cause a border dispute that would not be resolved until 1999.</p>
