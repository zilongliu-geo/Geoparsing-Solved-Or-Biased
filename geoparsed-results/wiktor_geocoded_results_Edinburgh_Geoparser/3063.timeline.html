  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Trenton is a city in <span class="loc">Grundy County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,001 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Grundy County</span>. The city claims to be the world's largest producer of vienna sausages (at its biggest employer ConAgra Grocery Foods plant). Trenton was first settled in <span class="date">1834</span> and was known as Lomax Store for the <span class="per">J.S. Lomax General Store</span> on a bluff above the <span class="per">Thompson Branch</span> of the <span class="loc">Grand River</span> (<span class="loc">Missouri</span>). It was renamed Bluff Grove and won a battle with <span class="loc">Tindall</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> to become the county seat of <span class="loc">Grundy County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The hilly area <span class="date">today</span> is called the "<span class="loc">Green Hills</span>." It was renamed again in <span class="date">1842</span> in honor of Trenton, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. The <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and Southwestern Railroad (which became part of the Rock Island Line) arrived in <span class="date">1869</span>. In <span class="date">1890</span> <span class="org">Avalon College</span>, which had been founded in <span class="loc">Avalon</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> by the United Brethren in <span class="date">1869</span> moved to Trenton because of proximity to the railroad. The <span class="org">College</span> nearly closed again. . In <span class="date">1900</span> <span class="per">George McAnelly</span> Miller started to turn the school around. He was soon joined by <span class="per">Walter Vrooman</span> who had just returned from <span class="loc">Oxford</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> where he established <span class="loc">Ruskin</span> Hall, a university called the "<span class="org">College</span> for the People" based on the Utopian Socialist writings of <span class="per">John Ruskin</span>. <span class="org">Avalon College</span> was renamed <span class="org">Ruskin College</span> after <span class="per">Vrooman</span> donated 1,500 acres (6.1 km2) to it.</p><br><br>
