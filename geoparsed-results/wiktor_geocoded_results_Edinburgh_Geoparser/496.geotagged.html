<p><span class="loc">Nazareth</span> (/ˈnæzərəθ/; Hebrew: נָצְרַת, Naṣrat; Aramaic: ܢܨܪܬ‎, Naṣrath; Arabic: النَّاصِرَة‎, an-Nāṣira) is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of <span class="loc">Israel</span>. <span class="loc">Nazareth</span> is known as "the Arab capital of <span class="loc">Israel</span>". The population is made up predominantly of Israeli Arabs, almost all of whom are either Muslim (69%) or Christian (30.9%). <span class="loc">Nazareth Illit</span> (lit. "<span class="loc">Upper Nazareth</span>") is built alongside old <span class="loc">Nazareth</span>, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974. In the New Testament, the city is described as the childhood home of Jesus, and as such is a center of Christian pilgrimage, with many shrines commemorating biblical events. One conjecture holds that "Nazareth" is derived from one of the Hebrew words for 'branch', namely ne·ṣer, נֵ֫צֶר, and alludes to the prophetic, messianic words in Book of Isaiah 11:1, 'from (Jesse's) roots a Branch (netzer) will bear fruit'. One view suggests this toponym might be an example of a tribal name used by resettling groups on their return from exile. Alternatively, the name may derive from the verb na·ṣar, נָצַר, "watch, guard, keep," and understood either in the sense of "watchtower" or "guard place", implying the early town was perched on or near the brow of the hill, or, in the passive sense as 'preserved, protected' in reference to its secluded position. The negative references to <span class="loc">Nazareth</span> in the Gospel of John suggest that ancient Jews did not connect the town's name to prophecy.</p>
