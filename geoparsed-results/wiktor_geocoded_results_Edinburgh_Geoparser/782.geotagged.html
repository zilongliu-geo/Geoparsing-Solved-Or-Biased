<p><span class="loc">Riverside</span> is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Wichita</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. A mostly residential area located between the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> and Little <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Rivers, it is home to several of the city's museums and large parks. <span class="loc">Riverside</span> was founded in March 1886 when the <span class="loc">Riverside</span> Land Company, led by developer James Oakley Davidson, had the area surveyed and platted. The company intended for the new neighborhood to be <span class="loc">Wichita</span>'s most stylish residential area and supported the construction of bridges and a trolley line to connect it to downtown. The local real estate market collapsed the next year, however, and development stalled for a decade. By 1889, several of the company's investors, including Davidson and Burton Campbell, had built large, luxurious homes for themselves. Campbell's mansion, modeled after a Scottish castle, became known as Campbell Castle or Crumb Castle locally and was eventually designated a historical landmark. In 1897, the <span class="loc">Wichita city</span> government purchased land in the neighborhood and began developing parks. It also built two more bridges, increasing access to the area and attracting more home buyers. <span class="loc">Riverside</span> became a popular recreational area for local residents, and development continued over the ensuing decades. The <span class="loc">Riverside</span> Boathouse opened on the <span class="loc">Little Arkansas River</span> in the late 1890s followed by a zoo in Central <span class="loc">Riverside</span> Park in 1921 and a public swimming pool in South <span class="loc">Riverside</span> Park in 1923. The Wichita Art Museum opened in 1935. In 1938, the Works Progress Administration replaced the pool with a second pool called Municipal Beach.</p>
