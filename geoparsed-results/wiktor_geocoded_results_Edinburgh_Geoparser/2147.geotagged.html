<p><span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is a market town in <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is the main town in the <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> local government district and is a part of the <span class="loc">Mansfield Urban</span> Area. Nestling in a pocket within the <span class="loc">Maun</span> Valley surrounded by hills, the town is around 12 miles (19 km) north of <span class="loc">Nottingham</span>. The <span class="loc">district of Mansfield</span> is a largely urban area situated in the north west of <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span> populated by 99,600 residents, the vast majority of whom live in <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> (including <span class="loc">Mansfield Woodhouse</span>), with <span class="loc">Market Warsop</span> a secondary centre, and the remainder in the rural north of the district. Adjacent to the urban area of Sutton-in-Ashfield, <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is the only major sub-regional centre in <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span> covering an area of 30 square miles (78 sq km). The Centre for Cities (2009) categorises the town as a 'small city', although it does not officially hold city status. <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is the only local authority area in the county to have a directly elected Mayor and in October 2008 <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> elected its first Youth Mayor. Historically, the district has been influenced heavily by its industrial past with coal mining and textiles thriving in the district until their decline in the 1990s, but in common with the national economy the area has seen the decline of these sectors. <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> has 20.2% (12,890) of its working age population seeking key out of work benefits (based on a 63,800 total working age population) (NOMIS).</p>
