<p>Anderson is a city in the <span class="loc">Denali Borough</span>, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and the borough's only incorporated community. At the 2010 census the population was 246, down from 367 at the 2000 census. The city is named after one of the original homesteaders. Anderson is named after Arthur Anderson, one of several homesteaders who settled in the area in the late 1950s. In 1959, Anderson subdivided his homestead into house lots and sold most of the lots to civilian workers from Clear Air Force Station, a Ballistic Missile Early Warning System station completed in 1961. An elementary school was built in the community in 1961, and Anderson incorporated as a city on June 2, 1962. In the 1960s, a road was completed between Anderson and Nenana. A ferry across the <span class="loc">Tanana River</span> at Nenana provided access to the Fairbanksâ€“Nenana Highway, and hence to Fairbanks and the contiguous North American highway system via the <span class="loc">Richardson</span> and <span class="loc">Alaska Highways</span>. The ferry was replaced with a bridge in 1968. In 1972, the George Parks Highway was completed, which provided direct road access to points south, including Anchorage.</p>
