<p>The <span class="loc">City of Louisville</span> /ˈluːɪsvɪl/ is a Home Rule Municipality in <span class="loc">Boulder County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city population was 18,376 at the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. <span class="loc">Louisville</span> began as a rough mining community in 1877, suffered through a period of extraordinary labor violence early in the 20th century, and then, when the mines closed in the 1950s, made a transition to a suburban residential community. According to CNN/Money and Money magazine's list of the 100 best places to live in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="loc">Louisville</span> was placed third in 2007, first in 2009 and 2011, and second in 2013. The town of <span class="loc">Louisville</span> dates back to the start of the Welch Mine in 1877, the first coal mine in an area of Boulder and Weld counties known as the Northern Coalfield. The town was named for Louis Nawatny, a local landowner who platted his land and named it for himself. Incorporation came several years later, in 1882. The Northern Coalfield proved to be highly productive, and eventually some 30 different mines operated within the current boundaries of <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, though not all at the same time. During the years of peak production (1907–09) twelve mines were in operation in <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, including the Acme Mine whose two million tons of coal came from directly beneath the center of town. The presence of many independent mining companies in <span class="loc">Louisville</span> saved the town from becoming a "company town", wholly owned and dominated by a single mining company.</p>
