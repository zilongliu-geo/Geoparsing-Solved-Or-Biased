<p>Kingston is a village and a census-designated place in the town of <span class="loc">South Kingstown</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and the site of the main campus of the University of <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. Much of the village center is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Kingston Village Historic District. The village was originally called <span class="loc">Little Rest</span>, but was renamed Kingston in 1826. It was the county seat for <span class="loc">Washington County</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Kings County</span>) from 1752 until 1894, when a new courthouse was built in nearby <span class="loc">West Kingston</span>. <span class="loc">West Kingston</span> is also the site of the historic 120-year-old Kingston Railroad Station, which is served by Amtrak on its Northeast Corridor. <span class="loc">South Kingstown</span> established the Kingston Historic District in 1959, and much of Kingston village became a National Register historic district in 1974 as Kingston Village Historic District. The historic district is located just outside the campus of the University of <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, and contains many fine examples of 18th and 19th century architecture. The historic district includes 38 buildings. The University of <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> was established at Kingston in 1888 as the <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> Agricultural School and Agricultural Experiment Station, by funding from the Hatch Act of 1887. In 1892 the Agricultural School became the <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts with funding from the Second Morrill Land Grant Act of 1890, later becoming <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> State College in 1909 and the University of <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> in 1951.</p>
