<p>Winchester is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Tullahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population of Winchester as of the 2010 census was 8,530, showing an increase of 1,201 from 2000. Winchester was created as the seat of justice for <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> by act of the <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> Legislature on November 22, 1809, and was laid out the following year. The town is named for James Winchester, a soldier in the American Revolution, first Speaker of the <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> Legislature, and a Brigadier General in the War of 1812. The Mary Sharp College (originally the "<span class="loc">Tennessee</span> and <span class="loc">Alabama Female</span> Institute", but later renamed in honor of Mary Corn Sharp, a donor) was founded in 1851 by Dr. Z. C. Graves and the Baptist Church. Though a women's college, it offered a classical curriculum based upon what was being offered at the time by Amherst College, Brown University, and the University of Virginia. It closed in 1896. During the 19th century, the institution helped make <span class="loc">Winchester</span> an educational center. Other private schools in the city were Carrick Academy for male students (founded in 1809), Winchester Female Academy (founded in 1835), and Winchester Normal College.</p>
