  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kumba</span> is a city in Southwest Region, Western <span class="loc">Cameroon</span> also known as K town. <span class="loc">Kumba</span> has an estimated population of about 400.000 inhabitants with about ¾ of this population falling within the youthful age group. The increase in population is as a result of increase in birth rate and a fall in infant mortality rate as a result of improvement in Infant health care and migrations (Rural – Urban). The N8 and N16 highways meet at <span class="loc">Kumba</span>. The city is a trade centre for <span class="per">Cocoa</span> and <span class="per">Palm</span> Oil, and has a timber industry as well. <span class="loc">Kumba</span> is a local road junction, making it the main commercial town in anglophone <span class="loc">Cameroon</span>. Trading in <span class="loc">Kumba</span> has attracted the interest of foreigners, mostly Nigerians (The Igbos), who have always controlled a greater percentage of the <span class="loc">Kumba</span> main market. (culled from a personal survey, <span class="date">January 2011</span>) Although it is the largest city in the southwest province of <span class="loc">Cameroon</span>, it is not the provincial capital; which is located in <span class="loc">Buea</span>, the former German colonial capital. Because of its size, most major roads to the provincial interior radiate from <span class="loc">Kumba</span>, running to the Nigerian border at <span class="loc">Mamfe</span>, the Korup National Park at <span class="loc">Mundemba</span>, and Mount Koupe to the east. The premier geographical attraction in <span class="loc">Kumba</span> is <span class="loc">Barombi Mbo</span>, the largest volcanic lake in <span class="loc">Cameroon</span>'s volcanic chain.</p><br><br>
