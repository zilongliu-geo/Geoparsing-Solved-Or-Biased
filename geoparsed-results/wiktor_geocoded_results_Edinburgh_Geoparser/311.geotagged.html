<p>Wellington is a small industrial town in rural <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, situated 7 miles (11 km) south west of <span class="loc">Taunton</span> in the <span class="loc">Taunton</span> <span class="loc">Deane district</span>, near the border with <span class="loc">Devon</span>, which runs along the <span class="loc">Blackdown</span> Hills to the south of the town. The town has a population of 14,549, which includes the residents of the <span class="loc">parish of Wellington</span> Without, and the villages of Tone and Tonedale. Known as Weolingtun in the Anglo-Saxon period, its name had changed to Walintone by the time of the Domesday Book of 1086. Wellington became a town under a royal charter of 1215 and during the Middle Ages it grew as a centre for trade on the road from <span class="loc">Bristol</span> to <span class="loc">Exeter</span>. Major rebuilding took place following a fire in the town in 1731, after which it became a centre for cloth-making. Wellington gave its name to the first Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, who is commemorated by the nearby <span class="loc">Wellington Monument</span>. The <span class="loc">Grand Western Canal</span> reached the town in 1835 and then the <span class="loc">Bristol</span> and <span class="loc">Exeter Railway</span> in 1843. The town's own railway station survived until 1964. Wellington was home of Fox, Fowler and Company, which was the last commercial bank permitted to print their own sterling banknotes in <span class="loc">England</span> and <span class="loc">Wales</span>. In the 20th century closer links with <span class="loc">Taunton</span> meant that many of the residents of Wellington commuted there for work, and the M5 motorway enabled car journeys to be made more easily.</p>
