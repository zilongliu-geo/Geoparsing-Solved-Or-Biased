  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Soho</span> is an area of the <span class="loc">City of Westminster</span> and is part of London's <span class="loc">West End</span>. Long established as an entertainment district, for much of the 20th century <span class="loc">Soho</span> had a reputation as a base for the sex industry in addition to its night life and its location for the headquarters of leading film companies. Since <span class="date">the 1980s</span>, the area has undergone considerable gentrification. It is <span class="date">now</span> predominantly a fashionable district of upmarket restaurants and media offices, with only a small remnant of sex industry venues. <span class="loc">Soho</span> is a small, multicultural area of central <span class="loc">London</span>; a home to industry, commerce, culture and entertainment, as well as a residential area for both rich and poor. It has clubs, including the former Chinawhite nightclub; public houses; bars; restaurants; a few sex shops scattered amongst them; and late-night coffee shops that give the streets an "open-all-night" feel at the <span class="date">weekends</span>. Record shops cluster in the area around <span class="loc">Berwick</span> Street, with shops such as Blackmarket <span class="per">Records</span> and <span class="per">Vinyl</span> Junkies. On <span class="date">many weekends</span>, <span class="loc">Soho</span> is busy enough to warrant closing off some of the streets to vehicles. <span class="loc">Westminster City</span> Council pedestrianised parts of <span class="loc">Soho</span> in the mid-1990s, but later removed much of the pedestrianisation, apparently after complaints of loss of trade from local businesses.</p><br><br>
