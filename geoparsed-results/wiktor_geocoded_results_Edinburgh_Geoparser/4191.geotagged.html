<p><span class="loc">Dundee</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Nobles County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, United States The population was 68 at the 2010 census. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.31 square miles (0.80 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> is located in the extreme northeastern corner of <span class="loc">Nobles County</span>. The <span class="loc">Murray County</span> line defines Dundee's northern border, and the <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> line defines its eastern border. Main highways Include: <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> State Highway 62 (west) <span class="loc">Nobles County</span> Road 1 <span class="loc">Dundee</span> was established in 1879 when the St. Paul and Sioux City Railway Company built a branch line, then known as the <span class="loc">Heron Lake</span> &amp; Black Hills Railroad. The first station out of <span class="loc">Heron Lake</span> was proposed in the extreme northeastern corner of <span class="loc">Nobles County</span>, and was originally named Warren, in honor of Joseph Warren who fell at the Battle of <span class="loc">Bunker Hill</span>. The town was surveyed and platted in July 1879, and construction of a depot began on August 13. Mr. G. Foils moved to town and assumed duties of stationmaster on September 1. He was also named postmaster when a post office was established on November 1, 1879. It was at this time that the name was changed to <span class="loc">Dundee</span>, after the <span class="loc">city of Dundee</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. The reason for the name change is lost to history, although it is known that stationmaster/postmaster G. Foils (whose first name is also lost to history) made the change. A Scottish Company known as the Dundee Improvement Company was then financing construction of an elevator, general store, and hotel in nearby <span class="loc">Kinbrae</span>, and perhaps Mr. Foils thought he could attract investment in <span class="loc">Dundee</span>. The first business was opened in the spring of 1880 by F. D. Lindquist and H. A. Scherlie. Several homes were also built in that second year, but real growth for <span class="loc">Dundee</span> did not occur until the late-nineties when the country began to recover from the Panic of 1893. A census taken on December 23, 1897, gave the village a population of 187. At this time, citizens petitioned for incorporation, and on January 4, 1898, the county commissioners granted their request. A special election was held on February 15, and on March 11, 1898, the <span class="loc">Dundee</span> council met for the first time. F. D. Lindquist was named village president.</p>
