  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Jackson is the county seat of <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. Located 70 miles east of Memphis, it has long been associated with the large city in trade. Its total population was 65,211 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census and 67,265 in the <span class="date">2012</span> Census estimate. Jackson is the primary city of the Jackson, <span class="loc">Tennessee metropolitan</span> area, which is included in the Jackson-Humboldt, <span class="org">Tennessee Combined Statistical Area</span>. Jackson is <span class="loc">Madison County</span>'s largest city, and the second largest city in <span class="per">West Tennessee</span> next to Memphis. It is home to the <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span>'s courthouse for <span class="per">West Tennessee</span>, as Jackson was the major city in the west when the court was established in <span class="date">1834</span>. In the antebellum era, Jackson was the market city for an agricultural area based on cultivation of cotton, the major commodity crop. Beginning in <span class="date">1851</span>, the city became a hub of railroad systems ultimately connecting to major markets in the north and south, as well as east and west. This was key to its development, attracting trade and many workers on the railroads in the late 19th century with the construction of railroads after the American Civil War. Through <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, the city was served by 15 passenger trains daily, but industry restructuring reduced such service and caused the loss of jobs. The economy has adjusted to new businesses, with major manufacturing in the area.</p><br><br>
