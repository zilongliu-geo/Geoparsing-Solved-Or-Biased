  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A suspected case of BSE, better known as mad cow disease, has been discovered in <span class="loc">Sweden</span> at a farm near Västerås some 80 kilometres west of <span class="loc">Stockholm</span>. The affected farm has been quarantined and no ruminants from the farm are allowed to be sold or transported. The cow was destroyed earlier after symptoms of calving paralysis had been discovered, and the tests where carried out in accordance to rules set by the European Union (<span class="org">EU</span>). The <span class="org">Swedish Board of Agriculture</span> (Jordbruksverket) analysed a specimen from the cow at the farm <span class="date">this weekend</span>. The tests confirmed the presence of BSE and the specimen was sent for further analysis at a <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> laboratory. If the British analysis confirms BSE in the specimen, it will be the first case of BSE in <span class="loc">Sweden</span>. The affected farmer told the Swedish public service radio: "As my father said, if we have to make history it would be a pity to do it this way." BSE isn't transmitted directly between animals, but rather from feedstuffs containing tainted tissues from infected ruminants to healthy animals. Such cattle feeds have been prohibited in <span class="loc">Sweden</span> for <span class="date">many years</span>, but as the affected cow was born in <span class="date">1994</span> she might have been given such food in her early life. The disease has been declining in the <span class="org">EU</span> after restrictions and regulations were put in place or tightened following an epidemic of the disease in humans in the <span class="loc">UK</span>. In that outbreak 150 people died. <span class="loc">Sweden</span> has been considered a low-risk country. Ten previous tests have all proven to be false alarms.</p><br><br>
