The city is located in the <span class="loc">Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky metropolitan</span> area. The population was 9,897 as of the 2010 census.

Harrison Township was established in 1850, formerly part of Crosby Township.

Harrison was the home of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s fifth governor Othneil Looker. It was one of the few stops in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> on the <span class="loc">Whitewater</span> Canal, built between 1836 and 1847, which spanned a distance of 76 miles (122 km). On July 13, 1863, Morgan's Raiders, a Confederate cavalry force, invaded. The column passed through taking fresh horses and burning the bridge over the <span class="loc">Whitewater River</span> near the southwest part of the town. The first train came to Harrison Township in 1864. In 1882 Harrison Depot was built at <span class="loc">West Broadway</span> and Railroad Avenue. It later burned to the ground.</p>
