  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Avondale</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Auckland</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, located in the <span class="loc">Whau ward</span>, one of the thirteen administrative divisions for the <span class="org">Auckland Council</span>. It is commonly considered to be part of <span class="loc">West Auckland</span>. It was originally called "<span class="loc">Te Whau</span>", which is the common name, of MƒÅori origin, for Entelea arborescens, a native tree. Its postcode is <span class="date">1026</span>. The first European settler in the area was <span class="per">John Sheddon</span> Adam in <span class="date">1843</span>, but settlement did not occur in larger numbers until the late 1850s, with the completion of Great North Road. Expansion was rapid, with churches, stores and a public hall built by <span class="date">1867</span>. With a railway connection to the settlement in <span class="date">1880</span>, the rate of settlement increased further. <span class="loc">Te Whau</span> became <span class="loc">Avondale District</span> on <span class="date">5 June 1882</span>, although the old name survives in the <span class="loc">Whau River</span>, an estuarial arm of the <span class="loc">Waitemata Harbour</span>, which runs along the western edge of the suburb. A prominent community leader and Member of Parliament was <span class="per">John Bollard</span>, who lived in <span class="loc">Avondale</span> from <span class="date">1861</span> to <span class="date">1915</span>. Early industries included brickyards, tanneries, mills and pottery works. <span class="loc">Avondale</span> also had numerous market gardens, especially on the <span class="loc">Rosebank</span> Peninsula. It was here that the "Hayward" cultivar of the Chinese gooseberry, later known as the kiwifruit, was developed by <span class="per">Hayward Wright</span>.</p><br><br>
