<p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Lamoille County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,659 at the 2010 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> includes the villages of <span class="loc">Jeffersonville</span> and <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>. Granted on November 7, 1780, <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> was chartered on August 13, 1781 to Samuel Robinson, John Fassett, Jr., Jonathan Frost and 64 others. It was first settled in 1783 by John Safford from <span class="loc">Piermont</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. The intervales proved good but rough, best for grazing livestock. By 1839, the town had about 7,000 sheep. The <span class="loc">Lamoille River</span> offered water power for watermills. Industries included one woolen factory, one tannery, one gristmill, plus several sawmills and cabinet shops. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> and neighboring <span class="loc">Johnson</span> were together known as the King's College Tract, being created by Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Colden by authority of British King George III in 1764. The King's College Tract was reserved for the eventual establishment of a university on the site. The place name <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> suggests Cambridge University in <span class="loc">England</span>. Johnson, the other town in the King's College Grant, was named for William Samuel Johnson.</p>
