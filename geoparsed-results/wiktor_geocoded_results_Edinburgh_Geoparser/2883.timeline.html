As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 336,463, making it the fourth-most populous county in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Chattanooga</span>. The county was named for <span class="per">Alexander Hamilton</span>, the first Secretary of the Treasury. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Chattanooga</span>, <span class="loc">TN-GA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> was formed on <span class="date">October 25, 1819</span> from portions of <span class="loc">Rhea County</span> and Indian land. It was named after <span class="per">Alexander Hamilton</span>, an officer in the American Revolutionary War, member of the Continental Congress, the first <span class="loc">US</span> Secretary of Treasury, and one of the founding fathers of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> was the site of an important saltpeter mine during the Civil War. <span class="loc">Saltpeter</span> is the main ingredient of gunpowder and was obtained by leaching the earth from caves. Lookout Mountain Cave was a major source of saltpeter during the Civil War. The mine was operated by <span class="per">Robert Cravens</span>, who owned the property where the cave is located. In <span class="date">May 1861</span>, Cravens contracted with the <span class="org">Tennessee Military and Financial Board</span> to deliver 20,000 pounds of saltpeter. On the 24th of the same month, he reported that he had ten hoppers already set up in his cave. Cravens was also mining <span class="loc">Nickajack</span> Cave in nearby <span class="loc">Marion County</span>. In <span class="date">1862</span> he quit mining at Lookout Mountain Cave and rented the cave to the <span class="org">Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau</span>, which mined the cave from <span class="date">June 1862</span> through <span class="date">July 1863</span>. Mining ceased when <span class="loc">Chattanooga</span> was occupied by Federal forces in <span class="date">1863</span>.</p><br><br>
