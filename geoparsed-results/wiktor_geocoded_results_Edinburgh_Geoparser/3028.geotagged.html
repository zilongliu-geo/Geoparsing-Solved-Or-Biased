<p>Stanton is an unincorporated community located within <span class="loc">Readington Township</span> in <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The community dates back to the 17th century and was settled by the Dutch. It was originally called Housel's after Johannes Housel, who had a farmstead along Dreahook Road in the mid-18th century. After the death of William Housel (who started a school in the community), the last owner of the Housel farmstead, it then carried the name of Waggoner's Hill after landowner William Waggoner. The community took the descriptive name of <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> during the beginning of the 20th century and would finally become known as <span class="loc">Stanton</span> to distinguish it from another <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>. The name "Stanton" was taken from James Logan's <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> estate: <span class="loc">Stenton</span>, which in turn is named for the Scottish village where his father was born. Logan was a proprietor of <span class="loc">West Jersey</span>, a mayor of Philadelphia, and a Chief Justice of the <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. Logan Way in <span class="loc">Readington</span> is named after him, as well as <span class="loc">Logan Circle</span> and the Logan neighborhood in Philadelphia and Logan Township in <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. In the 1830s, a Reformed Church and a general store were built, both of which are present today.</p>
