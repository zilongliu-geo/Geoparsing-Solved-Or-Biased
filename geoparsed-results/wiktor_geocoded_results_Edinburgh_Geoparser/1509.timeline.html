  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Livingston</span> is a name sometimes applied to the northeastern portion of <span class="loc">West Brighton</span>, a neighborhood located on the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> of the New <span class="loc">York City</span> borough of <span class="loc">Staten Island</span>. While official boundaries do not exist for any designated places on <span class="loc">Staten Island</span>, <span class="loc">Livingston</span> is most commonly regarded as being enclosed by Bement Avenue on the west, the Kill Van Kull shoreline on the north, Henderson Avenue on the south, and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on the east. It is dominated by large, older homes built before <span class="date">1900</span>, and its streets are shaded by spreading oak and elm trees. One of the first Europeans to settle the area was <span class="per">Francis Lovelace</span>, the second governor of the <span class="loc">New York</span> colony, who in <span class="date">1668</span> started farming in the area that would become <span class="per">Livingston</span>. The original name for the district was <span class="loc">Elliotville</span>, after a renowned ophthalmologist, <span class="per">Samuel MacKenzie Elliot</span>, who by <span class="date">1840</span> had acquired more than 30 homes in the community. The present name of <span class="per">Livingston</span> was coined by officials of the <span class="loc">Staten Island</span> Railway who bought the mansion of resident <span class="per">Anson Livingston</span> and then gave that name to a station built near the current intersection of <span class="loc">Richmond</span> <span class="per">Terrace</span> and <span class="per">Bard</span> Avenue. This station was situated on the now-defunct <span class="loc">North Shore</span> branch of the railway, on which passenger service ceased in <span class="date">1953</span>; the tracks on this branch are still there, but all traces of the <span class="per">Livingston</span> station have been removed, as is the case with the two other former stations on either side (Sailors' Snug Harbor and <span class="loc">West Brighton</span>).</p><br><br>
