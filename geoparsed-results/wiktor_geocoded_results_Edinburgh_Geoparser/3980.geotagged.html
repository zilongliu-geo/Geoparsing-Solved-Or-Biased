<p>Brewster is a city in <span class="loc">Nobles County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 473 at the 2010 census. Founding of Brewster: The town of Brewster was in established in the spring of 1872, but was known for many years as Hersey. It was the first town established in <span class="loc">Nobles County</span> by the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad, and was named after General Samuel F. Hersey, a lumber baron from <span class="loc">Maine</span>, and one of the railroad's directors. The first resident was W. R. Bennett, who came to take charge of the railroad station. T. J. Smith put up the first store which was run by A. J. Timlin for many years. Mr. A. O. Conde established a lumber yard and a grain business, Martin Heiser opened a second store, a hotel was opened by a Mr. Humphrey, and John Iverson established a blacksmith shop. All of this occurred in 1872, the same year that A. J. Timlin became postmaster. Source of name: In 1880, the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad was purchased by the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, St. Paul, <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span> and <span class="loc">Omaha Railway</span>, or the <span class="loc">Omaha Road</span>, and there was already a station named Hersey on the latter road's track in <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. In order to avoid confusion, the name of Hersey was changed, briefly to <span class="loc">Nobles County</span> Station. Soon thereafter, the name Brewster was settled upon. There is some confusion regarding the choice of name. E. F. Drake, president of the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad once stated that the name "was changed to Brewster after a director of the <span class="loc">Omaha Road</span>." But a brochure later put out by the <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and North Western Railway Company stated that "the present name was given in honor of Brewster, a town in <span class="loc">Barnstable County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, which was named in honor of Elder William Brewster, one of the first settlers of <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span>."</p>
