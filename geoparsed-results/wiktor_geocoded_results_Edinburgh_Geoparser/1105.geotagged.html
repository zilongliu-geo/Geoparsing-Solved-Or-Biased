<p><span class="loc">Chester</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Delaware County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with a population of 33,972 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Chester</span> is situated on the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River, between the <span class="loc">cities of Philadelphia and Wilmington</span>, <span class="loc">Delaware</span>. The first European settlers in the area were Swedes. They called the settlement that became <span class="loc">Chester</span> first "Finlandia" (the Latin name for <span class="loc">Finland</span>), then "Upland" (see the Swedish <span class="loc">province of Uppland</span> and the <span class="loc">borough of Upland</span>). They built Fort Mecoponacka in 1641 to defend the settlement. By 1682, Upland was the most populous town of the new <span class="loc">Province of Pennsylvania</span>. On October 27, the ship Welcome arrived at the town, bearing <span class="loc">William Penn</span> on his first visit to the province. <span class="loc">Penn</span> renamed the settlement for the English <span class="loc">city of Chester</span>. <span class="loc">Chester</span> served as the county seat for <span class="loc">Chester County</span>, which then stretched from the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River to the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span>. In 1789, the city became the county seat for the newly created <span class="loc">Delaware County</span> (whereupon <span class="loc">Chester County</span> became landlocked, with <span class="loc">West Chester</span> as its county seat), but the county seat was moved to the <span class="loc">borough of Media</span> in 1851. The courthouse is near the new City Hall building.</p>
