<p><span class="loc">Buxton</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Norfolk</span>, located between <span class="loc">Norwich</span> and <span class="loc">Aylsham</span>. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1085. <span class="loc">Buxton</span> is adjacent to the village of Lamas. The two villages are separated by the <span class="loc">River Bure</span> at <span class="loc">Buxton</span> Mill but are otherwise indistinguishable. Together they form the civil <span class="loc">parish of Buxton</span> with Lamas. <span class="loc">Buxton</span>'s main claim to fame is as the home village and burial place of Anna Sewell, author of <span class="loc">Black Beauty</span>. These claims are a little exaggerated. She is in fact is buried at the former Quaker Meeting-House in the village of Lamas, just over the river, and is more properly associated with the village of <span class="loc">Old Catton</span>, now a suburb of <span class="loc">Norwich</span>. The Sewell family, and their predecessors, the Wrights dwelt at <span class="loc">Dudwick</span> Park, a mansion in a private park on one side of the village. This was bought by John Wright (1728-1798), a wealthy Quaker Banker. His endowments founded the present school, as well as the <span class="loc">Red House</span>, an institution for young offenders which stood where the Rowan House complex now stands. These were erected by his grandson and heir, the second John Wright (1794-1871). He married a member of the <span class="loc">Harford</span> family, also Quakers, but died without issue, the property passing in 1856 to his sister's eldest son, Phillip Sewell, another Quaker banker. Phillip Sewell, the brother of Anna Sewell, was a major local benefactor, and enlarged the local school, a fact still recorded on a memorial plaque on the old buildings. The Sewells, like many Quaker landlords, were philanthropists, and gave the village a Reading Room, as well as supporting a school and reformatory. Their last gift to the community was the Village Hall, built 1927 and since extended. The Sewell connection ended in 1937, when P. E. Sewell, a <span class="loc">Ceylon</span> Tea-planter, died, leaving <span class="loc">Dudwick</span> Park to Percy Briscoe, a friend from <span class="loc">Ceylon</span>. The house was entirely rebuilt in the early part of the twentieth century, and, externally, no trace remains of the house which Anna Sewell would have known.</p>
