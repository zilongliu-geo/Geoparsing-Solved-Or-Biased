<p><span class="loc">Chamba</span> (Hindi: चम्बा) is an ancient town in the <span class="loc">Chamba district</span> in the state of <span class="loc">Himachal Pradesh</span>, in northern <span class="loc">India</span>. According to the 2001 Indian census, <span class="loc">Chamba</span> has a population of 20,312 people. Located at an altitude of 996 metres (3,268 ft) above mean sea level, the town is situated on the banks of the <span class="loc">Ravi River</span> (a major tributary of the Trans-Himalayan <span class="loc">Indus River</span>), at its confluence with the <span class="loc">Sal River</span>. Chambial were the Rulers of <span class="loc">Chamba</span> dynasty Chambials use suffix Varmans. Though historical records date the history of the <span class="loc">Chamba region</span> to the Kolian tribes in the 2nd century BC, the area was formally ruled by the Maru dynasty, starting with the Raju Maru from around 500 AD, ruling from the ancient capital of <span class="loc">Bharmour</span>, which is located 75 kilometres (47 mi) from the town of <span class="loc">Chamba</span>. In 920, <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="loc">Sahil</span> <span class="loc">Varman</span> (or <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="loc">Sahil</span> <span class="loc">Verma</span>) shifted the capital of the kingdom to <span class="loc">Chamba</span>, following the specific request of his daughter Champavati  (Chamba was named after her). From the time of Raju Maru, 67 Rajas of this dynasty have ruled over <span class="loc">Chamba</span> until it finally merged with the Indian Union in April 1948, although <span class="loc">Chamba</span> was under British suzerainty from 1846 to this time.</p>
