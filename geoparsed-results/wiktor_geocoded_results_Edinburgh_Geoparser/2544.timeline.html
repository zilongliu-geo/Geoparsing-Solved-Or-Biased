  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Shanxi</span> (Chinese: 山西; pinyin:  Shānxī; postal: <span class="loc">Shansi</span>) is a <span class="loc">province of China</span>, located in the <span class="loc">North China region</span>. Its one-character abbreviation is "晋" (pinyin: Jìn), after the state of <span class="loc">Jin</span> that existed here during the Spring and <span class="date">Autumn</span> Period. The name <span class="loc">Shanxi</span> means "<span class="org">West of the Mountains</span>", a reference to the province's location west of the <span class="loc">Taihang</span> Mountains. Shanxi borders <span class="loc">Hebei</span> to the east, Henan to the south, Shaanxi to the west, and <span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span> to the north and is made up mainly of a plateau bounded partly by mountain ranges. The capital of the province is <span class="loc">Taiyuan</span>. In the Spring and <span class="date">Autumn</span> Period (722–403 BC), the state of <span class="loc">Jin</span> was located in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Shanxi</span>. It underwent a three-way split into the states of <span class="loc">Han</span>, <span class="loc">Zhao</span> and <span class="loc">Wei</span> in <span class="date">403 BC</span>, the traditional date taken as the start of the Warring States period (403–221 BC). By <span class="date">221 BC</span>, all of these states had fallen to the state of Qin, which established the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC).</p><br><br>
