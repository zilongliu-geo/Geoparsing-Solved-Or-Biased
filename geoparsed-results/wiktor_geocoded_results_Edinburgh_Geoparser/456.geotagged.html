Waterloo's history dates back to the 18th century, with the French being the first Europeans to settle in the area. The site was ideal because of its elevation; the proximity of the Mississippi River Valley brought frequent flooding to the lowlands. It was also close to Fort de <span class="loc">Chartres</span>, a French stronghold. They named their settlement <span class="loc">Bellefontaine</span>, meaning 'beautiful spring.' This name related to a spring of water a mile south of the site of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>, a frequent campsite on journeys between <span class="loc">Kaskaskia</span>, <span class="loc">Cahokia</span>, and St. Louis.</p>
