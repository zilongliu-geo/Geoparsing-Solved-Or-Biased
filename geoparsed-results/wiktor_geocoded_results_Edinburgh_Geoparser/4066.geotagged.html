<p><span class="loc">Birmingham</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Huntingdon County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 90 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> is the site of the Birmingham Window, a geologic structure created by a Paleozoic thrust fault. Birmingham's early settler, John Cadwallader, settled on a hill above the <span class="loc">Little Juniata River</span> and made plans to establish a large city. Legend among the local residents is that it was once in consideration to be the state capital. In the first several decades of the 19th century, the village grew quickly as a hub for commerce being carried on the <span class="loc">Little Juniata River</span> and on the nearby <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Canal. By 1850, the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Railroad had passed through the valley. The development of the railroad diminished the importance of <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> as a trading hub since the railroad's nearby hubs in Tyrone and Altoona grew quickly on land that was better suited for development. In 1853, the Mountain Female Seminary opened in <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> as a boarding school for girls. In its earliest years, the school benefited from the ease of transportation afforded by the passage of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> railroad through <span class="loc">Birmingham</span>. Currently, the school still operates as Grier School, a boarding school for girls.</p>
