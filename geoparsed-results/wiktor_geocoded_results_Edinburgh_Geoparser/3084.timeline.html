  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Monterey</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Berkshire County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Pittsfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 961 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Prior to official settlement, the area of <span class="loc">Monterey</span> was inhabited by Mahicans, the local Native American tribe. <span class="loc">Monterey</span> was first settled by colonists in <span class="date">1739</span> as a part of Housatonic Township Number One. The township had two villages, along Hop Brook to the north (modern <span class="loc">Tyringham</span>) and <span class="loc">Konkapot River</span> in the south (modern <span class="loc">Monterey</span>). The town was officially incorporated as <span class="loc">Tyringham</span> in <span class="date">1767</span>. In the earliest <span class="date">days</span> of <span class="date">1776</span>, General <span class="per">Henry Knox</span> passed through the town, bringing cannons from <span class="loc">Fort Ticonderoga</span> in <span class="loc">New York</span> to aid in ending the Siege of <span class="loc">Boston</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, the path he took is known as the <span class="per">Henry Knox</span> Trail. However, the long divide between the two towns led to their separation in <span class="date">1847</span>. Previously called <span class="per">Green Woods</span> or <span class="loc">South Tyringham</span>, the local people voted to name the new town <span class="loc">Monterey</span> to commemorate the Battle of <span class="loc">Monterey</span> that took place <span class="date">a year earlier</span> in the Mexicanâ€“American War. <span class="loc">Palo Alto</span> and <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> were also considered, but thought to be "too foreign sounding". The town was mostly known for its sawmills, but <span class="date">today</span> it is a rural community, known more for its recreational areas in the state forests and along <span class="loc">Lake Garfield</span>.</p><br><br>
