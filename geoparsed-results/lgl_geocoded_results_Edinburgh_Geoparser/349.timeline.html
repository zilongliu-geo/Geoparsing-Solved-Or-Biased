  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Old bills never die, they just wait for votes. Bay Area lawmakers continue to resurrect bills that died in previous Congresses, hoping that having a wider margin of majority in the <span class="org">House</span> and a Democrat in the White <span class="org">House</span> could bring the bills success this time around. For example, Rep. <span class="per">Barbara Lee</span>, D-Oakland, and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Sen. <span class="per">Frank Lautenberg</span>, D-N.J., <span class="date">today</span> reintroduced their Responsible Education About Life, or REAL, Act, which would authorize federal funding for comprehensive, age-appropriate, medically accurate sex education. For <span class="date">now</span>, such funding is available only for abstinence-only-until-marriage programs, which have been shown to exclude important information about contraception as a protection against pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. "It's time for us to get REAL about sex education," <span class="per">Lee</span> said in her news release. "We should absolutely be teaching young people about abstinence, but we shouldn't be holding back information that can save lives and prevent unwanted pregnancies. Instead of 'abstinence only,' what we're proposing is 'abstinence-plus.' " Elsewhere, Rep. <span class="per">Jerry McNerney</span>, D-Pleasanton, <span class="date">today</span> introduced H.R.1546, <span class="org">the Caring for Veterans</span> with Traumatic Brain Injury Act of <span class="date">2009</span>. The bill would establish a special panel within the <span class="org">Department of Veterans Affairs</span> to assess the department's capacity to treat veterans who have traumatic brain injuries as well as to make recommendations on developing policies for care and rehabilitation. It also would help establish TBI-specific education and training programs for VA's health professionals. "Many of our soldiers who have been wounded in <span class="loc">Iraq</span> have experienced a traumatic brain injury. In fact, traumatic brain injuries are the hallmark injuries of this war," <span class="per">McNerney</span> said in his news release. "It is incumbent on us to ensure that the (Department of Veterans Affairs) is equipped and ready to provide the ongoing services necessary to fully address the impact of traumatic brain injuries." <span class="per">McNerney</span> had introduced a similar bill in <span class="date">May 2007</span>, but that bill never emerged from committee. <span class="per">Tom Del</span> Beccaro of <span class="loc">Lafayette</span>, vice chairman of the California Republican Party, <span class="date">today</span> is helping to launch a new political action committee, called the "First Amendment <span class="date">Now</span> Campaign." The PAC is intended to combat what Del <span class="per">Beccaro</span> says are Democratic efforts to curtail conservative political speech. The main issue is the Fairness Doctrine, a Federal Communications Commission policy dating from <span class="date">1949</span> but abolished in <span class="date">1987</span> that required broadcast license holders to present controversial issues of public importance in a way the FCC considered honest, equitable and balanced. Although President <span class="per">Barack Obama</span> repeatedly has said he opposes reinstating it and the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senate <span class="date">last month</span> overwhelmingly approved an amendment nixing it, conservatives have continued to rally against it, leading some critics to wonder whether it's an intentional effort to dangle some red meat as a distraction from other issues. Still, <span class="per">Del</span> Beccaro, California Political News and Views publisher <span class="per">Steve Frank</span> and state Sen. <span class="per">Tony Strickland</span>, R-Moorpark, along with a bunch of conservative talk-radio personalities, are launching this new organization, asking for donations of $17.76 "to preserve our freedom." Besides the Fairness Doctrine, they say, they're concerned about <span class="per">Obama</span>'s calls for "localism," or requiring broadcast license holders to dedicate some of their airtime to the interests of their local community â€” obviously a concern for a conservative station such as KSFO-AM/560 that's located in an overwhelmingly liberal media market such as the Bay Area. And they're also worried about <span class="per">Obama</span>'s calls for broadcast media ownership diversity, dating to <span class="date">2007</span> and echoed <span class="date">now</span> in Congress. The president and supporters claim they're concerned about a lack of female and minority ownership in the broadcast media, but opponents claim it's just another backdoor way to undercut conservative free speech. So, expect to hear a lot about this all across your AM radio dial as this new organization holds a kickoff rally <span class="date">Tuesday</span> in <span class="loc">Sacramento</span>, on the <span class="loc">Capitol</span>'s north steps, and as it moves forward with an effort to gather a million petition signatures that it can present to <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Sens. <span class="per">Barbara Boxer</span> and <span class="per">Dianne Feinstein</span>, both of <span class="loc">California</span>. The PAC promises to use its money "to preserve the First Amendment; to oppose the Fairness Doctrine, government-imposed diversity and localism; and to oppose candidates that favor the Fairness Doctrine."</p><br><br>
