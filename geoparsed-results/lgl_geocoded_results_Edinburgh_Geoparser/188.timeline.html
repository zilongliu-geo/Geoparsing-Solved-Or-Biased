  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Man with sack charged with burglary. A man toting an accessory normally used by <span class="per">Santa Claus</span> caught the attention of deputies <span class="date">Saturday afternoon</span>. Kijuan <span class="per">D. McDonald</span> was hauling around a bulging white sack at 4:40 p.m. in the <span class="loc">Holly Heights</span> neighborhood of <span class="loc">Gainesville</span>. “That got our attention,” said <span class="loc">Alachua County</span> Sheriff’s Office spokesman <span class="per">Art Forgey</span>. While deputies chatted with <span class="per">McDonald</span>, 24, of Archer, about the contents of the bag &#x96; mostly electronics - other deputies were checking out a report of a burglary involving mostly electronics from a unit in the nearby Sparrow Condominiums at 601 SW 75th St. The discussion with <span class="per">McDonald</span> led them to an apartment at 6813 SW 4th Place that had been leased to <span class="per">Barry M. George</span>, 46. A few items found at <span class="per">George</span>’s apartment and the items in the white bag <span class="per">McDonald</span> had been carrying matched the descriptions of the items taken from the condominium. <span class="per">McDonald</span> and <span class="per">Barry</span> were charged with burglary of an unoccupied dwelling and theft. <span class="per">Barry</span> was also charged with two unrelated counts of failing to appear in court on previous case.</p><br><br>
