  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Trenton (<span class="date">2001</span> population 19,374) is a community in Southern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> in the municipality of <span class="loc">Quinte West</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Located on the <span class="loc">Bay of Quinte</span>, it is the main population centre in <span class="loc">Quinte</span> West, and is one of the largest freestanding unincorporated communities in the province. Trenton is the starting point for the Trent-Severn Waterway, which continues northwest to <span class="loc">Peterborough</span> and eventually <span class="loc">Port Severn</span> on <span class="loc">Georgian Bay</span>. The <span class="loc">Trent River</span> was known to the <span class="loc">Mississauga</span> as Sangichiwigewonk, or 'fast flowing.' It was named after the <span class="loc">River Trent</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. French explorer <span class="per">Samuel de Champlain</span> followed the <span class="loc">Trent</span> Severn passing through Trenton in <span class="date">1615</span>. The area around the mouth of the <span class="loc">Trent River</span> was first settled by Europeans in the 1780s. Assorted settlements and town plots in the area went under a number of names, until the Village of Trenton was incorporated in <span class="date">1853</span>. Trenton grew thanks to its port location and area lumber industry. During the First World War, the town was home to a major munitions plant owned by the <span class="org">British Chemical Company</span>. This facility was built in <span class="date">1915</span> to manufacture artillery, rifle, and small arms ammunition. <span class="date">Three weeks</span> before the Armistice, an explosion levelled the plant. Remains of the old plant can still be found <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
