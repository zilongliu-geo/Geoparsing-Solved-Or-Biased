<p><span class="loc">Scranton</span> is the sixth-largest city in the Commonwealth of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> behind <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>, <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Allentown</span>, <span class="loc">Erie</span> and Reading. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Lackawanna County</span> in the state's northeastern region and is also the central point for the federal court of the area. With a population of 76,089, it is the largest city in the Scranton–Wilkes-Barre–Hazleton, <span class="loc">PA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, with a greater population of about 570,000, also known as the <span class="loc">Wyoming</span> Valley. <span class="loc">Scranton</span> is the geographic and cultural center of the <span class="loc">Lackawanna River</span> valley, and the largest of the former anthracite coal mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes Wilkes-Barre, <span class="loc">Pittston</span>, and <span class="loc">Carbondale</span>. <span class="loc">Scranton</span> was incorporated as a borough on February 14, 1856, as a borough in <span class="loc">Luzerne County</span> and as a city on April 23, 1866. The city "took its first step toward earning its reputation as the <span class="loc">Electric City</span>" when electric lights were introduced at Dickson Locomotive Works in 1880. Six years later, the nation's first streetcars powered exclusively by electricity began operating in the city. Rev. David Spencer, a local Baptist minister, later proclaimed <span class="loc">Scranton</span> the "<span class="loc">Electric City</span>."</p>
