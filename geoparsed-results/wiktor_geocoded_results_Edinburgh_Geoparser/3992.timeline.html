  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Not to be confused with <span class="loc">Tanjung Kupang</span> in <span class="loc">Johore</span> <span class="loc">Kupang</span> (Indonesian : Kota <span class="loc">Kupang</span>, Indonesian pronunciation: [ˈkupaŋ] ; Dutch spelling: <span class="loc">Koepang</span>) is the capital of the Indonesian <span class="loc">province of East</span> <span class="loc">Nusa Tenggara</span>, and has an estimated population in <span class="date">2011</span> of 349,344. It is the biggest city and port on the island of <span class="loc">Timor</span>. <span class="loc">Kupang</span> was an important port and trading point during the Portuguese and Dutch colonial eras. There are ruins and remnant signs of the colonial presence in the city. <span class="org">Representatives of the Dutch East</span> India Company (VOC) approached <span class="loc">Kupang</span> in <span class="date">1613</span> after having conquered the Portuguese fort on <span class="loc">Solor</span>. At this time the place and its hinterland was governed by a raja of the <span class="loc">Helong</span> tribe which claimed descent from <span class="loc">Ceram</span> in <span class="loc">Maluku</span>. <span class="loc">Kupang</span> was well situated for strategic control over parts of <span class="loc">Timor</span>, since it was possible to monitor shipping activities to the south coast of the island. Moreover, the <span class="loc">Koinino</span> River provided fresh water for the inhabitants. A VOC-Helong agreement was made, but due to the lack of VOC commitment on <span class="loc">Timor</span>, <span class="loc">Kupang</span> was later influenced by the Portuguese mestizo population of Flores, the Topasses. A Portuguese stronghold was established by the 1640s. However, the VOC was firmly established on <span class="loc">Solor</span> in <span class="date">1646</span>, and renewed contacts with the local raja. In <span class="date">January 1653</span> a Dutch fortification, Fort Concordia, was built on a height to the left of the river estuary. <span class="loc">Kupang</span> became the base of the Dutch struggle against the Portuguese. After a series of Dutch defeats in <span class="date">1655</span>, <span class="date">1656</span> and <span class="date">1657</span>, large refugee groups from the VOC allies <span class="per">Sonbai</span> and <span class="per">Amabi</span> settled in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Kupang</span> in <span class="date">1658</span> and formed small kingdoms on land that traditionally belonged to the <span class="loc">Helong</span>. They were followed by two other groups, Amfoan (<span class="date">1683</span>) and Taebenu (<span class="date">1688</span>). The <span class="loc">Helong</span> raja remained the "lord of the land" (tuan tanah) but was closely dependent on the VOC authorities. Apart from the old <span class="loc">Helong</span> territory, <span class="loc">Timor</span> was largely dominated by the Portuguese up to <span class="date">1749</span>.</p><br><br>
