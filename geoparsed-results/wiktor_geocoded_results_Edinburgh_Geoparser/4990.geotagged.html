<p>Ogden /ˈɒɡdɛn/ is a city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Weber County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, approximately 10 miles (16 km) east of the <span class="loc">Great Salt Lake</span> and 40 miles (64 km) north of <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span>. The population was 84,316 in 2014, according to the US Census Bureau. The city served as a major railway hub through much of its history, and still handles a great deal of freight rail traffic which makes it a convenient location for manufacturing and commerce. Ogden is also known for its many historic buildings, proximity to the <span class="loc">Wasatch</span> Mountains, and as the location of Weber State University. Ogden is a principal city of the Ogden–Clearfield, <span class="loc">Utah Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which includes all of Weber, Morgan, and Davis counties. The 2010 Census placed the Metro population at 547,184. In 2010, <span class="loc">Forbes</span> rated the Ogden-Clearfield MSA as the 6th best place to raise a family. Ogden has had a Sister City relationship to <span class="loc">Hof</span> (<span class="loc">Germany</span>) since 1954. Originally named Fort Buenaventura, the <span class="loc">city of Ogden</span> was the first permanent settlement by people of European descent in the region that is now <span class="loc">Utah</span>. It was established by the trapper Miles Goodyear in 1846 about a mile west of where downtown Ogden is currently located. In November 1847, Fort Buenaventura was purchased by the Mormon settlers for $1,950. The settlement was then called <span class="loc">Brownsville</span>, after Captain James Brown, but was later named Ogden for a brigade leader of the Hudson's Bay Company, Peter Skene Ogden, who had trapped in the Weber Valley a generation earlier. The site of the original Fort Buenaventura is now a <span class="loc">Weber County</span> park.</p>
