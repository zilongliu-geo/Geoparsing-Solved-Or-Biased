  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Palo</span> is a third class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Leyte</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 62,727 people. The municipality is the seat of most government departments, bureaus and regional offices of Region VIII, although some are situated at the neighboring <span class="loc">city of Tacloban</span>. The town is also home to the offices of the ecclesiastical government of the Archdiocese of <span class="loc">Palo</span>; the archbishop's residence; as well as the secondary, tertiary and theology seminaries of the archdiocese.

The discovery of the advancing communities of <span class="loc">Palo</span> dates back to the <span class="date">early 16th century A.D.</span> along the banks of <span class="loc">Bangon River</span>. However, local historians believe that the settlement of <span class="loc">Palo</span> started as early as the 10th to 13th century A.D.. The first known settlement were the kingdom of Takuranga, first name of <span class="loc">Palo</span> under <span class="per">King Guban</span>, and the Kingdom of Kaluugan, the second name of <span class="loc">Palo</span> under <span class="per">King Pitik</span>. From the 14th to the 16th <span class="date">centuries</span>, some other settlements were formed which also became the succeeding names of <span class="loc">Palo</span>, until finally in <span class="date">1550</span> Don <span class="loc">Miguel Lopez</span> de <span class="loc">Legaspi</span> coalesced the settlements and named the new confederation "Palo". The other settlements were Kasangitan, Binangalan, Kasuguran, <span class="loc">Bunga</span>, <span class="loc">Bangon</span> and <span class="loc">Guindapunan</span>. The settlers of <span class="loc">Bunga</span> played a vital role in the history of <span class="loc">Palo</span>, having formed the settlement of <span class="loc">Bangon</span> which is <span class="date">now</span> the town center. <span class="loc">Palo</span> formally became a town in <span class="date">1768</span> with Kapitan Balasabas as its first administration.</p><br><br>
