  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Portal is a village in <span class="loc">Burke County</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 126 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Portal was founded in <span class="date">1893</span>. Portal sits along the Canadian border and is a major port of entry for road and rail traffic. <span class="loc">North Portal</span>, <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span> is just over the border north of Portal. It is one of three year-round, 24-hour ports in <span class="loc">North Dakota</span> (the others being <span class="loc">Dunseith</span> and <span class="loc">Pembina</span>). The town is known for its "international" golf course, which has eight holes in <span class="loc">Canada</span> and one in the <span class="loc">US</span>. Portal is located at 48°59′44″N 102°33′2″W (48.995629, -102.550430). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.56 square miles (1.45 km2), all land. Because Portal is in the <span class="loc">Bakken Oil</span> Field region, the cost of living has risen considerably in <span class="date">recent years</span>. A <span class="date">2015</span> speech by a <span class="org">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</span> official used Portal as an example of an area where the cost of living, combined with limited housing availability, and the distance from medical care and shopping, can make it difficult to attract employees for federal government positions.</p><br><br>
