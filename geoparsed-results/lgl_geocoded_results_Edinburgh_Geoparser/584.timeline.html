  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Judge bars developer from sites. A <span class="org">Merrimack County Superior Court</span> judge <span class="date">yesterday</span> denied a request by <span class="org">Concord</span> developer <span class="per">Kevin Guay</span> to have access to his properties while state officials conduct a criminal investigation into possible environmental violations. <span class="per">Judge Diane Nicolosi</span> wrote, "the State's interest in maintaining the integrity of its crime scene and investigation warrants the temporary exclusion of <span class="per">Mr. Guay</span> and his lawyer from the property until the search is completed." <span class="per">Nicolosi</span> said the search warrant is similar to grand jury proceedings, which the court has recognized as being secret. "It is in the public's best interest for the State to work at the site unfettered and to accomplish any necessary follow up without interference from the public or a criminal defendant," she wrote. On <span class="date">Thursday morning</span>, the <span class="org">Concord</span> Police executed two search warrants and cordoned off <span class="per">Guay</span>'s properties at 180 <span class="per">Clinton</span> St. and on Villanova Drive. The <span class="org">Department of Environmental Services</span> took soil samples and began excavating. A state helicopter was involved in the action. No one except for tenants was allowed on or off the property, including <span class="per">Guay</span>. At 1 p.m. <span class="date">yesterday</span>, <span class="per">Guay</span>'s attorney Brandon Giuda filed a petition with the court asking for access to the property. "I'd think in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>, which is not a police state, observation of the police's extensive intrusion into someone's property, where they're destroying by excavating, should be observed," <span class="per">Giuda</span> told the Monitor. "We want to see what they're doing." At a hearing two hours later, <span class="per">Lauren Noether</span>, senior assistant attorney general for the state Justice Department's environmental protection bureau, responded that <span class="per">Guay</span> should not be allowed onto the property. She argued that his presence could compromise the investigation, jeopardize the safety of officers and be a health risk. During the hearing, several new details emerged about the investigation. Detective Sgt. <span class="per">John Thomas</span> of the <span class="org">Concord Police Department</span>'s criminal division testified that officials started work at the Villanova Drive property, which they hoped to finish <span class="date">yesterday evening</span>. They planned to start work on <span class="per">Clinton Street</span> <span class="date">today</span>, and hoped to finish by <span class="date">the end of the day</span>. According to <span class="per">Noether</span>, the warrant gave state officials <span class="date">seven days</span> to finish their search, but <span class="per">Thomas</span> said he hoped it could be completed by tonight. "There's a lot of money involved from the city and the state," <span class="per">Thomas</span> said. "We'll try to finish <span class="date">tomorrow</span>, but we don't know what's in there. If we find what we're expecting to find, it could be longer." On the Villanova Drive property, <span class="per">Thomas</span> said there was a defined "hot zone" where the state had dug a hole and was removing hazardous waste, and from which at least one large item was removed <span class="date">yesterday</span>. <span class="per">Noether</span> said there were safety concerns, since state officials do not know what is buried. "It's not entirely clear what's going to be exposed," <span class="per">Noether</span> said. "If it contains something like asbestos, it can be airborne." <span class="per">Noether</span> described the area as "one huge pit of junk" that is being excavated by two Department of Environmental Services officials in protective gear. She also worried there could be something explosive, like a propane tank, buried on the property. <span class="per">Noether</span> also said that the area includes a "command zone" where DES is communicating with the police, and communications could be compromised if someone else were present At the <span class="per">Clinton Street</span> site, <span class="per">Noether</span> said, one "hazardous area" was near the driveway, just past the police barrier, where there is a septic system and leach field. <span class="per">Noether</span> said <span class="per">Guay</span> would be allowed back on the property once state officials stopped digging and deemed it safe. According to a satellite picture of the property found through the Live Search Maps website, there is also a large pile of debris behind a barn on the <span class="per">Clinton Street</span> property. <span class="per">Guay</span> said <span class="date">yesterday</span> that it was a pile of junk, which the city has inspected, and that it contained nothing hazardous. There are wetlands concerns on both properties, state officials said.</p><br><br>
