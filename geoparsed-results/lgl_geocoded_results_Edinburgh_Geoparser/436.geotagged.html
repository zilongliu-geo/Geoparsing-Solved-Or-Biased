<p>Graduation data to be released today. The Virginia <span class="loc">Department of Education</span> is expected to release some key graduation data today for the stateâ€™s students. The statistics will detail graduation outcomes for students who entered the ninth-grade for the first time in 2004 and were scheduled to graduate in spring 2008. The reports are in concert with the Virginia On-Time Graduation Rate reports published last October and will include dropout rates for the commonwealth, school divisions and schools.</p>
