  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lewiston</span> is a city in north central <span class="loc">Idaho</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Nez</span> <span class="loc">Perce County</span>. It is the second-largest city in the <span class="loc">northern Idaho region</span>, behind Coeur d'Alene, and ninth-largest in the state. <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Lewiston</span>, <span class="loc">ID</span> - <span class="loc">Clarkston</span>, <span class="loc">WA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of <span class="loc">Nez</span> <span class="loc">Perce County</span> and <span class="loc">Asotin County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population of <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> was 31,894, up from 30,904 in <span class="date">2000</span>. <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> is located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Snake River</span> and <span class="loc">Clearwater River</span>, thirty miles (50 km) southeast of the Lower Granite Dam. Because of dams (and their locks) on the Snake and <span class="loc">Columbia River</span>, <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> is reachable by some ocean-going vessels.

The Lewiston-Nez <span class="loc">Perce County</span> Airport serves the city by air. <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> was founded <span class="date">155 years ago</span> in <span class="date">1861</span> in the wake of a gold rush which began <span class="date">the previous year</span> near Pierce, northeast of <span class="loc">Lewiston</span>. In <span class="date">1863</span>, <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> became the first capital of the newly created Idaho Territory. Its stint as seat of the new territory's government was short-lived, as a resolution to have the capital moved south to <span class="loc">Boise</span> was passed by the Idaho Territorial Legislature on <span class="date">December 7, 1864</span>.</p><br><br>
