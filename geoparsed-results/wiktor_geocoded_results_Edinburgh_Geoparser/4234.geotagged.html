<p><span class="loc">Bangor</span> is a borough located in <span class="loc">Northampton County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, 30 miles (48 km) north of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>, in the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley region of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>'s Slate Belt. It had a population of 5,273 according to the 2010 census. The borough was settled about 1760 and first incorporated in 1875. The founder and first Chief Burgess of <span class="loc">Bangor</span> was Robert M. Jones, an emigrant from <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span>. He was the prime mover in the establishment of the slate industry in <span class="loc">Northampton County</span>. Slate quarries pepper the area, but only a few are still functioning. A life-sized statue of him, dedicated on September 24, 1914, remains in the town center. In the official program for the unveiling it states "... Mr. Jones in his prime had many charming qualities, chief among which was his constant optimistic disposition." Indeed, if one visits <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span> it is clearly visible that the Welsh heritage made its way to <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, whose stone walls, rectangular gardens, and lovely flowers and greenery mirror those of its Welsh namesake. Around <span class="loc">Bangor</span> one can also see piles of slate residue and shale reminiscent of the area around <span class="loc">Bethesda</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span>.</p>
