<p>For the former town in <span class="loc">Bristol County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, see Warren, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. Warren is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,135 at the 2010 census. For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place Warren, please see the article Warren (CDP), Massachusetts. Warren was first settled in 1664 and was officially incorporated on January 16, 1741 as the town of Western. Originally a part of Quaboag Plantation, the town now known as Warren was part of <span class="loc">Brookfield</span> for 68 years until it was renamed Western. Warren includes land petitioned from both the Quaboag Plantation and the "Kingsfield", which included parts of Palmer and Brimfield. On March 13, 1834, the town was renamed Warren in honor of General Joseph Warren, who died at the Battle of <span class="loc">Bunker Hill</span> during the American Revolutionary War. The need to rename the town came about due to confusion of the name "Western" with the town of <span class="loc">Weston</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. According to the History of Warren Massachusetts by Olney I. Darling, Western was renamed Warren due to "countless mistakes in the transmission of the mails." On January 13, 1834, a town meeting was held to discuss a name change. Shortly thereafter, the town petitioned the legislature to change the name, which was soon done, and the first town meeting under the name "Warren" was held on April 28, 1834.</p>
