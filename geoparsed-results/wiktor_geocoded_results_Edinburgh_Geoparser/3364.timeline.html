  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Bethlehem Township</span>, <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, twenty-five miles up the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> from <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. It was platted in <span class="date">1812</span> and according to WPA records was presumably named for <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. Its first office was established on <span class="date">March 6, 1816</span>. The community's post office is popular around <span class="date">Christmas</span> with those wanting to have a <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> postmark on <span class="date">Christmas</span> letters and cards. Much of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>'s history was destroyed by the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> flood of <span class="date">1937</span>. What is known is that prior to its formation, the land which would become <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> was owned by Colonel <span class="per">John Armstrong</span>, who had been the commander of <span class="loc">Fort Finney</span> (located in present-day <span class="loc">Jeffersonville</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>). The first settlers arrived at the site in <span class="date">1805</span> <span class="per">Armstrong</span> and others, most notably <span class="per">Jonathon Clark</span> and <span class="per">William Plaskett</span>, platted the community in <span class="date">1812</span>. It was laid out in 124 lots in a rectangular manner. <span class="per">Armstrong</span> named it after <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, where he was born. Early in its history, <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> was blessed with a steamboat and ferry landing, and with its road to <span class="loc">New Washington</span> and <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> became a major transportation center. The economy of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> in the antebellum era focused on farming, shopping, and trade. By <span class="date">1833</span>, 300 individuals lived in the community.</p><br><br>
