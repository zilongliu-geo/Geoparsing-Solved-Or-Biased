  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Rogers</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Hennepin County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,597 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. However, the population increased to over 11,000 upon the annexing of surrounding Hassan Township in <span class="date">2012</span>. The population of Hassan Township was 2,600 in <span class="date">2010</span>, giving the current city a population base of 11,197 as of the census. The center of population of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> is located in <span class="per">Rogers</span> [1]. The city is a northwest suburb of the Minneapolisâ€“Saint <span class="loc">Paul metropolitan</span> area. Located on either side of Interstate 94, with <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> State Highway 101 running north, <span class="per">Rogers</span> has been teeming with growth for <span class="date">the past 20 years</span>. The <span class="date">2000</span>-<span class="date">2010</span> (8,597) population growth rate was +139.6%. In the 1880s, <span class="per">John Rogers</span> sold an acre of his land, then part of Hassan Township, to Great Northern Railroad for a dollar. The new depot provided a convenient stop for the rich timber resources of the area, and served as the beginning ground of a new community. When St. <span class="org">Martin Catholic Church</span> and school were added, <span class="per">Rogers</span> grew in local importance, consequently causing new businesses to be built and the town to be regarded as more of a local hub than other nearby communities such as Fletcher. In <span class="date">1914</span>, the city was incorporated.</p><br><br>
