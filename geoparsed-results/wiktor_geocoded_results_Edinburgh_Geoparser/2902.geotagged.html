<p><span class="loc">Madison County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 82,916. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Richmond</span>. The county is named for Virginia statesman James Madison, who later became the fourth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Madison County</span> is part of the Richmond-Berea, KY Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Lexington-Fayette-Richmond-Frankfort, KY Combined Statistical Area. It is considered a moist county, meaning that although the county prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages (and is thus a dry county), it contains a city where retail alcohol sales are allowed. Nevertheless, two of Richmond's 19 precincts are dry. Alcohol can also be sold by the drink in <span class="loc">Berea</span> and at <span class="loc">Arlington</span> and The Bull golf clubs. <span class="loc">Madison County</span> is home to Eastern Kentucky University, Berea College, <span class="loc">Boone Tavern</span>, and <span class="loc">Bybee Pottery</span>,(closed February 2011) one of the oldest pottery operations in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. This is also where famous pioneer <span class="loc">Daniel Boone</span> lived and built Fort Boonesborough, now a state historic site. Indian trader John Findley, <span class="loc">Daniel Boone</span>, and four others first came into the area that is <span class="loc">Madison County</span> in 1769 on a hunting and exploring expedition. The Transylvania Company, led by Judge Richard Henderson of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, purchased 20,000,000 acres of land west of the Appalachians (including present-day <span class="loc">Madison County</span>) from the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> in 1774. <span class="loc">Daniel Boone</span> was hired by the company to cut a trail through the <span class="loc">Cumberland Gap</span> and establish a settlement on the <span class="loc">Kentucky River</span>. The settlement at Fort Boonesborough began in April of 1775.</p>
