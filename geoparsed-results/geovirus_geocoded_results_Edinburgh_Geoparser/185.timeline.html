  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Earlier yesterday, California state senators voted 21-11 in favor the prohibition of sales of sugared sports drinks at public schools during class hours. Soft drinks are already banned during school hours. "Sugar-sweetened electrolyte replacement beverages are still available and have surged in popularity among kids," said Senator <span class="per">Alex Padilla</span>. "This is a common sense step forward in the effort to address the obesity epidemic in <span class="loc">California</span>," he added. <span class="per">Padilla</span>'s bill is <span class="date">now</span> on its way to the <span class="org">Assembly</span>. Studies have shown that drinks, especially sweetened, contribute to obesity among adults and children, leading to diseases like diabetes. "Eight out of ten drinks sold in <span class="loc">California</span> public schools are sports drinks," <span class="per">Padilla</span> said, citing information from the California Department of Public Health. <span class="per">Governor Schwarzenegger</span> is sponsoring a package of legislation aimed at reducing child obesity in <span class="loc">California</span>.</p><br><br>
