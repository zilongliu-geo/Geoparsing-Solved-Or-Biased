  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rama</span> (also called <span class="loc">Mai Lala</span>, <span class="loc">Lala</span>) is a town in northern <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. Located 35 km north of the town of <span class="loc">Adwa</span> and 7 kilometers from the border with <span class="loc">Eritrea</span>, in the Mehakelegnaw (Central) Zone of the <span class="loc">Tigray Region</span>, this town occupies a fertile lowland area and has a latitude and longitude of 14°25′N 38°47′E with an elevation of 1385 meters above sea level. It is the administrative center of Mereb Lehe woreda. <span class="loc">Rama</span> was recently the site for a pilot project for providing electricity to rural inhabitants, which has been a challenge for African governments, since villages in rural areas are often difficult to connect to national electricity grids. Since the project started in <span class="date">2007</span>, <span class="loc">Rama</span> has 2,100 houses with solar panels, and as of <span class="date">July 2009</span> there are 300 more requests for new solar home systems in <span class="loc">Rama</span>. One panel powers about four lamps, and the energy can also be used for radios and tape recorders. A point of interest in <span class="loc">Rama</span> is the nearby church, Kor Nebir Mikael. Records at the <span class="org">Nordic Africa Institute</span> website provide details of a primary school in <span class="loc">Rama</span> in <span class="date">1968</span>.</p><br><br>
