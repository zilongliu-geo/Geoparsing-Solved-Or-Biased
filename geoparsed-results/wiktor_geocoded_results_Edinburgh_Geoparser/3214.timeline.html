  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alamo is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Contra</span> <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a suburb located in the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> Bay Area's <span class="loc">East Bay</span> region, approximately 28 miles (45 km) east of <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>. Alamo is equidistant between the city of <span class="loc">Walnut Creek</span> and the town of <span class="loc">Danville</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 14,750. Alamo (from the Spanish Ã¡lamo, "poplar") was named for the poplar trees that lined <span class="loc">San Ramon Creek</span>. As an unincorporated community, Alamo does not have a government of its own. Police services are provided by the <span class="loc">Contra</span> <span class="org">Costa County Office</span> of the Sheriff. Fire and EMS services are provided by the San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District. Alamo, with a median household income of $140,561 (as of <span class="date">2011</span>), is one of the wealthiest communities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In <span class="date">August, 2007</span>, a group of citizens launched a new initiative to incorporate the community, the latest in a series of attempts that go back to <span class="date">the early 1960s</span> or before. Previous failed Alamo incorporation efforts always included parts of other nearby unincorporated areas: Alamo-Danville (<span class="date">1964</span>) and Alamo-Danville-San Ramon (<span class="date">1976</span>). This latest Alamo incorporation effort was defeated by referendum in <span class="date">March, 2009</span>.</p><br><br>
