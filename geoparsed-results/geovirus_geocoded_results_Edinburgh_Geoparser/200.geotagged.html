<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has told people to stay away from Ugandan caves with bats, due to the fact that a tourist visiting <span class="loc">Uganda</span> was recently killed by the fatal Marburg virus. Health authorities in the <span class="loc">Netherlands</span> said that the forty-year-old tourist contracted the disease from fruit bats in a cave. A spokesperson for WHO said that "it is an isolated case of imported <span class="loc">Marburg</span>." He continued, "people should not think about amending their travel plans to <span class="loc">Uganda</span> but should not go into caves with bats." The Health Ministry of <span class="loc">Uganda</span> advised people who have to enter caves in <span class="loc">Uganda</span> that they should exercise "maximum precaution not to get into close contact with the bats and non-human primates in the nearby forests". Marburg virus causes <span class="loc">Marburg</span> hemorrhagic fever, which is related to <span class="loc">Ebola</span>. It is believed that humans first caught the virus from Egyptian fruit bats. The first Ugandan case of the virus occurred approximately a year ago; it involved a 29-year-old man who became symptomatic on July 4 and died on July 14. A co-worker of the man had previously suffered from a similar disease, although he survived. The Soviet Union also reportedly prepared Marburg virus samples for use as a biological weapon in the time of war.</p>
