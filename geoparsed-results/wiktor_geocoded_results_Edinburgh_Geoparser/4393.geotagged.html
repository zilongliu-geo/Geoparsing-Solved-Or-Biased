<p><span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Isabella County</span>, located in Central Michigan. The population was 26,016 at the 2010 census. Part of the city (with a population of 8,741) is located within the <span class="loc">Isabella Indian Reservation</span>, the base of the federally recognized <span class="loc">Saginaw</span> <span class="loc">Chippewa</span> Tribal Nation. This is the site of the Tribe's Soaring Eagle Casino. The city is home to the main campuses of Central Michigan University, one of the largest universities in the state with 20,000 students at <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>, and Mid Michigan Community College. The student population nearly doubles the population of the city during the academic year. Until the mid-19th century, this area was occupied by historical bands of the Ojibwa people, known by English speakers as the <span class="loc">Chippewa</span>. In the early decades of the century, they ceded vast amounts of land to the <span class="loc">United States</span> government, which wanted to extinguish Native American land titles to enable settlement by European Americans. The federal Graduation Act of 1854 allowed European-American settlers to purchase land from the government at discount rates, and the first white settlers began to arrive in what became <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>. Under the Treaty of 1855, the Ojibwa bands (<span class="loc">Saginaw</span> <span class="loc">Chippewa</span> Tribe) from the <span class="loc">Saginaw</span>, <span class="loc">Swan Creek</span>, and Black rivers were relocated to land in <span class="loc">Isabella County</span> (<span class="loc">Isabella Indian Reservation</span>). Many non-natives soon moved to <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>, predicting prosperous relations with the natives. The Homestead Act of 1862 also attracted many new settlers, including new European immigrants, to <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> to develop their stake on free lands offered by the <span class="loc">US</span> government in exchange for their labor in developing it for residence and agriculture.</p>
