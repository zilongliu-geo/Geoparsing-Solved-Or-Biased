  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Flores is a middle class barrio or district in the centre part of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> city, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. Flores was considered a rural area of the Province of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> until <span class="date">1888</span> when it was integrated into the City. The limits of the neighbourhood are marked by several streets and avenues: <span class="loc">Portela</span>, <span class="loc">Cuenca</span>, <span class="per">Av</span>. <span class="loc">Gaona</span>, <span class="per">Av</span>. <span class="loc">Donato Alvarez</span>, Curapaligüe, <span class="per">Av</span>. Directorio, <span class="per">Av</span>. <span class="loc">Carabobo</span>, <span class="per">Av</span>. Castañares, Torres y <span class="loc">Tenorio</span>, <span class="per">Av</span>. Riestra, <span class="per">Av</span>. <span class="loc">Perito Moreno</span>, <span class="per">Av</span>. Castañares, <span class="per">Lacarra</span> and <span class="per">Av</span>. <span class="per">Luis J. Dellepiane</span>. Flores was mainly composed of country houses from the wealthy people of the City of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, remains of those houses can still be found, including the house owned by <span class="loc">Juan Manuel</span> de <span class="loc">Rosas</span>, the Governor of the Province around the 19th century. One of the most prominent of these early homeowners in Flores was the Marcó del Pont family, descendants of a former Spanish governor of <span class="loc">Chile</span>. Purchasing property facing the new railway station (one of <span class="loc">Argentina</span>'s first), they had a comfortable yet understated italianate property built in <span class="date">1860</span>. Relocating in <span class="date">1929</span>, the family sold the property and the estate fell into disrepair. Slated at one time for demolition, it eventually caught the attention of the <span class="per">San José</span> de Flores Historical Society, who prevailed on the city to declare it a National Historic Monument, in <span class="date">1976</span>. Its fate <span class="date">now</span> secure, as the home became the Marcó del Pont Cultural Center.</p><br><br>
