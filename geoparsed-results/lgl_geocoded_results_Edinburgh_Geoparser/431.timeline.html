  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Henrico police seek missing <span class="loc">Glen Allen</span> woman. <span class="loc">Henrico County</span> police are looking for a missing woman who was last seen <span class="date">Thursday</span> when leaving her parents' home by taxi. They identified her as <span class="per">Tasha Nicole Shelton</span>, 33, of the 9400 block of <span class="per">Telegraph Road</span> in <span class="loc">Glen Allen</span>. She has some mental health issues and may need her medication, they say. Her parents think she has not gone too far away because she is not familiar with the area, said police spokesman <span class="per">Lt. Doug Perry</span>. <span class="per">Shelton</span> may have cashed some checks at the <span class="org">Bank of America</span> branch at <span class="loc">Parham</span> <span class="per">Road</span> and <span class="per">Villa</span> Park. She is described as black, 6 feet tall and 130 pounds; she often wears a hoodie type of shirt and may also be wearing tennis shoes.</p><br><br>
