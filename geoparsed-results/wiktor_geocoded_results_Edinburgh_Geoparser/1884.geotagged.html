<p><span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span> is a village located in <span class="loc">Westmorland County</span>, <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The village's population meets the requirements for "town" status under the Municipalities Act of the <span class="loc">Province of New Brunswick</span>; however, its municipal status has not been changed. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> first became a permanent settlement when settlers from <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, settled there in 1774 (History, Village of Salisbury Website). <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> is situated on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Petitcodiac River</span>, approximately 25 km <span class="loc">west of Moncton</span> and <span class="loc">Riverview</span>. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> is called the "Home of the Silver Fox", in reference to its role in adopting Silver Fox farming during the early 20th century (as was <span class="loc">Alberton</span> in <span class="loc">Prince Edward Island</span>). The village features elementary, middle, and high schools, an outdoor swimming pool, as well as several family-owned shops and churches servicing the surrounding area. There is also a Royal Canadian Air Cadet Squadron, 580 A/M Hugh Campbell Squadron. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> is a local service centre for several farming communities which are being transformed into commuter communities in the <span class="loc">Petitcodiac River</span> valley. The village is served by Ambulance <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span>, Salisbury Fire &amp; Rescue Department.</p>
