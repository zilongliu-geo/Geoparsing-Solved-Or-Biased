<p>Woman wasn't kidnapped, now is charged in robbery. A Harlem woman initially identified as a kidnapping victim is now in jail, accused of participating in an armed robbery. Shashawna Diane Odell, 27, of the 500 block of Lou Lane, was charged with robbery, tampering with evidence and hindering the apprehension/punishent of a criminal. She was held without bond Monday in the Columbia County Detention Center, according to jail records. Police said her boyfriend Christopher Grier, of the 700 block of <span class="loc">Knox Road</span> in <span class="loc">Harlem</span>, is suspected in the armed robbery Friday of two individuals in their <span class="loc">Grovetown</span> home. At first, police believed Mr. Grier committed the robbery, then kidnapped Ms. Odell and their 7-month-old son and made her drive him to <span class="loc">Monroeville</span>, <span class="loc">Ala</span>. An Amber Alert was issued for Ms. Odell and her son after she called her mother in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C</span>. The mother called police, saying her daughter had been kidnapped, said Investigator Scott Wheatley of the Grovetown Department of Public Safety. Police found Ms. Odell and stopped her in <span class="loc">Newton County</span>, <span class="loc">Ga</span>. After they confirmed that she and the baby were safe, Ms. Odell drove back to <span class="loc">Harlem</span> on Sunday. <span class="loc">Grovetown</span> police then questioned Ms. Odell, who admitted that she willingly drove Mr. Grier to <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. She also told police that she drove the getaway car for Mr. Grier as he conducted the robbery and disposed of the gun he used, Investigator Wheatley said. The gun was recovered on Kings Way in Harlem. Mr. Grier is wanted for the robbery, but the kidnapping warrants have been dropped, <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> sheriff's Capt. Steve Morris said.</p>
