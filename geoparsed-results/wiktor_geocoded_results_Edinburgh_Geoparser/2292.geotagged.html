<p><span class="loc">Cachoeira</span> (Portuguese, meaning the waterfall), is an inland town of <span class="loc">Bahia</span>, <span class="loc">Brazil</span>, on the Paraguaçu River. The town exports sugar, cotton and tobacco and is a thriving commercial and industrial centre. First settled by the Indians, it was later settled by the Portuguese families of <span class="loc">Dias Adorno</span> and <span class="loc">Rodrigues</span> Martins. It became known as <span class="loc">Nossa Senhora</span> do Rosário in 1674. It was a strategic area and was linked with the mining <span class="loc">city of Salvador</span>, the former colonial capital. It became a parish on December 27, 1693. It also became Vila de <span class="loc">Nossa Senhora</span> do Rosário do <span class="loc">Porto</span> da <span class="loc">Cachoeira</span> do Paraguaçu in 1698. Sugar cane farming, gold mining on rio das <span class="loc">Contas</span>, increased traffic on royal streets, and navigation on the Rio Paraguaçu combined to boost the regional economy at the beginning of the 18th century. In early 1800, the Cachoeirense society became very important politically. It actively participated in the war of the Independence of <span class="loc">Bahia</span>. The town became a city under the imperial decree of March 13, 1873 (Provincial Law 43).</p>
