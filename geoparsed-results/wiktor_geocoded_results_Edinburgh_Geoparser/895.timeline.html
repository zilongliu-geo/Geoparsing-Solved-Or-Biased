  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Lycoming County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,695 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Williamsport</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> was incorporated as a borough by the <span class="org">Pennsylvania General Assembly</span> on <span class="date">March 27, 1887</span> from part of Clinton Township. The history of the settlement of <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> begins in <span class="date">1783</span> when <span class="per">John Lawson</span> established a homestead there. <span class="per">Nicholas Shaffer</span> built a gristmill in <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> in <span class="date">1795</span>. A sawmill and a wool carding mill were other early industries found on <span class="loc">Black Hole Creek</span> which flows through <span class="loc">Montgomery</span>. P. M. Barber was the first person to come to <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> and establish an industry that achieved any sustainable success. He opened a distillery in <span class="date">1859</span> and later a planing mill in <span class="date">1869</span> on the site of the distillery. Barber with his partners, <span class="per">A.B. Henderson</span>, <span class="per">Jesse Rank</span>, and <span class="per">Nathan Fowler</span> had so much success that they laid out a town around their mill in <span class="date">1870</span>. The town was further expanded by the success of Montgomery Machine Shops which starting in <span class="date">1873</span>, under the supervision of <span class="per">Levi Houston</span>, built woodworking machinery that was sold to clients throughout the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Canada</span> and as far away as <span class="loc">Australia</span>.</p><br><br>
