  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Slide forces closure of <span class="per">W.Va</span>. 61 in <span class="loc">East Bank</span>. <span class="loc">Kanawha County</span> emergency responders and state highway officials don't know exactly how long <span class="per">W.Va</span>. 61 will be closed in <span class="loc">East Bank</span> because of a mudslide. But <span class="loc">East Bank</span> Mayor <span class="per">Chuck Blair</span> said <span class="date">Monday</span> that he expects the major thoroughfare to be shut down <span class="date">at least two days</span>. "They're still trying to determine how much damage there is," <span class="per">Blair</span> said. "There's a deep mine up there that has been accumulating water for <span class="date">years</span> and <span class="date">years</span> and <span class="date">years</span>," <span class="per">Petry</span> said. <span class="per">Kathy Cosco</span>, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the mine last operated in <span class="date">the 1940s</span> or <span class="date">1950s</span>. Classes at <span class="loc">East Bank</span> Middle School were also canceled as a result of the slide. <span class="per">Melanie Vickers</span>, assistant superintendent in charge of middle schools, said <span class="loc">East Bank</span> Middle School will be open <span class="date">today</span>. Principal Candy Strader drove to the school <span class="date">Monday</span> and saw no damage inside the building, according to <span class="per">Vickers</span>. "She did get inside and said things were fine," she said. The problem was all the water that had spilled into the school's parking lot, <span class="per">Vickers</span> said. After speaking with county transportation director <span class="per">George Beckett</span>, <span class="per">Vickers</span> said she believed bus drivers would be able to get students to the school safely. <span class="loc">Kanawha County</span> emergency responders and state highway officials don't know exactly how long <span class="per">W.Va</span>. 61 will be closed in <span class="loc">East Bank</span> because of a mudslide. But <span class="loc">East Bank</span> Mayor <span class="per">Chuck Blair</span> said <span class="date">Monday</span> that he expects the major thoroughfare to be shut down <span class="date">at least two days</span>. "They're still trying to determine how much damage there is," <span class="per">Blair</span> said. <span class="loc">Kanawha County</span> Emergency Services Director Dale Petry said an old, abandoned mine that had been dormantor for <span class="date">years</span> started overflowing <span class="date">early Monday</span>, sending hundreds of thousands of gallons of water cascading across <span class="per">W.Va</span>. 61 and onto First Avenue in <span class="loc">East Bank</span> and forcing tons of rock and earth onto the road near the western end of town. "There's a deep mine up there that has been accumulating water for <span class="date">years</span> and <span class="date">years</span> and <span class="date">years</span>," <span class="per">Petry</span> said. <span class="per">Kathy Cosco</span>, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the mine last operated in <span class="date">the 1940s</span> or <span class="date">1950s</span>. Classes at <span class="loc">East Bank</span> Middle School were also canceled as a result of the slide. <span class="per">Melanie Vickers</span>, assistant superintendent in charge of middle schools, said <span class="loc">East Bank</span> Middle School will be open <span class="date">today</span>. Principal Candy Strader drove to the school <span class="date">Monday</span> and saw no damage inside the building, according to <span class="per">Vickers</span>. "She did get inside and said things were fine," she said. The problem was all the water that had spilled into the school's parking lot, <span class="per">Vickers</span> said. After speaking with county transportation director <span class="per">George Beckett</span>, <span class="per">Vickers</span> said she believed bus drivers would be able to get students to the school safely. <span class="per">Petry</span> said the slide forced the evacuation of one family whose driveway was obliterated by the mass of mud and water. <span class="per">Stacy Auber</span>, who lives downhill from the old mine, said relatives called her about 6:20 a.m. and told her about the mudslide. Soon, a dump truck belonging to the family went sliding over the hill. <span class="per">Auber</span> grabbed some clothes and left her house by about 10:30 a.m. She was allowed to return home <span class="date">Monday afternoon</span>. But <span class="per">Johnny Walker</span>, a highways administrator with the state Division of Highways, said highways officials can't even begin to guess how long it will take to clear away the debris and reopen <span class="per">W.Va</span>. 61. He said it all depends on how badly the tons of mud and water damaged the two-lane highway. "We've got a piling wall along that entire section, and it's undercut all of that," <span class="per">Walker</span> said. Highways officials need to determine whether the ground beneath the road was undermined, and they won't know that until water stops pouring across the asphalt. <span class="per">Petry</span> said discharge from the mine portal had slowed down by mid-afternoon, but that water continued to gush out of the abandoned mine at a rate of about 2,000 gallons per minute. Emergency officials reopened narrow First Avenue <span class="date">Monday afternoon</span> to allow residents access to their homes, but the single-lane street will be open only to passenger vehicles. Mud and water also closed the inner set of railroad tracks, <span class="per">Petry</span> said. All but local traffic was being rerouted at Cabin Creek Road and Paint Creek Road. "We're kind of on pins and needles <span class="date">now</span> to see what happens next with it," <span class="per">Blair</span> said <span class="date">Monday afternoon</span>. "We don't know how much water is up there to come out."</p><br><br>
