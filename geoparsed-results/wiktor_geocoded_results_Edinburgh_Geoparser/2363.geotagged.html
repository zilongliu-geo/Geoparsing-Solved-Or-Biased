<p><span class="loc">Ola</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Gem County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located approximately 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Emmett. <span class="loc">Ola</span> was established as a post office July 22, 1882, by Carroll Baird. It serves the Upper Squaw Creek Valley. The first post office in this area was "Upper <span class="loc">Squaw Creek</span>", established in September 1875, by Carroll Baird. Baird homesteaded along <span class="loc">Squaw Creek</span>, less than half a mile west of the present-day site of <span class="loc">Ola</span>. Nellie Ireton Mills writes that the <span class="loc">Bairds</span> built their cabin where the old Indian trail crosses the creek. The trail was also used by miners and others taking the short cut to, or from, <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and the <span class="loc">Boise Basin</span>. Prior to the 1875 post office, the mail was delivered by pack horse and snowshoes along the <span class="loc">Brownlee</span> Trail from <span class="loc">Horseshoe Bend</span> (<span class="loc">Boise County</span>) to Warren (<span class="loc">Idaho County</span>). Six weeks after the post office was established, <span class="loc">Bairds</span>' bachelor neighbor to the north, Fred Hoffman, was appointed postmaster, a position he held until the post office closed the end of January 1877, when mail was sent to Cascade (<span class="loc">Valley County</span>). Mills writes that first wedding in the community was between Fred Hoffman (aka Huffman) and school teacher Ella Drake on March 6, 1879.</p>
