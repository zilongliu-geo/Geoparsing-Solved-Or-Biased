<p>Lancaster /ˈlæŋkəstər/, or /ˈlæŋˌkæstər/ is the county town of <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is situated on the <span class="loc">River Lune</span> and has a population of 45,952. Lancaster is a constituent settlement of the wider <span class="loc">City of Lancaster</span>, a local government district which has a population of 138,375  and encompasses several outlying settlements, including neighbouring <span class="loc">Morecambe</span>. Long existing as a commercial, cultural and educational centre, Lancaster is the settlement that gives <span class="loc">Lancashire</span> its name. Lancaster has several unique ties to the British monarchy; the House of Lancaster was a branch of the English royal family, whilst the Duchy of Lancaster holds large estates on behalf of Elizabeth II, who herself is also the Duke of Lancaster. Lancaster was granted city status in 1937 for its "long association with the crown" and because it was "the county town of the King's Duchy of Lancaster". With its history based on its port and canal, Lancaster is an ancient settlement, dominated by <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> Castle. It is also home to the campus-based Lancaster University and a campus of the University of Cumbria. It is known that there existed a permanent Roman fort on the hill where <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> Castle now stands by the end of the 1st century AD, and possibly as early as the 60s, based on the Roman coin evidence. The coin evidence also suggests that the fort was not continuously inhabited in these early years. The fort was rebuilt in stone around 102 AD. The fort underwent a few more extensions, and at its largest area it was 9–10 acres (4–4 ha). The evidence suggests that the fort remained active into the early 5th century, which was the end of the Roman occupation of <span class="loc">Britain</span>.</p>
