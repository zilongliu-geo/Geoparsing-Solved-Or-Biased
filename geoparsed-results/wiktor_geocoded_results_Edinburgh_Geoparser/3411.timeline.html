  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Greenwich</span> (/ˈɡrɛnɪtʃ/, /ˈɡrɪnɪdʒ/, /ˈɡrɪnɪtʃ/ or /ˈɡrɛnɪdʒ/) is an early-established district of <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="loc">London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, centred 5.5 miles (8.9 km) east south-east of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. The town lends its name to the Royal Borough of <span class="per">Greenwich</span>. <span class="per">Greenwich</span> is generally described as being part of South-east <span class="loc">London</span> and sometimes as being part of <span class="loc">East London</span>. It is also one of the five boroughs of the <span class="loc">London</span> Docklands, connected to areas with docks of <span class="loc">London</span> historically by river and <span class="date">today</span> to <span class="loc">Canary Wharf</span> and other buildings by the <span class="loc">East London Line</span>. <span class="per">Greenwich</span> is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the <span class="per">Greenwich</span> <span class="org">Meridian</span> (0° longitude) and <span class="per">Greenwich</span> Mean Time. The town became the site of a royal palace, the Palace of <span class="loc">Placentia</span> from the 15th century, and was the birthplace of many Tudors, including <span class="per">Henry VIII</span> and <span class="per">Elizabeth I</span>. The palace fell into disrepair during the <span class="org">English Civil War</span> and was rebuilt as the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors by Sir <span class="per">Christopher Wren</span> and his assistant <span class="per">Nicholas Hawksmoor</span>. These buildings became the Royal Naval College in <span class="date">1873</span>, and they remained an establishment for military education until <span class="date">1998</span> when they passed into the hands of the <span class="org">Greenwich Foundation</span>. The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public; other buildings are used by University of <span class="per">Greenwich</span> and <span class="per">Trinity</span> <span class="org">Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance</span>.</p><br><br>
