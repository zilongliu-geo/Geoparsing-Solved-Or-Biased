<p><span class="loc">Wayne County</span> is the westernmost county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 42,481. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Wayne. The county was founded in 1842 and named for General "Mad" Anthony Wayne. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> is part of the Huntington-Ashland, <span class="loc">WV-KY-OH Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which is also included in the Charleston-Huntington-Ashland, WV-OH-KY Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> was originally <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, which was created from part of <span class="loc">Cabell County</span> in 1842. The county was named for General "Mad" Anthony Wayne. There was no white settlement in the area that became <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> until after 1794, due to the constant threat of Indian attack. The area was made safe for white settlement in 1794 through the defeat of the <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> at the Battle of <span class="loc">Fallen Timbers</span> by General "Mad" Anthony Wayne. When the first permanent European settlers came to <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> around the year 1800, the area was part of <span class="loc">Kanawha County</span>. Most of the original pioneer settlers were self-sufficient farmers. They raised their own food, sheep for wool clothing, and made their buildings, furnishings and tools out of the surrounding forest. A few trading posts provided the manufactured goods the pioneers could not make for themselves. Later, grist mills at Wayne, <span class="loc">Dickson</span>, south of <span class="loc">East Lynn</span> and at <span class="loc">Lavalette</span> ground their corn into meal and their wheat into flour.</p>
