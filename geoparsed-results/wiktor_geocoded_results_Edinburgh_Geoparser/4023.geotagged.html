<p><span class="loc">Canterbury</span> (Māori: <span class="loc">Waitaha</span>) is a region of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, located in the central-eastern <span class="loc">South Island</span>. The region covers an area of 44,508 square kilometres (17,185 sq mi), and is home to a population of 586,500 (June 2015 estimate). The region in its current form was established in 1989 during nationwide local government reforms. The <span class="loc">Kaikoura District</span> joined the region in 1992 following the abolition of the Nelson-Marlborough Regional Council. <span class="loc">Christchurch</span>, the <span class="loc">South Island</span>'s largest city and the country's third-largest urban area, is the seat of the region and home to 65 percent of the region's population. Other major towns and cities include <span class="loc">Timaru</span>, <span class="loc">Ashburton</span>, <span class="loc">Rangiora</span> and <span class="loc">Rolleston</span>. In 1848, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, a Briton, and John Robert Godley, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, founded the Canterbury Association to establish an Anglican colony in the <span class="loc">South Island</span>. The colony was based upon theories developed by Wakefield while in prison for eloping with a woman not-of-age. Due to ties to the prestigious Oxford University, the Canterbury Association succeeded in raising sufficient funds and recruiting middle-class and upper-class settlers. In April 1850, a preliminary group led by Godley landed at Port Cooper—modern-day Lyttelton Harbour—and established a port, housing and shops in preparation for the main body of settlers. In December 1850, the first wave of 750 settlers arrived at <span class="loc">Lyttelton</span> in a fleet of four ships.</p>
