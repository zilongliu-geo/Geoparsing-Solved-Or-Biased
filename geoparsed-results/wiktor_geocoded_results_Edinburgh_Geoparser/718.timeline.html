  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Weston is a township situated 5 km (3.1 mi) inland from <span class="loc">Oamaru</span>, <span class="loc">South Island</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. It is regarded as one of the more affluent townships of the <span class="loc">Waitaki District</span> and had a population of 730 in the <span class="date">2006</span> census. Weston has some of the largest sporting grounds in the <span class="loc">Oamaru region</span>, with the Weston Domain having a full size cricket oval, two football pitches and two rugby union fields, accompanied by a large pavilion and public garden/recreation area. Weston is home to the largest <span class="loc">Oamaru</span> stone quarry in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, supplying <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> and exporting much overseas. The quarry lies a further mile inland from Weston, so its daily operation is not noticed by Weston residents. International cement manufacturer Holcim has gained consent to open a cement plant near Weston, involving further limestone quarrying. The application prompted the founding of the <span class="org">Waiareka Preservation Society</span>, which opposes the planned plant. Society members are worried how potential extra traffic through the township would impact on roading infrastructure. However, Holcim has stated a preference for rail transport between the cement works and harbour and would seek to reopen the line to Weston.</p><br><br>
