  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Mitchell (sometimes known as Michael or St Michael's) is a village in mid <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is situated 14 miles (22 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Redruth</span> and 17 miles (27 km) west-southwest of <span class="loc">Bodmin</span> on the A30 trunk road. Mitchell straddles the old course of the A30 road but a dual carriageway bypass <span class="date">now</span> carries the traffic north of the village. A 16th-century coaching inn called <span class="org">the Plume of Feathers</span> stands in the main street. The original name was La Medeshole and the first recorded mention of the village was in a court case in <span class="date">1234</span> establishing the legal status of an annual market on <span class="loc">St Francis</span>'s Day. A chapel of <span class="loc">St Francis</span> for the use of wayfarers existed from <span class="date">1239</span> until its destruction at the Reformation. From the Middle Ages on, the <span class="loc">borough of Mitchell</span> elected two members to the <span class="org">Unreformed House of Commons</span> but was disenfranchised by the Reform Act <span class="date">1832</span>. <span class="per">Walter Raleigh</span> and <span class="per">Arthur Wellesley</span>, 1st <span class="per">Duke of Wellington</span> were both MPs representing Mitchell. At <span class="loc">Carland Cross</span>, a mile west of Mitchell, there are Iron Age burial mounds and flint arrow heads have been found in local fields.</p><br><br>
