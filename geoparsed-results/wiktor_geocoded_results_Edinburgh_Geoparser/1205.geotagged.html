The area was traditionally part of Lower Carniola.

The Slovene name is derived from the common noun raka 'wooden cladding preventing water erosion of a bank' or 'cladded chute carrying water to a mill'. Both the Slovene and German names are ultimately derived from Latin arca 'box'. <span class="loc">Raka</span> Castle is a castle west of the main settlement. It is one of the oldest castles in <span class="loc">Slovenia</span> as far as written sources are concerned, mentioned in documents dating to the 12th century.
