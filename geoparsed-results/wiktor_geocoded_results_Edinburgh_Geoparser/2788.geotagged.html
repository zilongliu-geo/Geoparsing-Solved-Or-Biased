<p><span class="loc">Shijing</span> Town (Chinese: 石井; pinyin: Shíjǐng) is a township-level division of <span class="loc">Nan</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> City, in <span class="loc">southern Fujian Province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>. <span class="loc">Shijing</span> Town is located on the western shore of the narrow <span class="loc">Anhai</span> Bay (the estuary of the <span class="loc">Shijing</span> River), where it opens into the <span class="loc">Weitou</span> Bay (围头湾) of the <span class="loc">Taiwan Strait</span>. Administratively, the territory included into Shijing Town forms sort of a southern "panhandle" of <span class="loc">Nan</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> City, and the only part of <span class="loc">Nan</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> that is located on the sea coast. <span class="loc">Shijing</span> is served by Fujian Provincial Highway 201 (S201), which runs generally parallel to the sea coast. As the name (<span class="loc">Shijing</span> 石井 = "Stone Well") indicates, <span class="loc">Shijing</span>, along with the nearby <span class="loc">Shuitou</span>, is a major center of stoneworking. <span class="loc">Shijing</span> is also a sea port of regional importance (administratively, one of the port areas of the Port of <span class="loc">Quanzhou</span>), involved in the cross-strait trade with <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>. <span class="loc">Shijing</span> also has the mainland terminal of the so-called "Quan-Jin Ferry" (short for "Quanzhou-Kinmen Ferry"), the regular passenger ferry service to the nearby <span class="loc">Kinmen</span> (Jinmen) Island, held by the <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>-based <span class="loc">Republic of China</span>. As of February 2012, this ferry (unlike similar ferries from <span class="loc">Xiamen</span>) may only be taken by the PRC and ROC citizens, and not by third-country nationals.</p>
