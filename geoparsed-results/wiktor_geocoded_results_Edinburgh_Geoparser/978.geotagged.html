<p>Salina /səˈlaɪnə/ is a town in <span class="loc">Mayes County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,396 at the 2010 census, a slight decline from 1,422 at the 2000 census. For thousands of years indigenous peoples had lived along the rivers in this area, with varying cultures. By the time of European encounter, the <span class="loc">Osage</span> was a major tribe in the area. Their territory started at the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River and extended west, including to parts of present-day <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. In 1541 the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto and expedition passed through the area, as did the 1721 expedition of Bernard de la Harpe. They gave Spanish names to many of the local streams, which the <span class="loc">Osage</span> had already named. In 1796 Jean Pierre <span class="loc">Chouteau</span>, a French trader from St. Louis, established the first trading post in 1796 at the junction of the Grand/<span class="loc">Neosho River</span> and <span class="loc">Saline Creek</span> for business with the <span class="loc">Osage</span>. Remembered today as one of the first permanent "white" (European-American) settlements in present-day <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, at that time the area was part of the <span class="loc">Province of Louisiana</span>. The <span class="loc">United States</span> took possession of the land that included Salina with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.</p>
