  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Clinton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Vernon County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. The population was 1,354 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The unincorporated community of <span class="loc">Bloomingdale</span> is located partially within the town. The town was named for New York Governor <span class="per">DeWitt Clinton</span>. Recently a movement called "Save Taryn's Beaver" was launched to save a family of beavers on upper <span class="loc">Weister Creek</span>. The beaver is a keystone species, increasing trout and bird biodiversity in its territory through creation of beaver ponds and wetlands. Options to manage the problem include beaver relocation, killing or installation of Flow devices to regulate pond height. The town of <span class="per">Clinton</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> is holding hearings to decide the fate of the <span class="loc">Weister Creek</span> beavers on <span class="date">May 12, 2010</span>. At the first hearing, <span class="date">May 12, 70</span> citizens showed up and it was standing room only in a debate between those who wanted to protect the beavers versus those who feared further road damage or loss of pastureland to wetland. <span class="per">Bill Quackenbush</span>, a representative of the Ho Chunk Tribal Nation, suggested that the <span class="org">Vernon County Board</span>, which recently was awarded $1.2 million in funds from the Ho Chunk Nation to use on county projects, help defray the cost of installation of fencing and flow devices to lower the height of the beaver dam and protect <span class="org">Dell</span> Road. The next hearing will be <span class="date">May 26</span>.</p><br><br>
