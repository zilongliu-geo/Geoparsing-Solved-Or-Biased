  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 21,720. The county seat is Madras. The county is named after <span class="loc">Mount Jefferson</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was created on <span class="date">December 12, 1914</span>, from a portion of <span class="loc">Crook County</span>. The county owes much of its agricultural prosperity to the railroad, which links Madras with the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span>, and was completed in <span class="date">1911</span>, and to the development of irrigation projects in <span class="date">the late 1930s</span>. The railroad was completed despite constant feuds and battles between two lines working on opposite sides of the <span class="loc">Deschutes</span> River. Madras was incorporated in <span class="date">1911</span>, and has been the permanent county seat since a general election in <span class="date">1916</span>. The first (temporary) county seat was <span class="loc">Culver</span>, which was selected by a three-man commission appointed by the governor. Due to repeated tie votes over <span class="date">several days</span> (with one vote each cast for <span class="loc">Culver</span>, <span class="loc">Metolius</span> and Madras). The deadlock was eventually broken by allowing the <span class="loc">Metolius</span> Commissioner to post the tie-breaker, by voting for <span class="loc">Culver</span>. [1]</p><br><br>
