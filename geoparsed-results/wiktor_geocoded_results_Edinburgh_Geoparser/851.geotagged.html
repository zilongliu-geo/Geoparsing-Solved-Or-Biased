<p><span class="loc">Matara</span> (Metera) is an archaeological site in <span class="loc">Eritrea</span>. Situated a few kilometers south of <span class="loc">Senafe</span>, it was a major city in the DÊ¿mt and Aksumite Kingdoms. Since Eritrean independence, the <span class="loc">National Museum</span> of <span class="loc">Eritrea</span> has petitioned the Ethiopian government to return artifacts removed from the site. However, the efforts have thus far been rebuffed. <span class="loc">Matara</span> is the name of both a small village and an important archaeological site in <span class="loc">Eritrea</span>. The latter is located some 136 kilometers southeast of the capital <span class="loc">Asmara</span>, just past <span class="loc">Senafe</span> on the road leading south to the border with the <span class="loc">northern Tigray Region</span> of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. The archaeological site already has yielded evidence of several levels of habitation, including at least two different major cities, covering more than 1000 years. The topmost layers are associated with the Aksumite Empire and date from the fourth to the eighth centuries. This city was allied with or part of the powerful trading empire centered in the capital, <span class="loc">Aksum</span>, to the southwest. It appears that <span class="loc">Matara</span> was one of a string of cities along the trade route that ran from <span class="loc">Aksum</span> to its port city, Adulis, whose extensive ruins, surveyed but largely excavated, are in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Zula</span>, southeast of <span class="loc">Massawa</span> on the <span class="loc">Red Sea</span> coast. Keskese is located 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) north of <span class="loc">Matara</span>.</p>
