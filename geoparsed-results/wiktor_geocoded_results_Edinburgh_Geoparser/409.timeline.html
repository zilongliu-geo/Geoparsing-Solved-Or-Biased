  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salem</span> is a town in New <span class="loc">London County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,151 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The area was originally inhabited by the Mohegan people. The first settlement of European origin in present-day <span class="loc">Salem</span> (then part of the town of <span class="loc">Montville</span>) was deeded in <span class="date">1664</span>. In the early 18th century, more settlements appeared in what was then <span class="loc">Colchester</span>. During this time period, the area was called "Paugwonk". The small neighborhood around the Gardner Lake Firehouse on Route 354 is sometimes still referred to by that name. Because of the remote location of these settlements and the considerable distance to churches, the people petitioned the <span class="org">Connecticut General Court</span> for a new parish in <span class="date">1725</span>. It was named New <span class="loc">Salem Parish</span>, in honor of <span class="per">Colonel Samuel Browne</span>, the largest landowner at the time, who was from <span class="loc">Salem</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Recent archaeological evidence suggests that <span class="per">Colonel Browne</span> owned slaves. The people of <span class="loc">New Salem</span> strongly supported the <span class="org">Patriot</span> cause in the Revolution. <span class="loc">Salem</span> was the first town in the state of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> to have a plantation, owned by the <span class="per">Browne</span> family.</p><br><br>
