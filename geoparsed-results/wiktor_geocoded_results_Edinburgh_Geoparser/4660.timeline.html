  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bangar</span> is a third class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">La Union</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 34,522 people. The name <span class="loc">Bangar</span> (pronounced: Bang-gar) is derived from the bangar tree (pronounced ba- ngar; Sterculia foetida), which were once abundant in the general area of the present town. The bangar is notable for the foul odour that emanates from its flowers. <span class="loc">Agdeppa</span> - Notorious criminals were once often executed with their arms outstretched, and the place was thus called agdeppa, meaning outstretched arms. <span class="per">Alzate</span> - named after a Spanish colonial officer called <span class="per">General Alzate</span>, who manned the garrison in that place against the local revolucionarios. It is said that the <span class="loc">Amburayan River</span> which partly flowed through <span class="loc">Bangar</span> was a favourite swimming hole for Spaniards and the early illustrados. <span class="loc">Bangaoilan</span> - Once called "Anonang", the town was renamed because of the abundance of a poisonous plant called bangaoil. <span class="loc">Barraca</span> - This barrio was formed from the two sitio of <span class="per">Binyadura</span> and <span class="per">Nagpalcan</span>. <span class="loc">Barraca</span> was adopted as the common name after residents of both hamlets signed a pact to end a violent feud between them.</p><br><br>
