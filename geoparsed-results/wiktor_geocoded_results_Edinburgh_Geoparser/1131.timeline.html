  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Brighton</span> is a beach-side suburb of <span class="per">Melbourne, Victoria</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 11 km south-east of <span class="per">Melbourne</span>'s central business district. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Bayside</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> Census, <span class="loc">Brighton</span> had a population of 21,257. <span class="loc">Brighton</span> is named after <span class="loc">Brighton</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. In <span class="loc">England</span>, on <span class="date">29 August 1840</span>, <span class="per">Henry Dendy</span> (<span class="date">1800</span>–81) purchased 5,120 acres (2,070 ha) of <span class="loc">Port Phillip</span> land at £1 per acre, site unseen, under the terms of the short-lived Special Survey regulations. <span class="per">Dendy</span> arrived on <span class="date">5 February 1841</span> to claim his land. The area was known as <span class="org">Dendy's Special Survey</span>. The area <span class="per">Dendy</span> was compelled to take, called "Waterville", was bound by the coastline to the west and the present day North Road, East Boundary Road and South Road. A town was surveyed in mid-1841, defined by the crescent-shaped street layout which remains <span class="date">today</span>, and subdivided allotments were offered for sale. The area soon became the "<span class="loc">Brighton</span> Estate", and <span class="per">Dendy</span>'s site for his own home was named "<span class="loc">Brighton</span> Park". Unfortunately, the land did not have any ready sources of water. Sales were slow at first, and the financial depression came and <span class="per">Dendy</span>'s scheme for emigration and land sales failed. The family of his agent <span class="per">Jonathan Binns</span> Were (<span class="date">1809</span>–85) who had arrived in <span class="per">Melbourne</span> in <span class="date">1839</span>, bought the land. All of <span class="per">Dendy</span>'s business ventures failed, and he died a pauper.</p><br><br>
