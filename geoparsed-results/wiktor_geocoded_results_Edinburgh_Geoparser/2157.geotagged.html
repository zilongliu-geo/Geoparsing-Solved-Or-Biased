<p><span class="loc">Mansfield</span> (also called <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> Village, Dicksons Mills, <span class="loc">Dixons Mills</span>, <span class="loc">Dublin</span> or <span class="loc">New Dublin</span>) is an unincorporated community in Jackson Township, <span class="loc">Parke County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The village was originally named <span class="loc">New Dublin</span> by James Kelsey in 1820, and within a couple of years the village was called Dickn's Mills, and then Strain's Mills before it became known as <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> in the 1930s. The village of <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> prospered and grew because of a roller mill that was built by James Kelsey and Francis Dickson, in 1820. As the milling industry became popular the village grew into a thriving town of more than 300 people. A sash mill and carding mill were added, and the little town grew with the addition of a general store, blacksmith, cooperage, and wagon maker. As the population expanded, a church and a school were organized.
