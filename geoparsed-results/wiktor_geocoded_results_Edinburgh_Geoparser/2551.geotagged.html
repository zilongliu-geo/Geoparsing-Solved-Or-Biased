After a series of major incidents with powerful political interests of the time, on December 3, 1824, Don Braulio Morales successfully founded the town of <span class="loc">Naranjito</span>. The town was founded in the neighborhood of the same name, on a land donated by Doña Manuela Rivera and Don Braulio Morales. Morales was named "Captain Settler" and at the same time was appointed mayor of the town in development. The name "Naranjito" is derived from a small orange tree that served as a reference point for travelers looking for in the shortest way to the town of <span class="loc">Toa Alta</span>. At the time of its foundation, <span class="loc">Naranjito</span> consisted of five wards/districts, "Lomas", "Guadiana", "Achiote", "Nuevo" and "Cedro". "Cedro" was divided in 1853 in "Cedro Arriba" and "Cedro Abajo", also having the urban zone composed by "<span class="loc">San Miguel</span>", "<span class="loc">San Antonio</span>" and "<span class="loc">San Cristobal</span>" districts.</p>
