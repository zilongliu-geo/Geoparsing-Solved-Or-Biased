<p>Foreclosures, support cases locally reflect tough economic times. Statistics from the <span class="loc">Guernsey County</span> Common Pleas Court reflect the current economic conditions, with both foreclosures and child support cases rising sharply since last year. At of the end of February there were 99 foreclosures pending in the court, 20 more than the same time in 2008. The number of child support cases pending through the first two months of 2008 totaled 14. During the same period in 2009 that number has more than doubled to 31. Common Pleas Judge David A. Ellwood said he believes the numbers will only grow. "I would think that would have to follow as the economy and the recession worsen," he said. "Foreclosures obviously follow the economy and if people don't have jobs they clearly won't be able to pay child support. So we're going to have more child support arrearage cases. And we work with people in both of those categories. But the court is dependent on whatever cases are filed. And that's the cases that are filed right now that are increasing." On a brighter note, criminal cases are down from 79 in January and February 2008 to 57 this year and there are currently no domestic violence cases in court, compared to three last year. "Other civil" cases -- those not categorized as professional torts, product liability or other torts -- dropped as well, from 103 last year to 76. "But here's the 800-pound gorilla still in the room," Ellwood said of the foreclosures and child support cases. Total cases pending in the court's general division as of Feb. 28, with 2007 number in parenthesis, are as follows: Total cases pending in the court's domestic relations division as of Feb. 28, with 2007 number in parenthesis, are as follows: The Probation Department currently supervises 240, including 218 on basic probation, nine offenders on pretrial release, four on electronic monitored house arrest and nine drug court participants. Year-to-date statistics in other probation categories include one expungement, 34 home visits, 117 drug tests performed with 30 positive results, 22 arrests. Restitution for victims of crime collected through the end of February totaled $14,599.72. Ellwood said nine community service workers logged 238.75 hours in February, and 430.75 to date in 2009.
