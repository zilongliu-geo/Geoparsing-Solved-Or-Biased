  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Augusta</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 9,274. The confluence of the <span class="loc">Whitewater River</span> and the <span class="loc">Walnut River</span> was originally inhabited by Osage people, who found the land ideal for hunting and fishing. In <span class="date">1868</span>, C. N. <span class="per">James</span> settled in the area and built a log cabin to serve also as a general store and trading post. Around that same time, a post office was established in the settlement, and as the first postmaster, C. N. <span class="per">James</span> named the post office and the town in honor of his wife, <span class="per">Augusta James</span>. In <span class="date">1877</span>, the <span class="loc">Florence</span>, <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company built a branch line from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>. In <span class="date">1881</span> it was extended to <span class="loc">Douglass</span>, and later to <span class="loc">Arkansas City</span>. The rail line was leased and operated by the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway. Service from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">El Dorado</span> was abandoned in <span class="date">1942</span>. The original branch line connected <span class="loc">Florence</span>, Burns, <span class="loc">De Graff</span>, <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>, <span class="loc">Augusta</span>, <span class="loc">Douglass</span>, Rock, <span class="loc">Akron</span>, <span class="loc">Winfield</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas City</span>.</p><br><br>
