Fortaleza's history began on <span class="date">February 2, 1500</span>, when Spaniard Vicente Pinzón landed in Mucuripe's cove and named the new land <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> de la Consolación. Because of the Treaty of <span class="loc">Tordesillas</span>, the discovery was never officially sanctioned.

After a victory over the French in <span class="date">1612</span>, Martins Soares Moreno expanded the Fort of São <span class="loc">Tiago</span> and changed its name to Forte de São Sebastião.</p><br><br>
