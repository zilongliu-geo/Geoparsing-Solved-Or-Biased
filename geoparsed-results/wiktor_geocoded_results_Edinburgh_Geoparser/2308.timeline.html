  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Stanford</span> is a village in <span class="loc">McLean County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 596 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Bloomingtonâ€“Normal Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The beginnings of <span class="per">Stanford Stanford</span> was platted, under the name of Allin, on <span class="date">December 14, 1867</span>. Its founder was <span class="per">John Armstrong</span> (<span class="date">January 20, 1820</span> - <span class="date">August 7, 1912</span>). It was founded when the <span class="loc">Jacksonville Division</span> of the Chicago Alton and <span class="per">St. Louis</span> Railroad was extended westward from <span class="loc">Bloomington</span>. The <span class="loc">McLean County</span> town of <span class="loc">Covell</span> was founded, within <span class="date">a few months</span> of Allen, as a station on the same railroad. In <span class="date">1870</span> the name of the town was changed to <span class="per">Stanford</span>. It was incorporated as a village in <span class="date">June 1874</span>. The town's founder, <span class="per">John Armstrong</span> was born in <span class="loc">Posey County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. He was first a farmer and then ran a grocery in <span class="per">Stanford</span>, where he continued to live until his death in <span class="date">1912</span>. For <span class="date">many years</span> after the town was founded <span class="per">John Armstrong</span> ran a grocery in <span class="per">Stanford</span>. Original town design and development The original town of what would soon become <span class="per">Stanford</span> had an unusual "L" shaped design, with the leg of the "L" extending to the east along the railroad tracks. The large area in the crook of the "L" was not platted, but remained in the hands of <span class="per">John Armstrong</span>, the town founder, whose residence was near the tracks on the north side of the railroad. Rather than a central square, the original plat of <span class="per">Stanford</span>, like many towns laid out in the 1850s and 1860s, featured two rectangular public areas labeled as "Depot Grounds" which extended along either side of the tracks. The depot itself was on the north side of the tracks and, in <span class="date">1874</span>, the grain elevator on the south side. As the town developed most businesses were located south of the tracks. By <span class="date">1895</span> these included a hotel, a bank, the Masonic Hall, and several stores. Except for the depot, most of the railroad related facilities were on the Depot Ground south of the railroad. These included a stock yard, a Lumber yard, and several elevators. This area also held a band stand. There were two early churches in <span class="per">Stanford</span>: the <span class="per">Christian Church</span> on Boundary Street south of the business district and the <span class="per">Presbyterian Church</span> in the southeastern part of town.</p><br><br>
