<p><span class="loc">Sagar</span> (<span class="loc">Saugor</span>), (Hindi: सागर) is a city in the state of <span class="loc">Madhya Pradesh</span> in central <span class="loc">India</span>. Situated on a spur of the Vindhya Range and 1,758 feet (536 m) above sea-level. The city is around 180 kilometres (110 mi) northeast of state capital, <span class="loc">Bhopal</span>. Its original name '<span class="loc">Saugor</span>' is an amalgamation of two words: sau meaning 100 and gahr meaning forts; there were countless small-forts in this region. With time the name has changed from '<span class="loc">Saugor</span>' to '<span class="loc">Sagar</span>'. <span class="loc">Sagar</span> has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi's flagship Smart Cities Mission. The ancient Indian kingdom of Chedi had its capital as "Suktimati", which is located in <span class="loc">Sagar</span> in contemporary times. History of <span class="loc">Sagar District</span> was not known before 1022 A.D., after that all the records are available.Firstly, <span class="loc">Sagar</span> was under the rule of Ahir Rajas and their capital was at "Garhpehra". in 1660 A.D. Udenshah founded the present <span class="loc">Sagar</span> Town. <span class="loc">Sagar</span> owes its importance to having been made the capital of the <span class="loc">Maratha</span> governor Govind Pant Bundele who established himself here in 1735. By a treaty concluded with the Maratha Peshwa in 1818, at the conclusion of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the greater part of the present district was made over to the British. The town became the capital of the <span class="loc">Saugor</span> and <span class="loc">Nerbudda Territories</span>, then attached to the North-Western Provinces. The <span class="loc">Saugor</span> and <span class="loc">Nerbudda Territories</span> later became part of the Central Provinces (afterwards Central Provinces and <span class="loc">Berar</span>) and <span class="loc">Sagar District</span> was added to <span class="loc">Jabalpur Division</span>. During the Revolt of 1857 the whole district was in the possession of the rebels, except the town and fort, in which the British were shut up for eight months, until relieved by Sir Hugh Rose. The rebels were totally defeated and British rule restored by March 1858.</p>
