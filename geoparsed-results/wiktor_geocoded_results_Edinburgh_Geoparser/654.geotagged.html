<p><span class="loc">Arlington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Bennington County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,317 at the 2010 census. The town of <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was chartered July 28, 1761, by <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Governor Benning Wentworth, as part of the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Grants. In 1777, <span class="loc">Arlington</span> became the first capital of the <span class="loc">Vermont</span> Republic. Among the first settlers in <span class="loc">Arlington</span> were Captain Jehiel Hawley and his family, who had settled there by 1764. They were Anglicans and had fled <span class="loc">Roxbury</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, because of the oppressive requirements of the established Congregational church. At a Proprietor's meeting in 1764, the town voted to give 50 acres (20 hectares) of land to any man who would set up a gristmill in what is now <span class="loc">East Arlington</span>. This offer was accepted by Remember Baker (first cousin of Ethan Allen), who built a grist and sawmill. In the years leading up to the American Revolution, both <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> laid claim to lands comprising current-day <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. The Province of <span class="loc">New York</span> began to grant land in 1765, lagging <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> by four years. <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was, for the most part, settled by Anglicans from <span class="loc">Roxbury</span>, <span class="loc">Newtown</span>, and <span class="loc">Milford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, with ownership rights derived from the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Grants.</p>
