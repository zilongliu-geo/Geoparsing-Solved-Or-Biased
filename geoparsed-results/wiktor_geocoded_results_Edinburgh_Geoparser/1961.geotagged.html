A tract of land in the town was purchased by Benjamin Hovey, from <span class="loc">Oxford</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The first settlers in <span class="loc">Oxford</span> arrived in the spring of 1789. Elijah Blackman, his son Jabez Blackman, and eleven-year-old adopted daughter Polly Knapp built a primitive log cabin on an island in the <span class="loc">Chenango River</span>. The little island on which the Blackman family had squatted had previously been bought by Benjamin Hovey, who when he came on later to take possession, gave them in consideration of the improvements made, a piece of land, a mile and a half up the river. Blackman resided there until his death, which occurred about the year 1825.</p>
