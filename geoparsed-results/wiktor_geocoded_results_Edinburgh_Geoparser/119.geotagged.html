Most of <span class="loc">Richmond</span>'s original buildings were built from the mid-1840s through the 1860s and consisted of Greek Revival rural farmhouse and <span class="loc">Richmond</span>'s commercial district. Houses within the village were built mostly in the Greek Revival style as well with later prominent homes cast in the Italianate or Second Empire styles.
