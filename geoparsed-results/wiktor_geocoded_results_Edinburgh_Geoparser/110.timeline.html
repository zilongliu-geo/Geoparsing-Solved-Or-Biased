  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Richmond</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 3 km south-east of <span class="org">Melbourne's Central Business District</span> in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Yarra</span> municipality. The <span class="date">2011</span> Census listed Richmond's population as 26,121. Three of the 82 designated major activity centres identified in the <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> <span class="date">2030</span> Metropolitan Strategy are located in Richmondâ€”the commercial strips of <span class="per">Victoria Street</span>, Bridge Road and <span class="loc">Swan Street</span>. The diverse suburb has been the subject of gentrification since <span class="date">the early 1990s</span> and <span class="date">now</span> contains an eclectic mix of expensively converted warehouse residences, public housing high-rise flats and terrace houses from the Victorian-era. The residential segment of the suburb exists among a lively retail sector. <span class="loc">Richmond</span> was home to the Nine Network studios, under the callsign of GTV-9, until the studios moved to Docklands in <span class="date">2011</span>. Dimmeys is long associated with <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, although it is located in the neighbouring suburb of <span class="loc">Cremorne</span>. The suburb is well known for its popular factory outlets along Bridge Road, remaining an attraction to the area. <span class="loc">Richmond</span> is well known for its vibrant and popular Little Saigon area along <span class="per">Victoria Street</span>; however, the area is also recognised for the illicit drug dealing (especially heroin) that occurs in both street-based and domestic contexts.</p><br><br>
