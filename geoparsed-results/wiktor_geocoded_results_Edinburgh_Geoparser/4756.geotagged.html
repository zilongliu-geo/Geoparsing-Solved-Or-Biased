<p><span class="loc">Marietta</span> is located in central <span class="loc">Cobb County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and is the county's seat and largest city. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 56,579. The 2013 estimate is 59,089, making it one of the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> metropolitan area's largest suburbs. <span class="loc">Marietta</span> is the fourth largest of the principal cities (by population) of the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> metropolitan statistical area. Homes were built by early settlers near the Cherokee town of <span class="loc">Big Shanty</span> (now <span class="loc">Kennesaw</span>) prior to 1824. The first plat was laid out in 1833. Like most towns, <span class="loc">Marietta</span> had a square in the center with a courthouse. The Georgia General Assembly legally recognized the community on December 19, 1834. Built in 1838, Oakton House is the oldest continuously occupied residence in <span class="loc">Marietta</span>. The original barn, milk house, smokehouse, and wellhouse remain on the property. The spectacular gardens contain the boxwood parterre from the 1870s. <span class="loc">Oakton</span> served as Major General Loring's headquarters during the Battle of <span class="loc">Kennesaw Mountain</span> in 1864. <span class="loc">Marietta</span> was initially selected as the hub for the new Western and Atlantic Railroad, and business boomed. By 1838, roadbed and trestles had been built north of the city. However, in 1840, political wrangling stopped construction for a time. In 1842, the railroad's new management decided to move the hub from <span class="loc">Marietta</span> to an area that would become <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>. Nonetheless, in 1850, when the railroad began operation, <span class="loc">Marietta</span> shared in the resulting prosperity.</p>
