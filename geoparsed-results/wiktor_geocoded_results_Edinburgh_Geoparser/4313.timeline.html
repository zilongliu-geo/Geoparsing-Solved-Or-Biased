  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ensenada</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [enseˈnaða]) is a coastal city in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, the third-largest in <span class="loc">Baja California</span>. Lying 125 kilometres (78 mi) south of <span class="loc">San Diego</span> on the <span class="loc">Baja California</span> Peninsula, it is locally referred to as La Cenicienta del Pacífico, "The <span class="loc">Cinderella</span> of the Pacific." One of the first settlements founded in the Californias, <span class="loc">Ensenada</span> has emerged as a cruise ship destination, aerospace center, and there is a nearby region to the north east where wine grapes are grown. It is said that the first Vitis vinifera made it to the region's <span class="org">San Ignacio Mission</span> in <span class="date">1703</span>, when <span class="per">Jesuit Padre Juan de Ugarte</span> planted the first vineyards there. Situated on the coastline of Bahía de Todos Santos—an inlet of the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> on the peninsula's Gold Coast—the Port of <span class="loc">Ensenada</span> is an important commercial, fishing, and tourist port. The city is home to a navy base, army base, and Ensenada Airport, a military airfield which doubles as an airport of entry into <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. <span class="loc">Ensenada</span> is the municipal seat and cultural and commercial center of Ensenada Municipality, one of five into which the state is divided. As of <span class="date">2015</span>, the <span class="loc">city of Ensenada</span> had a population of 519,813.</p><br><br>
