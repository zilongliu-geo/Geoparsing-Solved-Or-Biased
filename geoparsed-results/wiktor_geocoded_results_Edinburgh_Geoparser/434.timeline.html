  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Washington</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, within the <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="loc">PA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area in the southwestern part of the state. The population was 13,663 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, <span class="loc">Washington</span> has a total area of 3.3 square miles (8.5 km2), all land. Delaware Indian chief <span class="per">Tangooqua</span>, commonly known as "Catfish", had a camp on a branch of <span class="loc">Chartiers Creek</span>, in what is <span class="date">now</span> part of the <span class="loc">city of Washington</span>. The French labeled the area "Wissameking", meaning "catfish place", as early as <span class="date">1757</span>. The area of <span class="loc">Washington</span> was settled by many immigrants from <span class="loc">Scotland</span> and the north of <span class="loc">Ireland</span> along with settlers from eastern and central parts of colonial Virginia. It was first settled by colonists around <span class="date">1768</span>. The <span class="org">Pennsylvania General Assembly</span> passed an act on <span class="date">March 28, 1781</span>, erecting the <span class="loc">County of Washington</span> and naming "Catfish Camp" as the place for holding the first election. This was the first county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> to be named in honor of General <span class="loc">George Washington</span>. <span class="per">David Hoge</span> laid out a plan of lots immediately after the legislature's action. His original plot carried the name "Bassett, alias <span class="per">Dandridge Town</span>," but before the plot was recorded, lines were drawn through "Bassett, alias <span class="per">Dandridge Town</span>" with ink, and the word "Washington" was written above. There have long been rumors among locals that the town was named “Washington” because <span class="loc">George Washington</span> spent the night in the region once. This is not true however; <span class="loc">Washington</span> had never been to the area.</p><br><br>
