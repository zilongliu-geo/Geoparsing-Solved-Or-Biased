It is <span class="loc">India</span>'s smallest state by area and the fourth smallest by population. <span class="loc">Goa</span> is one of <span class="loc">India</span>'s richest states with a GDP per capita two and a half times that of the country as a whole. It was ranked the best placed state by the Eleventh Finance Commission for its infrastructure and ranked on top for the best quality of life in <span class="loc">India</span> by the National Commission on Population based on the 12 Indicators. <span class="loc">Panaji</span> is the state's capital, while <span class="loc">Vasco da Gama</span> is the largest city. The historic <span class="loc">city of Margao</span> still exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first landed in the early 16th century as merchants and conquered it soon thereafter. <span class="loc">Goa</span> is a former Portuguese province; the Portuguese overseas territory of Portuguese <span class="loc">India</span> existed for about 450 years until it was annexed by <span class="loc">India</span> in 1961. <span class="loc">Goa</span> is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year for its beaches, places of worship and world heritage architecture. It also has rich flora and fauna, owing to its location on the <span class="loc">Western Ghats</span> range, which is classified as a biodiversity hotspot.</p>
