<p><span class="loc">Jones County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 67,761. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seats are Laurel and Ellisville. <span class="loc">Jones County</span> is part of the Laurel, MS Micropolitan Statistical Area. Less than a decade after <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> became the country's 20th state, settlers carved out a 700-square mile of pine forests and streams for a new county in 1826. They named it <span class="loc">Jones County</span> after <span class="loc">John Paul Jones</span>, the early American Naval hero who rose from humble Scottish origin to military success during the American Revolution. Ellisville, the county seat, was named for Powhatan Ellis, a member of the Mississippi Legislature who claimed to be a direct descendant of <span class="loc">Pocahontas</span>. During the economic hard times in the 1830s and 1840s, there was an exodus of population from <span class="loc">South Mississippi</span>, principally to <span class="loc">Texas</span>, and the slogan "GTT" ("Gone to <span class="loc">Texas</span>") came into currency. Soon after the election of <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span> as <span class="loc">United States</span> president in November 1860, slave-owning planters led <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> to join <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> and secede from the Union in January 1861. Other Southern states would follow suit. Mississippi’s Declaration of Secession reflected the planters’ interests in its first sentence: “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery…” However, the yeoman farmers and cattle herders of <span class="loc">Jones County</span> had little use for a war over a “state’s right” to maintain the institution of slavery. By 1860, slaves made up only 12% of the total population in <span class="loc">Jones County</span>, the smallest percentage of any county in the state.</p>
