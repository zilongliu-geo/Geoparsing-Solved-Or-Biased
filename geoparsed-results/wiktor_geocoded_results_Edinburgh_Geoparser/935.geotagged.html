<p><span class="loc">San Esteban</span> is a barangay in <span class="loc">Antacudos district</span> of <span class="loc">Nabua</span>, <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span> in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. In 1569, when the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> was still a colony of <span class="loc">Spain</span>, <span class="loc">San Esteban</span> was a part of Rancheria Antacudos of <span class="loc">Bua</span>, which was the name of <span class="loc">Nabua</span> at that time. The other rancherias were Caobnan, <span class="loc">Sabang</span>, <span class="loc">Lupa</span> and <span class="loc">Binoyoan</span>. Before the Spaniards came, <span class="loc">Nabua</span> was ruled by a Muslim Chieftain named Datu Ogbon. Several barangays of <span class="loc">Nabua</span> carry his name, such as <span class="loc">San</span> Vicente Ogbon and San Antonio Ogbon, among others. The flag of <span class="loc">San Esteban</span>, called the "The Steven's Flag", features eight yellow stars on a blue field. At its center are white Star and crescent on a black background. On the upper left part is an orange Greek cross. The eight yellow stars refers to the eight zones of <span class="loc">San Esteban</span>: <span class="loc">Centro North</span>, <span class="loc">Centro South</span>, <span class="loc">Likod North</span>, <span class="loc">Likod South</span>, Cabuntaran, <span class="loc">Magol</span> East, <span class="loc">Magol</span> West and Folklands. The star and crescent and orange Greek cross represent the Muslim and Christian citizens of the community. The blue background symbolizes the peaceful co-existence among the people of <span class="loc">San Esteban</span>.</p>
