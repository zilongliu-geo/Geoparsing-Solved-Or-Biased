<p><span class="loc">Claremont</span> is a Southern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> community located in the north part of the <span class="loc">City of Pickering</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Historically, <span class="loc">Claremont</span> was part of <span class="loc">Pickering Township</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario County</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span> until 1974 when <span class="loc">Ontario County</span> was amalgamated into the <span class="loc">Regional Municipality of Durham</span> established at that time. It is one of many rural villages with suburban type housing mixed with older, historic buildings in the Greater Toronto Area. Brock Road, the main north-south Regional road in the area was realigned to bypass the village to the east in 1970. <span class="loc">Claremont</span> is situated just below the Oak Ridges Moraine in the <span class="loc">Greenbelt</span>. Typical of the moraine countryside, around 50 to 70% of the land area around <span class="loc">Claremont</span> is forested. The remaining land around the village is wooded farmland and streams. Until the establishment of regional government in 1974, the municipal offices of the former Township of <span class="loc">Pickering</span> were located in <span class="loc">Claremont</span>. Access to and traffic through <span class="loc">Claremont</span> increased greatly with the completion of the eastern extension of the Highway 407 highway, terminating at the Brock Road exit which opened in 2001. The Havelock Subdivision of the Canadian Pacific Railway runs through <span class="loc">Claremont</span>. This line is used for freight traffic, but there have been proposals for the return of passenger service as part of a GO Transit expansion to <span class="loc">Peterborough</span>.</p>
