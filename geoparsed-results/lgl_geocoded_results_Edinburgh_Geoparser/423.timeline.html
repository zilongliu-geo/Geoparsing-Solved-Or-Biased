  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Haslett student telethon raises $16,000. Kathryn Prater kprater@lsj.com <span class="date">March 23, 2009</span> From LSJ.com Kids in the school's advanced film and TV class hosted the telethon <span class="date">Friday</span> and <span class="date">Saturday</span> on the school's student-run TV station, "The Vision." In an unofficial count, they raised about $16,000 total, said Brian Town, station director and film teacher. They will donate half of that to Haven House, a shelter in <span class="loc">East Lansing</span> that provides emergency housing and services for families. The rest of the money will go toward the school's film program, he said. “In this economy, I think it’s a great effort,” Town said. “We measure our success by (the fact that) we completed it with a successful show, and we raised enough money to help some people.” For the telethon, community members pledged money and made bids on 170 auction items, all of which sold, Town said. The cheapest was a $15 doll, and the most expensive &#x96; a teeth whitening treatment &#x96; went for $225, he said.</p><br><br>
