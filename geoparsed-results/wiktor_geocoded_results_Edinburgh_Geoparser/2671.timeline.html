  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Brunswick</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span> in southeastern <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 20,278 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Part of the <span class="loc">Portland-South Portland-Biddeford metropolitan</span> area, <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> is home to <span class="org">Bowdoin College</span>, the <span class="org">Bowdoin College Museum of Art</span>, the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum, The <span class="org">Theater Project</span>, and the <span class="org">Maine State Music Theatre</span>. It is also home to Mid Coast Hospital, one of <span class="loc">Maine</span>'s newest full-service hospitals; and <span class="org">Parkview Adventist Medical Center</span>. It was home to Naval Air Station <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> which was permanently closed on <span class="date">May 31, 2011</span>. Settled in <span class="date">1628</span> by Thomas Purchase and other fishermen, the area was called by its Indian name, <span class="loc">Pejepscot</span>, meaning "the long, rocky rapids part [of the river]". In <span class="date">1639</span>, Purchase placed his settlement under protection of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span>. During <span class="per">King Philip</span>'s War in <span class="date">1676</span>, <span class="loc">Pejepscot</span> was burned and abandoned, although a garrison called Fort Andros was built on the ruins during <span class="per">King William</span>'s War. During the war, in Major <span class="per">Benjamin Church</span>'s second expedition <span class="date">a year later</span>, he arrived on <span class="date">11 September 1690</span> with 300 men at <span class="loc">Casco</span> Bay. He went up the <span class="loc">Androscoggin</span> River to the English Fort Pejepscot (present day <span class="loc">Brunswick</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>). From there he went 40 miles up-river and attacked a native village. Three or four native men were shot in retreat; when Church discovered 5 English captives in the wigwams, six or seven prisoners were butchered as an example; and nine prisoners were taken. <span class="date">A few days later</span>, in retaliation, the natives attacked Church at <span class="loc">Cape Elizabeth</span> on <span class="loc">Purpooduc</span> Point, killing 7 of his men and wounding 24 others. On <span class="date">September 26</span>, Church returned to <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>.</p><br><br>
