<p>Summit is a city in <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city's population was 21,457, reflecting an increase of 326 (+1.5%) from the 21,131 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 1,374 (+7.0%) from the 19,757 counted in the 1990 Census. Summit had the 16th-highest per capita income in the state as of the 2000 Census. Originally incorporated as Summit Township by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on March 23, 1869, from portions of <span class="loc">New Providence</span> Township (now <span class="loc">Berkeley Heights</span>) and Springfield Township, Summit was reincorporated as a city on March 8, 1899. Possible derivations of Summit's name include its location atop the <span class="loc">Second Watchung Mountain</span>; the Summit Lodge, the house to which jurist James Kent moved in 1837 and which stands today at 50 Kent Place Boulevard; and to a local sawmill owner who granted passage to the <span class="loc">Morris</span> and Essex Railroad for a route to "the summit of the <span class="loc">Short Hills</span>". The region in which Summit is located was purchased from Native Americans on October 28, 1664. Summit's earliest European settlers came to the area around the year 1710. The original name of Summit was "<span class="loc">Turkey Hill</span>" to distinguish it from the area then known as "<span class="loc">Turkey</span>" (<span class="loc">New Providence</span>'s original name until 1759). During the American Revolutionary War period, Summit was known as "<span class="loc">Beacon Hill</span>", because bonfire beacons were lit on an eastern ridge in Summit to warn the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> militiamen of approaching British troops.</p>
