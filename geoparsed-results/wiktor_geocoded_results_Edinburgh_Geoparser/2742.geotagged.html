<p><span class="loc">Alang</span> is a census town in <span class="loc">Bhavnagar district</span> in the Indian state of <span class="loc">Gujarat</span>. In the past three decades, its beaches have become a major worldwide centre for ship breaking. The longest ship ever built, Seawise Giant, was sailed to and beached here for demolition in December 2009. The shipyards at Alang recycle approximately half of all ships salvaged around the world. It is considered the world's largest graveyard of ships. The yards are located on the Gulf of Khambat, 50 kilometres southeast of <span class="loc">Bhavnagar</span>. Large supertankers, car ferries, container ships, and a dwindling number of ocean liners are beached during high tide, and as the tide recedes, hundreds of manual labourers dismantle each ship, salvaging what they can and reducing the rest to scrap. The salvage yards at <span class="loc">Alang</span> have generated controversy about working conditions, workers' living conditions, and the impact on the environment. One major problem is that despite many serious work-related injuries, the nearest full service hospital is 50 kilometres away in <span class="loc">Bhavnagar</span>. <span class="loc">Alang</span> became the centre of an international controversy when the <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> of <span class="loc">India</span> temporarily prohibited the French aircraft carrier <span class="loc">Clemenceau</span> from entering the port in January 2006. Attempts to reach a settlement were unsuccessful, and <span class="loc">Clemenceau</span> was sent to a ship-breaking harbour in <span class="loc">England</span> instead.</p>
