<p>Semi left in <span class="loc">Niota</span>, but not the trailer full of whiskey. Police reports from <span class="loc">Nashville</span> describe a poor quality video showing a black man wearing a blue shirt first break into a truck before hooking it up to a red cargo trailer and driving away. He cut a lock on the front gate where the truck and trailer were being stored and drove off into the night. Carver responded and determined that it was the truck stolen in <span class="loc">Nashville</span>. However, the trailer and its contents were nowhere around. Metro Nashville police records state the trailer is painted red, 40 feet long, with the word "Hyundai" painted its on sides. According to reports, there were 1,064 cases of Jack Daniel's whiskey, along with 1,028 cases of various other whiskeys, inside the trailer which was scheduled to be shipped to <span class="loc">Miami</span>.</p>
