  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Ogden</span> /ˈɒɡdɛn/ is a city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Weber County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, approximately 10 miles (16 km) east of the <span class="loc">Great Salt Lake</span> and 40 miles (64 km) north of <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span>. The population was 84,316 in <span class="date">2014</span>, according to the <span class="org">US Census Bureau</span>. The city served as a major railway hub through much of its history, and still handles a great deal of freight rail traffic which makes it a convenient location for manufacturing and commerce. <span class="per">Ogden</span> is also known for its many historic buildings, proximity to the <span class="loc">Wasatch</span> Mountains, and as the location of Weber State University. <span class="per">Ogden</span> is a principal city of the Ogden–Clearfield, <span class="loc">Utah Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which includes all of <span class="per">Weber, Morgan</span>, and <span class="per">Davis</span> counties. The <span class="date">2010</span> Census placed the Metro population at 547,184. In <span class="date">2010</span>, <span class="loc">Forbes</span> rated the Ogden-Clearfield MSA as the 6th best place to raise a family. <span class="per">Ogden</span> has had a Sister City relationship to <span class="loc">Hof</span> (<span class="loc">Germany</span>) since <span class="date">1954</span>. Originally named Fort Buenaventura, the <span class="loc">city of Ogden</span> was the first permanent settlement by people of European descent in the region that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Utah</span>. It was established by the trapper <span class="per">Miles Goodyear</span> in <span class="date">1846</span> about a mile west of where downtown <span class="per">Ogden</span> is currently located. In <span class="date">November 1847</span>, Fort Buenaventura was purchased by the Mormon settlers for $1,950. The settlement was then called <span class="loc">Brownsville</span>, after Captain <span class="per">James Brown</span>, but was later named <span class="per">Ogden</span> for a brigade leader of the Hudson's Bay Company, <span class="per">Peter Skene Ogden</span>, who had trapped in the Weber Valley a generation earlier. The site of the original Fort Buenaventura is <span class="date">now</span> a <span class="loc">Weber County</span> park.</p><br><br>
