<p>Dōngfāng (simplified Chinese: 东方; traditional Chinese: 東方; literally: "the East") is one of the seven county-level <span class="loc">cities of Hainan</span> province, <span class="loc">China</span>. Although called a "city", <span class="loc">Dongfang</span> refers to a large land area in <span class="loc">Hainan</span> - an area which was once a county. Within this area is the main city, <span class="loc">Dongfang City</span>. It is located on the western coast of <span class="loc">Hainan Island</span> facing <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> across the <span class="loc">Gulf of Tonkin</span>, and in 2004 had a population of 435,000. As all county-level units, <span class="loc">Dongfang</span> is administratively divided into township-level units (see the list). The main urban area of <span class="loc">Dongfang</span> (i.e., what used to be called "the county seat", when <span class="loc">Dongfang</span> was a county) is the town of <span class="loc">Basuo</span>. The former <span class="loc">county of Ganen</span> (postal: <span class="loc">Kumyan</span>, <span class="loc">Kanem</span> or <span class="loc">Kamyan</span>) is now part of the city. <span class="loc">Dongfang</span> has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen Aw). Monsoonal influences are strong, and the two seasons are the wet season and the dry season (November to April), when very little rainfall occurs. Rainfall is heaviest and most frequent from August to October, when typhoons may strike, and averages an annual total of 961 mm (37.8 in), far lower than much of the island. January thru March features the highest relative humidity levels of the year, while May thru August is very sunny, consistently averaging above 60% of possible sunshine. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 46% in February to 67% in May, the city receives 2,558 hours of sunshine annually, a level not seen in the southern half of <span class="loc">China</span> outside of <span class="loc">Tibet</span>. The average low temperature remains above 26.0 °C (78.8 °F) from June to August.</p>
