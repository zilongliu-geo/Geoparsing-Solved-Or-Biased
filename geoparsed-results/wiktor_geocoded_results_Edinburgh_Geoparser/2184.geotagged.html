<p><span class="loc">Stockton</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The borough sits on the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River at the western end of <span class="loc">Amwell</span> Valley. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 538, reflecting a decline of 22 (-3.9%) from the 560 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn declined by 69 (-11.0%) from the 629 counted in the 1990 Census. <span class="loc">Stockton</span> was incorporated as a borough by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on April 14, 1898, from portions of <span class="loc">Delaware</span> Township. <span class="loc">Stockton</span> is located along the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River north of <span class="loc">Lambertville</span>. The community was first known as Reading Ferry and later as Howell's Ferry. The name was changed to Centre Bridge Station to match the name of the post office and hamlet on the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> side of the river. The name became <span class="loc">Stockton</span> with the creation of a local post office in 1851. The town was named in honor of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senator Robert Field Stockton, who was instrumental in the creation of the <span class="loc">Delaware and Raritan Canal</span>. The Borough was incorporated in 1898, having been separated from <span class="loc">Delaware</span> Township.</p>
