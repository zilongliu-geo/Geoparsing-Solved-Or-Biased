  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Providence is the capital and most populous city in <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. Founded in <span class="date">1636</span>, it is one of the oldest cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located in <span class="loc">Providence County</span>, and is the third-largest city in the <span class="loc">New England</span> region after <span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">Worcester</span>. Providence has a city population of 179,154 and is part of the 38th-largest metropolitan population in the country, with an estimated population of 1,604,291, exceeding that of <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> by about 60%, as it extends into southern <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. This can be considered in turn to be part of the Greater <span class="loc">Boston</span> commuting area, which contains 7.6 million people. The city is situated at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Providence River</span>, at the head of <span class="loc">Narragansett Bay</span>. Providence was founded by <span class="per">Roger Williams</span>, a religious exile from the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span>. He named the area in honor of "God's merciful Providence", which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle. After becoming one of the first cities in the country to industrialize, Providence became noted for its jewelry and silverware industry. <span class="date">Today</span>, the <span class="loc">city of Providence</span> is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning, which has shifted the city's economy into service industries, though it still retains significant manufacturing activity.</p><br><br>
