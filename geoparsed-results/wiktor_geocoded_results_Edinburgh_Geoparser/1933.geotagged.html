<p><span class="loc">Riverton</span> (Arapaho: Hóóxonó'oo) is a city in <span class="loc">Fremont County</span>, <span class="loc">Wyoming</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city's population was 10,615 at the 2010 census. The city is an incorporated entity of the state of <span class="loc">Wyoming</span>. The community was named <span class="loc">Riverton</span> because of the four rivers that meet there. The town was built on land ceded from the Wind River Reservation in 1906, a situation that often makes it subject to jurisdictional claims by the nearby Eastern <span class="loc">Shoshone</span> and Northern Arapaho tribes. Recent legal rulings indicate the land may have been sold but not ceded...(BIA Solicitor Opinion, October, 2011) In December 2013, the <span class="loc">US</span> <span class="loc">Environmental Protection Agency</span>, Department of Interior and Department of Justice found <span class="loc">Riverton</span> to be a part of the <span class="loc">Wind River Indian Reservation</span>. <span class="loc">Riverton</span> is located at 43°1′40″N 108°23′42″W (43.027838, −108.395077).
