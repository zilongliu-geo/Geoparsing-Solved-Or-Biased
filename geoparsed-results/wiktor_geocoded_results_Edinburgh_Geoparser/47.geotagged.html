<p><span class="loc">Florida</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Berkshire County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Pittsfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is home to the east portal of the Hoosac Tunnel, as well as <span class="loc">Whitcomb Summit</span> (elevation 2,172 ft or 662 m), the highest point of the Mohawk Trail. <span class="loc">Florida</span> contains the village of <span class="loc">Drury</span>. At the 2010 census the town had a total population of 752. Most of what is now <span class="loc">Florida</span> was originally a grant to the town of <span class="loc">Bernardston</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> made sometime before 1771. The first settler, Dr. Daniel Nelson, arrived around 1783. The town was incorporated in 1805 and named "Florida", perhaps because Spanish <span class="loc">Florida</span> was a topic of conversation at the time. The town was mostly agrarian, with maple syrup, wool, and potatoes its main products for many years. However, in the mid-nineteenth century, the town was a boom town for the workers involved in the construction of the Hoosac Tunnel, a rail tunnel which begins on the town's eastern border and extends through the Hoosac Range to neighboring <span class="loc">North Adams</span>.</p>
