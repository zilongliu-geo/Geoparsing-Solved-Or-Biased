<p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 24,498 at the 2010 census. It is believed that <span class="loc">Burlington</span> takes its name from the English town of <span class="loc">Bridlington</span>, <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span> but this has never been confirmed . It was first settled in 1641 and was officially incorporated on February 28, 1799; several of the early homesteads are still standing, such as the Francis Wyman House, dating from 1666. The town is sited on the watersheds of the <span class="loc">Ipswich</span>, Mystic, and Shawsheen rivers. In colonial times up through the late 19th century, there was industry in the mills along Vine Brook, which runs from <span class="loc">Lexington</span> to <span class="loc">Bedford</span> and then empties into the <span class="loc">Shawsheen River</span>. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is now a suburban industrial town at the junction of the Boston-Merrimack corridor, but for most of its history it was almost entirely agricultural, selling hops and rye to <span class="loc">Boston</span> and supplementing that income with small shoe-making shops. Early railroad expansion passed the town by (although the town was serviced by the Middlesex Turnpike), limiting its early development, and <span class="loc">Burlington</span> continued to cure hams for the Boston market and produce milk, fruit, and vegetables.</p>
