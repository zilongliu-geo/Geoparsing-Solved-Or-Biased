  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Montana airplane crash victims had Laurel ties. Four of the 14 passengers who died in an airline crash in Montana <span class="date">Sunday</span> had ties to <span class="loc">Laurel County</span>. <span class="per">Brent Ching</span>, his wife <span class="per">Kristen</span> and his children, Hailey, 6, and <span class="per">Caleb</span>, 4, all of whom died in the crash, were related to the late <span class="per">Dr. Caleb Chu</span>, who worked as a physician at Oneida Mountain Hospital for <span class="date">more than 30 years</span>. <span class="per">Brent Ching</span> was <span class="per">Chu</span>’s grandson. <span class="per">Chu</span>’s widow and Ching’s stepgrandmother, <span class="per">Priscilla</span>, has lived in <span class="loc">London</span> for <span class="date">more than 30 years</span>. <span class="per">Priscilla Chu</span> said the family was flying from <span class="loc">Oroville</span>, <span class="loc">Calif.</span>, to Montana for a ski trip. <span class="per">Chu</span> said the Chings were avid skiers. “Even the little ones skied,” she said. <span class="per">Chu</span> said she heard about what happened while watching the news on TV. “When they mentioned <span class="loc">Oroville</span>, it clicked,” she said. <span class="per">Brent Ching</span>, a dentist, was the son of <span class="per">Phyllis Chu</span>, <span class="per">Caleb Chu</span>’s daughter. While <span class="per">Phyllis Chu</span> was raised in <span class="loc">Clay County</span>, <span class="loc">Ching</span> grew up in <span class="loc">California</span>. His uncle <span class="per">Perry Chu</span>, who attended <span class="org">Laurel County High School</span>, also lives out west. <span class="per">Priscilla Chu</span> said she spoke to <span class="per">Perry</span>, an anesthesiologist, <span class="date">Sunday</span>. “He was in bad shape and was in shock,” she said. As to how she felt, <span class="per">Priscilla Chu</span> just answered, “How would you feel?” <span class="per">Chu</span> visited the <span class="per">Ching</span> family in <span class="date">August</span> and said the kids were a joy. “They were so young, they loved everybody,” she said. Seven of the 14 killed in the crash were believed to be children who ranged in age from 1 to 9. Around <span class="date">11:30 a.m. Sunday</span>, the plane was headed to <span class="loc">Bozeman</span>, <span class="loc">Mont.</span>, but rerouted suddenly to Butte. The PC-12, which was built in <span class="date">2001</span>, nose-dived into Holy Cross Cemetery, just 500 feet short of the runway at Butte’s <span class="per">Bert Mooney</span> Airport. Reports <span class="date">Tuesday</span> showed ice might have been a factor in the crash. There were no survivors.
