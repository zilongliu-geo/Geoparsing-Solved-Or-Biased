<p><span class="loc">Charlestown</span> (also known as Charlestown-on-Forth) is a town in Fife, <span class="loc">Scotland</span> on the north shore of the <span class="loc">Firth of Forth</span>. It is 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) west of Limekilns, and 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south-west of <span class="loc">Dunfermline</span>. <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> was established in 1770 by Charles Bruce, 5th Earl of Elgin. The planned village is laid out in the shape of a letter E for Elgin. It was established as a harbour town for the shipment of coal mined on Lord Elgin's Fife estates, and for the production of lime. The harbour's outer basin was built around 1840. In 1887, on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, the Queen's Hall was built at the village centre, to designs by Robert Rowand Anderson. Shipbuilding was carried on at <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> in the 19th century, as well as ship-breaking. Some of the German Imperial Fleet were brought here from <span class="loc">Scapa Flow</span> after World War I to be broken up. <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> is the home of Broomhall Cricket Club, named after <span class="loc">Broomhall</span>, the nearby home of Lord Elgin. They have a 1st XI and a 2nd XI that play in the Scottish East League run by the East of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> Cricket Association and have junior, midweek and Sunday teams as well. They play at The Cairns, <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>.</p>
