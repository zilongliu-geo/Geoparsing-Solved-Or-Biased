<p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Dorchester County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 12,326 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Dorchester County</span> and the county's largest municipality. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is the fourth most populous city in <span class="loc">Maryland</span>'s <span class="loc">Eastern Shore</span> region, after <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="loc">Elkton</span> and <span class="loc">Easton</span>. Settled by English colonists in 1684, <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is one of the oldest colonial cities in <span class="loc">Maryland</span>. At the time of English colonization, the Algonquian-speaking Choptank Indians were already living along the river of the same name. During the colonial years, the English colonists developed farming on the <span class="loc">Eastern Shore</span>. The largest plantations were devoted first to tobacco, and then mixed farming. Planters bought enslaved Africans to farm tobacco and mixed farming. The town was a trading center for the area. The town peer was the center for slave trading for the region, a sad history documented well in historical markers throughout the town center. It was incorporated officially in 1793, and occupies part of the former Choptank Indian Reservation. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> was named after the town and county in <span class="loc">England</span>. The town became a stop on the underground railroad, which had an extensive network of safe houses for slaves escaping to the north.</p>
