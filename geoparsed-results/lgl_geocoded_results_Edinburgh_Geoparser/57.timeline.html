  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Area woman sentenced for mortgage fraud. CORSICANA — A <span class="loc">Henderson County</span> woman was sentenced to <span class="date">99 years</span> in prison for her role in a mortgage fraud scheme on <span class="date">Monday</span>. On <span class="date">March 17</span>, a <span class="loc">Navarro County</span> jury found the defendant, Kandace Yancy <span class="per">Marriott</span>, 52, of <span class="loc">Gun Barrel City</span>, guilty of engaging in organized criminal activity. According to prosecutors, evidence presented at the punishment stage showed <span class="per">Marriott</span> received monthly mortgage payments from her clients, failed to remit those payments to the mortgage lender, embezzled the homeowners’ funds, and therefore caused her clients to default on their home loans. <span class="per">Marriott</span>’s conviction stems from her involvement in a complex mortgage fraud scheme that defrauded the federal government. The scheme’s principal operators were the defendant and her husband, <span class="per">Darrell L. Marriott</span>, 54, who sold manufactured homes through their company, One Way Home &amp; Land. However, the defendants’ daughter, <span class="per">Kally Marriott</span>, and <span class="per">Mrs. Marriott</span>’s sister, <span class="per">Karen Hayes</span>, have also been indicted for their role in the scheme. All four defendants face separate charges for related criminal conduct in <span class="loc">Kaufman County</span>. According to state investigators, the defendants illegally forged home buyers’ signatures, inaccurately completed loan applications, and falsified supporting documents, including the buyers’ rent payment verification statements, proof of employment, and Social Security Administration benefits data, among other items. Court documents filed by the state indicate that the defendants conduct was intended to ensure that unqualified home buyers loans were approved by mortgage lenders. The scheme involved predominantly low-income purchasers whose residential loans were guaranteed by the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> <span class="loc">Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>. As a result, when the unqualified buyers defaulted on their home loans, their mortgage lenders did not suffer financial losses. Instead, HUD — and therefore the taxpayers — had to cover the default costs. Investigators believe the defendants’ scheme cost the taxpayers more than $3 million. The defendants closed the One Way Home &amp; Land after litigation and investigations ensued in <span class="date">late 2005</span>. As a result, they opened a <span class="loc">Kaufman County</span> firm under the assumed name, Torenia. Additional criminal charges in <span class="loc">Kaufman County</span> stem from the defendants’ Torenia operation. The <span class="org">Office of the Attorney General</span> received assistance from the <span class="loc">Navarro County</span> Criminal District Attorney’s Office, <span class="org">Corsicana Police Department and HUD Office of Inspector General</span>. Attorney General Abbott’s Criminal Prosecutions Division is leading the prosecution of the four defendants with the cooperation of district attorneys’ offices in <span class="loc">Navarro</span>, <span class="loc">Henderson</span> and <span class="loc">Ellis counties</span>.
