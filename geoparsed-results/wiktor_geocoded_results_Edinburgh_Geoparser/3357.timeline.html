  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Saavedra</span> is a barrio (neighbourhood) of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. It is located in the Northern end of the city, close to <span class="loc">Belgrano</span> and <span class="loc">Villa Urquiza</span>. Its northern border is <span class="per">Avenida</span> <span class="loc">General Paz</span>. Among the main features of the neighbourhood is the Parque <span class="loc">Saavedra</span> (English: <span class="loc">Saavedra</span> Park), which has large picnic areas and sports facilities. Many inhabitants of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> pass through <span class="loc">Saavedra</span> en route to their <span class="date">weekends</span> in the country. The neighbourhood's most famous son is tango singer <span class="per">Roberto Goyeneche</span>. Also, it was the cradle of Platense football club. The main characters of <span class="per">Adolfo Bioy Casares</span>'s novel El Sueño de los Héroes (English: <span class="org">Dream of Heroes</span>) live in <span class="loc">Saavedra</span>. The interchange between the Pan-American <span class="per">Highway</span> and <span class="per">Avenida</span> <span class="loc">General Paz</span> is at <span class="loc">Saavedra</span>'s northern end. Points south were the site of extensive demolition during <span class="date">the late 1970s</span> tenure of military-appointed <span class="per">Mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore</span>, who planned a network of new expressways including one through <span class="loc">Saavedra</span>, one of the city's most residential barrios. Never built, the demolished stretch was converted into <span class="per">Avenida</span> <span class="per">Roberto Goyeneche</span>. <span class="loc">Saavedra</span> is also home to an important <span class="org">Philips</span> manufacturing facility, as well as the <span class="org">Dot Baires Shopping Center</span>, the city's largest.</p><br><br>
