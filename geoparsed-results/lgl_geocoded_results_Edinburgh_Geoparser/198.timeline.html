  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Gainesville</span> citywide election has high early voter turnout. Early voter turnout for <span class="loc">Gainesville City</span> Elections is quadruple that of the <span class="date">2007</span> Spring Elections, possibly because of student interest in <span class="org">Charter</span> Amendment 1, <span class="org">Supervisor of Elections</span> <span class="per">Pam Carpenter</span> said. About 2,200 people participated in early voting, which ran from <span class="date">Monday</span> through <span class="date">Saturday</span>, up from under 500 people in the last stand&#x96;alone city election in <span class="date">2007</span>, <span class="per">Carpenter</span> said. The citywide election will take place on <span class="date">Tuesday</span> and voters may cast ballots at their precinct polling places between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Her office received many calls during the week from students asking if voters had to vote on all ballot issues and candidates, or if they could just choose one, she said. “You can vote for just one, or as many issues or candidates as you want,” she said. Carpenter believed invigoration from the presidential elections <span class="date">last fall</span> may also have played a role in student participation. “I would like to think that some of our younger voters came to realize how important it is to participate in democracy,” she said.</p><br><br>
