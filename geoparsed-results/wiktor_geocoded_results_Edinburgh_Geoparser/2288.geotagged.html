<p>Agra is a village and former municipality in the canton of <span class="loc">Ticino</span>, <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. In 2004 the municipality was merged with the other, neighboring municipalities Gentilino and Montagnola to form a new and larger municipality Collina d'Oro. The hamlet of Bigogno, which is part of Agra, is first mentioned in 1270 in an inventory of the lands of the monastery of S. Abbondio in <span class="loc">Como</span> in the <span class="loc">Valle</span> di <span class="loc">Lugano</span>. The inventory of <span class="loc">Como</span> Cathedral (1298) mentions their allodial titles and episcopal loans in Agra as well as possessions of the <span class="loc">Disentis</span> Abbey. The same document also mentions the church of S. Tommaso in Agra. The church initially belonged to the <span class="loc">parish of S. Pietro</span> in Pambio and then became an under-parish in 1591. The Chapel of S. Assunta in Bigogno was completed before 1609. In the statutes of <span class="loc">Como</span> from 1335, the Concilium or Vicinanza of Agra and Premona or Barbengo is first mentioned. In addition to agriculture, the village was once famous for training and sending artisans to <span class="loc">Russia</span> along with other European nations. In 1912 a regional sanatorium opened in the village. It was a residence to for many, especially German-speaking, notables and intellectuals. They published the monthly magazine Die Terrasse (The Terrace) from the sanatorium. It was closed in 1969 and fell into disrepair.</p>
