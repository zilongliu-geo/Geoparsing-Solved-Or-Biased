<p>Seat belt use declines in <span class="loc">Johnson County</span> . Just three years ago, 85 percent of <span class="loc">Johnson County</span> residents buckled up in what was then an all-time high for the state, state officials said Friday. Mysteriously, the <span class="loc">Johnson County</span> rate last year was only 80 percent. Meanwhile, <span class="loc">Leavenworth County</span> has surged forward and last year led the state with an 86 percent rate. Douglas and Wyandotte counties also have improved in recent years, and last year more than 80 percent of people in those counties used seat belts, said Greg Scott with the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> <span class="loc">Department of Transportation</span>.</p>
