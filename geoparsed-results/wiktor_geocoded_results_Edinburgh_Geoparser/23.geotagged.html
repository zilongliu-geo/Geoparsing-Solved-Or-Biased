<p>Medina /mᵻˈdaɪnə/ mə-DY-na is a city in <span class="loc">Medina County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. In 2009, CNNMoney named Medina the 40th most desirable American city to live in. The population was 26,678 at the 2010 Census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Medina County</span>. Medina is located at 41°8′9″N 81°51′51″W (41.135899, -81.864069). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 12 square miles (31.08 km2), of which 11.8 square miles (30.56 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) is water. Medina was founded in 1818 as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. It was originally named Mecca, but an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> already had that name, so the name was changed. Both Mecca and Medina are cities in <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span> and particularly significant to <span class="loc">Islam</span>. Most early residents were farmers. In the 1830s, growth of the community was aided by the completion of the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Erie Canal</span>, which helped transport agricultural products to markets. In 1835, Medina was incorporated as a village and as the county seat of <span class="loc">Medina County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. By 1855, the town's quarries were producing over $200,000 worth of stone per year. In 1857, many of the canal workers started a strike for higher wages; the striking workers were fired, and the four workers who started it were jailed in <span class="loc">Albion</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>.</p>
