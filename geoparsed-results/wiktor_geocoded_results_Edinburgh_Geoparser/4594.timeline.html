  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Butler County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 20,947. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. Its name is in honor of Captain <span class="per">William Butler</span>, who was born in Virginia and fought in the Creek War, and who was killed in <span class="date">May 1818</span>. <span class="loc">Butler County</span> was formed from <span class="loc">Conecuh County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, and <span class="loc">Monroe County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, by an act passed <span class="date">December 13, 1819</span>, by the Legislature while in session at <span class="loc">Huntsville</span>. This was the first session of the Legislature of <span class="loc">Alabama</span> as a State. The name of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> was first proposed for this county, but was changed on the passage of the bill to Butler, in honor of Captain <span class="per">William Butler</span>. The exact date of the first settlement made by white people in the limits of <span class="loc">Butler County</span> is not exactly known. Some records have it as early as <span class="date">1814</span>, but the earliest settler of no dispute is <span class="per">James K. Benson</span>, who settled in the Flat in <span class="date">1815</span>, and built the first house ever erected in <span class="loc">Butler County</span>. It was built near where <span class="loc">Pine Flat</span> Methodist Church <span class="date">now</span> stands, and was made of logs. Shortly after, <span class="per">William Ogly</span> and <span class="per">John Dickerson</span> came with their families and made a settlement on the Federal Road, about three miles (5 km) south of where <span class="loc">Fort Dale</span> was later erected. In the <span class="date">fall of 1816</span>, a party from the state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> came to settle in <span class="loc">Pine Flat</span>, including <span class="loc">Thomas Hill</span>, <span class="per">Warren A. Thompson</span>, Captain <span class="per">John Watts</span>, and <span class="per">Benjamin Hill</span>. In <span class="date">1817</span>, many more settlers arrived, since the hardest work had already been done by these brave original souls.</p><br><br>
