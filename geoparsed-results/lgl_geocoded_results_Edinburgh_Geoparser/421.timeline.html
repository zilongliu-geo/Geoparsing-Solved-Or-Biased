  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Major Mich</span>. utilities seek double-digit rate boosts. <span class="org">David Eggert Associated Press</span> <span class="date">March 23, 2009</span> From <span class="org">Lansing State Journal Lansing Board</span> of Water &amp; Light's commissioners may vote on a 2.5 percent rate increase at their meeting at 5:30 p.m. Thursday. It will be held at the BWL boardroom, <span class="date">1232</span> Haco Drive. <span class="date">Last spring</span>, the BWL's electric and water customers began paying 7 percent more. Steam customers had a 6 percent increase. - <span class="org">Lansing State Journal Detroit Edison and Consumers Energy</span> distribute power to nearly 90 percent of Michigan's electric customers. The companies are seeking rate increases. <span class="per">Consumers Energy</span> said its average residential power customer pays $89 <span class="date">a month</span>. The bill would rise to $99, an 11 percent increase, under the company's proposal. <span class="per">Edison</span> said a residential customer using 500 kilowatt hours <span class="date">a month</span> pays $63. The bill would increase to about $70, an 11 percent increase, under the company's plan. Under a new state law, Consumers Energy could automatically implement its rate hike - or a lesser rate hike - in <span class="date">May</span> if state regulators do not rule by then. Edison could do the same in <span class="date">July</span>. Customers could get refunds, however, if the <span class="org">Michigan Public Service Commission</span> later decides the increases are too high. Both utilities say they will make a decision on how to proceed as they get closer to the dates they can raise rates on their own - <span class="date">six months</span> after a proposal is submitted. "I think it is crummy in this time of hardship," said <span class="per">Bonnie Banks</span>, 61, a retired court recorder who splits her time between Ann <span class="per">Arbor</span> and <span class="per">Oscoda</span> and is a power customer of both Consumers Energy and Edison. "Because of the economy and all the layoffs and our high unemployment rate, it seems like there would be an even larger hardship for people."</p><br><br>
