<p>Rescue squad seeks funds. Within the next week, all residents of <span class="loc">Paris</span> and <span class="loc">Henry County</span> will be receiving a letter from the <span class="loc">Paris-Henry County</span> Rescue Squad. This is the Rescue Squadâ€™s annual mail-out fundraiser in which the squad asks for a tax-deductible donation to help with daily operating expenses, enable the squad to purchase needed equipment, perform routine maintenance and efficiently conduct needed rescue operations in <span class="loc">Henry County</span> during the next year. The Rescue Squad is a volunteer organization with members trained in several different areas of emergency services, such as First Responders, EMTs, paramedics, emergency vehicle rescue, land and water search, and rescue divers.</p>
