  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Centro</span> is the inner city barrio (neighbourhood or district) of <span class="loc">Montevideo</span>, <span class="loc">Uruguay</span>. Its main avenue is 18 de <span class="per">Julio</span> Avenue. It is delimited by La Paz Str. to the North, Florida Str. (North of 18 de julio <span class="per">Av</span>.) and Andes Str. (South of 18 de <span class="per">Julio Av</span>.) to the West, Canelones Str. to the South and Barrios Amorin Str. to the East. It used to be the main commercial venue of the city, but after the opening of the first malls, many small stores started closing down. <span class="date">Now</span>, that process is being reverted and the area is coming back to life. Because of the military origins of <span class="per">Montevideo</span>, it had been forbidden to build anything permanent in the area outside the walls of the city up to the time that <span class="loc">Uruguay</span> gained Independence. That area was called <span class="per">Campo de Marte</span> or ejido (common). Around <span class="date">1750</span>, the colonial Gobernación Política y <span class="per">Militar de Montevideo</span> traced the limits of the forbidden area at "a canonball's reach" from the city's fortifications by a line or "cordón". Eventually, Cordón became the name of the area outside the <span class="per">Campo de Marte</span>.</p><br><br>
