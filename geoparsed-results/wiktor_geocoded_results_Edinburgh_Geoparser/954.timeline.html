  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The small village of <span class="loc">Springfield</span> (population less than 1,000) lies at the edge of the <span class="loc">Howe of Fife</span>, to the south of the town of <span class="loc">Cupar</span>, Fife, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. The origin of the community is thought to be from the linen industry in the 19th century. The <span class="org">Church of Scotland</span> parish church was built in <span class="date">1861</span> (and <span class="date">now</span> shares a minister with nearby <span class="loc">Ceres</span> and <span class="loc">Kemback</span>). The church garden was originally intended to be a cemetery, but the high water table prevented this. The community is surrounded by fields; agriculture is still an important part of the economy of north east Fife (although few <span class="loc">Springfield</span> residents work in agriculture). After World War II, a considerable number of council houses were built in the village - creating new communities in Crawley Crescent, Tarvit Terrace and several other streets. Many of these local authority-owned houses have since been bought by their former tenants. One of the largest local employers is <span class="org">Stratheden Hospital</span> (a psychiatric hospital located between <span class="loc">Springfield</span> and <span class="loc">Cupar</span>). <span class="loc">Springfield</span> has a pub, shop, parish church, village hall, primary school and <span class="loc">Springfield</span> railway station on the <span class="loc">Edinburgh</span> to Aberdeen Line.</p><br><br>
