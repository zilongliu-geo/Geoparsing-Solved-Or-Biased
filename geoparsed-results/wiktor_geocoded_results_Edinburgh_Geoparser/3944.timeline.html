  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Picton</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Marlborough Region</span> of <span class="loc">New</span> <span class="loc">Zealand</span>'s <span class="loc">South Island</span>. The town is located near the head of the <span class="loc">Queen Charlotte Sound</span>, 25 km (16 mi) north of <span class="loc">Blenheim</span> and 65 km (40 mi) west of <span class="per">Wellington</span>. <span class="loc">Waikawa</span> lies just north-east of <span class="per">Picton</span>, and is often considered to be contiguous part of <span class="per">Picton</span>. <span class="per">Picton</span> is a major hub in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>'s transport network, connecting the <span class="loc">South Island</span> road and rail network with ferries across <span class="loc">Cook Strait</span> to <span class="per">Wellington</span> and the <span class="loc">North Island</span>. The town has a population of 4,330  (<span class="date">June 2015</span> estimate), making it the second-largest town in the <span class="loc">Marlborough Region</span> behind <span class="loc">Blenheim</span>. It is the easternmost town in the <span class="loc">South Island</span> with a population of at least 1,000 people. The town is named after Sir <span class="per">Thomas Picton</span>, the Welsh military associate of the <span class="per">Duke of Wellington</span>, who was killed at the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. The Main North railway line and State Highway 1 link <span class="per">Picton</span> southwards to <span class="loc">Blenheim</span>, <span class="loc">Kaikoura</span>, <span class="loc">Christchurch</span> and beyond, while the scenic <span class="per">Queen Charlotte</span> Drive (shorter in distance but usually slower than State Highway 1/State Highway 6 via <span class="loc">Rapaura</span>, near <span class="loc">Blenheim</span>) winds westward to <span class="loc">Havelock</span>. The completion of the highway link ended the relative isolation of this scenic area in <span class="date">the 1950s</span> and encouraged modern motels, beginning with the American Luxury Motels, and many more after the ferry service to <span class="per">Wellington</span> began.</p><br><br>
