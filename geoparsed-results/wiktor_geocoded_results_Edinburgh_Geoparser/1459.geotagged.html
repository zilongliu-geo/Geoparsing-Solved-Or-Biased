<p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Beaver County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located 25 miles (40 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, it is part of the <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span> metropolitan area. The population was 3,657 at the 2010 census. Like many places in and around <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span> and especially <span class="loc">Beaver County</span>, <span class="loc">Rochester</span> has been used for scenes in movies. Scenes in the 1986 movie Gung Ho (starring <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span> native Michael Keaton), the 1996 movie Kingpin (starring Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, and Bill Murray), and the 2000 movie "Wonder Boys" (starring Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey Jr.) were shot in <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. What would eventually become <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was originally a Lenape village called Sawcunk before being settled in 1799 in what was then the American frontier by white settlers. During this time, what would eventually became <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was known as <span class="loc">East Bridgewater</span>, <span class="loc">Fairport</span>, and <span class="loc">Beaver Point</span>. The borough adopted its current name in 1834 when a local businessman who did regular business in <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span> decided to christen his home with the name <span class="loc">Rochester</span> so he could have a unique name to stamp his goods; the borough would officially be incorporated as such in 1849.</p>
