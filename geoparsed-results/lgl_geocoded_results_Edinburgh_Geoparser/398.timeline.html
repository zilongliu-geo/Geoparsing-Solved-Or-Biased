  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Hit-and-run defendant makes court appearance. A young woman accused of driving the vehicle that killed <span class="per">Terry A. Corbin</span> in a hit-and-run accident made her first court appearance <span class="date">Thursday morning</span>. Ashley <span class="per">L. Evans</span>, 26, of <span class="loc">Paris</span>, was in the custody of the <span class="loc">Edgar County</span> Sheriff’s Department for an appearance before <span class="per">Judge David W. Lewis</span>. The purpose of the hearing was to advise <span class="per">Evans</span> of the charge against her, explain her trial rights as a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> citizen and to address the issue of legal counsel. <span class="per">Evans</span> is charged with a single Class 1 felony of leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident that resulted in death and failing to report the accident to law enforcement. <span class="per">Lewis</span> advised <span class="per">Evans</span> that a penitentiary sentence of between four and <span class="date">15 years</span> is possible upon conviction. Probation is another sentencing option. While awaiting her turn before the bench, <span class="per">Evans</span> often sat with her face in her hands. She spoke softly during the hearing and said little except to answer questions from the court, although she did say she will try to hire defense counsel. She was remanded back to custody on a $50,000 bond. Also appearing was <span class="per">Guy C. Harminson</span>, 26, of <span class="loc">Paris</span>. <span class="per">Harminson</span> is charged with a Class 4 felony of obstruction of justice, alleging he provided investigators with false information about the accident in order to prevent <span class="per">Evans</span>’ arrest. <span class="per">Evans</span> and <span class="per">Harminson</span> share a rural Paris address. <span class="per">Harminson</span> said he cannot afford legal counsel and public defender <span class="per">L. Kaye</span> DeSelms was assigned to the case. He was remanded to custody on a $15,000 bond. <span class="per">Corbin</span> died <span class="date">Dec. 6, 2008</span>, at <span class="org">Carle Foundation Hospital</span> in <span class="loc">Urbana</span>, approximately nine-hours after Paris emergency personnel found him lying in the southbound lane of state Route 1 at the <span class="per">Marshall Street</span> cutoff.</p><br><br>
