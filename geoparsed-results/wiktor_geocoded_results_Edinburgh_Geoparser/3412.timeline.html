  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Greenwich</span> (pronounced "Green-witch") was a town in <span class="loc">Hampshire County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. It was established in <span class="date">1739</span> as <span class="loc">Quabbin</span>, incorporated as <span class="loc">Quabbin Parish</span> in <span class="date">1754</span> and became the town of <span class="per">Greenwich</span> (named for <span class="per">John Campbell</span>, <span class="per">Duke of Greenwich</span>) in <span class="date">1754</span>. It was located along the East and Middle branches of the <span class="loc">Swift River</span>. The <span class="per">Athol Branch</span> of the <span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">Albany Railroad</span> ran through the center of town, as did Route 21. It was well known for its lakes and ponds, which were popular vacation spots. It bordered four towns - <span class="loc">Enfield</span>, <span class="loc">Prescott</span>, <span class="loc">Dana</span>, and <span class="loc">Hardwick</span>. <span class="per">Greenwich</span> was disincorporated on <span class="date">April 28, 1938</span> as part of the creation of the <span class="loc">Quabbin</span> Reservoir. Upon disincorporation, portions of the town were annexed to the adjacent towns of <span class="loc">Hardwick</span>, <span class="loc">New Salem</span>, <span class="loc">Petersham</span>, and Ware. (Because of the redrawing of town lines, the land is no longer completely in <span class="loc">Hampshire County</span>; only the portion located in Ware is.) It is <span class="date">now</span> largely submerged, except for the hilltops of <span class="per">Curtis Hill</span>, Mount Liz and <span class="loc">Mount Pomeroy</span>, which are <span class="date">now</span> islands.</p><br><br>
