  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a waterfront town and former colonial port in <span class="loc">Talbot County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 651 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is one of the oldest towns in <span class="loc">Maryland</span>. While <span class="loc">Oxford</span> officially marks the <span class="date">year 1683</span> as its founding because in <span class="date">that year</span> it was first named by the <span class="org">Maryland General Assembly</span> as a seaport, the town began between <span class="date">1666</span> and <span class="date">1668</span> when 30 acres (120,000 m2) were laid out as a town called <span class="loc">Oxford</span> by <span class="per">William Stephens</span>, Jr.. By <span class="date">1669</span> one of the first houses was built for Innkeeper <span class="per">Francis Armstrong</span> (see <span class="loc">Talbot County</span> Land Records, A 1, f. 10/11). <span class="loc">Oxford</span> first appears on a map completed in <span class="date">1670</span>, and published in <span class="date">1671</span>. In <span class="date">1694</span>, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> and a new town called <span class="per">Anne Arundel</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Annapolis</span>) were selected as the only ports of entry for the entire <span class="loc">Maryland province</span>. Until the American Revolution, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> enjoyed prominence as an international shipping center surrounded by wealthy tobacco plantations. Early inhabitants included <span class="per">Robert Morris</span>, Sr., agent for a <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> shipping firm who greatly influenced the town's growth; his son, <span class="per">Robert Morris</span>, Jr., known as "the financier of the Revolution;" Jeremiah Banning, sea captain, war hero, and statesman; The <span class="per">Reverend Thomas Bacon</span>, Anglican clergyman who wrote the first compilation of the laws of <span class="loc">Maryland</span>; <span class="per">Matthew Tilghman</span>, known as the "patriarch of <span class="loc">Maryland</span>" and "father of statehood"; and <span class="per">Colonel Tench Tilghman</span>, aide-de-camp to <span class="loc">George Washington</span> and the man who carried the message of <span class="per">General Cornwallis</span>'s surrender to the Continental Congress in <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>. <span class="per">Tench Tilghman</span>'s grave can be found at the <span class="loc">Oxford</span> cemetery. It is overshadowed by the <span class="loc">Tench Tilghman</span> Monument, a stone spire approximately 10 feet tall. The monument is the tallest monument found at the <span class="loc">Oxford</span> cemetery. The cemetery itself was used in the opening sequence of the <span class="date">1988</span> feature film, <span class="org">Clara's Heart</span>, starring <span class="per">Whoopi Goldberg</span> and <span class="per">Neil Patrick Harris</span>.</p><br><br>
