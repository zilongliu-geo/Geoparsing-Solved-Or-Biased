The Mauryas introduced Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism to the region, and were planning to capture more areas of Central <span class="loc">Asia</span> until they faced local Greco-Bactrian forces. Seleucus is said to have agreed a peace treaty with Chandragupta by giving control of the territory south of the <span class="loc">Hindu Kush</span> to the Mauryas upon intermarriage and receipt of 500 elephants.</p>
