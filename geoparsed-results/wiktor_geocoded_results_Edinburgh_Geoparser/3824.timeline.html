  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Angeles</span>, officially the <span class="loc">City of Angeles</span> (Kapampangan: Lakanbalen ning <span class="per">Angeles</span>; Filipino: Lungsod ng <span class="per">Angeles</span>) and often referred to as <span class="loc">Angeles City</span>, is a highly urbanized city located geographically within the <span class="loc">province of Pampanga</span> in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It is bordered by <span class="loc">Mabalacat</span> to the north; <span class="loc">Mexico</span> to the east; <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> to the southeast; <span class="loc">Bacolor</span> to the south; and <span class="loc">Porac</span> to the southwest and west. The city administers itself autonomously from <span class="loc">Pampanga</span> and, as of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 326,336. <span class="per">Angeles</span> is served by the <span class="org">Clark International Airport</span> in the <span class="per">Clark Freeport</span> Zone. As the former home of <span class="loc">Clark Air Base</span> (then the largest <span class="loc">United States</span> military facility outside of the continental <span class="loc">United States</span>), it was significantly affected by the pullout brought about by the eruption of <span class="loc">Mount Pinatubo</span> in <span class="date">1991</span>. The economy of <span class="per">Angeles</span> was heavily dependent on the American base at that time. In <span class="date">1993</span>, a full cleanup and removal of volcanic ash deposits began and the former <span class="loc">U.S.</span> base re-emerged as <span class="org">Clark Special Economic Zone</span> (CSEZ). The creation of CSEZ has helped to offset the loss of income and jobs previously generated by the presence of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> base in the city. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="per">Angeles</span> and <span class="per">Clark</span> form the hub for business, industry, aviation, and tourism in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> as well as a leisure, fitness, entertainment and gaming center of Central Luzon.</p><br><br>
