<p>Milton /ˈmɪltən/ is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Lafayette Parish</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>. Milton is part of the <span class="loc">Lafayette Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is unknown when the village of Milton was first settled. Old land claims show that much of the town is on land once owned by Bernard, son of Ashnoya, a chief of the Attakapas Indians. The area served as a river crossing and a trade center for the farms and cattle ranches that lined both sides of the <span class="loc">Vermilion River</span>. The earliest settlers were Acadian families. Early Acadian landowners in the area included Francois Broussard, son of Joseph Broussard dit <span class="loc">Beausoleil</span>; Jean Bernard; Pierre Vincent; Michel Meaux; Jean-Baptiste Trahan; and Joseph Boudreaux. Jean-Jacques Denais operated a ferry at the townsite in the early 19th century. Désiré Broussard and Jean-Baptiste <span class="loc">Montet</span> settled there by 1823. Anselm Thibodeaux, who settled on land on the east bank of the river, cultivated it for at least 20 years prior to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Anselm's Coulee, named for him, runs through the area. Beausoleil Broussard's descendants <span class="loc">Eloi</span> Broussard and Darmas Broussard owned and operated a store during the steamboat era. They built a two-story home on the east side of the river in the late 1880s. The home stands at a bridge there today. A ferry operated at the Milton site probably as early as 1820. At the December 14, 1897, meeting of the Vermilion Parish Police Jury, it was suggested that a bridge be built across the river there. That bridge was dedicated on February 2, 1902. The present bridge was built in 1948.</p>
