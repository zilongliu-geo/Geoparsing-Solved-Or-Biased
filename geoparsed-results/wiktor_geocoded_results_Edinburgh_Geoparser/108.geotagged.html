<p>Richmond is a suburban town in southwest <span class="loc">London</span>, 8.2 miles (13.2 km) west-southwest of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. The town is on a meander of the <span class="loc">River Thames</span>, with a large number of parks and open spaces, including <span class="loc">Richmond Park</span>, and many protected conservation areas, which include much of <span class="loc">Richmond Hill</span>. A specific Act of Parliament protects the scenic view of the <span class="loc">River Thames</span> from Richmond. Richmond was founded following Henry VII's building of Richmond Palace in the 16th century, from which the town derives its name. (The Palace itself was named after Henry's earldom of <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">North Yorkshire</span>.) During this era the town and palace were particularly associated with Elizabeth I, who spent her last days here. During the 18th century <span class="loc">Richmond</span> Bridge was completed and many Georgian terraces were built, particularly around Richmond Green and on <span class="loc">Richmond Hill</span>. These remain well preserved and many have listed building architectural or heritage status. The opening of the railway station in 1846 was a significant event in the absorption of the town into a rapidly expanding <span class="loc">London</span>. Richmond was formerly part of the ancient parish of <span class="loc">Kingston upon Thames</span> in the <span class="loc">county of Surrey</span>. In 1890 the town became a municipal borough, which was later extended to include <span class="loc">Kew</span>, Ham, <span class="loc">Petersham</span> and part of <span class="loc">Mortlake</span> (<span class="loc">North Sheen</span>). The municipal borough was abolished in 1965 when, as a result of boundary changes, Richmond was transferred to <span class="loc">Greater London</span>.</p>
