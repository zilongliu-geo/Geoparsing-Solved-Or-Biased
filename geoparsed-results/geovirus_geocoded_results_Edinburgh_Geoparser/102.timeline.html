  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Homeland Security Secretary <span class="per">Janet Napolitano</span> announced <span class="date">today</span> at a news conference that the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> has declared a public health emergency in light of the swine flu outbreak. The total number of confirmed swine flu cases in the <span class="loc">United States</span> stands at 20. Secretary <span class="per">Napolitano</span> said that the <span class="loc">United States</span>' declaration follows suit with the "standard operating procedure" of such an outbreak to make more government resources available to combat the disease. One direct result of the declaration is the government's mobilization of approximately 12 million doses of Tamiflu to locations where the states can quickly access their share of the medication if needed. Secretary <span class="per">Napolitano</span> urged residents not to panic saying that the government is issuing a "declaration of emergency preparedness." Secretary <span class="per">Napolitano</span> added, "Really that's what we're doing right <span class="date">now</span>. We're preparing in an environment where we really don't know ultimately what the size of seriousness of this outbreak is going to be." <span class="per">John Brennan</span>, a Homeland Security assistant, added that "at this point, a top priority is to ensure that communication is robust and that medical surveillance efforts are fully activated." This afternoon, New <span class="loc">York City</span> Mayor <span class="per">Michael Bloomberg</span> reported that 8 students from the St. <span class="org">Francis Prepatory School</span> in Queens, <span class="loc">New York</span> have contracted the swine flu. All in all, more than 100 students from that high school were absent <span class="date">last week</span> with flu-like symptoms. Meanwhile, public health officials in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> <span class="date">today</span> announced one confirmed case of swine flu in the state. Thus far, <span class="loc">California</span> has reported 7 confirmed cases of swine flu, while <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and <span class="loc">Texas</span> have each reported two confirmed cases. At the same news conference <span class="per">Dr. Richard Besser</span>, the acting director from <span class="org">the Centers for Disease Control</span> and Prevention (CDC), said to expect additional cases of swine flu to be reported in the short term. <span class="per">Dr. Besser</span> added that the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> could also start seeing cases of the disease where the effects are more dramatic: "We're going to see more severe disease in this country". So far, no one in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> has died from swine flu.</p><br><br>
