  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Gore is a town in <span class="loc">western Sequoyah County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Fort Smith</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 977 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, an increase of 15 percent from 850 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. Gore claims to be the "trout capital of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>", with great fishing in Lake Tenkiller, the <span class="loc">Illinois River</span>, and the <span class="loc">Arkansas River</span>. This community began as a small settlement in Indian Territory known as <span class="per">Campbell</span>, named for <span class="per">Dr. W. W. Campbell</span>, who, along with <span class="per">Joe Lynch</span>, operated a ferry across the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River between <span class="per">Campbell</span> and <span class="loc">Webbers Falls</span>. Tahlonteskee, the capital of the Western <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> from <span class="date">1828</span>–<span class="date">1839</span>, was near here, just two miles to the north of town. In <span class="date">1829</span>, <span class="per">John Jolly</span>, chief of the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> Nation–West, built a home in this area. The settlement was also known as <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Station or "<span class="loc">Illinois</span> Station, <span class="org">Campbell Post Office</span>." It became a stage stop on the route between <span class="loc">Fort Gibson</span> and <span class="loc">Fort Smith</span>. A post office designation of <span class="per">Campbell</span> was assigned to <span class="per">Dr. Campbell</span>'s store in <span class="date">1888</span>. Also in <span class="date">1888</span>, the St. Louis, <span class="loc">Iron Mountain</span> and Southern Railway (later the Missouri Pacific Railway) built a rail line through the settlement.</p><br><br>
