<p>Harrison is a town in <span class="loc">Hudson County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a suburb of the nearby <span class="loc">city of Newark</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, Harrison's population was 13,620, reflecting a decline of 804 (-5.6%) from the 14,424 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 999 (+7.4%) from the 13,425 counted in the 1990 Census. Once considered "the beehive of industry", the town is undergoing a residential renewal, particularly along the <span class="loc">Passaic River</span>. The area that is now Harrison was a part of a charter granted to Captain William Sandford of <span class="loc">Barbados</span>. New <span class="loc">Barbadoes Neck</span> consisted of 30,000 acres (120 km2) and extended north from <span class="loc">Newark Bay</span> to present-day <span class="loc">Rutherford</span>, between the <span class="loc">Passaic</span> and <span class="loc">Hackensack Rivers</span>. Sandford sent his nephew, Major Nathanial Kingsland, to enter into an agreement for the purchase the land from the Unami Native Americans, a branch of the Leni Lenape. In 1755, the first steam engine in <span class="loc">North America</span> was set up at the Schuyler Copper Mine in what is now <span class="loc">North Arlington</span> to help drain water from the mine.</p>
