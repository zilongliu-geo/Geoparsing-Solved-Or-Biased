  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Clinton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Vermillion County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,893 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city was established in <span class="date">1829</span> and is named after <span class="per">DeWitt Clinton</span>, who served as governor of <span class="loc">New York</span> from <span class="date">1817</span> to <span class="date">1823</span>. Many of <span class="per">Clinton</span>'s original settlers were immigrants working in coal mines. Most of the immigrants were Italians trying to earn a living coal mining. According to <span class="loc">Vermillion County</span> naturalization records, "...from <span class="date">1856</span> to <span class="date">1952</span>... <span class="loc">Vermillion County</span> received almost 3,550 new citizens of foreign birth, the largest number coming during <span class="date">the first twelve years</span> of [the 20th] century. Italians accounted for one-third, or 1,178, of the total number who filed Declarations, with Austrians the next largest group (675) and then Scots. At least 77 percent of the Italians were from the northern regions of <span class="loc">Italy</span>." This was in contrast to the majority of Italian immigrants to <span class="loc">America</span> during this same time period that hailed from southern <span class="loc">Italy</span>. Over time, the coal mining industry in <span class="per">Clinton</span> died down but many of the Italian settlers stayed at <span class="per">Clinton</span>.</p><br><br>
