  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Waterloo</span> (/ˌwɔːtərˈluː/) is a <span class="loc">district of Central London</span>, and part of the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Lambeth</span>. It is situated 1 mile (1.6 km) east of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. The area is part of a business improvement district known as <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> Quarter, which includes The Cut and the <span class="loc">Old Vic</span> and <span class="per">Young Vic</span> theatres, including some sections in the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Southwark</span>. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is connected to the Strand area on the north bank of the <span class="loc">River Thames</span> by <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> Bridge. The first bridge on the site was opened in <span class="date">1817</span> and the current bridge was opened in <span class="date">1945</span>. The bridge was named to commemorate the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> in <span class="date">1815</span>. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> Road also dates from this time, built on land belonging to the <span class="per">Archbishop of Canterbury</span>. The Church of <span class="loc">St John</span> the Evangelist, <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> Road was constructed from <span class="date">1822</span> by <span class="org">the Commissioners for Building New Churches</span> as the population of the <span class="loc">parish of Lambeth</span> had significantly increased. After the opening of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> railway station in <span class="date">1848</span> the locality around the station and <span class="loc">Lower Marsh</span> became known as <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. The boundary of the ecclesiastical <span class="loc">parish of St John Waterloo</span> established in <span class="date">1824</span> was formed by the <span class="loc">River Thames</span> in the north and west, approximated Westminster Bridge Road in the south, and followed the boundary with <span class="loc">Southwark</span> in the east.</p><br><br>
