  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Padang</span> (Indonesian pronunciation: [ˈpadaŋ]) is the capital of the province of <span class="loc">West Sumatra</span> in <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>. It is the largest city on the western coast of <span class="loc">Sumatra</span>. Before <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>'s independence, <span class="loc">Padang</span> was one of the major cities in the <span class="loc">Dutch East Indies</span> and nowadays the fifth largest city in <span class="loc">Sumatra</span> behind <span class="loc">Medan</span>, <span class="loc">Batam</span>, <span class="loc">Palembang</span> and <span class="loc">Pekanbaru</span>. It has an area of 695 square kilometres (268 sq mi) and the population of 1.000.096 in <span class="date">2014</span>. <span class="loc">Padang</span> is one of the cleanest big cities in <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>. Up to <span class="date">2009</span>, <span class="loc">Padang</span> has received the "Adipura" (cleanest and greenest city) award in the category of large city 17 times and the "Adipura Kencana" award three times. <span class="loc">Padang</span> is exactly at the antipodes of <span class="loc">Esmeraldas</span>, <span class="loc">Ecuador</span>. Since the 16th century <span class="loc">Padang</span> has been a trade centre. During the 16th and 17th <span class="date">centuries</span> pepper was cultivated and traded with <span class="loc">India</span>, <span class="loc">Portugal</span>, the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> and the <span class="loc">Netherlands</span>. In <span class="date">1663</span> the city came under the authority of the Dutch and a trading post was built here in <span class="date">1680</span>. The city came under British authority twice, the first time from <span class="date">1781</span> to <span class="date">1784</span> during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, and again from <span class="date">1795</span> to <span class="date">1819</span> during the Napoleonic Wars. Afterwards the city was transferred back to the <span class="loc">Netherlands</span>. Up to approximately <span class="date">1780</span> the most important trade product was gold, originating from the gold mines in the region. When the mines were exhausted, the emphasis turned to other products such as coffee, salts and textiles.</p><br><br>
