<p>Blanca (pronounced [ˈblaːntsa]) is a settlement on the left bank of the <span class="loc">Sava River</span> in the Municipality of <span class="loc">Sevnica</span> in central Slovenia.The area is part of the historical region of <span class="loc">Styria</span>. The municipality is now included in the Lower <span class="loc">Sava</span> Statistical Region. The settlement includes the neighborhood of Agrež in the west and the hamlets of Suho and Vrhek to the northeast. The railway line from <span class="loc">Ljubljana</span> to <span class="loc">Zagreb</span> runs along the left bank of the <span class="loc">Sava</span> and there is a small railway station in the settlement. Blanca was attested in written records in 1309 as <span class="loc">Blanitz</span>. The name is derived from *Blanica, a diminutive of the obsolete noun *blana (cf. Czech blana 'meadow, pasture', Belarusian balona 'empty land before a village', Bulgarian blana 'lawn, meadow'). The name therefore originally refers to the local geography. Prehistoric burial mounds were found in the area in 1892, testifying to early settlement. A school was established in 1874. During the Second World War, a ferry across the <span class="loc">Sava</span> in Blanca was used to main contact with Partisan units in Lower Carniola. A civic center was built in 1949, and a fire station in 1954. The settlement was supplied with running water from the <span class="loc">Lopatec</span> Reservoir in 1966.</p>
