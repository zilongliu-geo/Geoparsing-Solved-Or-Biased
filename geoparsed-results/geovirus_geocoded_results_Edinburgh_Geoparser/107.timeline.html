  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Pope John Paul II</span> left Rome's Gemelli hospital <span class="date">today</span>, having been treated for throat spasms brought on by flu. The 84-year-old Pontiff had been in hospital for <span class="date">10 days</span>. <span class="loc">Vatican</span> spokesman, <span class="per">Joaquin</span> Navarro-Valls, said that the Pope had been "cured" from the breathing difficulties, which lead to his hospitalization. Navarro-Valls also said that the Pontiff had undergone a number of tests, including a CAT scan, which had ruled out any new illnesses. The <span class="loc">Vatican</span> reports that the Pope has recovered his voice and that he will make his regular appearance for crowds in St. Peter's Square. The <span class="loc">Vatican</span> is also being quiet regarding speculation as to the Pope's successor, the <span class="org">BBC</span> reports. The Pope's last appearance was from his hospital window on <span class="date">Sunday</span> (<span class="date">6th February</span>).</p><br><br>
