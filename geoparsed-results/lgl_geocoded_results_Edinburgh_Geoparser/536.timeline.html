A group of Saudi clerics urged the kingdom's new information minister on <span class="date">Sunday</span> to ban women from appearing on TV or in newspapers and magazines, making clear that the country's hardline religious establishment is skeptical of a new push toward moderation. Abaya-wearing women in <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span> wait in a ladies-only line to order a burger. Photo: AP <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span> was founded on an alliance with the conservative Wahhabi strain of <span class="loc">Islam</span> that sees the mixing of sexes as anathema and believes the playing of music violates religious values. French Foreign Minister <span class="per">Bernard Kouchner</span>, in town for meetings with Saudi officials, told a news conference that during lunch he sat between a female Saudi surgeon and a female journalist. He said while one woman is allowed to perform surgery and another is allowed to teach, neither is permitted to drive.</p><br><br>
