<p>Asan (Chamorro: <span class="loc">Assan</span>) is a village located on the western shore of the <span class="loc">United States</span> territory of <span class="loc">Guam</span>. The municipality of Asan-Maina combines Asan with Maina, a community in the hills to the east. It was a primary landing site for <span class="loc">United States</span> Marines during Guam's liberation from the Japanese during World War II. Asan <span class="loc">Beach Park</span> is part of the War in the Pacific National Historic Park. Asan and Maina are located in the <span class="loc">Luchan</span> (Western) District. Asan derives its name from the Chamorro word hassan meaning scarce or rare. A meaning of the word maâ€™ina refers to an infant who, between the time of birth and baptism, is taken by the mother to Mass before sunrise; this ritual considered the presentation of the child to the temple or church. On July 21, 1944 the Americans landed in Asan to recapture the island from occupying Japanese forces during the Battle of <span class="loc">Guam</span>. The 3rd Marine Division landed in Asan at 08:28, and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed near <span class="loc">Agat</span> to the south. Japanese artillery sank 20 Landing Vehicle Trackeds, but by 09:00 tanks were ashore at both beaches. <span class="loc">United States</span> Marines fought Japanese forces fortified in the hills above the shore after establishing a beach head. During the following week, Americans pursued retreating Japanese forces northward and eventually won the battle.</p>
