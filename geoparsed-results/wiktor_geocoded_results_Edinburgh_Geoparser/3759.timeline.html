  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> (county code MG) is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the county population was 35,471. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Independence, and its most populous city is <span class="loc">Coffeyville</span>. The <span class="loc">Coffeyville</span>, <span class="loc">KS</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span> includes all of <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> was established <span class="date">February 26, 1867</span>. It was named in honor of <span class="per">Richard Montgomery</span>, an American Revolutionary War general killed in <span class="date">1775</span> while attempting to capture <span class="loc">Quebec City</span>, in <span class="loc">Canada</span>, after successfully capturing two forts and the <span class="loc">city of Montreal</span>. When <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was admitted to the <span class="org">Union</span> as a state in <span class="date">1861</span>, the Osage Indian reservation occupied a large tract of land near the southern border. The reservation had been established in <span class="date">1825</span>. After the Civil War ended, the Osage lands were coveted as the largest and last reserve of good land in the eastern part of the state. As early as <span class="date">1866</span>, the Osages were forced to cede tracts at the eastern and northern edges of the reservation. This treaty conceded white settlement on land in the eastern part of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>.</p><br><br>
