  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, named after <span class="loc">George Washington</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 59,534, making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, but the second-least populous capital county in the nation, after <span class="loc">Hughes County</span>, in <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is the municipality of <span class="loc">Montpelier</span>, the state capital. The county was created in <span class="date">1810</span> as <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> and organized <span class="date">the following year</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Barre</span>, <span class="loc">VT</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. In <span class="date">2010</span>, the center of population of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> was located in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, in the town of Warren. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is one of several <span class="loc">Vermont counties</span> created from land ceded by the state of <span class="loc">New York</span> on <span class="date">January 15, 1777</span> when <span class="loc">Vermont</span> declared itself to be a distinct state from <span class="loc">New York</span>. The land originally was contested by <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, and New Netherland, but it remained undelineated until <span class="date">July 20, 1764</span> when King <span class="per">George III</span> established the boundary between <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span> along the west bank of the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>, north of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and south of the parallel of 45 degrees north latitude. <span class="loc">New York</span> assigned the land gained to <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. On <span class="date">March 12, 1772</span> <span class="loc">Albany County</span> was partitioned to create <span class="loc">Charlotte County</span>, and this situation remained until Vermont's independence from <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Britain</span>.</p><br><br>
