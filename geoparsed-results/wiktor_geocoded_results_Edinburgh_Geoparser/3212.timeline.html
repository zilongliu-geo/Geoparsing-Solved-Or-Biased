  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Warren</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Grafton County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 904 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Warren</span> includes the village of <span class="loc">Glencliff</span>. It is the smallest by population of the six towns named <span class="per">Warren</span> in <span class="loc">New England</span> (one in each state). <span class="per">Warren</span> was granted in <span class="date">1763</span> by Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span>, and incorporated in <span class="date">1770</span> by Governor <span class="per">John Wentworth</span>.
