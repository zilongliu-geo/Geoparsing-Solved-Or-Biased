<p>Dallas (/ˈdæləs/) is a major city in the state of <span class="loc">Texas</span> and is the largest urban center of the fourth most populous metropolitan area in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city proper ranks ninth in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> and third in <span class="loc">Texas</span> after Houston and <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>. The city's prominence arose from its historical importance as a center for the oil and cotton industries, and its position along numerous railroad lines. The bulk of the city is in <span class="loc">Dallas County</span>, of which it is the county seat; however, sections of the city are located in Collin, <span class="loc">Denton</span>, <span class="loc">Kaufman</span>, and <span class="loc">Rockwall</span> counties. According to the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city had a population of 1,197,816. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau's estimate for the city's population increased to 1,281,047, as of 2014. The city is the largest economic center of the 12-county Dallas–Fort <span class="loc">Worth–Arlington metropolitan</span> area (commonly referred to as DFW), which had a population of 6,954,330 as of July 1, 2014, representing growth in excess of 528,000 people since the 2010 census. In 2014, the metropolitan economy surpassed <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">DC</span> to become the fifth largest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, with a 2014 real GDP over $504 billion. In 2013, the metropolitan area led the nation with the largest year-over-year increase in employment and advanced to become the fourth-largest employment center in the nation (behind New <span class="loc">York City</span>, <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and <span class="loc">Chicago</span>) with more than three million non-farm jobs. As of August 2015, the metropolitan job count has increased to just under 3.4 million jobs. The city's economy is primarily based on banking, commerce, telecommunications, technology, energy, healthcare and medical research, and transportation and logistics. The city is home to the third-largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the nation (behind New <span class="loc">York City</span> and Houston). In the latest rankings released in 2013, Dallas was rated as a "beta plus" world city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group &amp; Network, and was 14th in world rankings of GDP by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>
