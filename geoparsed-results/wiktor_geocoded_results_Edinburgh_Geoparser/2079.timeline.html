  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span> is a township in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, along with the township of <span class="org">Concord</span>, is located in the unorganized territory, Central Somerset. The population of Central Somerset was 336 as of the <span class="date">2000</span> census. Originally called Gilman Pond Plantation, an attempted settlement was made in <span class="date">1804</span> by Isaac Elder, but an early frost killed his garden and he moved to <span class="loc">New Portland</span>. In <span class="date">1806</span> Elder's father-in-law, David Quint took over the farm, becoming the first permanent settler. <span class="per">Governor King</span>, the proprietor of the town had three agents, David Quint, then <span class="per">Henry Morgan</span> and finally <span class="per">Abraham Smith</span>, who oversaw the sale of lands and operated his farm and mill in the township. King chose to name the new town <span class="per">Frazier</span>, in honor of his wife, <span class="per">Anne Frazier</span> of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, since <span class="loc">Kingfield</span> had been named for him. However, the settlers sent in another petition, changing the name to <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, in conjunction with <span class="org">Concord</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, which had been incorporated in <span class="date">1826</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">March of 1833</span>.</p><br><br>
