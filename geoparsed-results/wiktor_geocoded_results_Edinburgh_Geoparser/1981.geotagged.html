<p><span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> was a fishing and shipping village located on <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> Island on the <span class="loc">Outer Banks</span> in <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> Island is a tidal island connected, under most conditions, to north end of the <span class="loc">North Core Banks</span>, across Ocracoke Inlet from the village of <span class="loc">Ocracoke</span>. The town lies in <span class="loc">Carteret County</span>, was established in 1753 by the <span class="loc">North Carolina Colonial</span> Assembly, and abandoned in 1971. Its remains are now part of the <span class="loc">Cape Lookout National Seashore</span>. Ocracoke Inlet was a popular shipping lane during colonial times. Established in 1753, the town of <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> functioned as a lightering port, where cargo from ocean-going vessels could be transferred to shallow-draft vessels capable of traversing Pamlico and Core Sounds. <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> grew to a peak population of 685 in 1860. Though small, <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> was one of the most important points-of-entry along the Atlantic coast in post-Revolutionary <span class="loc">America</span>. In 1846, two strong hurricanes cut Oregon Inlet and deepened the existing Hatteras Inlet to the northeast, making Ocracoke Inlet a less desirable shipping lane by comparison. The waters around <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>'s harbor also began to shoal up, hastening its decline as a port. The Civil War was yet another blow as many people fled to the mainland when Union soldiers came to occupy the <span class="loc">Outer Banks</span>. Many didn't return after the war had ended and the Village of <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> continued its decline, sped along by the occasional hurricane. The mammoth 1933 Atlantic hurricane season also served as a benchmark in the island's population decline, though more as a focal point of memory and a symbol of decline than the real cause of it. (These were the same hurricanes that led to the depopulation of the barrier islands on the <span class="loc">Eastern Shore</span> of Virginia and Maryland.)</p>
