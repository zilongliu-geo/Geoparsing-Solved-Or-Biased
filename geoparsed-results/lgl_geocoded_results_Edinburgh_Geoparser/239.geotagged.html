<p>Two men charged in brazen purse-snatching in <span class="loc">Kansas City</span>, North . Bond for Todd D. Kresin, 38, of <span class="loc">Kansas City</span>, Kan., and Ian S. Jett, 30, of <span class="loc">Platte City</span>, was set at $150,000 each. The incident occurred Sunday in the parking lot of the Price Chopper at Vivion Road and North Oak Trafficway. According to court records, the victim and her elderly mother had finished shopping and were placing their items in their vehicle when another car, driven by Jett, pulled up. Kresin got out of the vehicle and tried to grab the purse off the victimâ€™s shoulder. The victim held on tight. Kresin pulled her to the ground and wrested the purse from her grasp. Two officers, who were in marked police vehicles in the same parking lot, arrested Kresin and Jett as they tried to speed away.</p>
