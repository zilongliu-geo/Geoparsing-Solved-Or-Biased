  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Eureka</span> is a city located in St. <span class="loc">Louis County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> between the <span class="loc">cities of St. Louis and Pacific</span> along Interstate 44. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a population of 10,189. Since <span class="date">1971</span>, <span class="org">Eureka</span> has been known as the home of the amusement park Six Flags <span class="per">St. Louis</span> (formerly Six Flags Over Mid-America). Local news coverage for the town and some of its neighbors is provided by the <span class="loc">Tri County</span> Journal, the <span class="org">Eureka</span> Pacific Current NewsMagazine, and the Washington Missourian. The city is 2 miles (3 km) west of the former Times Beach, the site of dioxin contamination in <span class="date">the 1980s</span>; the area was depopulated, cleaned up, and reopened as Route 66 State Park. The village of <span class="org">Eureka</span> was platted in <span class="date">1858</span> along the route of the Pacific Railroad. By <span class="date">1890</span>, the village consisted of about 100 homes. According to the <span class="org">Eureka</span> <span class="loc">Chamber of Commerce</span>, railroad workers while clearing way for the track and the next railroad camp saw <span class="org">Eureka</span>, level land with little to clear, and declared, "<span class="org">Eureka</span>!" Greek meaning "I have found it." Thus, <span class="org">Eureka</span> was founded. In <span class="date">1898</span>, <span class="org">Eureka</span> became home to the <span class="per">St. Louis</span> Children's Industrial Farm, established to give children from <span class="per">St. Louis</span> tenement neighborhoods a chance to experience life in a rural setting. It later became <span class="loc">Camp Wyman</span> (<span class="date">now</span> part of <span class="org">Wyman Center</span>) and is one of the oldest camps in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="org">Eureka</span> was incorporated as a fourth-class city on <span class="date">April 7, 1954</span>.</p><br><br>
