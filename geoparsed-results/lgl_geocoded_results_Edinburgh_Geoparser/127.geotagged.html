<p>1 dead, 1 hurt in motorcycle crash. A motorcycle wreck on Rivers Avenue killed a pass-enger and sent the driver to the hospital Sunday afternoon, the <span class="loc">North Charleston Police</span> Department reported. The victims' names were not released Sunday. The driver's injuries did not appear to be life-threatening, Public Information Officer Spencer Pryor said. Initial reports indicate the motorcycle might have experienced some kind of malfunction, and as a result the passenger was thrown off and hit by a truck near Rivers and Stokes avenues shortly before 2 p.m., Pryor said.</p>
