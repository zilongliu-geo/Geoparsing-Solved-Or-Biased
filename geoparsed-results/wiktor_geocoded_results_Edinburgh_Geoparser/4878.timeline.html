  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Yamhill County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located about two miles west of <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> near <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 99W. The area is sometimes known as "<span class="per">St. Joe</span>". <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> was named by <span class="per">Ben Holladay</span>, who chose this location as the terminus of the westside line of his <span class="org">Oregon Central Railroad</span>, in order to encourage competition between <span class="per">Lafayette</span> and <span class="per">McMinnville</span>. He probably named the station after <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, although another source says it was named to honor <span class="per">Holladay</span>'s brother <span class="per">Joseph</span>. <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> post office operated from <span class="date">1872</span> until <span class="date">1878</span>. <span class="per">Holladay</span> had planned to extend the railway south of <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> down the <span class="loc">Willamette</span> Valley, but he ran out of money. Turntables were used to return the train to <span class="loc">Portland</span>. <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> was platted with 74 blocks that each contained ten lots, and at one time the town had 150 houses. There was a two-story hotel, and stagecoaches from <span class="per">McMinnville, Dayton</span>, and <span class="per">Lafayette</span> would meet the train, which brought passengers from the East Coast looking to buy acreage in the area from two companies that were formed to sell land there in about <span class="date">1900</span>. <span class="per">Henry Villard</span> extended the railroad line from <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> south to <span class="loc">Corvallis</span> in <span class="date">1878</span>, and <span class="per">McMinnville</span> became the more important railroad terminal.</p><br><br>
