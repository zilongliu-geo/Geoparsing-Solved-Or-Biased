<p><span class="loc">Orange County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. As of the 2010 census, its population was 81,837. The county seat is Orange. <span class="loc">Orange County</span> is included in the Beaumont-Port Arthur, <span class="loc">TX Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is located in the very southeastern corner of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, with a boundary with <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, within the <span class="loc">Golden Triangle</span> of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was formed in 1852 from portions of <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>. It was named after the orange fruit, the common citrus fruit grown by the early settlers of this County near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Sabine River</span>. Due to periodic spells of quite cold winter weather (frosts) in <span class="loc">Orange County</span>, it is no longer the home of orange trees and citrus orchards. The production of those fruits in <span class="loc">Texas</span> long ago was moved a long way southwest into the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> Valley, where the weather is almost always warm all winter long. Citrus trees produce their fruit in the wintertime, which makes them especially vulnerable to frost and icy weather. A similar thing has happened in <span class="loc">Florida</span>, where orchards of citrus trees no longer exist in either <span class="loc">Citrus County</span> or <span class="loc">Orange County</span> because of bad winter freezes in some years. In both <span class="loc">Florida</span> and <span class="loc">Texas</span>, the citrus agriculture has been moved farther south in search of milder winters, and away from the periodic frosts.</p>
