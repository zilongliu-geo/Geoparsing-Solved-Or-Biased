  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Huntington</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Fairfax County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 11,267 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. To the east is <span class="loc">Belle Haven</span>, <span class="loc">Fairfax County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span> and to the south <span class="loc">Groveton</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. Its main component is the namesake <span class="loc">Huntington</span> subdivision, a late-1940s neighborhood of mainly duplex homes. In <span class="date">June 2006</span>, the lower-lying northern section was ravaged by floods due to a torrential rainstorm that sent adjoining Cameron Run over its banks. Nevertheless, it remains popular with first-time home buyers due largely to its proximity to the Huntington Metro station, the southern terminus of Metrorail's <span class="per">Yellow Line</span>. There are also several high-rise apartment and condominium complexes on and near Route 1 where much of the CDP's remaining population resides. The area is included in ZIP code 22303, which the <span class="loc">United States</span> Postal Service considers to be unincorporated Alexandria. <span class="loc">Huntington</span> is located at 38°47′33″N 77°4′20″W (38.792563, -77.072120). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.8 square miles (2.0 km²), all of it land.</p><br><br>
