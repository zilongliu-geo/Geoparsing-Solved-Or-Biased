  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Solano ([1]) is a first class urban municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 56,134 people. Solano is the main commercial and financial center of <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span>. It has the most number of fast food restaurants in the province, including Jollibee, <span class="loc">Greenwich Pizza</span>, <span class="loc">McDonalds</span>, Chowking, Mang Inasal and more. It is also the financial hub of northern <span class="loc">Vizcaya</span>, with many major banks such as Metrobank, <span class="per">Banco de Oro</span>, Bank of the <span class="loc">Philippine Islands</span>, <span class="org">Philippine National Bank</span>, Landbank, <span class="org">Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation</span>, as well as rural and regional banks maintaining their presence in the area. Solano, being the premier town in <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span> and the fastest-growing municipality in the region, is slated to become Cagayan Valley Region's 5th City after <span class="loc">Tuguegarao</span>, <span class="loc">Santiago</span>, <span class="loc">Cauayan</span>, and <span class="loc">Ilagan</span>. Solano is politically subdivided into 22 barangays. In <span class="date">1760</span>, the original name of the town was <span class="loc">Bintauan</span>. Its pioneer settlers were the Gaddang tribe. The municipality was founded in <span class="date">1767</span> by <span class="per">Father Alejandro Vidal</span>, a Dominican priest who led a Spanish mission. In <span class="date">1768</span>, it was called "Lungabang", which means "cave" in the Gaddang dialect. The name was later changed to "Lumabang" by the Spaniards for convenience. In <span class="date">1851</span>, <span class="per">Governor General Antonio Urbiztondo</span> declared Lumabang a barrio of <span class="loc">Bayombong</span> for not having sufficient inhabitants and revenue to maintain itself. <span class="per">Governor General Ramon Solano</span> y Llanderal authorized the separation of Lumabang as barrio from <span class="loc">Bayombong</span>. In <span class="date">1853</span>, the first Ilocanos arrived brought by <span class="per">Don Diego Lumicao</span>, former Gobernadorcillo. In <span class="date">1889</span>, it was renamed Solano, in honor of <span class="per">Governor General Ramon Solano</span> y Llanderal. The town was planned by Father <span class="per">Juan Villaverde</span>. The poblacion, as designed, consisted of 14 parallel wide streets, each having a width of 20 meters. The streets run from north to south and east to west forming 100 square blocks with an aggregate area of one hectare per block. Solano was the largest municipality in the province until two of its barangays, <span class="loc">Caliat</span> and <span class="loc">Bintawan</span>, were segregated to become the municipalities of <span class="loc">Quezon</span> and <span class="loc">Villaverde</span> respectively. The land area of Solano was correspondingly reduced to 13,980 hectares. In <span class="date">1957</span>, the barrios of <span class="loc">Ibung</span> and <span class="loc">Bintawan</span> were separated to form the town of <span class="loc">Ibung</span>, later renamed as <span class="per">Villaverde</span>.</p><br><br>
