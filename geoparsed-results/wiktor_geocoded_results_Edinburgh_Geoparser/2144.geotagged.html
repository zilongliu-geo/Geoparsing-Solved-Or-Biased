<p><span class="loc">Hollywood</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">Bromsgrove district</span> of <span class="loc">Worcestershire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, contiguous with and to the south of the <span class="loc">city of Birmingham</span>. The village lies within the <span class="loc">ward of Hollywood and Majors Green</span> and is located within the civil <span class="loc">parish of Wythall</span>. The eastern part of the village is also known as <span class="loc">Trueman's Heath</span>. Until the 1950s, <span class="loc">Hollywood</span> was a rural area with many fields and farms. Extensive postwar development saw these fields and farms give way to housing estates, shops and schools. <span class="loc">Hollywood</span> is served by the A435 Alcester Road, and is adjacent to <span class="loc">Highter's Heath</span> to the north and <span class="loc">Drakes Cross</span> to the south. Other settlements close by include <span class="loc">Wythall</span>, <span class="loc">Kings Heath</span>, <span class="loc">Kings Norton</span>, <span class="loc">Shirley</span> and <span class="loc">Dickens Heath</span>. <span class="loc">Hollywood</span> is home to the Hollywood Golf Club, formally known as Gay Hill Golf Club which has existed since 1921, and a family owned and managed packaging company, Kilby Packaging, which has existed since 1946. The village is served by several schools located immediately outside the ward boundary - Hollywood Primary School is located over the county border within the <span class="loc">Highter's Heath</span> area of the <span class="loc">city of Birmingham</span>, whilst the Coppice Primary School and Woodrush School are just within the <span class="loc">Drakes Cross</span> ward.</p>
