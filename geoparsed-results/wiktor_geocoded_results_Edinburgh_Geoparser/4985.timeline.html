  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Guildford</span> is a small settlement situated on the <span class="loc">Loddon River</span>, 130 kilometres (81 mi) north-west of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located on the Midland Highway between <span class="loc">Daylesford</span> and <span class="loc">Castlemaine</span>. The population recorded at the <span class="date">2011</span> census was 245. Facilities in the town include a post office (in a building dating from <span class="date">1901</span>), hotel, community hall and a general store. It is thought that the town was named after <span class="loc">Guildford</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. The area was known as Yarrayne to the original inhabitants of the area, the Jajowarrung people. The first European to explore the area was Major <span class="per">Thomas Mitchell</span> in <span class="date">1836</span>. By the 1840s pastoral runs had been established and, in <span class="date">the following decade</span>, gold miners flocked to the area during the rush at the <span class="loc">Mount Alexander</span> goldfields. The largest encampment of Chinese miners in Victoria (estimates vary from 5000-6000 individual miners) was situated at the junction of the <span class="loc">Loddon River</span> and <span class="loc">Campbells Creek</span>. Tensions ran high between the white miners and the Chinese which erupted in numerous local conflicts. This anti-Chinese hostility, combined with discriminatory taxation against Chinese miners, saw the Chinese population dwindle and eventually all but disappear by the end of the gold rush.</p><br><br>
