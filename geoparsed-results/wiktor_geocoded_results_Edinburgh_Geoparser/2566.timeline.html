  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Helena is a town in southeastern <span class="loc">Alfalfa County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Residents pronounce the town's name with a long E: "Heh-LEE'-nuh." The population was 1,403 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the site of the <span class="org">James Crabtree Correctional Center</span>, run by the <span class="org">Oklahoma Department of Corrections</span>, with a population of 1,003 inmates in <span class="date">2010</span>. It is the site of the <span class="org">Timberlake Public School</span> district, shared with the nearby towns of <span class="loc">Goltry</span>, <span class="loc">Jet</span>, and <span class="loc">Nash</span>. On <span class="date">June 1894</span>, <span class="per">Helen S. Monroe</span> received a postal designation for Helena.  <span class="per">Monroe</span> became the first postmaster and the town's namesake. Shortly after the Cherokee Outlet opened to settlement, numerous small communities emerged in what was then southwestern <span class="loc">Woods County</span> (<span class="date">now</span> Alfalfa county). When the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Valley and Western Railway survey bypassed the nearby settlement of <span class="loc">Carwile</span>, those residents began migrating closer to the proposed railroad, near where <span class="per">H. H. Anderson</span> had established a store around <span class="date">1896</span>. The townsite was laid out nearby in <span class="date">1902</span>, and the village was incorporated <span class="date">the following year</span>, by which time the population was 160.</p><br><br>
