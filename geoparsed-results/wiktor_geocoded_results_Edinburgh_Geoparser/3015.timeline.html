  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Changde</span> (Chinese: 常德; pinyin: Chángdé) is a prefecture-level city in the northwest of <span class="loc">Hunan province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, with a population of 5,717,218 as of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, of which 1,232,182 reside in the urban <span class="loc">districts of Dingcheng and Wuling</span>. In addition to the urban districts, <span class="loc">Changde</span> also administers the county-level <span class="loc">city of Jinshi</span> and six counties. <span class="loc">Changde</span> is adjacent to Dongting Lake to the east, the <span class="loc">city of Yiyang</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Wuling</span> and <span class="loc">Xuefeng Mountains</span> to the west, and <span class="loc">Hubei province</span> to the north. The area has been inhabited by humans since around <span class="date">8,000 years ago</span>. In that time, the city has changed names several times, but it has been known as <span class="loc">Changde</span> since the 12th century. The city is well known for the Battle of <span class="loc">Changde</span> during the Second Sino-Japanese War (<span class="date">1937</span>–45) and the atrocities committed then by the <span class="org">Imperial Japanese Army</span>. In <span class="date">the past decade</span>, the city has seen a massive construction boom. New highrises have sprung up, roads were rebuilt and new schools, parks and museums have opened. Locals and tourists often visit the Changde Poetry Wall, covered in a variety of poems mostly from ancient <span class="loc">China</span>. The wall stretches for 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) along the <span class="loc">Yuan River</span> downtown and functions as a flood wall. It is listed in the <span class="org">Guinness Book of World Records</span> as the longest wall with engraved arts in the world.</p><br><br>
