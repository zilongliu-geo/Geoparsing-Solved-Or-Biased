<p><span class="loc">Wayne County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 Census, the population was 93,772. The county seat is <span class="loc">Lyons</span>. The name honors General Anthony Wayne, an American Revolutionary War hero and American statesman. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">NY</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area and lies on the south shore of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span>, forming part of the northern border of the <span class="loc">United States</span> with <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Its location during the early westward expansion of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, on an international border and in a fertile farming region, has contributed to a rich cultural and economic history. Two world religions sprung from within its borders, and its inhabitants played important roles in abolitionism in the years leading up to the American Civil War. Nineteenth century War of 1812 skirmishes, <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> sailing ship commerce and <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal barge traffic have since yielded to contemporary recognition as one of the world's most productive fruit growing regions. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> ranks as the top apple producing county in <span class="loc">New York</span>. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the land <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> encompasses was originally part of the Iroquois Confederacy, which had existed from around August 31, 1142. <span class="loc">When counties</span> were established in <span class="loc">New York</span> State on November 1, 1683, it became part of <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of <span class="loc">New York</span> State and all of the present State of <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, extending (in theory) westward to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. In 1804, after numerous acts of subdividing, <span class="loc">Seneca County</span> was formed by the splitting of <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span>, which, in turn, was reduced in size by combining portions of <span class="loc">Seneca</span> and the remainder of <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span> to form <span class="loc">Tompkins County</span> in 1817.</p>
