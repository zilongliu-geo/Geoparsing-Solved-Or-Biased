<p>Hamilton is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Boone County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is situated at Latitude 38.88333, Longitude -84.78167, in the southern part of the county on the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>; it is about a mile north of the mouth of <span class="loc">Big Bone Creek</span>. It was established in 1835, being incorporated by the <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> Legislature as the Town of Landing. The plat laid out by Joel Hamilton and George McGlasson. The original trustees were: William Winston, Jr., George McGlasson, Joel Hamilton, Henry L. Rose, James <span class="loc">Dukan</span>. The same year the Legislature provided a Constable for the town. In 1846 the name of the town was changed to <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> in honour of Joel Hamilton, the founder, who had since moved to <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The trustees of the town at this time were: Benjamin E. Garnett, John J. Miller, Marshall M. McManama, James R. Hawkins and Richard Johnson. The town was authorized to levy taxes the next year. This was a real estate tax, not to exceed fifty cents per hundred dollars. The limits of the town of Hamilton were extended in 1849. A provision was added by the legislature that citizens of the town were not required to work on the road more than half a mile beyond the new limit. In 1852 a new road, the <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> and Union Turnpike was chartered. This may have been in conjunction with the incorporation of the Big Bone Hotel Company at the nearby Big Bone Springs the previous year. Other projects chartered in the area that year were the <span class="loc">Napoleon</span> and Big Bone Lick Turnpike, and the Union and Beaver Turnpike.</p>
