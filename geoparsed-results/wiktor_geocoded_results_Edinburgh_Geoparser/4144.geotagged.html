<p><span class="loc">Yuanlin City</span> (Chinese: 員林市) is a county-controlled city in <span class="loc">eastern Changhua County</span>, <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>. It is the second largest settlement in the county, after the county seat of <span class="loc">Changhua City</span>. The land around <span class="loc">Yuanlin</span> was cleared of trees and bushes, and fitted for cultivation since the Yongzheng era of the Qing dynasty (1723–1735). It was well developed about the 16th year of the Qianlong era. At first, people cut down the surrounding forests to build their houses. Gradually, only the round woodland was left, and the town was named 圓林仔 (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Oân-nâ-á), meaning "the round woodland." Later the characters were changed to 員林 (Yuanlin). <span class="loc">Yuanlin</span> produces different kinds of fruits, and succade (fruit cooked in sugar syrup and encrusted with a sugar crystals) is one of its specialties. On 8 August 2015, <span class="loc">Yuanlin</span> was upgraded from an urban township into a county-controlled city after the qualifying population level for city status was revised downwards from 125,000 to 100,000 people. <span class="loc">Yuanlin</span> is located on the eastern border of <span class="loc">Changhua County</span>, in central <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>. The city is bordered to the north by <span class="loc">Dacun</span>, to the east by Fenyuan and Nantou City (the only neighboring settlement outside <span class="loc">Changhua County</span>), to the south by <span class="loc">Shetou</span>, and to the west by Yongjing and Puxin.</p>
