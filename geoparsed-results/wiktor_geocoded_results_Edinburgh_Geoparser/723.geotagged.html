<p><span class="loc">Sacramento</span> (/ˌsækrəˈmɛntoʊ/; Spanish: [sakɾaˈmento]) is the capital city of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span> and the seat of government of <span class="loc">Sacramento County</span>. It is at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Sacramento River</span> and the <span class="loc">American River</span> in the northern portion of California's expansive Central Valley. Its estimated 2014 population of 485,199 made it the sixth-largest city in <span class="loc">California</span>. <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> is the cultural and economic core of the <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> metropolitan area, which includes seven counties with a 2010 population of 2,414,783. <span class="loc">Its metropolitan</span> area is the fourth largest in <span class="loc">California</span> after the Greater <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the <span class="loc">San Diego</span> metropolitan area, and is the 27th largest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In 2002, the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University conducted for TIME magazine named <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> "<span class="loc">America</span>'s Most Diverse City". <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> became a city through the efforts of the Swiss immigrant John Sutter, Sr., his son John Sutter, Jr., and James W. Marshall. <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> grew quickly thanks to the protection of Sutter's Fort, which was established by Sutter in 1839. During the <span class="loc">California Gold Rush</span>, <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> was a major distribution point, a commercial and agricultural center, and a terminus for wagon trains, stagecoaches, riverboats, the telegraph, the <span class="loc">Pony Express</span>, and the First Transcontinental Railroad.</p>
