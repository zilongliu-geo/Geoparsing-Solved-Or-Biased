<p><span class="loc">Beaumont</span> (/ˈboʊmɒnt/ BOH-mont) is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, within the Beaumont–Port <span class="loc">Arthur Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Located in Southeast <span class="loc">Texas</span> on the <span class="loc">Neches</span> River and about 90 miles from Houston, the city had a population of 118,296 at the 2010 census, making it the twenty-fourth most populous city in the state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Beaumont's early history was centered around the development of lumber, farming, and port industries. In 1892 Joseph Eloi <span class="loc">Broussard</span> opened the first rice mill in the state, stimulating development of rice farming in the area; he also organized an irrigation authority to support rice culture. A big change occurred in 1901 with the Spindletop gusher, which demonstrated the potential of the huge oil field. The area transformed into one of the major petro-chemical refining areas in the country. Along with <span class="loc">Port Arthur</span> and Orange, <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> forms the <span class="loc">Golden Triangle</span>, a major industrial area on the Gulf Coast. <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> is home of Lamar University, a national Carnegie Doctoral Research university with 15,000 students. Over the years, several corporations have called <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> home. For example, Gulf States Utilities had its headquarters in <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> until its absorption by Entergy Corporation in 1993. GSU's Edison Plaza headquarters is still the tallest building in <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> (as of 2011). With <span class="loc">Spindletop</span>, several energy companies developed in <span class="loc">Beaumont</span>, and some continue.</p>
