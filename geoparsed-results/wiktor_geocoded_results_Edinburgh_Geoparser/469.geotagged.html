<p>Tūrān (Persian توران) literally means "the land of the <span class="loc">Tur</span>", and is a region in Central <span class="loc">Asia</span>. The term is of Persian origin and may refer to a certain prehistoric human settlement, a historic geographical region, or a culture. The original Turanians were an Iranian tribe of the Avestan age. As a people, the "Turanian" are one of the two Iranian peoples both descending from the Persian <span class="loc">Fereydun</span> but with different domains and often at war with each other. In fact according to the Shahnameh's account, at least 1,500 years later after the <span class="loc">Avesta</span>, the nomadic tribes who inhabited these lands were ruled by Tūr, who was the emperor Fereydun's elder son. The association with Turks is also primarily based on the Shahnameh's geographical account where Turkification of Central <span class="loc">Asia</span> was partially completed during that time. <span class="loc">Tur</span>/Turaj (Tuzh in Middle Persian) is the son of emperor <span class="loc">Fereydun</span> in ancient Iranian mythology. In the Shahnameh, he is identified with the Turks; however, culturally there is no relationship between Turanians of the Shahnameh and the culture of ancient Turks according to C.E. Boseworth.</p>
