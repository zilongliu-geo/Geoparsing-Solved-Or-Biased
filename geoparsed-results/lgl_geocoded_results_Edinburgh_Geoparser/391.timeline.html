  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Crestwood School Board</span> anticipates budget amendment. A few unexpected expenses might require the <span class="org">Crestwood Board of Education</span> to amend their budget in <span class="date">May</span>, Superintendent <span class="per">Lorraine Bailey</span> informed the board <span class="date">Wednesday night</span> during the regular meeting. <span class="per">Bailey</span> explained if the budget is off by a certain percentage, law requires the budget be amended. Tuition to <span class="org">Paris High School</span> was more than expected <span class="date">this year</span>, which <span class="per">Bailey</span> said was due to higher costs divided by fewer students. An additional teacher was also hired midyear. Despite the unexpected expenses, <span class="per">Bailey</span> said the school has “done very well staying in line with what we budgeted.” During the meeting, board members also started looking at <span class="date">summer</span> projects. The roof over the cafeteria and kitchen will be replaced as well as patch work to the rest of the roof with the bid being awarded to Martinsville Roofing at a cost of $38,117. The roof project was approved for Health/Life/Safety funds. The school is also in need of a new chair lift. The current lift is not operable at this time. The bid was awarded to <span class="per">Garaventa Lift</span>, who originally installed the lift at the school. <span class="per">Bailey</span> said the company is very reputable. The H/L/S amendment for the lift has not yet been approved, <span class="per">Bailey</span> noted; however the preliminary paper work came back with no concerns. If the amendment is not approved, the money will come from the <span class="per">Operations</span> and <span class="per">Maintenance</span> Fund. <span class="date">Several years ago</span>, the board looked into tuckpointing the school. The bids came back higher than anticipated and the board decided to hold off on the project. <span class="date">Now</span>, the problem is getting worse and tuckpointing is inevitable. The project bid was awarded to Midwest Restoration of <span class="loc">Paris</span> in the amount of $12,680. The board also voted to replace to busses through Midwest Transit. The school will lease a <span class="date">two year</span> old 65 passenger bus at a cost of $60,100 before trade-in at a value of $6,600; and another two-year-old 65 passenger bus at a cost of $59,700 before trade-in of $6,100. The school calendar was approved for <span class="date">next year</span> and is the same calendar as District 95. The first day of school will be <span class="date">Aug. 17</span> and the final day of school, if no snow <span class="date">days</span> are used, will be <span class="date">May 26</span>. During the administrative report, <span class="per">Bailey</span> reminded the board preschool and kindergarten screenings will be held <span class="date">March 17, 18</span> and 19 for all students in the district who will be 3 or 4 by <span class="date">Sept. 1</span> for preschool and for those who will be five by <span class="date">Sept. 1</span> for kindergarten. Anyone who has not yet made an appointment is encouraged to do so. Following an executive session, the board accepted the resignation of Ashley Nickles as girls basketball coach and hired <span class="per">Sarah Crippes</span> as the replacement.</p><br><br>
