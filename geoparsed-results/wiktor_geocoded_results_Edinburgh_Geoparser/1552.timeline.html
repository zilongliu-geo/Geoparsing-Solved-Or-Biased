  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Agua Fria</span> (formerly, <span class="loc">Agua Frio</span>, <span class="loc">Agua Frie</span>, and <span class="loc">Aqua</span> <span class="loc">Fria</span>) is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Mariposa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It is located 5.25 miles (8.4 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Catheys</span> Valley, at an elevation of 2001 feet (610 m). <span class="loc">Agua Fria</span> is the former county seat of <span class="loc">Mariposa County</span> located approximately three miles <span class="loc">west of Mariposa</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. <span class="loc">Agua Fria</span> was mainly a mining camp divided into Lower <span class="loc">Agua Fria</span> and Upper <span class="loc">Agua Fria</span>. The name was derived from two springs of cold water about a quarter mile below Lower <span class="loc">Agua Fria</span> (the main part of town). It may have been here that <span class="per">John C. Fremont</span>'s men discovered gold in <span class="date">1849</span>. In <span class="date">1850</span>, it was a booming trade center and the final destination for many new arrivals in <span class="loc">California</span>. It was <span class="loc">Mariposa County</span>'s first <span class="org">Seat</span> of Justice from <span class="date">February 18, 1850</span> to <span class="date">November 10, 1851</span>. A post office was established <span class="date">October 7, 1851</span>. In <span class="date">1853</span>, a 6-stamp quartz mill was established in Upper <span class="loc">Agua Fria</span>. The camp boasted a hotel, express office, assayers, billiard room, bowling alley, monte and faro banks, about a dozen stores, numerous tents and log cabins by the <span class="date">fall of 1850</span>. The population started to decline by the mid-19th century, and the city suffered destructive fires and was never rebuilt. <span class="loc">Agua Fria</span> means "cold water" in Spanish.</p><br><br>
