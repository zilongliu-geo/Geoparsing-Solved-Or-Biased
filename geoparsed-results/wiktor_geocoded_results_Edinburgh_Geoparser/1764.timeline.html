The area which would become <span class="loc">Geneva</span> was originally settled in <span class="date">1805</span>, and was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1958</span>. It is named after <span class="loc">Geneva</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. The population was 6,215 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census.

In <span class="date">1806</span>, settlers from <span class="loc">Harpersfield</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> arrived and established <span class="loc">Harpersfield</span> Township, which included the present-day townships of <span class="loc">Geneva</span>, <span class="loc">Trumbull</span> and <span class="loc">Hartsgrove</span>. However, in <span class="date">1816</span>, citizens of <span class="loc">Harpersfield</span> decided to withdraw from the township and form their own township, which then became <span class="loc">Geneva</span> Township, named after <span class="loc">Geneva</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. In <span class="date">1866</span>, the town of <span class="loc">Geneva</span> then became a village, and, <span class="date">nearly one hundred years later</span>, in <span class="date">1958</span>, <span class="loc">Geneva</span> was incorporated as a city. <span class="loc">Geneva</span> is located at 41°48′0″N 80°56′45″W (41.800098, -80.945784), 45 miles (72 km) east of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> and 55 miles (89 km) <span class="loc">west of Erie</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. The city is bordered to the north, east and west by <span class="loc">Geneva</span> Township and by <span class="loc">Harpersfield</span> Township to the south. The <span class="loc">Grand River</span> flows around <span class="loc">Geneva</span> to the south in <span class="loc">Harpersfield</span> and to the west in <span class="loc">Lake County</span>.
