<p><span class="loc">Hanover</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 682; as of 2014, it was estimated to have decreased to 665. It is the second most populous town within <span class="loc">Washington County</span>. The city is primarily agricultural, and the surrounding countryside is filled with small family farms. The <span class="loc">Hanover</span> area is also a popular destination for deer hunting. Named after <span class="loc">Hanover</span>, <span class="loc">Germany</span>, the town is a traditional German community with strong German cultural influences. The local area is home to numerous other German communities such as <span class="loc">Hollenberg</span>, <span class="loc">Hermansburg</span>, <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>, and <span class="loc">Bremen</span>. The "<span class="loc">Hollenberg</span> Station" became an important hub along the way for <span class="loc">Pony Express</span> travelers and he eventually established a grocery and stage depot on his farm in 1858. The <span class="loc">Hollenberg</span> farm housed nine boarding rooms, and the success of "<span class="loc">Hollenberg</span> Station" as a business attracted more people to the area and many settled alongside the Hollengbergs in the decade leading up to the establishment of <span class="loc">Hanover</span>. Prior to the establishment of the town, in 1868 a school district was established in the area to satisfy the need to educate children of settlers who continued to arrive near the "<span class="loc">Hollenberg</span> Station."</p>
