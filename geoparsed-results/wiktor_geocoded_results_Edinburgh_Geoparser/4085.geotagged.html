<p><span class="loc">Chail</span> is a hill station in <span class="loc">Himachal Pradesh</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>. <span class="loc">Chail</span> is 44 km from <span class="loc">Shimla</span> and 45 km from Solan. The Chail Palace is well known for its architecture, the palace was built as summer retreat by the Maharaja of <span class="loc">Patiala</span> during the British Raj, on the land allotted to him by the British for former's assistance in the Anglo-Nepalese War. The cricket ground and a polo ground which is there at an altitude of 2,250 m was owned by erstwhile royal family of <span class="loc">Patiala</span>. It is the world's highest cricket ground. <span class="loc">Chail</span> is also considered as the hiker's paradise. The area is away from the bustling life of the state capital <span class="loc">Shimla</span>. In 1891, Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of <span class="loc">Patiala</span> incurred the rage of Lord Kitchener. It led to the restriction of his entry in the Indian summer capital, <span class="loc">Shimla</span>. This incensed the Maharaja and he vowed to build a new summer retreat for himself. So he rebuilt the place (Chail) as per his requirements. After accession to the Indian Union, Maharaja of <span class="loc">Patiala</span> donated most of his buildings to Chail Military School and Government of India.</p>
