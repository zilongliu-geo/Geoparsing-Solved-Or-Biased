<p>The Mission district is an inner city neighbourhood of <span class="loc">Calgary</span>, <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> that originated as <span class="loc">Notre Dame</span> de la <span class="loc">Paix</span>, a Catholic mission, and was for a time the incorporated Village of Rouleauville. Mission contains the very popular 4th Street with many trendy restaurants and shops, and it hosts the Lilac Festival in May. It is represented in the <span class="loc">Calgary City</span> Council by the Ward 8 councillor. The community has an area redevelopment plan in place. After a temporary location 40 km (25 mi) away (started in 1872), Oblate missionary Father Constantine Scollen, on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church, founded the permanent location in 1875. In 1883, Oblate missionary Father Albert Lacombe, returning after a ten-year absence, obtained two quarter sections of land for a "Mission district" to ensure a strong French speaking Catholic community. Father Scollen who had lived in the area since 1862 and who had witnessed Treaty Six with the Cree Nation and Treaty Seven with the Blackfeet Nation left for <span class="loc">Edmonton</span> and then the <span class="loc">U.S.A</span>. After obtaining the rest of the land that's now Mission, the area was incorporated on November 2, 1899 as the Village of Rouleauville named after Charles Rouleau. The village was founded in what was then the <span class="loc">Northwest Territories</span>. Despite Lacombe's desire to preserve the French language and culture, Rouleauville progressively lost its French character, becoming overwhelmingly English. In 1907 the village was annexed by <span class="loc">Calgary</span>. In the process all the French names of streets were replaced by <span class="loc">Calgary</span>'s street numbering system.</p>
