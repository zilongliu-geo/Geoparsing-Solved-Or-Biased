  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is named after the <span class="org">Mission</span> <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Arc치ngel, founded by Junipero Serra. The city grew outward from the mission and in <span class="date">1852</span> became the original township of <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>. <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1913</span>. The city's motto is "A city with a <span class="org">Mission</span>" and it is often called the "Birthplace" of the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> metropolitan area. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 39,718. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish to Alta <span class="loc">California</span>, the area that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> was inhabited by the Tongva Native Americans, whom the Spanish called the Gabriele침o. The Tongva name for the <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> region has been reconstructed as Shevaa. <span class="date">Today</span> a center for culture and art, the <span class="org">Mission</span> <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Arc치ngel, founded by Father Junipero Serra, is the fourth of twenty-one <span class="loc">California</span> Missions, and is known as the "Pride of the <span class="loc">California</span> Missions." The <span class="org">Mission</span> <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Arc치ngel served a pivotal role in the colonial Spanish society, with many of the area's first Mexican settlers being baptized at the mission, including future <span class="per">governor Pio Pico</span>, who was born in <span class="date">1801</span> at the mission and baptized there the same year. He was appointed as <span class="loc">California</span>'s governor twice, serving briefly in <span class="date">1832</span> and again from <span class="date">1845</span> through the Mexican-American War. Later in life, he was elected as a <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles City</span> councilman. The city of <span class="loc">Pico Rivera</span> was named to honor him as the last governor of <span class="loc">California</span> to be born in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>.</p><br><br>
