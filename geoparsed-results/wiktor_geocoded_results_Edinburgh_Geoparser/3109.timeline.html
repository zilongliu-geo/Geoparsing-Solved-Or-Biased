  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Paula</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ventura County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Situated amidst the orchards of the fertile <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> River Valley, the city advertises itself to tourists as the "Citrus Capital of the World." <span class="loc">Santa Paula</span> was one of the early centers of <span class="loc">California</span>'s petroleum industry. The <span class="org">Union</span> Oil Company Building, the founding headquarters of the <span class="org">Union</span> Oil Company of <span class="loc">California</span> in <span class="date">1890</span>, <span class="date">now</span> houses the <span class="org">California Oil Museum</span>. The population was 29,321 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 28,598 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The area of what <span class="date">today</span> is <span class="loc">Santa Paula</span> was originally inhabited by the Chumash, a Native American people. In <span class="date">1769</span>, the Spanish Portola expedition, first Europeans to see inland areas of <span class="loc">California</span>, came down the <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> River Valley from the previous night's encampment near <span class="loc">Fillmore</span> and camped in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Santa Paula</span> on <span class="date">August 12</span>, near one of the creeks coming into the valley from the north (probably <span class="loc">Santa Paula Creek</span>). Fray <span class="per">Juan Crespi</span>, a Franciscan missionary travelling with the expedition, had previously named the valley Ca√±ada de <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span>. He noted that the party traveled about 9 to 10 miles (14 to 16 km) <span class="date">that day</span> and camped near a large native village, which he named <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="per">Pedro Amoliano</span>. The site of the expedition's arrival has been designated <span class="loc">California</span> Historical Landmark No. 727.</p><br><br>
