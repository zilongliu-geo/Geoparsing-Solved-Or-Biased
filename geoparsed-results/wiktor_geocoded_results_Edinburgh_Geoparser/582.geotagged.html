<p>Milton is a village and civil parish about 3 miles (5 km) west of <span class="loc">Didcot</span> and a similar distance south of <span class="loc">Abingdon</span>. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,290. In AD 956 King Eadwig granted 15 hides of land at Milton to his thegn Alfwin, who in turn gave the estate to the <span class="loc">Benedictine Abingdon</span> Abbey. In the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s the abbey surrendered its lands to the Crown. Milton was among a number of estates that Henry VIII granted to Baron Wriothesley in 1546. Wriothesley sold Milton that same year to Thomas Calton, a goldsmith of <span class="loc">London</span>, whose descendants retained it for the next 218 years. In 1709 Paul Calton married Catherine, daughter of Admiral John Benbow. In 1764 Catherine, Martha and Mary Calton sold the estate to Bryant Barrett, in whose family the property remains. Bryant Barrett was a Roman Catholic, so, by English law, could not own property. He and his brother Isaac agreed that the latter should buy the house and estate on Bryant's behalf for Â£10,600. Milton <span class="loc">Manor House</span> is a yellow and red brick manor house built for the Calton family in the 17th century. The actual date is unknown: in 1696 it was described as "newly built" but Sir Nikolaus Pevsner believed that it could not be much later than the 1660s. The original building is of five bays and three storeys and may have been designed by Inigo Jones. In 1772 short two-storey wings designed by Stephen Wright were added to the house for Bryant Barrett. The house is a Grade I listed building.</p>
