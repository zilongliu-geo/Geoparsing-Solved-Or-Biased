  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Burbank</span> is a large, greenbelt suburb in south-east <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It has been claimed the suburb was named after <span class="per">Alfred Harry Burbank</span>, a surveyor and farmer, who was a resident in the area from <span class="date">1890</span> to <span class="date">1908</span>, or that it was named after <span class="per">Frank Burbank</span>, a local horse dealer. <span class="loc">Mount Petrie</span> lies just to the north of the suburb. <span class="per">Burbank</span> has a number of small intermittent creeks winding between cleared and uncleared rolling hills. At the <span class="date">2011</span> Australian Census the suburb recorded a population of 1,137. The main road across in the area is the Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road. There are also a couple of working and hobby farms. There are a few palm nurseries and at least two turf farms in the area. <span class="per">Burbank</span> has a number of churches and temples and there is a jewish school. The closest public primary school is Mount <span class="org">Petrie State School</span> in Mackenzie. There are no shops in the suburb and public transport is very limited. The almost entirely residential outer suburb is dominated by large acreage blocks, many with extensive gardens and prestige housing built on them. A large dam built in <span class="date">the late 1960s</span> has shaped the modern development of this area. Called the <span class="per">Leslie Harrison</span> Dam, it forms the <span class="loc">Tingalpa</span> Reservoir on <span class="loc">Tingalpa Creek</span>. The dam provides water for thousands of users in <span class="loc">Redland City</span>. Because of water quality concerns the population density has been kept low within the immediate catchment area.</p><br><br>
