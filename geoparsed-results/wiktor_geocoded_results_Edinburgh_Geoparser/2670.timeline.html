  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gaoqiao</span> (Chinese: 高桥; pinyin: Gāoqiáo) is a town in <span class="org">Pudong New Area</span> in Shanghai, <span class="loc">China</span>. <span class="loc">Gaoqiao</span> <span class="loc">Old Town</span> dates back to the Southern Song Dynasty. Gaoqiao New Town, also known as <span class="loc">Holland</span> Village or <span class="loc">Holland</span> Town, is a new town with a Dutch architectural theme. <span class="loc">Gaoqiao</span> is located at the northern end of <span class="loc">Pudong</span>, on the east bank of the <span class="loc">Huangpu</span> River and next to <span class="org">Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone</span>. It has an area of 39 square kilometres, and had a registered population of 84,900 in <span class="date">2008</span>. The town is served by Shanghai Metro Line 6. Gaoqiao New Town arose from the One City, Nine Towns policy, which was initiated in <span class="date">2001</span>. Each of the suburban <span class="loc">districts of Shanghai</span> was assigned a new town, each with its own theme. Pudong's new town was assigned to <span class="loc">Gaoqiao</span>, with a Dutch theme. Other Western themes used to date are Scandinavian, Italian, Spanish, Canadian, English and German. Dutch architectural firms <span class="loc">Kuiper</span> <span class="per">Compagnons</span> and <span class="per">Atelier</span> Dutch jointly produced the design for the town's initial development, covering an area of 1 square kilometre; Chinese designers were brought in subsequently. There are versions of Dutch buildings such as the <span class="org">Netherlands Maritime Museum</span>, the Bijenkorf department store in <span class="loc">Amsterdam</span>, and the <span class="loc">Hofwijck</span> mansion in <span class="loc">Voorburg</span>. One section of the town was inspired by the Kattenbroek quarter of <span class="loc">Amersfoort</span>. The town also has a windmill, and is a popular location for wedding photography. As of <span class="date">July 2010</span>, the town was still only partially built.</p><br><br>
