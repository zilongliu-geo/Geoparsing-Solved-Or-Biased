<p><span class="loc">Shuitou</span> (simplified Chinese: 水头; traditional Chinese: 水頭; pinyin: Shuǐtóu; literally: "water head") is a town (a township-level division) of <span class="loc">Nan</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> City, in <span class="loc">southern Fujian province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>. <span class="loc">Shuitou</span> is located on the western side of the <span class="loc">Shijing</span> River and its estuary, the <span class="loc">Anhai</span> Bay (安海湾). It is connected to its eastern neighbor, the town of <span class="loc">Anhai</span>, by the famous ancient five-li-long <span class="loc">Anping</span> Bridge, built from large (some almost 10 meters long) slabs of stone. There is also a modern road to <span class="loc">Anhai</span> (and on to <span class="loc">Jinjiang City</span> and <span class="loc">Quanzhou</span>), which has a much shorter bridge over the <span class="loc">Shijing</span>, as the estuary has largely silted up over a thousand of years since the old bridge was built. <span class="loc">Shuitou</span>, similarly to its southern neighbor, <span class="loc">Shijing</span>, has a significant stone-working industry. There is a fair amount of new economic development in town, some of it connected to the trade with <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>. Aquaculture is practiced on the <span class="loc">Anhai</span> Bay (the estuary of the <span class="loc">Shijing</span> River). As of ca. 2001, 138.5 hectares of the bay's mudflats and water surface were used for aquaculture; this included 37.5 ha used for raising the blood cockles (Tegillarca granosa, 泥蚶), 58.3 ha used for the Chinese razor clam (Sinonovacula constricta, 缢蛏), 16.2 ha used for oyster farming, and 26.5 ha used for shrimp farming. Over 1400 people from Shuitou's <span class="loc">Gangnei</span> Village (巷内村) were employed in aquaculture and fishing.</p>
