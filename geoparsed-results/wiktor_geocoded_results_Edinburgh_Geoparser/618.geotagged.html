<p><span class="loc">Belmont</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, a suburb of <span class="loc">Boston</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Boston</span> metropolitan area. Its population was 24,729 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Belmont</span> was established on March 10, 1859, by former citizens of, and land from the bordering towns of <span class="loc">Watertown</span>, to the south; <span class="loc">Waltham</span>, to the west; and <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, then known as <span class="loc">West Cambridge</span>, to the north. The town was named after <span class="loc">Bellmont</span>, the 200 acre (0.8 kmÂ²) estate of one of the leading advocates of and largest donor to its creation, John Perkins Cushing. The easternmost section of the town, including the western portion of Fresh Pond, was annexed by <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> in 1880 in a dispute over a slaughterhouse licensed in 1878 on Fresh Pond, so that <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> could protect Fresh Pond, a part of its municipal water system. Preceding its incorporation, <span class="loc">Belmont</span> was an agrarian based town, with several large farms servicing <span class="loc">Boston</span> for produce and livestock. It remained largely the same until the turn of the twentieth century, when trolley service and better roads were introduced, making the town more attractive as a residential area, most notably for the building of large estates.</p>
