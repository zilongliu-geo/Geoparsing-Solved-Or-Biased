  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hudson</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Breckinridge County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="per">Hudson</span> is located along <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> Route 401, 13.4 miles (21.6 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Hardinsburg</span>. <span class="per">Hudson</span> has a post office with ZIP code 40145. In <span class="date">1810</span>, <span class="per">Joseph Hudson</span> arrived in <span class="loc">Breckinridge County</span>, taking land that would forever be known as <span class="per">Hudson</span>. The first settlers at <span class="per">Hudson</span> were <span class="per">George Holmes</span>, Rafeal Cox, <span class="per">Doctor George Legrand</span>, <span class="per">Steve Critchelow</span> (the father of <span class="per">Bill</span> and <span class="per">Tom</span> <span class="per">Critchelow</span>, who ran the mill and blacksmith shop at <span class="loc">McDaniels</span> for <span class="date">60 years</span>), <span class="per">Henry Tucker</span>, and Mac Jauncy. <span class="per">Hudson</span> loaned four of its citizens to the <span class="org">Union Army during the Civil War</span>: <span class="per">Elza Tucker</span>, <span class="per">Bill Tucker</span>, <span class="per">Bill Monroe</span>, and <span class="per">Nic Mercer</span>. All returned safely. During the Civil War, guerillas plundered all the houses in <span class="per">Hudson</span>, stealing all the best horses, and woolen goods and clothing that was of any value. Shortly after the war, Mac Jauncy built a gristmill in the forks of <span class="loc">Calimese</span> Creek so people of the community could grind their own meal. This gristmill was powered by a single horse, and had a long sweep pole, which was common for sorghum mills in the area. Even though Mac Jauncy wasn't present to collect any fees, every customer would leave some of their meal in a bin based on the honor system.</p><br><br>
