  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Hale is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">Halton</span> unitary authority of <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. According to the <span class="date">2001</span> Census it had a population of 1,898. The village is north of the <span class="loc">River Mersey</span>, and just to the east of the boundary with <span class="loc">Merseyside</span>. It is 2½ miles east of <span class="loc">Speke</span> in <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>, and 4 miles south-west of <span class="loc">Widnes</span>. The nearby village of Halebank is to the north-east. The entire area was historically in <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>. Before <span class="date">1 April 1974</span> it formed part of the <span class="loc">Whiston Rural</span> District in <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>. The area still however has a <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> postcode "L24" In spite of being close to the <span class="loc">City of Liverpool</span>, the village’s tranquil and quiet atmosphere still survives <span class="date">today</span>. The many whitewashed cottages, with country gardens, set against a background of mature trees, present an attractive picture in the spring and <span class="date">summer</span>. The visitor will quickly appreciate why Hale has several times won ‘Best - Kept Village’ awards in <span class="date">the late 1960s</span> and more recently several "Community Pride" and "Little Gem Awards" for several locations in the village. Situated on Grade One agricultural land, Hale s surrounded by several farms and rolling countryside.</p><br><br>
