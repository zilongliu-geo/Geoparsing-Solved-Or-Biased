  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Clovis</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Fresno County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The <span class="date">2014</span> population was estimated to be 102,189. <span class="per">Clovis</span> is located 6.5 miles (10.5 km) northeast of downtown <span class="loc">Fresno</span>, at an elevation of 361 feet (110 m). The <span class="loc">city of Clovis</span> began as a freight stop along the San Joaquin Valley Railroad. Organized on <span class="date">January 15, 1890</span>, by Fresno businessmen <span class="per">Thomas E. Hughes</span>, <span class="per">Fulton Berry</span>, <span class="per">Gilbert R. Osmun, H.D.</span> <span class="per">Colson, John</span> D. Gray, and <span class="per">William M. Williams</span>, in partnership with Michigan railroad speculator <span class="per">Marcus Pollasky</span>, the SJVRR began construction in <span class="loc">Fresno</span> on <span class="date">July 4, 1891</span>, and reached the farmlands of <span class="per">Clovis Cole</span> and <span class="per">George Owen</span> by <span class="date">October</span> of <span class="date">that year</span>. The railroad purchased right-of-way from both farmers, half from each – the east side from <span class="per">Cole</span> and the west side from <span class="per">Owen</span> – and ran tracks up the borderline between the two properties. The railroad agreed to establish a station on the west side of the tracks and to call it "<span class="per">Clovis</span>". The <span class="per">Clovis</span> station, after which the town was named, was positioned on the <span class="per">Owen</span> side of the track.</p><br><br>
