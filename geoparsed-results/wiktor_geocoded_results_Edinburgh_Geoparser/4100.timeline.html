The <span class="loc">Sevier River</span> is generally used by irrigation before it reaches its eventual end, the dry <span class="loc">Sevier Lake</span>. DMAD are the initials for the <span class="loc">Deseret</span> <span class="per">Melville Abraham</span> and <span class="org">Delta</span> water company.
