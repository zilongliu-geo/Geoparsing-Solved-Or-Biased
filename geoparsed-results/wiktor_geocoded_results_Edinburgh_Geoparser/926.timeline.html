  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Albany</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Athens County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 828 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Albany</span> is located at 39°13′44″N 82°12′1″W (39.228787, -82.200363). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.27 square miles (3.29 km2), of which 1.25 square miles (3.24 km2) is land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) is water. <span class="loc">Albany</span> was laid out in about <span class="date">1832</span>. It was incorporated as a village in <span class="date">1842</span>. The small rural village became one of several stops in <span class="loc">Athens County</span> for the Underground Railroad, as fugitives could come upriver on the <span class="loc">Hocking River</span> from the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>. Free blacks, many of whom had migrated from the Upper South, settled the village in the mid-19th century. The black population increased during the 1850s from four in the township to 174 by <span class="date">1860</span>, largely because of the chance for their children to attend the <span class="org">Albany Manual Labor Academy</span>, which was open to both genders and all races. The outbreak of the Civil War caused the academy to lose students and close.</p><br><br>
