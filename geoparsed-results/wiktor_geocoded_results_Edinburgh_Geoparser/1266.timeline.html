  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pasadena</span> is an incorporated town located in census division 5 which is in the western portion of <span class="loc">Newfoundland</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> and it is a picturesque community on the shores of <span class="loc">Deer Lake</span> at the junction of the North Arm Valley and the <span class="loc">Humber</span> Valley. The town was named after <span class="loc">Pasadena</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The meaning of the name is sometimes claimed to be "crown of the valley". The Town of <span class="loc">Pasadena</span> claims the name is Spanish for "crown of the valley". However, the name, first applied to the city in <span class="loc">California</span>, is a corruption of an Ojibwe phrase meaning "valley" or "of the valley". The founders of <span class="loc">Pasadena</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, claimed it was Ojibwe for "crown of the valley" or "key of the valley" when in fact it only meant, roughly "of the valley". The Town of <span class="loc">Pasadena</span> formerly consisted of three separate communities: <span class="loc">South Brook</span>, <span class="loc">Pasadena</span> and Midland. <span class="loc">South Brook</span> was located on the sandy shore of <span class="loc">Deer Lake</span>. It evolved much earlier than <span class="loc">Pasadena</span>, starting out in <span class="date">the early 1920s</span> as a logging camp for the <span class="org">Bowater Company</span> from Corner Brook. The railway also used <span class="loc">South Brook</span>, but only as a stop along its route across the island. In <span class="date">1921</span>, the census showed that <span class="loc">South Brook</span> only had a population of 6 people, within 2 families.</p><br><br>
