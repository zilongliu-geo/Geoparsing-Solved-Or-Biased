  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Valle de Guadalupe</span> (Valley of <span class="per">Guadalupe</span>), or <span class="loc">Francisco Zarco</span> is a village located in the <span class="loc">Ensenada Municipality</span>, <span class="loc">Baja California</span>, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, 20 km (14 mi) north of the <span class="loc">city of Ensenada</span>. The census of <span class="date">2010</span> reported a population of 2,664 inhabitants. The community was founded in <span class="date">1834</span> by Dominican missionary Félix Caballero as Misión de Nuestra Señora de <span class="per">Guadalupe del Norte</span>, making it the last mission established in the Californias. Caballero had to abandon the mission in <span class="date">1840</span>, under attacks from the indigenous peoples. From <span class="date">1905</span>-<span class="date">1910</span>, a mixture of Spiritual Christian faiths from <span class="loc">South Russia</span>, mostly Pryguny, settled in 4 farming colonies near <span class="loc">Ensenada</span>, <span class="loc">Baja</span> <span class="loc">California</span> <span class="loc">Norte</span> Territory, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. <span class="per">Guadalupe</span> was the main colony of about 20+ square miles purchased in <span class="date">1905</span>. Most owned or rented land communally. Not all were ethnic Russians, and were of various faiths. They also rented as much as 50 square miles from about 10 nearby ranches. A few other immigrants from <span class="loc">Russia</span> lived in <span class="loc">Ensenada city</span>. Most moved to <span class="loc">California</span> during WWII to join more prosperous relatives and work in the war industries. Most of those who remain, intermarried and live in <span class="loc">Ensenada</span> and <span class="loc">Tijuana</span>.</p><br><br>
