  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Attorney insists client not competent for trial . The attorney for a mentally ill man accused of stabbing an Athens-Clarke police officer nearly to death wants another jury to consider whether the defendant is competent to stand trial. Assistant public defender <span class="per">Benjamin Pearlman</span> is arguing that, after a one-day civil trial <span class="date">last fall</span>, a jury contradicted a state psychologist's finding that <span class="per">Steven Anthony Eberhart</span> is incompetent. And, he said, mental health professionals still believe <span class="per">Eberhart</span> isn't sane enough to understand what he did or help in his defense. <span class="per">Pearlman</span> keeps in contact with the staff at East Central Regional Hospital, and every specialist involved in treating <span class="per">Eberhart</span> "continues to have the opinion that he is still not competent to stand trial," <span class="per">Pearlman</span> argued in documents filed <span class="date">last month</span> in <span class="org">Clarke County Superior Court</span>. <span class="per">Pearlman</span> can't defend <span class="per">Eberhart</span> effectively, because his client can't hold a rational conversation about his case, he said. "It's basically unconstitutional to put a person like that on trial, and it's my responsibility to say that <span class="per">Steven</span>'s not in the state of mind to stand trial," <span class="per">Pearlman</span> said. "Even if a jury found he might have been competent before, when someone has mental health issues, their status can change month to month, day to day," he said. Authorities say <span class="per">Eberhart</span>, 45, attacked <span class="per">Sgt. Courtney Gale</span> with a kitchen knife on <span class="date">Dec. 11, 2007</span>, repeatedly stabbing the uniformed officer as she worked an off-duty security guard job in the <span class="org">Kroger</span> store on Alps Road. Gale spent <span class="date">two weeks</span> in a coma, had several surgeries to save one of her legs and went through extensive physical and cognitive rehabilitation. A grand jury indicted <span class="per">Eberhart</span> on a criminal attempt to commit murder charge and 10 other felonies, and in <span class="date">September</span>, a civil panel in <span class="org">Clarke County Superior Court</span> determined that <span class="per">Eberhart</span>, though he has a history of schizophrenia, is competent to stand trial. Jurors heard a state Department of Human Resources psychologist testify that <span class="per">Eberhart</span> continued to "experience psychotic delusions, consistent with his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia," according to court documents. <span class="per">Eberhart</span> has been held at the <span class="loc">Augusta</span> psychiatric hospital since soon after his arrest in <span class="date">December 2007</span>. He couldn't attend his own arraignment hearing <span class="date">Feb. 4</span>, so the court entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. <span class="per">Pearlman</span> filed the request for a second competency trial immediately after the jury finding. Prosecutors are not required to respond, and Superior Court Chief Judge <span class="per">Lawton Stephens</span> has yet to rule on the request. <span class="per">Pearlman</span> already asked the state Court of Appeals to overturn the competency decision, but the court dismissed the appeal in <span class="date">December</span>, stating it lacked jurisdiction. District Attorney <span class="per">Ken Mauldin</span> declined to comment on the request for another competency hearing, other than to say, "Of course, (<span class="per">Eberhart</span>'s) already been found competent by a jury, and they are raising that issue again, saying he's not competent at this time."</p><br><br>
