  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Linden is a municipality in the Bern-Mittelland administrative district in the canton of <span class="loc">Bern</span> in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. Ausserbirrmoos was the largest in land area of the three communities that formed Linden. It was first mentioned in <span class="date">1298</span> as Birmos. Throughout the Middle Ages it was part of the Herrschaft of <span class="loc">Diessbach</span>. Originally it formed a single community with Innerbirrmoos, but in <span class="date">1633</span> the two communities separated to form independent municipalities. It absorbed the land and population of the communities of Schöntal (BE) and Barschwand when they dissolved in <span class="date">1887</span>. In <span class="date">1941</span>, before the merger, it had a population of 466. <span class="loc">Otterbach</span> is first mentioned in <span class="date">1236</span> as Ottirbach. Like Innerbirrmoos, around <span class="date">1399</span> it became part of the <span class="loc">Bernese district</span> of Röthenbach and in <span class="date">1529</span> the Landvogtei of <span class="loc">Signau</span>. It was the smallest and poorest of the three municipalities that joined to form Linden. In <span class="date">1941</span> it had a population of 310. The hamlet of Linden was first mentioned in <span class="date">1354</span>. While it was geographically in the center of the three municipalities, it was never an independent municipality itself. All three municipalities, Ausserbirrmoos, Innerbirrmoos, and <span class="loc">Otterbach</span>, were part of the <span class="loc">parish of Oberdiessbach</span> until <span class="date">1860</span>, when they broke away to form the <span class="loc">parish of Kurzenberg</span>. After the creation of the independent municipality of Linden in <span class="date">1945</span>, it became the <span class="loc">parish of Linden</span>. The parish church was built in the hamlet of Linden in <span class="date">1848</span>. Since it was in the center of the communities, the local school was also built there. Beginning in <span class="date">the 1970s</span>, a training base for the <span class="org">Swiss Army</span> opened in the community. <span class="date">Today</span> the municipality is still rural and agricultural in character, though about two-thirds of the working population commute to jobs outside the municipality.</p><br><br>
