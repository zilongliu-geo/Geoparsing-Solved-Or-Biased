  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Laura</span> is a rural town in the <span class="per">Mid North</span> region of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>, 12 km north of <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> on the Horrocks Highway and 40 km east of <span class="loc">Port Pirie</span>. The first European to explore the district was <span class="per">Thomas Burr</span> in <span class="date">September 1842</span>. His promising reports soon led to occupation of the district by pastoralists, one of whom was <span class="per">Herbert Bristow</span> <span class="loc">Hughes</span> (ca.1821 – <span class="date">18 May 1892</span>). When the present town was surveyed he named it for his wife, <span class="per">Laura</span> née White (ca.1829 – <span class="date">5 January 1909</span>). <span class="per">Laura</span> is famous as the home of <span class="per">Golden North</span> ice cream which has been manufactured in the town since <span class="date">1923</span> (the factory being the biggest employer in the District), and was a boyhood home of poet <span class="per">C. J. Dennis</span>, whose first poem was published in the <span class="org">Laura Standard</span> newspaper. <span class="per">Laura</span> is administered by the <span class="org">Northern Areas Council</span>, and is in the state electoral <span class="loc">district of Stuart</span> and the federal Division of Grey. The <span class="per">Laura</span> Community Development and Tourism Association Incorporated liaises with the <span class="org">Northern Areas Council</span> in preserving the amenity of the rural centre, with the support of many volunteers in community projects. The LCDTA's major project is operating the community-owned <span class="per">Laura</span> Caravan Park. Profits from the caravan park operations are then used for improvements in the township.</p><br><br>
