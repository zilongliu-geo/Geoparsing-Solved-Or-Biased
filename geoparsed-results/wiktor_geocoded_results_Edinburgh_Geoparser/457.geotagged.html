<p><span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Quebec</span>, included in La Haute-Yamaska <span class="loc">Regional County</span> Municipality, in the administrative area of Montérégie. The population as of the <span class="loc">Canada</span> 2011 Census was 4,330. Completely encircled by the township of <span class="loc">Shefford</span>, this residential city is located within the Eastern Townships, about ninety kilometers east of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>. It was first settled in 1793 by Ezekiel Lewis, an English Loyalist supporter who was originally from <span class="loc">Marlborough</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. He named his location <span class="loc">Lewis Falls</span> and after 9 years, Captain Ezekiel Lewis sold his lot and moved only a short distance. The land was purchased by William Lamoure, a merchant from St-Armand who then sold it to Lazare Letourneau who in turn sold it to Hezekiah Robinson in 1822. Robinson immediately renamed <span class="loc">Lewis Falls</span> to <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> after the famous battle in which Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated. The name <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> was suggested by his Father-in-law. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> became the summer residence of <span class="loc">Montreal</span> industrialist James Davidson in the 1880s. Davidson was the son of Scottish immigrant Thomas Davidson, who founded The Thos. Davidson Manufacturing Company, Ltd., a producer of enameled tinware with offices throughout <span class="loc">Canada</span> and around the world. Davidson established "<span class="loc">Ayrmont</span> Farm" on the western side of the town. The main house, "<span class="loc">Orford</span> View," still stands on <span class="loc">Mountain Street</span>. The guest bungalow across the road and surrounding property are still in the hands of the family.</p>
