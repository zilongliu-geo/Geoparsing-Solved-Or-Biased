<p>For the Burton near <span class="loc">Tarporley</span> in <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>, see Burton, Gowy Burton is a village on the <span class="loc">Wirral</span> Peninsula, in the unitary authority of <span class="loc">Cheshire West</span> and <span class="loc">Chester</span> and the ceremonial <span class="loc">county of Cheshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It constituted part of the Burton and Ness Ward of the Borough of <span class="loc">Ellesmere Port</span> and <span class="loc">Neston</span>, with the ward having a total population of 1,620 in the 2001 Census. It is now in <span class="loc">Ledsham</span> and <span class="loc">Willaston Ward</span>. Burton was first documented in the Domesday Book and historically was on the route which travellers would take from <span class="loc">London</span> to <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span>. Owing to its location on trade routes, it is thought to have developed at a faster rate than neighbouring communities. Indeed, during the fourteenth century trade and travel allowed Burton to flourish, standing as it did near the site of embarcation for the ferry to <span class="loc">North Wales</span> and on the main route to the <span class="loc">city of Chester</span>. However, the build up of silt in the <span class="loc">River Dee</span> led to a decrease in shipping trade, and Burton's prosperity took a downturn when the river course was diverted in the eighteenth century.</p>
