  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sur</span> (Arabic: صور‎) is a capital <span class="loc">city of Ash Sharqiyah</span> Region, northeastern <span class="loc">Oman</span>, on the coast of the <span class="loc">Gulf of Oman</span>. It is located at around 22°34′0″N 59°31′44″E, and is 93 miles (150 km) southeast of the Omani capital Muscat. Historically the city is known for being an important destination point for sailors. <span class="date">Today</span> the sea still plays an important part of life in <span class="loc">Sur</span>. By the 6th century, <span class="loc">Sur</span> was an established centre for trade with <span class="loc">East Africa</span>. In the 16th century, it was under Portuguese rule but was liberated by the Omani imam Nasir ibn <span class="loc">Murshid</span> and underwent an economic revival, as a trade centre with <span class="loc">India</span> and <span class="loc">East Africa</span>. This continued until the mid-19th century, when the British outlawed the slave trade. The city was further ruined by the opening of the <span class="loc">Suez Canal</span>, which saw it lose trade with <span class="loc">India</span>. The main college in <span class="loc">Sur</span> is the <span class="org">Sur College of Applied Sciences</span>. The college has over 4000 students and offers degrees in Business, Communication, Information Technology and Design. It is considered one of the better institutions of higher learning in <span class="loc">Oman</span>. The second college is <span class="org">Sur University College</span>.</p><br><br>
