  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Body ID'd, cause of death unknown. The frozen body found <span class="date">earlier this week</span> along the shore of <span class="loc">Lake Opechee</span> in <span class="loc">Laconia</span> has been identified as that of a <span class="loc">Laconia</span> man who went missing <span class="date">nearly three months ago</span>. But the police still aren't sure how <span class="per">Bryan Harman</span>, 28, died. The state medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy <span class="date">yesterday</span>, identifying the body as <span class="per">Harman</span>'s. The autopsy found nothing suspicious - no wounds or signs of violence - and it could be <span class="date">months</span> before toxicology reports come back, said <span class="loc">Laconia</span> police <span class="per">Capt. William Clary</span>. "There's nothing sticking out," <span class="per">Clary</span> said. He said the autopsy also did not determine how long ago <span class="per">Harman</span> had died, but "we're saying <span class="date">at least several months</span>." <span class="per">Harman</span> was last seen on <span class="date">New Year's Eve</span>. He had a fight with his girlfriend, his mother said when she called the police <span class="date">the next day</span> to report him missing. The police began to investigate. Flyers were posted around <span class="loc">Laconia</span>. The police tracked <span class="per">Harman</span>'s cell phone and credit cards, but they weren't used, <span class="per">Clary</span> said. <span class="per">Harman</span> never picked up a paycheck from work. <span class="date">Months</span> passed, and no one called to report anything, <span class="per">Clary</span> said. On <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, two people walking along nearby railroad tracks and searching the area for bottles spotted a body by the lake's shoreline. It was partly in the water and partly covered in ice, <span class="per">Clary</span> said. The body, which was fully clothed, likely wasn't visible until recently, as snow began to melt, <span class="per">Clary</span> said. The medical examiner's office took the body, and an autopsy was scheduled. Though an identification hadn't been made, <span class="per">Harman</span> was the only missing person report that the <span class="loc">Laconia</span> police had pending, and they contacted his family to let them know a body had been found. "We wanted to make sure they knew we were doing everything we could," <span class="per">Clary</span> said. During the autopsy, the medical examiner was able to identify <span class="per">Harman</span> with information his family had previously provided, including "tattoos, body piercings, very good clothing description," <span class="per">Clary</span> said. "We had all that stuff on hand." <span class="per">Harman</span> also had his wallet, including an ID from <span class="loc">Alaska</span>. <span class="per">Clary</span> said <span class="per">Harman</span> lived in <span class="loc">Alaska</span> "for some period of time" and said he thought <span class="per">Harman</span>'s father lived there also. <span class="per">Harman</span> is listed as living on <span class="loc">Dartmouth Street</span> in <span class="loc">Laconia</span>. <span class="date">Yesterday morning</span>, before the autopsy had been conducted, a woman answered the phone and identified herself as <span class="per">Harman</span>'s ex-girlfriend. She said she was "assuming the worst." She said she hadn't heard from him since <span class="date">Dec. 31</span>.</p><br><br>
