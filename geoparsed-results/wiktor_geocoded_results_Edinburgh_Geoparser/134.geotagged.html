<p>The Municipality of <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> (Filipino: Bayan ng <span class="loc">Candelaria</span>) is a first class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Quezon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 110,570 people. <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> is the second largest industrial center of the province, after <span class="loc">Lucena City</span>. Among the municipalities in <span class="loc">Quezon Province</span>, <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> has the most desiccated coconut factories and oil refineries, such as Peter Paul Philippine Corporation, Primex Coco Products Inc., Pacific Royal Basic Foods, SuperStar Corporation, Tongsan Industrial Development Corporation, and others, which employ thousands of people. Prior to 1885, the pioneering barangays of <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> in its Western part notably, <span class="loc">Taguan</span>, <span class="loc">Kinatihan</span> and <span class="loc">Masin</span> were parts of the Municipality of <span class="loc">Tiaong</span>, while <span class="loc">Malabanban</span>, <span class="loc">Mangilag</span> and Sta. Catalina in the East, were under the jurisdiction of the town of <span class="loc">Sariaya</span>. It was on December 26, 1878, that a permit was granted by the Governor General of the <span class="loc">Philippine Islands</span> for the establishment of an independent government over these barangays. Its boundaries were fixed by means of a treaty signed by the notable leaders of <span class="loc">Tiaong</span>, <span class="loc">Sariaya</span> and the founding families of <span class="loc">Candelaria</span>.</p>
