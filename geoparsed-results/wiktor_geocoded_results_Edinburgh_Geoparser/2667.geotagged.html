<p><span class="loc">San Remo</span> is a town in southern Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span> in the <span class="loc">Gippsland</span> region. Formed as a fishing village, its economy is now largely based on tourism. It is also notable as the town on the mainland end of the bridge to <span class="loc">Phillip Island</span>. At the 2006 census, <span class="loc">San Remo</span> had a population of 1017. It is located at the western tip of the <span class="loc">Anderson</span> Peninsula, 122 km south-east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> via the <span class="loc">South Gippsland Highway</span>, near <span class="loc">Kilcunda</span> and opposite <span class="loc">Newhaven</span> on <span class="loc">Phillip Island</span>. The area around what is now <span class="loc">San Remo</span> was occupied for many centuries by the Bunurong people of the Kulin nation. George Bass explored the coast and discovered the strait separating the mainland and Van Diemen's land, together with the bay he named Western Port. Sealers frequented the coast and Islands in the 1820s before Europeans settled the coast Samuel Anderson a Scottish immigrant who in 1835 established the third permanent settlement in Victoria at Bass. Samuel had arrived in <span class="loc">Hobart</span> aboard the "Lang" in September 1830 and was employed as bookkeeper for Van Diemens Land Co at Circular Head Tasmania. In 1835 he left the company and sailed to <span class="loc">Westernport</span>, it has been suggested that the sloop "Rebecca" was purchased by Samuel and his partner/s.In 1837 his partner Robert Massie also left <span class="loc">VDL Co</span> and joined Samuel at <span class="loc">Westernport</span> where his skills as an engineer produced a tidal powered mill.Samuels Brothers Hugh and Thomas followed him to Bass and when land was released they bought over 2000 acres centred on the Anderson area today with their homestead "Netherwood" being built on the shores of Westernport.The Anderson brothers and their descendants featured prominently in the local municipal area. An early pioneer and explorer "Anderson Inlet" at <span class="loc">Inverloch</span> was named after Samuel Anderson. Descendents of the Anderson family remain around <span class="loc">San Remo</span> to this day.</p>
