<p>Brody (Ukrainian: Броди, Polish: Brody, Yiddish: בראָד, translit. <span class="loc">Brod</span>) is a city in Lviv Oblast (region) of western <span class="loc">Ukraine</span>. It is the administrative center of Brody Raion (district), and is located in the valley of the upper <span class="loc">Styr</span> River, approximately 90 kilometres (56 miles) northeast of the oblast capital, Lviv. Population: 23,784 (2013 est.). Brody is the junction of the <span class="loc">Druzhba</span> and Odessa–Brody oil pipelines. The first mention of a settlement on the site of Brody is dated 1084 (Instructions by Volodymyr Monomach). It is believed to have been destroyed by Batu Khan in 1241. From 1441 Brody was the property of different feudal families (Jan Sieniński; from 1511, Kamieniecki). Brody was granted Magdeburg rights and city status in 1584. At this time it was known under the name <span class="loc">Lubicz</span> (Любич, Polish: <span class="loc">Lubicz</span>) that gave name to the Lubicz coat of arms of the owner, Stanisław Żółkiewski (not to be confused with Lubech, Lubecz). Since the 17th century, the city has been populated not only by Ukrainians and Poles, but also a significant number of Jews (70% of the town's population), Armenians, and Greeks. From 1629, the city became the property of Stanisław Koniecpolski, who ordered the construction of Brody Castle (1630–1635). The castle, or rather the fortress, was designed by the French military engineer <span class="loc">Guillaume</span> <span class="loc">Le Vasseur</span> de <span class="loc">Beauplan</span>. In 1648, during the Cossack insurrection, the castle took eight weeks for Bohdan Khmelnytsky to capture. Notably, according to the book History of the <span class="loc">Rus</span>, the town′s Jewish population was spared after the sack. The Jews of Brody were found not to have been engaged in maltreatment of the Orthodox Christian (<span class="loc">Rus</span>) population and were only required to pay a "moderate tribute" in kind.</p>
