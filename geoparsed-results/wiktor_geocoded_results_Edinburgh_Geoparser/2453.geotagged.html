<p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 60,485. The county seat is Jefferson. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> comprises the Jefferson, GA Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Atlanta-Athens-Clarke County-Sandy Springs, GA Combined Statistical Area. Most of the first non-Native American settlers came from <span class="loc">Effingham</span>, County in 1786. On February 11, 1796, <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> was split off from part of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. The new county was named in honor of Revolutionary War Lieutenant Colonel, Congressman, Senator and Governor James Jackson. The county originally covered an area of approximately 1,800 square miles (4,662.0 km2), with <span class="loc">Clarksboro</span> as its first county seat. In 1801, the Georgia General Assembly granted 40,000 acres (160 km2) of land in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> for a state college. Franklin College (now University of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>) began classes the same year, and the <span class="loc">city of Athens</span> was developed around the school. Also the same year, a new county was developed around the new college town, and Jackson lost territory to the new <span class="loc">Clarke</span>. The county seat was moved to an old Indian village called <span class="loc">Thomocoggan</span>, a location with ample water supply from Curry Creek and four large springs. In 1804, the city was renamed Jefferson, after Thomas Jefferson.</p>
