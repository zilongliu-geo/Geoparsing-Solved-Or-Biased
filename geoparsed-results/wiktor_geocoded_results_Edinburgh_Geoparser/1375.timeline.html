  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cleveland</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Pawnee County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. The <span class="date">2010</span> census population was 3,251, a decrease of 0.9 percent from 3,282 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. After the Cherokee Outlet opening, a homesteader by the name of <span class="loc">Willis</span> <span class="per">H. Herbert</span> established a town named <span class="per">Herbert</span> by opening a post office on the current townsite of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> on <span class="date">October 28, 1893</span>. The Post Office department subsequently withdrew the approval of the <span class="per">Herbert</span> post office. The post office was then moved 100 feet, and reestablished under the name <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, named in honor of then President <span class="loc">Grover Cleveland</span> on <span class="date">April 19, 1894</span>. By <span class="date">1900</span>, the town's population was 211. Before the discovery of oil in the area, the town served as a trade center between the local farmers and the Osage Tribe who lived on the reservation was on the other side of the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> river. In <span class="date">1904</span>, a railroad line owned by the <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> Railroad (later known as <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Texas Railway or Katy) from <span class="loc">Oklahoma City</span> reached <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> and crossed the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River into <span class="loc">Osage County</span>. On <span class="date">May 27, 1904</span>, the first oil well was spudded near the community, and it caused an influx of oil workers and other people. At the time of statehood in <span class="date">1907</span>, <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> had 1,441 residents.</p><br><br>
