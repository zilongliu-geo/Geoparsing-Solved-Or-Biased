  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>New twist develops in <span class="per">Fairfield</span> hearing. A new plea agreement is “at least being discussed” for <span class="per">Elizabeth Fairfield</span>, a <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> woman accused of murdering her daughter, <span class="per">Brittany</span>, in <span class="date">June 2007</span>. <span class="per">Robert Schembs</span>, one of four lawyers on <span class="per">Fairfield</span>’s defense team, told Superior Court II <span class="per">Judge Rebecca McClure</span> a deal was possible during an initial hearing <span class="date">Thursday</span>. “I think if we resolve it, it will be sooner rather than later,” <span class="per">Schembs</span> said. Specifics will follow <span class="date">Thursday</span>’s hearing, he told <span class="per">McClure</span>. Initial hearings are when defendants formally learn what crimes they are accused of committing. <span class="per">Fairfield</span> was already in jail after being indicted by a Circuit Court grand jury in <span class="date">November 2008</span> for allegedly giving <span class="per">Brittany</span> a lethal dose of tramadol, a prescription pain killer. Additional charges of reckless homicide, neglect of a dependent and lying to police were filed against <span class="per">Fairfield</span> on <span class="date">March 16</span>. <span class="per">McClure</span> gave attorneys until <span class="date">11 a.m. April 24</span>, when an hearing to review evidence is scheduled, to approve a plea agreement. <span class="per">Fairfield</span>’s trial is to start at <span class="date">8:30 a.m. May 4</span> and <span class="date">last five days</span>. <span class="per">McClure</span> said she anticipates the trial “would require substantially more jurors” than usually called for in a Superior II trial. “It costs us more than $1,000 just to get a jury here,” she said. <span class="per">Fairfield</span>’s lawyers have already tried to keep the new charges from being field and still question whether the new charges are “technically legal,” <span class="per">Schembs</span> said. There are “propriety issues” over the grand jury’s indictment, he said. “We’re not sure at this point what they were presented with and what they weren’t; what they did and what they didn’t,” <span class="per">Schembs</span> said. <span class="per">McClure</span> had rejected a motion to strike the new charges, saying the defense had based the request on an out-dated state law. “A new motion to strike is pending,” <span class="per">Schembs</span> said. If the new charges stand, and if she is convicted on all four counts, <span class="per">Fairfield</span> could spend <span class="date">up to 98 years</span> in prison and be fined $35,000. <span class="per">Fairfield</span> has rejected one plea agreement. On <span class="date">Jan. 20</span>, Prosecutor <span class="per">Todd Meyer</span> offered to have her confess to reckless homicide. If she had accepted, and agreed to attend parenting and prescription drug treatment classes, <span class="per">Fairfield</span> would have been released <span class="date">that day</span>. <span class="per">Fairfield</span> declined to plead, maintaining her innocence.</p><br><br>
