  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bogota</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Bergen County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 8,187, reflecting a decline of 62 (-0.8%) from the 8,249 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 425 (+5.4%) from the 7,824 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. <span class="loc">Bogota</span> was formed on <span class="date">November 14, 1894</span>, from portions of Ridgefield Township, based on the results of a referendum held <span class="date">that day</span>. The borough was formed during the "Boroughitis" phenomenon then sweeping through <span class="loc">Bergen County</span>, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in <span class="date">1894</span> alone. Portions of <span class="loc">Bogota</span> were taken in <span class="date">1895</span> to form part of the newly created Township of <span class="loc">Teaneck</span>. <span class="loc">Bogota</span> was named in honor of the <span class="per">Bogert</span> family, which had been the first to occupy the area, and may also be a portmanteau of <span class="per">Bogert</span> and <span class="per">Banta</span>, another early family, with an "O" added to ease pronunciation. The borough's name is pronounced /bəˈɡoʊtə/ buh-GO-ta, unlike Bogotá, capital <span class="loc">city of Colombia</span>, whose name is accented on the final syllable. Coincidentally, 1.54% of Bogota's residents are from <span class="loc">Colombia</span>.</p><br><br>
