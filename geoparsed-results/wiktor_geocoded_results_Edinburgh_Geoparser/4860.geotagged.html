<p>Bartlett is a city in <span class="loc">Shelby County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located northeast of <span class="loc">Memphis</span>, and is part of the <span class="loc">Memphis</span> metropolitan area. The population was 54,613 at the 2010 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census. The community from which the <span class="loc">city of Bartlett</span> grew was first called <span class="loc">Union Depot</span> and <span class="loc">Green Bottom</span>. It was the last major way station in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> along the stagecoach route from <span class="loc">Nashville</span> westward and came into being about 1830. When the <span class="loc">Memphis</span> &amp; Ohio Railroad took the place of the stages, Bartlett continued as a depot. This was a farming community, with major plantations along Stage Road. On November 1, 1866, with a population of less than 100, the city was officially incorporated and the name changed to Bartlett. Upon incorporation, Bryan Wither was named the city's inaugural mayor. It was named for Major Gabriel M. Bartlett, a planter, whose homeplace was located on the old Raleigh-Somerville Road (Stage Road) at the present location of Bartlett Station Plaza. Bartlett is located at 35°13′23″N 89°50′28″W (35.222990, -89.841170), adjacent to the northeastern boundary of <span class="loc">Memphis</span>.</p>
