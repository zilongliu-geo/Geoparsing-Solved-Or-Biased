<p><span class="loc">La Joya</span> is a city in <span class="loc">western Hidalgo County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 83 between Mission and <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> City. The population was 3,985 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">La Joya</span> is part of the McAllen–Edinburg–Mission and <span class="loc">Reynosa–McAllen metropolitan</span> areas. Its name, meaning "the jewel," was inspired by a small natural lake west of the city; early settlers were said to observe that the lake shined in the sun like a jewel. [1] The site on which <span class="loc">La Joya</span> was founded was part of what was known as <span class="loc">Los Ejidos</span> de <span class="loc">Reynosa Viejo</span>. The ejidos were the shared grazing lands used for the livestock of the settlers of <span class="loc">Reynosa Viejo</span>. During the early 1800s, at the site of what is now <span class="loc">La Joya</span>, Francisco de la Garza, a descendent of the early colonizers of the area, founded a community, called <span class="loc">Tabasco</span>, adjacent to the northern bank of the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>. It was a prosperous community that died out after floods in 1908 and 1909. The settlers moved their belongings just north to higher and less flood-prone ground, current day La Joya.[2]</p>
