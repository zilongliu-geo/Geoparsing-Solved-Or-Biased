<p><span class="loc">Princeton</span> is a ghost town located in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Once a busy port on the <span class="loc">Mississippi River</span>, <span class="loc">Princeton</span> today is covered by forest and a portion of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Levee. Nothing remains of the settlement. <span class="loc">Princeton</span> was named for William Berry Prince, who settled on nearby <span class="loc">Lake Jackson</span> with his wife Sarah S. Jefferies in the early 1820s. <span class="loc">Princeton</span> was one of the first towns in the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Delta. In 1830, <span class="loc">Princeton</span> became <span class="loc">Washington County</span>'s second county seat after the first county seat, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, caved into the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. The <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River flowed directly west of <span class="loc">Princeton</span>, and "<span class="loc">Princeton</span> Landing" was the town's port. Across the river in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> was the now-extinct town of "<span class="loc">Grand Lake</span>". The <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Legislature incorporated the "<span class="loc">Lake Washington</span> and <span class="loc">Deer Creek</span> Railroad and Banking Company" in 1836. Based in <span class="loc">Princeton</span>, the railroad began constructing a line east from the town to <span class="loc">Lake Washington</span> and <span class="loc">Deer Creek</span>. The intent was to move cotton by railroad to <span class="loc">Princeton</span>, where it could be shipped by boat along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. Only a portion of the railroad bed was completed before the company's charter was repealed in 1839.</p>
