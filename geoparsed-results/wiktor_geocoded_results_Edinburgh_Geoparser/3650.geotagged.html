<p><span class="loc">Burra</span> is a pastoral centre and historic tourist town in the mid-north of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It lies east of the <span class="loc">Clare</span> Valley in the <span class="loc">Bald Hills</span> range, part of the northern Mount Lofty Ranges, and on <span class="loc">Burra Creek</span>. The town began as a single company mining township that, by 1851, was a set of townships (company, private and government-owned) collectively known as "The <span class="loc">Burra</span>". The <span class="loc">Burra</span> mines supplied 89% of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>'s and 5% of the world's copper for 15 years, and the settlement has been credited (along with the mines at <span class="loc">Kapunda</span>) with saving the economy of the struggling new colony of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. The <span class="loc">Burra</span> <span class="loc">Burra</span> Copper Mine was established in 1848 mining the copper deposit discovered in 1845. Miners and townspeople migrated to <span class="loc">Burra</span> primarily from <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span> and <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The mine first closed in 1877, briefly opened again early in the 20th century and for a last time from 1970 to 1981. When the mine was exhausted and closed the population shrank dramatically and the townships, for the next 100 years, supported pastoral and agricultural activities. Today the town continues as a centre for its surrounding farming communities and, being one of the best-preserved towns of the Victorian era in <span class="loc">Australia</span>, as a historic tourist centre.</p>
