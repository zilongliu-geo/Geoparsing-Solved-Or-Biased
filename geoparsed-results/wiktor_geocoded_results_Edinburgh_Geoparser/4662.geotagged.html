<p><span class="loc">Lee</span> (also <span class="loc">Lee Green</span>) is a suburban district of south east <span class="loc">London</span>, within the <span class="loc">London Boroughs</span> of <span class="loc">Lewisham</span> and <span class="loc">Greenwich</span>. It is located west of <span class="loc">Eltham</span> and south east of <span class="loc">Lewisham</span>. Until 1889 the district was in the <span class="loc">county of Kent</span>. St Margaret's Church (built 1839â€“41, architect: John Brown) is the burial place of three Astronomers Royal: Edmond Halley, Nathaniel Bliss and John Pond. The Manor of <span class="loc">Lee</span> was a historic parish of the <span class="loc">Blackheath</span> hundred and existed up to 1900 when it was merged with the <span class="loc">parish of Lewisham</span> to create the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Lewisham</span>. While modern <span class="loc">Lee</span> is centred on <span class="loc">Lee</span> railway station and the road of Burnt <span class="loc">Ash Hill</span>, the parish was based around <span class="loc">Lee</span> High Road which today stretches into the town centre of <span class="loc">Lewisham</span>. The River Quaggy formed much of the boundary between the two parishes, though at <span class="loc">Lee</span> Bridge (at the western end of <span class="loc">Lee</span> High Road) it is now almost completely hidden. The <span class="loc">Lee</span> Manor Society have produced a comprehensive history of the area. The Domesday Book describes <span class="loc">Lee</span> as a small area of cultivation set in extensive woodland. The earliest map available (Rocque's of 1740) shows a cluster of about a dozen houses around a triangular village green. This hamlet was surrounded by fields. <span class="loc">Lee</span> <span class="loc">Green Farm</span> occupied the south-east quadrant from the 1660s (roughly on the site of the present Leegate shopping centre). The farm was demolished in the 1840s and rebuilt as <span class="loc">Tudor House</span> further east.</p>
