  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kingswood</span> or <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> with <span class="loc">Burgh Heath</span> is a large village on the <span class="loc">North Downs</span> in the <span class="loc">Borough of Reigate and Banstead</span> in <span class="loc">Surrey</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Part of the <span class="loc">London</span> commuter belt, <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> is just to the east of the A217 separating it from <span class="loc">Tadworth</span> and has a railway station. <span class="loc">Burgh Heath</span> in its north is combined with it to form a ward. <span class="loc">Reigate</span> is 3.6 miles (5.8 km) south of its centre and <span class="loc">London</span> is 15.5 miles (24.9 km) to the north northeast. <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> with <span class="loc">Burgh Heath</span> had a population of 6,891 in <span class="date">2001</span>. The first specific reference to the land which later charters, parish, hundred and county maps state to be <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> is in the Domesday Book, where a passage in the entry for <span class="loc">Ewell</span> states that "2 hides and 1 virgate were removed from this manor; they were there before <span class="date">1066</span>, but reeves lent them to their friends; and 1 woodland pasture and 1 croft" - Ewell's Lords of the manor in <span class="date">1086</span> were Osbern of Eu (held of <span class="per">King William</span>) and <span class="per">King William</span> himself. <span class="per">Henry II</span> granted it with Shelwood much further detached, in the <span class="loc">Weald</span>, as parcel of the manor of <span class="loc">Ewell</span> to Merton Priory, who in <span class="date">1291</span> were given licence to inclose the wood of <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> as "it was their own soil and without the bounds of the royal hunting forest" â€“ see <span class="loc">Windsor Great Park</span>.</p><br><br>
