<p><span class="loc">Dazhai</span> (Chinese: 大寨; pinyin: Dàzhài; literally: "great outpost"), formerly romanized as Tachai or <span class="loc">Ta-chai</span>, is the name of a community of several hundred farmers in <span class="loc">Xiyang County</span> in <span class="loc">eastern Shanxi province</span>, chiefly known for Mao Zedong's directive, "Learn from <span class="loc">Dazhai</span> in agriculture" (农业学大寨), which set up <span class="loc">Dazhai</span> as the model for agricultural production throughout the <span class="loc">China</span> during the 1960s and ’70s, amid the Cultural Revolution. Numerous newspaper and magazine stories and books as well as films were published nationwide about how hard and diligently the villagers of <span class="loc">Dazhai</span> had worked to build the village into one with not only well-managed fields and bountiful crops, but engineering marvels such as amazing reservoirs and grandiose aqueducts crossing deep valleys for irrigation. They allegedly worked on their own on the principle of self-reliance, without any financial and technical support from the government. A number of songs about <span class="loc">Dazhai</span> were popular for a while, the best-known perhaps being Dazhai Yakexi (yakexi is the Mandarin transliteration of the Uyghur word meaning good or great), about a Uyghur farmer telling how happy he was after he visited <span class="loc">Dazhai</span>. The song was adapted to a dance in which a Uyghur male sang while six ladies accompanied him with dances in the Uyghur traditional style. Both the singer and the dancers were in clothing typical of the Uyghur nationality, which the Han Chinese people found aesthetically appealing.</p>
