<p>Clinton is a city in <span class="loc">Custer</span> and <span class="loc">Washita</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. The population was 9,033 at the 2010 census. The community began in 1899 when two men, J.L. Avant and E.E. Blake, decided to locate a town in the <span class="loc">Washita</span> River Valley. Because of governmental stipulations that an Indian could sell no more than one half of a 160-acre (0.6 km2) allotment, the men made plans to purchase 320 acres (1.3 km2) from four different Indians - Hays, Shoe-Boy, Nowahy, and Night Killer - and paid them each $2,000 for 80 acres (320,000 m2) to begin the small settlement of <span class="loc">Washita</span> Junction. Congressional approval for the sale was granted in 1902 and <span class="loc">Washita</span> Junction quickly developed. The first businesses were the office of the <span class="loc">Custer County</span> Chronicle newspaper and the <span class="loc">First National Bank</span> building. When a post office was started, the postal department would not accept the name of <span class="loc">Washita</span> Junction; so the town was named for the late Judge Clinton Irwin. Clinton was served by the Frisco Railroad. It was also the eastern terminus of the Clinton, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, and Western Railroad Company, which lay track westward to <span class="loc">Hemphill County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Once in <span class="loc">Hemphill County</span>, a second similarly-named railroad, the Clinton-Oklahoma-Western Railroad Company of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, joined with <span class="loc">Pampa</span> in <span class="loc">Gray County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Both of these companies were soon leased and purchased by the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway, which held them until disestablishment in 1965.</p>
