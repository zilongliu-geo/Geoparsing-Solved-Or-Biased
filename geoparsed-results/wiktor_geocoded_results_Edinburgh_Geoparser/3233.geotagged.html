<p>Hale is a small village and civil parish in <span class="loc">Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies on the border of the <span class="loc">New Forest</span>, overlooking the valley of the <span class="loc">River Avon</span>. The village is about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) north-east of the town of <span class="loc">Fordingbridge</span>, and about 8 miles (13 km) south of the <span class="loc">city of Salisbury</span>. Within the parish stands <span class="loc">Hale House</span>, a large 18th-century mansion which was the country house of architect Thomas Archer, who also rebuilt Hale church in 1717. Hale is a village to the northeast of <span class="loc">Fordingbridge</span> in an area of woodland, to the east of the <span class="loc">River Avon</span>. It is a scattered community with some thatched cottages around the green, a village hall, and a Victorian school building which still houses the primary school. At the centre of the village is <span class="loc">Hatchet Green</span>, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Conservation Area. It contains various tree species including oak, ash, birch, holly, lawson cypress, chestnut and hawthorn. It was taken over by the Parish Council in 1975 because no owner could be traced.</p>
