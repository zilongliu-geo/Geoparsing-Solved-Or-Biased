  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Angus</span> (Scottish Gaelic: Aonghas) is one of the 32 local government council areas of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, a registration county and a lieutenancy area. The council area borders <span class="loc">Aberdeenshire</span>, <span class="loc">Dundee City</span> and <span class="loc">Perth</span> and <span class="loc">Kinross</span>. Main industries include agriculture and fishing. Global pharmaceuticals company GSK has a significant presence in <span class="loc">Montrose</span> in the north of the county. <span class="loc">Angus</span> was historically a county, known officially as <span class="loc">Forfarshire</span> from the 18th century until <span class="date">1928</span>. It remains a registration county and a lieutenancy area. In <span class="date">1975</span> its administrative functions were transferred to the council district of the <span class="loc">Tayside Region</span>, and in <span class="date">1995</span> further reform resulted in the establishment of the unitary <span class="org">Angus Council</span>. The area that <span class="date">now</span> comprises <span class="loc">Angus</span> has been occupied since at least the Neolithic period. Material taken from postholes from an enclosure at <span class="loc">Douglasmuir</span>, near <span class="loc">Friockheim</span>, about five miles north of <span class="loc">Arbroath</span> has been radiocarbon dated to around <span class="date">3500 BC</span>. The function of the enclosure is unknown, but may have been for agriculture or for ceremonial purposes. Bronze age archaeology is to be found in abundance in the area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near <span class="loc">West Newbigging</span>, about a mile to the North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet. Iron Age archaeology is also well represented, for example in the souterrain nearby Warddykes cemetery and at <span class="loc">West Grange</span> of <span class="loc">Conan</span>, as well as the better-known examples at <span class="per">Carlungie</span> and <span class="per">Ardestie</span>.</p><br><br>
