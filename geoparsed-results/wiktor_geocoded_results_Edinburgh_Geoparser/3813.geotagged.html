<p>Beaconsfield is a city in <span class="loc">Ringgold County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 15 in the 2010 census, an increase from 11 in the 2000 census. In the 2000 census Beaconsfield had the dubious distinction of being the least populated incorporated city in <span class="loc">Iowa</span>; with the increase in the 2010 census it now shares that distinction with <span class="loc">Le Roy</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. Beaconsfield started when the <span class="loc">Humeston</span> and <span class="loc">Shenandoah Railroad</span> built a train station. In 1881 a town company laid it out as a village. A post office was established in 1882 and closed in 1993. The town was incorporated on January 18, 1990. The community was named after Lord Beaconsfield of England. The Hy-Vee grocery chain has its origin in the Beaconsfield Supply Store, a general store opened by Charles Hyde and David Vredenburg in 1930. That location is on the National Register of Historic Places. On May 23, 1981, a tornado touched down southwest of Beaconsfield for 15.9 miles. It was a category F2 tornado Beaconsfield's longitude and latitude are 40.807958, -94.050634. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.72 square miles (1.86 km2), all of it land.</p>
