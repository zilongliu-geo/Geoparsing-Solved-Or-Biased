<p><span class="loc">Soho</span> is an area on the borders of Central Birmingham and Smethwick, approximately 2 miles north west of <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> city centre on the A41. The name is an abbreviation of <span class="loc">South House</span>, denoting that it was located to the south of <span class="loc">Handsworth</span>. The section of the A41 separating <span class="loc">Handsworth</span> from <span class="loc">Winson Green</span> is known as <span class="loc">Soho</span> Road. <span class="loc">Soho</span> expanded dramatically during the 19th century with the construction of numerous houses and factories, and immigration from the Commonwealth was centred in these homes during the 1950s and 1960s. Most of the immigrants who settled in <span class="loc">Soho</span> were of Indian origin. Further housebuilding took place by the local council during the 1960s and 1970s. <span class="loc">Soho</span> falls partly in the <span class="loc">Soho ward</span> of the <span class="loc">City of Birmingham</span> and partly in the <span class="loc">Soho</span> and <span class="loc">Victoria ward</span> of the <span class="loc">Borough of Sandwell</span>. The 2001 Population Census found that 25,634 people were living in <span class="loc">Soho</span> with a population density of 5,369 people per km² compared with 3,649 people per km² for Birmingham. <span class="loc">Soho</span> covers an area of 4.8 km². The ward is a very ethnically diverse area with ethnic minorities making up 76.2% (19,522) of the ward's population, compared with 29.6% for Birmingham.</p>
