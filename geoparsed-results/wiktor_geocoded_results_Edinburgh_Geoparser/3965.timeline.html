Bratager</span> store building. <span class="per">James Montgomery</span> started a small grain elevator, and <span class="per">James Ramage</span> opened a lumber yard and hardware store under the management of Arch Priest. The <span class="org">Bank of Lismore</span> opened its doors on <span class="date">September 1, 1900</span>, and was incorporated as the <span class="loc">State Bank</span> of <span class="loc">Lismore</span> <span class="date">three months later</span>. A livery stable, a butcher shop, a restaurant, and a blacksmith shop were also opened in that first year.
