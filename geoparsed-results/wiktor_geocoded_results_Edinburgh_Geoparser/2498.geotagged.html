<p>Reading (/ˈrɛdɪŋ/ RED-ing) is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, 10 miles (16 km) north of central <span class="loc">Boston</span>. The population was 24,747 at the 2010 census. Many of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span>'s original settlers arrived from <span class="loc">England</span> in the 1630s through the ports of Lynn and Salem. In 1639 some citizens of Lynn petitioned the government of the colony for a "place for an inland plantation". They were initially granted six square miles, followed by an additional four. The first settlement in this grant was at first called "<span class="loc">Lynn</span> Village" and was located on the south shore of the "<span class="loc">Great Pond</span>", now known as <span class="loc">Lake Quannapowitt</span>. On June 10, 1644 the settlement was incorporated as the town of Reading, taking its name from the town of Reading in <span class="loc">England</span>. The first church was organized soon after the settlement, and the first parish, later known as "<span class="loc">South Reading</span>", became the separate town of <span class="loc">Wakefield</span> in 1868. Thomas Parker was one of the founders of Reading. He also was a founder of the 12th Congregational Church (now the First Parish Congregational Church), and served as deacon there. He was a selectman of Reading and was appointed a judicial commissioner. There is evidence that Parker was "conspicuous in naming the town" and that he was related to the Parker family of <span class="loc">Little Norton</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, who owned land by the name of Ryddinge.</p>
