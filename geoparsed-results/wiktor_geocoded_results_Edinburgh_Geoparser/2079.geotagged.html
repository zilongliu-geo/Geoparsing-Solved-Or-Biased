<p><span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span> is a township in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, along with the township of Concord, is located in the unorganized territory, Central Somerset. The population of Central Somerset was 336 as of the 2000 census. Originally called Gilman Pond Plantation, an attempted settlement was made in 1804 by Isaac Elder, but an early frost killed his garden and he moved to <span class="loc">New Portland</span>. In 1806 Elder's father-in-law, David Quint took over the farm, becoming the first permanent settler. Governor King, the proprietor of the town had three agents, David Quint, then Henry Morgan and finally Abraham Smith, who oversaw the sale of lands and operated his farm and mill in the township. King chose to name the new town Frazier, in honor of his wife, Anne Frazier of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, since <span class="loc">Kingfield</span> had been named for him. However, the settlers sent in another petition, changing the name to <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, in conjunction with Concord, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, which had been incorporated in 1826. The town of <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was incorporated in March of 1833.</p>
