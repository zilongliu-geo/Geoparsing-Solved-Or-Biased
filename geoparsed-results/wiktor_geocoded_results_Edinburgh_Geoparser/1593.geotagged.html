<p><span class="loc">Newton</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Harvey County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 19,132. <span class="loc">Newton</span> is located 25 miles (40 km) north of <span class="loc">Wichita</span>. The city of <span class="loc">North Newton</span> is located immediately north, existing as a separate political entity. For millennia, the land now known as <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, most of modern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was secured by the <span class="loc">United States</span> as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in 1861 <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In 1872, <span class="loc">Harvey County</span> was founded. In 1871, the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Railway extended a main line from Emporia westward to <span class="loc">Newton</span> by July 1871. The town soon became an important railroad shipping point of Texas cattle. The city was founded in 1871 and named after <span class="loc">Newton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, home of some of the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> stockholders. In August 1871, there was a Gunfight at Hide Park, in which a total of eight men were killed. The incident began with an argument between two local lawmen, Billy Bailey and Mike McCluskie. Because of this incident, <span class="loc">Newton</span> became known as "bloody and lawlessâ€”the wickedest city in the west.".</p>
