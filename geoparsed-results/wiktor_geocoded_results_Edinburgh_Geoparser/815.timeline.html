  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Lara is a residential Town, 18 km north-east of <span class="loc">Geelong</span>, inland from the Princes Freeway to <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. The explorers <span class="per">Hume</span> and <span class="per">Hovell</span> arrived at Lara on <span class="date">December 16, 1824</span>, believing that they had reached <span class="loc">Westernport</span> Bay. They recorded that the Aboriginals described the bay as Jullong and land as Corago, suggesting origins for the names of <span class="loc">Geelong</span> and <span class="loc">Corio</span>. The area was originally named Kennedy's Creek but was also given several different names including <span class="loc">Duck Ponds</span>, <span class="per">Hovell</span>'s Creek, Cheddar, <span class="loc">Swindon</span> and <span class="loc">Lara Lake</span>. The area of Lara was no more than a few farms at this time. The railway though the town was opened in <span class="date">1857</span> along with the local railway station, with several subdivisions then announced. A Post Office opened on <span class="date">1 March 1858</span> as <span class="loc">Duck Ponds</span>, renamed <span class="per">Hovell</span>'s Creek in <span class="date">1872</span>, and finally Lara in <span class="date">1884</span>. The population grew to a few hundred by <span class="date">1890</span>, and several facilities like schools and churches were built, but a municipal water supply was not completed until <span class="date">1947</span>. In <span class="date">January 1969</span>, 17 people were killed in bushfires which ravaged Lara. Most of the victims were trapped by the fast-moving grass fire while travelling on the Princes Highway.</p><br><br>
