  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Sale is a town in <span class="loc">Trafford</span>, <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically in <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>, it is on the south bank of the <span class="loc">River Mersey</span>, 1.9 miles (3.1 km) south of <span class="loc">Stretford</span>, 2.5 miles (4.0 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Altrincham</span>, and 5.2 miles (8.4 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Manchester</span>. In <span class="date">2001</span>, it had a population of 55,000 being measured at 134,122 in the <span class="date">2011</span> Census. <span class="org">Evidence of Stone Age</span>, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon activity has been discovered locally. In the Middle Ages, Sale was a rural township, linked ecclesiastically with neighbouring Ashton upon <span class="loc">Mersey</span>, whose fields and meadows were used for crop and cattle farming. By the 17th century, Sale had a cottage industry manufacturing garthweb, the woven material from which horses' saddle girths were made. The <span class="loc">Bridgewater Canal</span> reached the town in <span class="date">1765</span>, stimulating Sale's urbanisation. The arrival of the railway in <span class="date">1849</span> triggered Sale's growth as a commuter town for <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, leading to an influx of middle class residents; by the end of the 19th century the town's population had more than tripled. Agriculture gradually declined as service industries boomed.</p><br><br>
