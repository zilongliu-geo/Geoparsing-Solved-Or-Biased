  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Sterling</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The population was 7,808 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="org">Sterling</span> was first settled by Europeans in <span class="date">1720</span> and was officially incorporated in <span class="date">1781</span>. Previous to its incorporation it was "the Second Parish of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>," and was commonly called by a portion of its Indian name, Chocksett. The original Indian name of the area being Woonsechocksett. The land encompassing the <span class="loc">Chocksett region</span> was not originally included in the first land sold by the great Indian Chief <span class="per">Sholan</span> to the settlers of the <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> grant. However, <span class="per">Sholan</span>'s nephew <span class="loc">Tahanto</span> would eventually sell the Chocksett land to inhabitants of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> in <span class="date">1713</span>. The first white settlers arrived in Chocksett <span class="date">seven years later</span> in <span class="date">1720</span>, formerly inhabitants of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> proper. Among these first settlers were families such as <span class="loc">Beman</span>, <span class="loc">Sawyer</span>, <span class="loc">Houghton</span>, and <span class="loc">Osgood</span>; names reflected to <span class="date">this day</span> in the names of <span class="org">Sterling</span>'s oldest roads. <span class="date">A short time</span> after settlement, in <span class="date">1733</span>, the residents of the Chocksett area requested its own incorporation, separate from <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, due to the "great inconvenience" of a long distance to the church in Lancaster's center. This request was denied. However, by <span class="date">1780</span> the population of Chocksett was so numerous as to constitute a majority, and so the voters of the area voted out the existing <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> town officers and began to conduct town business and meetings in Chocksett. This was enough to convince the rest of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> that it was <span class="date">now</span> time for Chocksett, the Second Parish of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, to go its own way.</p><br><br>
