Shortly after the mid-nineteenth century Newburgh's growth leveled off until the economic boom of the 1960s and 70’s resulted in substantial growth as a bedroom community for families looking for new housing developments near <span class="loc">Evansville</span>. Today, <span class="loc">Newburgh</span> is locally known for its charming, historic downtown district that features a number of specialty stores, antique shops, and quaint dining establishments along its riverfront.
