  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">El Centro</span> is a city in and county seat of <span class="loc">Imperial County</span>, the largest city in the <span class="org">Imperial</span> Valley, east anchor of the Southern <span class="loc">California Border Region</span>, and the core urban area and principal city of the <span class="loc">El Centro</span> metropolitan area which encompasses all of <span class="loc">Imperial County</span>. <span class="loc">El Centro</span> is also the largest American city to lie entirely below sea level (-39 feet). The city, located in the far southeastern corner of California, is near the <span class="per">major Southern California</span> city of <span class="loc">San Diego</span> and the Mexican <span class="loc">city of Mexicali</span>. Founded in <span class="date">1906</span>, W. F. <span class="loc">Holt</span> and C.A. Barker purchased the land on which <span class="loc">El Centro</span> was eventually built for about $40 an acre and invested $100,000 in improvements. As one historian of valley life put it, "in only <span class="date">five months</span> <span class="loc">El Centro</span> went from a barley field to a city...". It is home to retail, transportation, wholesale, and agricultural industries. There are also two international border crossings nearby for commercial and noncommercial vehicles. The city's population was 42,598 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 37,835 in <span class="date">2000</span>.</p><br><br>
