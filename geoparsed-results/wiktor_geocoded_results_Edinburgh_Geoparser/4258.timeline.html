  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Croydon</span> is a suburb of <span class="per">Melbourne, Victoria</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 27 km east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>'s Central Business District. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Maroondah</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> Census, <span class="loc">Croydon</span> had a population of 23,553. Dating back to <span class="date">1840</span> the land was first utilised by settlers for grazing and the first road cut through the area <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Croydon</span>, was initially known as Sawmill Road, as a sawmill was nearby. Later it became known as Oxford Road and later Mt Dandenong Road, some time in <span class="date">the early 1900s</span>. Owing to the coarse silvery-white grass, the area <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Croydon</span> was first called "<span class="loc">White Flats</span>". The <span class="per">Lacey</span> family from <span class="loc">Essex</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> named the area <span class="loc">Croydon</span> after <span class="per">Mrs Lacey</span>'s home town. They preferred this to <span class="per">Mr Lacey</span>'s home town, <span class="loc">Steeple Bumpstead</span>. The <span class="per">Lacey</span> family has a street named after them near the Main St. shopping precinct. In <span class="date">1868</span> parcels of land were surveyed and the first habitations were constructed with wattle and daub. These were later rebuilt in timber and the area prospered in sheep, beef and dairy farming, and sawmills. Orchards were soon established and thrived. Crops included apples, cherries, pears, peaches and plums. Street names in and around <span class="loc">Croydon</span> <span class="date">now</span> reflect the impact orchards had on "<span class="loc">White Flats</span>".</p><br><br>
