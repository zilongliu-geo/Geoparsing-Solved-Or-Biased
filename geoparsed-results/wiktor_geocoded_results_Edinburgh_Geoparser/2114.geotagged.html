<p><span class="loc">Waterford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Saratoga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">US</span>. The population was 8,515 at the 2000 census. The name of the town is derived from its principal village, also called <span class="loc">Waterford</span>. The town and village are in the southeast corner of <span class="loc">Saratoga County</span>, and north-northwest of Troy, <span class="loc">New York</span>. The town is part of the Van Schaick land patent of 1687. The first settlement took place at the site of the current <span class="loc">Waterford</span> village, then called "<span class="loc">Half Moon Point</span>". The town was formed in 1816 by splitting the area of southeastern <span class="loc">Saratoga County</span> known as <span class="loc">Halfmoon</span> (anglicized from the Dutch name <span class="loc">Halve Maan</span>) into the town of <span class="loc">Halfmoon</span> and the town of <span class="loc">Waterford</span>. The village of <span class="loc">Waterford</span> is the oldest incorporated village in the <span class="loc">US</span>, having been incorporated in 1794, before the town was formed. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> has been host to "Canal Fest" and "Tugboat Roundup" celebrations for many years. The Northside Historic District, Ormsby-Laughlin Textile Companies Mill, <span class="loc">Peebles</span> (Peobles) Island, and Waterford Village Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, the canal tugboats Catawissa and Urger have received listings; although the first mentioned boat was scrapped in 2008, the second mentioned boat is permanently stationed in <span class="loc">Waterford</span> as an educational resource.</p>
