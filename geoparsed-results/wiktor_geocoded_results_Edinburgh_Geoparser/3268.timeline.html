  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pudong</span> is a <span class="loc">district of Shanghai</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>, located east of the <span class="loc">Huangpu</span> River across from the historic city center of Shanghai in <span class="loc">Puxi</span>. The name refers to its historic position as "The <span class="loc">East Bank</span>" of the <span class="loc">Huangpu</span> River, which flows through central Shanghai, although it is <span class="date">now</span> administered as the <span class="org">Pudong New Area</span>, a state-level new area which extends all the way to the <span class="loc">East China Sea</span>. The traditional area of <span class="loc">Pudong</span> is <span class="date">now</span> home to the <span class="org">Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone</span> and the <span class="org">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span> and many of Shanghai's best-known buildings, such as the Oriental Pearl Tower, the Jin Mao Tower, the <span class="org">Shanghai World Financial Center</span>, and the Shanghai Tower. These modern skyscrapers directly face Puxi's historic Bund, a remnant of a former foreign concessions in <span class="loc">China</span>. The rest of the new area includes the Shanghai <span class="per">Expo</span> and <span class="per">Century</span> Park, Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park, <span class="loc">Pudong</span> international airport, the Jiuduansha Wetland Nature Reserve, and a planned <span class="org">Disney</span> resort. Pudong—literally "The <span class="loc">East Bank</span> of the <span class="loc">Huangpu</span> River"—originally referred only to the less-developed land across from Shanghai's <span class="loc">Old City</span> and foreign concessions. The area was mainly farmland and only slowly developed, with warehouses and wharfs near the shore administered by the <span class="loc">districts of Puxi</span> on the west bank: <span class="loc">Huangpu</span>, <span class="loc">Yangpu</span>, and <span class="loc">Nanshi</span>. <span class="loc">Pudong</span> was originally established as a county in <span class="date">1958</span> until <span class="date">1961</span> which the county was split among <span class="loc">Huangpu</span>, <span class="loc">Yangpu</span>, <span class="loc">Nanshi</span>, <span class="loc">Wusong</span> and <span class="loc">Chuansha County</span>. In <span class="date">October 1, 1992</span> the original area of <span class="loc">Pudong County</span> and <span class="loc">Chuansha County</span> merged and established <span class="org">Pudong New Area</span>.</p><br><br>
