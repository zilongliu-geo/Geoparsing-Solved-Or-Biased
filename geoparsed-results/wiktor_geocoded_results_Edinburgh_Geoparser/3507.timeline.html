  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Clinton</span> (also known as <span class="loc">Port Clinton</span>) is a coastal township on <span class="loc">Yorke Peninsula</span>, <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. Located in the north west head of Gulf <span class="loc">St Vincent</span>, it is 130 km south of <span class="loc">Port Pirie</span> and 125 km from the <span class="loc">Adelaide city</span> centre. The first European occupiers were leaseholder pastoralists. In <span class="date">1854</span> in what is <span class="date">now</span> the northern parts of the Hundred of <span class="per">Clinton, W.</span> &amp; <span class="per">A. Rogers</span> leased 75 square miles at an annual rental of ten shillings per square mile. In <span class="date">1860</span>, near the centre of the <span class="per">Hundred, T.</span> &amp; W. Day leased twelve square miles. The Hundred of <span class="per">Clinton</span> was proclaimed on <span class="date">12 June 1862</span>, comprising 137 square miles. The port was surveyed that same year, with a jetty being erected in <span class="date">1863</span>. Surveys and closer settlement by farmers soon followed, along with land clearing of the mallee woodland. This was an important and busy port in the 1860s and 70s, being a transfer point for goods and passengers travelling between <span class="loc">Port Adelaide</span> and the copper mines at <span class="loc">Wallaroo</span> and <span class="loc">Moonta</span>. That was despite the shallowness of the beach, which closed the port to larger vessels during low tide. <span class="per">Clinton</span> began a gradual decline after <span class="date">1878</span> when the railway between <span class="per">Wallaroo</span> and <span class="per">Adelaide</span> was completed. The jetty was dismantled in <span class="date">1916</span>.</p><br><br>
