  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lafayette</span> is a census-designated place in the center of Deer Creek Township, <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located at 39°56′15″N 83°24′24″W, along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 40, just west of its intersection with <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 42. <span class="loc">Lawrenceville</span> (also known regionally as "Limerick") was laid out in <span class="date">1816</span>, by <span class="per">Thomas Gwynne</span>, on land he owned 1.5 miles (2.4 km) northwest of where <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> is located <span class="date">today</span>. In <span class="date">1816</span>, <span class="per">Angus Ross</span> opened Lawrenceville's first and only tavern. The <span class="org">Lawrenceville Post Office</span> was established on <span class="date">July 2, 1825</span>. In 1836-7, the National Road was completed through the township, missing <span class="loc">Lawrenceville</span>, and the town immediately began to die. By <span class="date">1915</span>, the original community was nothing more than pasture land, with no signs left to indicate there was ever a community. <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> was laid out on <span class="date">October 1, 1834</span>, by William Minter, and named in honor of <span class="per">Gilbert du Motier</span>, marquis de <span class="loc">Lafayette</span>. On <span class="date">December 31, 1836</span>, the <span class="org">Lawenceville Post Office</span> was moved to <span class="loc">Lafayette</span>, and renamed <span class="org">Lafayette Post Office</span>, with John Minter as the first postmaster of the new branch. As of <span class="date">1875</span>, the community contained one drug store, one dry goods and grocery store, and one blacksmith shop. The post office was discontinued on <span class="date">December 31, 1905</span>, with mail service going through the <span class="loc">London</span> branch. As of <span class="date">1915</span>, the community contained three general stores and one blacksmith shop.</p><br><br>
