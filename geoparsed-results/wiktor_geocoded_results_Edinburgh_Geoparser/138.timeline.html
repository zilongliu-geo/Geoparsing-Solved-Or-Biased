  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Candelaria</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Presidio County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with about 75 inhabitants. The town stands in the Chihuahuan Desert on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>, just across from the small Mexican town of <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="per">Antonio Del</span> <span class="org">Bravo</span>. The two towns were linked by a bridge across the river that enabled the inhabitants of <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> to buy groceries and supplies from <span class="loc">Candelaria</span>; some sent their children to school there. However, in <span class="date">2008</span> the bridge was controversially removed by the <span class="loc">US</span> Border Patrol because of concerns that it had become, in the words of Border Patrol chief <span class="per">John Smietana</span>, "a route for terrorists, drug traffickers and illegals." It is unclear when <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> was founded, but the area was occupied by Native Americans before farmers began to grow crops on the irrigated floodplain of the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>. It was known initially as <span class="loc">Gallina</span> ("chicken" in Spanish) before being renamed as <span class="loc">Candelaria</span>. In <span class="date">1868</span>, an entrepreneur named <span class="per">William Russell</span> came to the area to establish a farm worked by the local people, selling the grain to the <span class="org">US Army</span> at <span class="loc">Fort Davis</span> and Fort Stockton. Cotton was also grown locally. With the town's population increasing steady, it became the seat of one of <span class="loc">Presidio County</span>'s three school districts in <span class="date">1893</span>. By <span class="date">1911</span> it had grown to two stores, a church and a school, with 307 pupils in the school district and a general population of 1,842, though only a minority of these actually lived in the town.</p><br><br>
