  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Savannah</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hardin County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Hardin County</span> and had a population of 6,917 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="loc">Savannah</span> hosted the NAIA college football national championship game from <span class="date">1996</span>-<span class="date">2007</span>, and is home to several places of historical significance, including the <span class="org">Cherry Family Mansion</span> and apparently the resting place of the "22nd official(ly) Certified <span class="org">Mainstreet Community</span>" in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The city's original name was Rudd's Ferry, named for James Rudd, an early settler who established a ferry at the site in the early 1820s. Rudd's Ferry was later purchased by a wealthy landowner, <span class="per">David Robinson</span>. The town was renamed "<span class="loc">Savannah</span>" after <span class="loc">Savannah</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, the hometown of Rudd's wife, <span class="per">Elizabeth</span>. <span class="loc">Hardin County</span> was the site of the <span class="date">1862</span> Battle of <span class="loc">Shiloh</span> (also known as the "Battle of <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> Landing") during the Civil War. This battleground site is just south of the town of <span class="loc">Savannah</span>. Union General <span class="per">Ulysses S. Grant</span> commandeered the <span class="org">Cherry</span> Mansion just off the town square for use as a headquarters during the battle.</p><br><br>
