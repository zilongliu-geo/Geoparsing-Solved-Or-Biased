<p><span class="loc">Norfolk</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with a population of 11,227 people at the 2010 census. Formerly known as <span class="loc">North Wrentham</span>, <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> broke away to become an independent town in 1870. <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> is a rural suburban town on the periphery of metropolitan <span class="loc">Boston</span>, located on an upper valley of the <span class="loc">Charles River</span>. There were a half dozen small farms in the town after 1669, the result of a determined effort to populate the colonial frontier. This was seen as a difficult task despite the good agricultural lands, fresh water fishing and fish runs because the settlement was so remote. It was abandoned during King Philip's War, and when <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> was reestablished, settlers relied on agriculture and cattle grazing with some considerable lumbering and planting of orchards. After 1812, three cotton manufacturing companies were established at <span class="loc">Stony Brook</span>, and later in the 19th century George Campbell's paper mill was opened at <span class="loc">Highland Lake</span> making heavy wrapping and building papers.The town saw a rapid increase in population after 1925 when a hospital and a state prison were built in <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> on the <span class="loc">Walpole</span> line. Major residential development took place before 1940 in the <span class="loc">Pondville</span> and Clark Streets section of town with scattered new housing along Seekonk and Main Streets, and suburban residential building has continued since.</p>
