<p><span class="loc">Arabi</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Bernard Parish, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies on the eastern bank of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River, between the Lower 9th Ward of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> and Chalmette within the Greater <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> metropolitan area. The population was 8,093 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Arabi</span> was established in the 19th century as a suburb of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>, along the east bank of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. <span class="loc">Arabi</span> was part of <span class="loc">Orleans Parish</span>, however, a law passed in the 1880s stated that slaughterhouses could not be located within the City of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. An 1851 map calls the area <span class="loc">Jacksonburgh</span>, a name believe to be derived from Andrew Jackson. <span class="loc">Arabi</span> began as the community known as <span class="loc">Stockyard</span> Landing, because of the many stockyards and slaughterhouses located there. In the rear yards of some of houses in Old Arabi, there are remnants of blood traps from the area. When excavation for swimming pools was done, residents found dishes from <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> hotels and restaurants whose table scraps were once used to feed animals. Business interests of the stockyards wanted to be free from control of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> and persuaded the state of <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> to transfer dominion of the area to downriver St. Bernard parish.</p>
