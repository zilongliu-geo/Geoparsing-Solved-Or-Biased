  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lowell</span> is the westernmost town in <span class="loc">Orleans County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 738 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. Budget - $1,199,600 Principal - <span class="org">Anita Gagner School Board Members</span> - <span class="per">Steven Mason</span>, Chair - <span class="per">Laurie Pion</span>, Member - <span class="per">Kevin Hodgeman</span>, Member <span class="per">Lowell Graded</span> School offers Pre-K - 8. There are 119 students. 56 students from <span class="per">Lowell</span> attend North Country Union High School. Circa <span class="date">400 million years ago</span>, large and slow moving upheavals formed the serpentine rock and the asbestos fiber which sometimes accompanies serpentine. This serpentine comprises Brown's Ledges at the Lowell-Westfield border. <span class="date">Today</span>, a rare fern species, Adiantum viridimontanum, grows there which can tolerate the high nickel content of serpentine. Serpentine also contains iron, so much so that some rocks can be magnetized. This affects where cell towers can be placed in town. The iron oxide gives the color brown to "Brown's Ledges." The major <span class="loc">Baie Verte</span> fault line runs through <span class="per">Lowell</span>. The Burgess branch of the river follows the fault with serpentine rocks on one side and nonserpentine rocks on the other.</p><br><br>
