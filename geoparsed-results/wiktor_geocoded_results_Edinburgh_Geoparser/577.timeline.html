  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Milton /ˈmɪltən/ is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Lafayette Parish</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>. Milton is part of the <span class="loc">Lafayette Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is unknown when the village of Milton was first settled. Old land claims show that much of the town is on land once owned by <span class="per">Bernard</span>, son of <span class="per">Ashnoya</span>, a chief of the Attakapas Indians. The area served as a river crossing and a trade center for the farms and cattle ranches that lined both sides of the <span class="loc">Vermilion River</span>. The earliest settlers were Acadian families. Early Acadian landowners in the area included <span class="per">Francois Broussard</span>, son of <span class="per">Joseph Broussard</span> dit <span class="loc">Beausoleil</span>; <span class="per">Jean Bernard</span>; <span class="per">Pierre Vincent</span>; Michel Meaux; <span class="per">Jean-Baptiste</span> Trahan; and <span class="per">Joseph Boudreaux</span>. Jean-Jacques Denais operated a ferry at the townsite in the early 19th century. Désiré <span class="per">Broussard</span> and <span class="per">Jean-Baptiste</span> <span class="loc">Montet</span> settled there by <span class="date">1823</span>. Anselm Thibodeaux, who settled on land on the east bank of the river, cultivated it for <span class="date">at least 20 years</span> prior to the Louisiana Purchase in <span class="date">1803</span>. Anselm's Coulee, named for him, runs through the area. Beausoleil <span class="per">Broussard</span>'s descendants <span class="loc">Eloi</span> <span class="per">Broussard</span> and <span class="per">Darmas</span> <span class="per">Broussard</span> owned and operated a store during the steamboat era. They built a two-story home on the east side of the river in the late 1880s. The home stands at a bridge there <span class="date">today</span>. A ferry operated at the Milton site probably as early as <span class="date">1820</span>. At the <span class="date">December 14, 1897</span>, meeting of the Vermilion Parish Police Jury, it was suggested that a bridge be built across the river there. That bridge was dedicated on <span class="date">February 2, 1902</span>. The present bridge was built in <span class="date">1948</span>.</p><br><br>
