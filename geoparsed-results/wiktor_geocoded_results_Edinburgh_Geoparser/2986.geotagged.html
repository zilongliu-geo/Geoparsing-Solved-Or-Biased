<p><span class="loc">Acton</span> is a small village and civil parish lying immediately west of the town of <span class="loc">Nantwich</span> in the unitary authority of <span class="loc">Cheshire</span> East and the ceremonial <span class="loc">county of Cheshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The civil parish also includes the small settlement of Dorfold and part of <span class="loc">Burford</span>, with a total population of a little over 300, increasing to 404 at the 2011 Census. It is administered jointly with the adjacent civil <span class="loc">parishes of Henhull and Edleston</span>. Historically, <span class="loc">Acton</span> refers to a township and also to an ancient parish in the <span class="loc">Nantwich</span> Hundred covering a wide area to the west of <span class="loc">Nantwich</span>. The area is agricultural, with dairy farming the main industry. Around a third of the area falls within the Dorfold Estate. Historically, agriculture was the major employer, but it has now been overtaken by the service industries, with many residents commuting significant distances outside the parish to work. The civil parish is believed to have been inhabited since the 8th or 9th century. It contains many historic buildings, including two listed at grade I: <span class="loc">Dorfold Hall</span> was considered by Nikolaus Pevsner to be one of the two finest Jacobean houses in <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>, while St Mary's Church has a tower dating from the 13th century, one of the earliest in the county.</p>
