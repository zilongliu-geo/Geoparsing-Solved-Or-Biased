  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> (English /ˌpɔːrtə ˈriːkoʊ/ or /ˌpwɛərtə ˈriːkoʊ/; Spanish: [ˈpweɾto ˈriko], locally also [ˈpwelto ˈχiko; ˈʀ̥iko]), officially the Commonwealth of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>, literally the "Associated <span class="loc">Free State</span> of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>"), is a <span class="loc">United States</span> territory located in the northeastern Caribbean. <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> is an archipelago that includes the main island of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> and a number of smaller islands. The capital and most populous municipality is <span class="loc">San Juan</span>. The territory does not observe daylight saving time, and its official languages are Spanish, which is predominant, and English. The island's population is approximately 3.4 million. <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>'s rich history, tropical climate, diverse natural scenery, renowned traditional cuisine and attractive tax incentives make it a popular destination for visitors from around the world. Its location in the Caribbean, combined with <span class="date">centuries</span> of colonization and subsequent migration, has made Puerto Rican culture a distinct melting pot of Amerindian, Spanish, African, and North American influences. Originally populated by the aboriginal Taíno people, the island was claimed in <span class="date">1493</span> by <span class="per">Christopher Columbus</span> for the <span class="loc">Kingdom of Spain</span>, enduring several invasion attempts by the French, Dutch, and British. During <span class="date">the four centuries</span> of Spanish rule, the island's cultural and physical landscapes were transformed, with European knowledge, customs, and traditions being introduced, especially Roman Catholicism and the Spanish language. In <span class="date">1898</span>, following the Spanish–American War, <span class="loc">Spain</span> ceded the island to the <span class="loc">United States</span> under the terms of the Treaty of <span class="loc">Paris</span>.</p><br><br>
