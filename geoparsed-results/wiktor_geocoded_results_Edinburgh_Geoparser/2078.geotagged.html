<p>Lexington, <span class="loc">California</span>, is a ghost town in Santa <span class="loc">Clara County</span>, now submerged by the <span class="loc">Lexington</span> Reservoir. Originally located along <span class="loc">Los Gatos</span> Creek, the town was 550 feet above sea level. Lexington started out as a sawmill built in 1848 by Isaac Branham and Julian Jank. Zachariah "Buffalo" <span class="loc">Jones</span> bought the mill for $3000 and laid out a town called "<span class="loc">Jones</span> Mill". In 1860 John P. Hennings bought some of the property and changed the name to <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, after his home town of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. Lexington was a stop on the stagecoach route from <span class="loc">Los Gatos</span> to <span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span>. In the 1860s, the saw mills moved up into the hills and Lexington began to lose importance. In 1880, a narrow gauge railroad from <span class="loc">Los Gatos</span> to <span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span> was completed, bypassing Lexington and accelerating its decline; its post office had already been transferred to Alma, a mile south, where the trains stopped and which was the transfer point to stagecoaches until the line was completed. The railroad ceased operations in March 1940, following major damage by a winter storm and the completion of State Route 17 that same year. When the <span class="loc">Lexington</span> Reservoir was created in 1952, both Lexington and Alma were officially abandoned and SR 17 was rerouted to its present location. The visible ruins under <span class="loc">Lexington</span> Reservoir are actually those of Alma, not Lexington; building foundations and original pavements of roads are sometimes visible during droughts.</p>
