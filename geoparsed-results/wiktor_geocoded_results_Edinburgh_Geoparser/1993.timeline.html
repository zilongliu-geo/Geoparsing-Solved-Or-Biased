  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Lodi /ˈloʊ.daɪ/ LOH-dye is a city in <span class="loc">Columbia County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,050 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Lodi</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Madison Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="per">Isaac Palmer</span> founded the village of <span class="loc">Lodi</span> in <span class="date">1846</span> in what was then the Pleasant Valley Precinct of the <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> Territory. He named it after <span class="loc">Lodi</span>, in <span class="loc">Italy</span>. Palmer chose this glaciated valley as the location for the village because of its water power potential. <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span> powered a sawmill <span class="date">that year</span> and a grist mill followed in <span class="date">1850</span>. Lodi School Hillside Improvement Site Lodi is located at 43°18′51″N 89°31′51″W (43.314296, −89.530994). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.77 square miles (4.58 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span>, which runs from the Lodi marsh through downtown <span class="loc">Lodi</span> and empties into <span class="loc">Lake Wisconsin</span>, is a local spring-fed brown trout stream. Portions of the creek do not freeze over the <span class="date">winter</span> and thus serve as host to brown trout and waterfowl, particularly mallards. <span class="loc">Lodi</span> has adopted <span class="date">this Spring</span> Creek resident, which the residents have named "Susie the Duck", as a mascot.</p><br><br>
