  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Ely</span> (/ˈiːli/ EE-lee) is a city in Saint <span class="loc">Louis County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,460 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is located on the <span class="per">Vermilion Iron</span> Range, and is historically home to several iron ore mines. <span class="date">Today</span> the <span class="loc">city of Ely</span> is best known as a popular entry point for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness; the International <span class="org">Wolf Center</span>, and the North American Bear Center. The main street of <span class="per">Ely</span> is lined with outfitters, outdoor clothing stores, and restaurants. State Highway 1 (MN 1), State Highway 169 (MN 169) and County Road 21 (Central Avenue) are the main routes in <span class="per">Ely</span>. The first Europeans to explore the area were fur traders who made their way into the wilderness in search of furs. But it was the Lake Vermillion gold rush that brought the first large numbers of pioneers to the area in <span class="date">1865</span>. Although hardly any gold was ever found, it was discovered that the area did contain large deposits of iron ore. Thousands of new immigrants were arriving in <span class="loc">America</span> at that time, and many of them came to the area later to be known as the <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> Iron Range, looking for work. When the <span class="loc">Duluth</span>, <span class="per">Missabe</span> and <span class="per">Iron</span> Range Railway laid tracks extending the rails from Tower to <span class="per">Ely</span> in <span class="date">1888</span>, <span class="per">Ely</span> began mining operations with the opening of the Chandler Mine, shipping the ore to docks on <span class="loc">Lake Superior</span> in <span class="loc">Two Harbors</span> and <span class="loc">Duluth</span>. <span class="date">That year</span> the miners incorporated the town of <span class="loc">Florence</span>, population 177, near the east side of <span class="loc">Shagawa Lake</span> on a site <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Spaulding</span>. The miners named their settlement <span class="loc">Florence</span> after the daughter of the Chandler mine’s <span class="per">Captain Jack Pengilly</span> (also the town’s first mayor). But the community moved after ore was discovered farther west, and it changed its name as well. Since it was found that the name “Florence” was already taken by another <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> village, “<span class="per">Ely</span>” was chosen in honor of mining executive <span class="per">Samuel B. Ely</span>, a big promoter of Vermilion Range ore who lived in <span class="loc">Michigan</span> (and never actually visited the town that bears his name).</p><br><br>
