  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A Midland, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span> newspaper office was shut down briefly due a suspicious letter with white powder. When the envelope was opened at the Midland Daily News offices around <span class="date">17:00 GMT Tuesday</span>, the presence of powder aroused alarm the envelope might contain the deadly disease anthrax. The news office, along with restaurants and businesses near the downtown newspaper were quarantined as a safety precaution shortly after authorities were alerted. On-site tests found no evidence of anthrax, and the letter has been sent to <span class="loc">Lansing</span> for additional tests. Around 20:30 GMT, the office was reopened and all quarantines were lifted. A mail-sorting machine is being tested, and has been removed from the local post office for further tests. The envelope did contain a return address, according to local news station WNEM-TV 5. The editor's office was closed <span class="date">Tuesday night</span>, and sealed off as a crime scene.</p><br><br>
