<p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is the capital and chief settlement of <span class="loc">Ascension Island</span>, <span class="loc">Saint Helena</span>, <span class="loc">Ascension</span>, and <span class="loc">Tristan da Cunha</span>, situated on the west coast of the island. The town is centred on St Mary's Church, part of the <span class="loc">Anglican Diocese</span> of <span class="loc">St Helena</span> and the former Exiles Club, built as a Royal Marines barracks at the time of Napoleon's exile to <span class="loc">Saint Helena</span> in the early 19th century. The town is named after King George III, who reigned at the time the island was claimed for <span class="loc">Britain</span> and garrisoned by the Admiralty in 1815. As well as the church, there is a pier, an athletics track, a small supermarket, Royal Mail post office, snackbar, hotel, police station, hospital, dental surgery and a library. There is no school however and pupils travel to Two Boats village, 3 miles inland. A naval base was established at <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> in 1816 due to British concerns that the French might make use of the island to attempt a rescue of their exiled former Emperor. Following Napoleon's death in 1821, the settlement found a new role as a supply, maintenance and victualling base for the <span class="loc">West Africa Squadron</span>. Local tufa was used for building, but everything else had to be imported (including seeds, vegetables and fruit trees, all of which were cultivated on <span class="loc">Green Mountain</span> to supplement the locally-available diet of turtle meat). By 1829 a small jetty had been constructed as well as several buildings on what is now the Regent Square area, close to the sea (including a hospital - the <span class="loc">West Africa Squadron</span> was notoriously prone to sickness).</p>
