<p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Skagit County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population is 8,388 as recorded by the 2010 census. It is included in the Mount Vernonâ€“Anacortes, <span class="loc">Washington Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> began as a logging camp, established by John P. Millett and William McKay, in 1882. It was officially incorporated on June 16, 1902. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is locally famous for its proliferation of shopping malls and for having some of the best youth sports fields in <span class="loc">Washington</span>. In 2007, the city opened a new library  and city hall. Originally, Burlington's businesses were centered around Fairhaven Avenue. Today, Fairhaven Avenue is the center of Burlington's old downtown, and provides a gathering place for the whole city during the annual summer Berry Dairy Days. Berry Dairy Days was originally simply known as the Strawberry Festival, and served as a fundraiser for the town's fire department for many years. A 1954 article described a gigantic strawberry shortcake that was the centerpiece of that year's festival: it consisted of 60 sheets of sponge cake that took 12 hours to bake, and claimed to be the largest strawberry shortcake in the world.</p>
