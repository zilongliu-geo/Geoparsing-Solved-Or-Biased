  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Chandler</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. and is part of the <span class="loc">Oklahoma City</span> Metropolitan Area. The population was 3,100 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, an increase from 2,842 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="per">Chandler</span> is located northeast of <span class="loc">Oklahoma City</span> on SH-66 and I-44, and north of <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> on SH-18. <span class="per">Chandler</span> was named after Judge <span class="per">George Chandler</span>, a member of Congress and Assistant Secretary of the Interior. The site of <span class="per">Chandler</span> was opened by a land run on <span class="date">September 28, 1891</span>. The town had been planned to be opened on <span class="date">September 22</span>, (the date of the Land Run of <span class="date">1891</span>) but the site survey had not been completed. The <span class="org">Chandler Post Office</span> had opened <span class="date">September 21</span>, the day before the planned run.

In <span class="date">1891</span> the county government operated out of an office building until the original courthouse was built. The courthouse was destroyed by the tornado of <span class="date">1897</span>, and a two-story frame building was erected as a temporary courthouse was erected on the present site. This building was removed in <span class="date">1907</span> to make way for a stone courthouse. This third courthouse burned down on <span class="date">December 23, 1967</span> and the current courthouse was set in its place.</p><br><br>
