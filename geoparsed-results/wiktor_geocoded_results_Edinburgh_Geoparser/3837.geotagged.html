<p><span class="loc">Lampang</span>, also called <span class="loc">Nakhon Lampang</span> (Thai: นครลำปาง, pronounced [náʔkʰɔːn lampaːŋ]) to differentiate from <span class="loc">Lampang Province</span>, is the third largest town in northern <span class="loc">Thailand</span> and capital of <span class="loc">Lampang Province</span> and the <span class="loc">Lampang</span> district. Traditional names for <span class="loc">Lampang</span> include <span class="loc">Wiang</span> Lakon and Khelang <span class="loc">Nakhon</span>. The city is still growing rapidly as trading and transportation center. It offers much of the historic interest of <span class="loc">Lanna</span> as well as <span class="loc">Chiang Mai</span>, but without the overt commercialization. In the heart of the north, <span class="loc">Lampang</span> is also a good base for excursions and travel within northern <span class="loc">Thailand</span>. <span class="loc">Lampang</span> lies 601 km north of <span class="loc">Bangkok</span> and 101 km south-east of <span class="loc">Chiang Mai</span>. <span class="loc">Lampang city</span> is in the valley of the <span class="loc">Wang River</span>, bordered by the Khun Tan Range on the west and the Phi Pan Nam Range on the east. The river, a major tributary of the <span class="loc">Chao Phraya</span>, flows through the city. The city lies mainly on the south side of <span class="loc">Wang River</span>, although the old parts of the city had been originally developed in the north side of it. Nowadays, the downtown of <span class="loc">Lampang</span> has grown in the south-east of the river along Bunyawat and Pahon <span class="loc">Yothin</span> Roads, and the main roads of the city are lined by dense commercial and residential buildings.</p>
