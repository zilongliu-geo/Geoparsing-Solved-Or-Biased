Since the Central District is mostly comprised by the city of <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span>, they are often treated interchangeably. The city of <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> still maintains its traditional feel of a typical Costa Rican town with its small stores, bars, restaurants offering local and international cuisine and <span class="date">Sunday</span> fresh fruit and vegetable markets. Nonetheless, <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> has been recently experiencing real estate and commercial development unprecedented in the entire Central Valley. It has become the place of choice with upscale grocery stores, gourmet restaurants, banks, gas stations, medical and dental clinics, beauty salons, coffee houses, hotels, private schools, and small commercial centers springing up everywhere. The city itself is within a few minutes of the surging business locale of <span class="loc">Lindora</span>, in the <span class="loc">Pozos district</span>, adding to the availability of commercial, lodging and residential areas.</p><br><br>
