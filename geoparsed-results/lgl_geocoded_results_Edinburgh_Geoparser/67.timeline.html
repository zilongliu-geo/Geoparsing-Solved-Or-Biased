  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Semi left in <span class="loc">Niota</span>, but not the trailer full of whiskey. Police reports from <span class="loc">Nashville</span> describe a poor quality video showing a black man wearing a blue shirt first break into a truck before hooking it up to a red cargo trailer and driving away. He cut a lock on the front gate where the truck and trailer were being stored and drove off into the night. <span class="org">Carver</span> responded and determined that it was the truck stolen in <span class="loc">Nashville</span>. However, the trailer and its contents were nowhere around. Metro Nashville police records state the trailer is painted red, 40 feet long, with the word "<span class="org">Hyundai</span>" painted its on sides. According to reports, there were 1,064 cases of <span class="per">Jack Daniel</span>'s whiskey, along with 1,028 cases of various other whiskeys, inside the trailer which was scheduled to be shipped to <span class="loc">Miami</span>.</p><br><br>
