<p><span class="loc">Bolivar</span> is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 10,325. <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> began as a settlement around Keeling Spring, with the majority of settlers being from <span class="loc">Hardeman County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The settlement became part of <span class="loc">Greene County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> when that county was organized in 1833. After the northern part of <span class="loc">Greene County</span> was ceded to form <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, the Polk County Court proclaimed the settlement as a city, named it <span class="loc">Bolivar</span>, and designated it as the county seat on 10 November 1835. <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> was re-organized as a fourth-class city 15 February 1881. <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> experienced growth in 1884 when the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway was extended to that point. The name <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> was proposed by John Polk Campbell and his brothers William St. Clair and Ezekiel Madison. The name is after <span class="loc">Bolivar</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> where their grandfather and Continental Army Colonel Ezekiel Polk had lived. In the 1830s, both <span class="loc">Polk</span> and <span class="loc">Bolivar</span> were names locally associated with liberation. As such, <span class="loc">Bolivar</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> is an indirect namesake of Simón Bolívar.</p>
