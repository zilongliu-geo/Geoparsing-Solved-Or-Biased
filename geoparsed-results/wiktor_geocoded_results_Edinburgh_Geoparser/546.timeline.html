  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hastings</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, the county seat of <span class="loc">Barry County</span> as well as the county's only city. The population was 7,350 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city borders <span class="per">Hastings</span> <span class="org">Charter</span> Township on the north, east, and south, and Rutland Charter Township on the west. <span class="per">Hastings</span> is part of the Grand <span class="loc">Rapids-Wyoming metropolitan</span> area. In <span class="date">1836</span> three entrepreneurs named Dibble, <span class="per">Kingsbury</span> and <span class="per">Kendall</span> bought 480 acres (1.9 km2) along the <span class="loc">Thornapple</span> River from <span class="loc">Detroit</span> banker <span class="loc">Eurotas</span> <span class="per">P. Hastings</span>. The three platted the area into lots, and soon a small community arose. In <span class="date">1843</span>, the state legislature designated <span class="per">Hastings</span> as the County Seat of <span class="loc">Barry County</span>. The first paper, the <span class="loc">Barry County</span> <span class="org">Pioneer</span>, began publishing in <span class="date">1851</span>, and a second paper, the Republican Banner, began in <span class="date">1856</span>. The latter publication, a weekly paper published on Thursdays, continues to be published as the <span class="per">Hastings</span> Banner. <span class="per">Hastings</span> was incorporated as a village in <span class="date">1855</span>, with a population of around 300, and on <span class="date">March 11, 1871</span>, <span class="per">Hastings</span> officially become a city. The <span class="loc">Barry County</span> Courthouse, which is still in use <span class="date">today</span>, was built in <span class="date">1893</span>. The city grew slowly, reaching 6,500 people in <span class="date">1960</span> and remaining nearly flat through <span class="date">1990</span>.</p><br><br>
