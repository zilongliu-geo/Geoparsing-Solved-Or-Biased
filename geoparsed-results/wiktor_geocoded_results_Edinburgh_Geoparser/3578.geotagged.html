<p><span class="loc">Liberia</span> /laɪˈbɪəriə/, officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Liberia</span>, is a country on the West African coast. <span class="loc">Liberia</span> means "Land of the Free" in Latin. It is bordered by <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span> to its west, <span class="loc">Guinea</span> to its north and <span class="loc">Ivory Coast</span> to its east. It covers an area of 111,369 square kilometres (43,000 sq mi) and is home to 4,503,000 people. English is the official language and over 20 indigenous languages are spoken, representing the numerous tribes who make up more than 95% of the population. Forests on the coastline are composed mostly of salt-tolerant mangrove trees, while the more sparsely populated inland has forests opening onto a plateau of drier grasslands. The climate is equatorial, with significant rainfall during the May–October rainy season and harsh harmattan winds the remainder of the year. <span class="loc">Liberia</span> possesses about forty percent of the remaining Upper Guinean rainforest. It was an important producer of rubber in the early 20th century. The <span class="loc">Republic of Liberia</span>, beginning as a settlement of the American Colonization Society (ACS), declared its independence on July 26, 1847. The <span class="loc">United States</span> did not recognize <span class="loc">Liberia</span>'s independence until during the American Civil War on February 5, 1862. Between January 7, 1822 and the American Civil War, more than 15,000 freed and free-born Black Americans from <span class="loc">United States</span> and 3,198 Afro-Caribbeans relocated to the settlement. The Black American settlers carried their culture with them to <span class="loc">Liberia</span>. The Liberian constitution and flag were modeled after the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In January 3, 1848 Joseph Jenkins Roberts, a wealthy free-born Black American from Virginia who settled in <span class="loc">Liberia</span>, was elected as <span class="loc">Liberia</span>'s first president after the people proclaimed independence.</p>
