<p>Canada's Food Inspection Agency has confirmed that a cow in <span class="loc">British Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or "mad cow disease". Officials announced on Friday that initial tests done on the purebred six-year-old dairy <span class="loc">Holstein</span> had come back inconclusive. The cow was found in <span class="loc">Fraser</span> Valley, a farming community near <span class="loc">Vancouver</span>, <span class="loc">British Columbia</span>. Officials also say that the beef supply is safe because none of the infected cows had made it to the human food chain. "This finding does not affect the safety of Canadian beef. Tissues in which BSE is known to concentrate in infected animals are removed from all cattle slaughtered in <span class="loc">Canada</span> for domestic and international human consumption. No part of this animal entered the human food or animal feed systems," said agency officials in a statement on Sunday. "This animal, a six-year-old dairy cow, developed BSE after the implementation of <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s feed ban. Investigators will pay particular attention to the feed to which the animal may have been exposed early in its life, when cattle are most susceptible to BSE. The CFIA is collecting records of feed purchased by and used on the animal's birth farm," the statement continued. However, the <span class="loc">United States</span> does not believe a ban on Canadian beef will come immediately. "Information gathered through this investigation will help us to determine what, if any, impact this should have on our beef and live cattle trade with <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Based on the information currently available, I do not anticipate a change in the status of our trade," said <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns. This is <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s fifth confirmed case of the disease since May 2003, and officials have tested more than 100,000 cows since the first case of the disease turned up in <span class="loc">Alberta</span>. This is the second cow to test positive for the disease this year. At least 150 people worldwide have died from eating beef contaminated with the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a nerve disease that is usually fatal. Most of the deaths occurred in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>.</p>
