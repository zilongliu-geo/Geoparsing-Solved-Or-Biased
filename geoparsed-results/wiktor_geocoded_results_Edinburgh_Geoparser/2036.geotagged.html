<p><span class="loc">Union County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 21,356. The county seat is <span class="loc">Blairsville</span>. Its Sole commissioner is Lamar Paris, who has served since 2001. <span class="loc">Union County</span> was carved from <span class="loc">Cherokee County</span> territory during the <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Land Lottery of 1832. Originally inhabited by Native Americans, the area became more desirable to white settlers with the discovery of gold in the 1820s. The Union Party, a political group that supported removing the Indians and opening the area to white settlers, is the probable inspiration for the countyâ€™s name. Upon entering the town of <span class="loc">Blairsville</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, one can see a plaque crediting John Thomas (former Justice of the Inferior Court and serving <span class="loc">Union County</span> in the Georgia House of Representatives in 1833) for giving the county the name of Union. When asked to suggest a name, he is reported to have said, "Name it Union, for none but union-like men reside in it." Since the county was founded almost 30 years before the U.S. Civil War, <span class="loc">Union County</span> obviously was not named in sympathy for the North, as is sometimes thought. County residents, however, were largely pro-Union in the years leading up to the war, as was true of much of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>'s mountainous north, and the county's delegates to the state convention of 1861 voted against secession. When the state seceded, most <span class="loc">Union County</span> residents supported the Confederacy, and the majority of its Civil War soldiers fought on the Confederate side, although a significant minority fought for the Union. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the county's memorial to its generations of war dead may be the only one in the South that specifically includes homage to Union soldiers and to American Indians who fought white settlement.</p>
