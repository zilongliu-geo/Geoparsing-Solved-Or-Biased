  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Toula</span> (Arabic: تولا‎) is a small village in <span class="loc">North Lebanon</span> in <span class="loc">Zgharta District</span> (or Quadaa). It is 1,150 meters (3,770 feet) above sea level and is primarily a recreational village. Descendants of the original full-time residents of <span class="loc">Toula</span> do not reside in <span class="loc">Toula</span> during the <span class="date">winter</span> <span class="date">months</span>. Heavy snow fall typically makes Toula's mountainous roads inaccessible. However, Toula's original families occupied the village on a year-round basis. Settling families and early residents developed a climatic tolerance and adapted to Toula's harsh <span class="date">winter</span> <span class="date">months</span>. <span class="loc">Toula</span> has an estimated approximate population of 1,000. The last national census was conducted in <span class="date">1932</span>. At the beginning of the 20th century, similar to other Lebanese towns and cities, these village residents emigrated to different locations around the world. Significant numbers have emigrated to the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, <span class="loc">Brazil</span> and other countries. A distinctive percentage of current village residents have achieved secondary education and professional school levels. [cite pending] Census reports indicated that a high proportion of these residents hold professional degrees in medicine, law, engineering and education. Additionally, numerous business entrepreneurs are village residents.</p><br><br>
