  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>For the musical instrument, see viola da gamba Gamba is a small town in <span class="loc">Gabon</span> lying on the southern bay of the <span class="loc">Ndogo Lagoon</span>. Historically, the area was populated by gatherer-hunter-fishermen autochthons scattered in small villages around the <span class="loc">Ndogo Lagoon</span> and the <span class="loc">Yenzi</span> Lake. With the discovery in <span class="date">1967</span> of a major oil field by <span class="org">Shell</span> in the area, the town boomed and immigration of workers from various other parts of the country resulted in the population <span class="date">today</span> of about 8000 people. Though production from the Gamba field is <span class="date">now</span> only a fraction of what it once was, Gamba remains an important and strategic oil hub, being one of only two oil terminals in <span class="loc">Gabon</span> (the other one being <span class="loc">Cape Lopez</span>. Most people live in the heart of the town, divided into five blocks called “Plaines”, while most senior <span class="org">Shell</span> staff live in <span class="loc">Yenzi</span>, half a dozen miles away from the heart of the city near the airport and the oil terminal. Balumbu people are known to be the autochthons of the region, even though the <span class="loc">Punu</span> and Fang people are <span class="date">now</span> possibly the majority ethnic groups present. The name Gamba stands for fog in <span class="loc">Vili</span>, probably because of the foggy weather during the dry season.</p><br><br>
