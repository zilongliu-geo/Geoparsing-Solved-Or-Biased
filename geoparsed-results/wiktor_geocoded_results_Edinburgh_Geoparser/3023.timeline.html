  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Stanton</span> is village situated in north <span class="loc">Suffolk</span>, about nine miles north-east of <span class="loc">Bury St. Edmunds</span>, on the A143 road to <span class="loc">Diss</span>. Close to the village lies the former WW II airfield RAF Shepherds Grove, where American forces were based. One of the main landmarks in the village is the fine restored windmill at <span class="loc">Upthorpe</span> Farm, to the east of the village. The name " <span class="org">Stanton</span>" means 'a homestead on stony ground'. It's believed the site of the village has been continuously occupied since Roman times <span class="org">Stanton</span> dates back to Roman times, sited at the junction of Peddars Way and the Roman road believed to run between Camulodunum (<span class="loc">Colchester</span>) and <span class="loc">Bildeston</span>. The site of a Roman Villa known as '<span class="loc">Stanton Chare</span>' is at the junction of the two ancient routes. The Manor of <span class="loc">Stanton</span> was held for <span class="date">many years</span> by Abbots of <span class="loc">Bury St Edmunds</span>, and subsequently by the Capel-Lofft family. The present parish was formed from two earlier parishes, <span class="org">Stanton</span> <span class="loc">All Saints</span> and <span class="loc">Stanton St John</span>. The former St John's Church, on a prominent hill outside the village, was abandoned and services continued at <span class="loc">All Saints</span> in the village centre.</p><br><br>
