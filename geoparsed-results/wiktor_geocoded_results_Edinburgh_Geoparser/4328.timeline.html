  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Nashville</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Lowndes County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located 1.4 mi (2.3 km) west of the Alabama state line, on the east bank of the <span class="loc">Tombigbee</span> River, <span class="loc">Nashville</span> was once an important shipping port and river crossing location. The site was settled by <span class="per">Daniel Young</span>, a blacksmith, in <span class="date">1824</span>, and the place became known as "Young's Bluff". In <span class="date">1833</span>, a road was constructed west from Young's Bluff to intersect the Robinson Road (which connected the <span class="loc">cities of Columbus</span>, Jackson, and <span class="loc">Natchez</span>, and is the second oldest road in <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>), and another was constructed east into <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. Road traffic passed through the community and then crossed the river on a ferry owned by Young. Another early settler, <span class="loc">Nimrod</span> <span class="per">N. Nash</span>, opened a store there, and then purchased Young's property in <span class="date">1834</span>. He renamed the town "<span class="loc">Nashville</span>", and sold lots to settlers. In addition to the successful ferry service, <span class="loc">Nashville</span>'s stores supplied local farmers with goods, it had a post office established in <span class="date">1837</span>, and its port had facilities to store cotton until steamboats arrived in the late autumn-early <span class="date">winter</span>, when water level would rise. Despite this, <span class="loc">Nashville</span> never experienced significant growth, and the town did not incorporate. It never had more than two stores, and in census of <span class="date">1840</span>, the population was about 55 whites, and an undetermined number of slaves.</p><br><br>
