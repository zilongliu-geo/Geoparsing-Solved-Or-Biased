It is nestled in the <span class="loc">Sierra Nevada</span> foothills, 31 miles northeast of <span class="loc">Sacramento</span>. <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> generally has moderate winters and warm summers. The latitude of <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> is 38.874N, the longitude is -121.132W, and an elevation of 945 ft. The town's zip code is 95658 and area code 916. The population of the CDP as of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census is 1,224. <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> was founded in the 19th century. According to Transcontinental Railroad Landmarks the "Regular freight and passenger trains began operating over the first 31 miles of Central Pacific's line to <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> <span class="date">June 10, 1864</span>, when political opposition and lack of money stopped further construction during that mild <span class="date">winter</span>. Construction was resumed in <span class="date">April, 1865</span>." The region is also in the vicinity of what was the cradle of "gold country", where in the mid-19th century a flurry of miners and gold prospectors searched for their fortune. During this time however, the town of <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> was known more for its orchards rather than abundant gold mines.</p><br><br>
