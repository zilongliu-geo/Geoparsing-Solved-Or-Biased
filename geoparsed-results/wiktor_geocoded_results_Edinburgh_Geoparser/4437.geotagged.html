<p>The Town of <span class="loc">Garden City</span> is a Statutory Town located in <span class="loc">Weld County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 357 at the 2000 census. With a total area less than one square mile, it is entirely surrounded by the <span class="loc">cities of Greeley</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span> and <span class="loc">Evans</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. <span class="loc">Garden City</span> is located at 40°23′41″N 104°41′19″W (40.394766, -104.688634). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Garden City</span> was founded in August 2, 1938 as a base for saloons and liquor stores serving residents of nearby <span class="loc">Greeley</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, which was then a Dry City. Shortly after the repeal of Prohibition in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, in June of 1935, <span class="loc">Greeley</span> voters, by a majority of 356 votes, voted in the local option election to make <span class="loc">Greeley</span> "dry" and prohibit the sale, manufacture, transportation, or possession of liquor in the city limits of <span class="loc">Greeley</span>. The morning following the election, two <span class="loc">Greeley</span> liquor stores were closed by the Chief of Police. The <span class="loc">Greeley</span> Tribune published several articles of a Wet Town incorporating on <span class="loc">Greeley</span>'s southern edge. This area was home to a 10 acre area known at the time as Ray's Cottage Camp, owned by Mrs. A.F. Ray. The law for incorporating a town at the time required a petition to be filled with <span class="loc">Weld County</span> of 30 or more residents who were also landowners. Mrs. Ray sold cabins and lots in her Cottage Camp for as little as $100.00 so that <span class="loc">Garden City</span> could meet the petition criteria. According to Tribune articles written at the time, the incorporation of <span class="loc">Garden City</span> was challenged and found to be invalid twice but <span class="loc">Garden City</span> did finally become incorporated on the third attempt in 1938. According to the incorporation document on file in the Clerk's Office, the incorporation date was August 2, 1938.</p>
