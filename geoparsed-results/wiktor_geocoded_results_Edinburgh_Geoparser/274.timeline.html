  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> (<span class="date">2011</span> population 599) is a small town in central <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> approximately 40 km northeast of <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span> on the <span class="loc">Fish Creek</span> in Division No. 15. <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> was first settled by immigrants of Russian, English, Scottish and Ukrainian descent in the 1890s. The railway arrived in <span class="date">1905</span>. Initial settlers in <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> moved from <span class="per">Eastern</span> and <span class="per">Atlantic</span> <span class="loc">Canada</span> (of English or Scottish ancestry), Ukrainian immigrants (<span class="date">1898</span>â€“<span class="date">1899</span>) and Mennonite's (from <span class="loc">Manitoba</span>) in <span class="date">1901</span>. In <span class="date">1905</span> the Canadian Northern Railway reached the town, by <span class="date">1908</span> the railway had become critical for the sale of wheat, with 120 rail cards of hard wheat leaving the town <span class="date">that year</span>. The business on main street peaked in <span class="date">the early 1930s</span>, until much of Main Street was destroyed by fire in <span class="date">1937</span>. The Aberdeen Rec Complex is located in the town and consists of a Library, meeting room, ice rink, curling rink, bowling alley, dance studio, music room and meeting rooms. SaskWater purchases water from the <span class="loc">city of Saskatoon</span> and then sells the water to the town of <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span>, that in turn sells the water to local residents. This is facilitated through the use of a $4 Million pipeline that was completed in <span class="date">2010</span>.</p><br><br>
