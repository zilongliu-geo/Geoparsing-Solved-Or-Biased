As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a population of 27,687. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span>, and the site of the maximum-security Auburn Correctional Facility, as well as the <span class="per">William H.

After his death in <span class="date">1806</span>, <span class="per">Hardenbergh</span> was buried in Auburn's North Street Cemetery, and was re-interred in <span class="date">1852</span> in Fort Hill Cemetery â€“ the first burial in the city's newly opened burial ground. The community grew up around <span class="per">Hardenbergh</span>'s gristmill and sawmill.</p><br><br>
