<p><span class="loc">Dongo</span> is a comune in the <span class="loc">Province of Como</span> in the Italian region <span class="loc">Lombardy</span>. It lies on the northwestern shore of <span class="loc">Lake Como</span> between <span class="loc">Gravedona</span> and <span class="loc">Musso</span> at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Albano</span>. It is 70 kilometres (43 mi) north of <span class="loc">Milan</span> and about 40 kilometres (25 mi) northeast of Como. It was in <span class="loc">Dongo</span>, on 27 April 1945, that Benito Mussolini and other fascists, fleeing from <span class="loc">Milan</span> towards <span class="loc">Valtellina</span>, were captured by Urbano Lazzaro and other partisans. Dongo borders the following municipalities: <span class="loc">Colico</span>, Consiglio di <span class="loc">Rumo</span>, <span class="loc">Garzeno</span>, Germasino, <span class="loc">Musso</span>, <span class="loc">Pianello</span> del <span class="loc">Lario</span>, <span class="loc">Stazzona</span>. The Palazzo del Vescovo (Palace of the Bishop) was erected in the 17th century by the family of the Marquis Cossoni. In 1854, Carlo Romanò, the Bishop of Como, acquired the building from the Cossoni family. In 1983 the Town of <span class="loc">Dongo</span> purchased the building. The citizens of <span class="loc">Dongo</span>, assisted financially by the Comunità Montana Alto <span class="loc">Lario</span> <span class="loc">Occidentale</span>, initiated the complete restoration of the <span class="loc">Palazzo</span> shortly thereafter. Still bearing its original name, the building currently houses the Civic Institute of Music "Alto <span class="loc">Lario</span>", and, since December 2003, the International Piano Academy <span class="loc">Lake Como</span>.</p>
