<p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Piscataquis County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,646 at the 2010 census. The town is centered on the lower end of <span class="loc">Moosehead</span> Lake, the largest body of fresh water in the state. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> is the historic gateway to the north country and a center for outdoor recreation in the area. Greenville High School, with 89 students, was ranked as the third best high school in <span class="loc">Maine</span> and one of the top 1,000 in the <span class="loc">US</span> in 2010. First called T9 R10 NWP (or Township 9, Range 10, North of the Waldo Patent), the land was granted about 1812 by the Massachusetts General Court to Thornton Academy in <span class="loc">Saco</span>. In 1824, Nathaniel Haskell of <span class="loc">Westbrook</span> bought the Thornton Academy Grant. With Oliver Young and John Smith, he began clearing trees that summer for farming near <span class="loc">Wilson</span> Pond, where the <span class="loc">Wilson</span> Stream would provide water power for mills. In 1827, Haskell completed a house, and his family joined him. A sawmill was built on <span class="loc">Wilson</span> Stream in 1829, with a gristmill added the following year. In 1835, Henry Gower began clearing land beside <span class="loc">Moosehead</span> Lake for what would develop into Greenville village. There he erected the first hotel, a two-story building called The Seboomook House, and the first store. On February 6, 1836, <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was incorporated from Haskell Plantation, and named for its green forests. By 1846, Greenville village included two houses, two blacksmith shops and a schoolhouse. On August 10, 1848, the town annexed land from <span class="loc">Wilson</span>, the remainder of which was distributed to <span class="loc">Shirley</span> and <span class="loc">Elliotsville</span>.</p>
