<p><span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is a county located on the <span class="loc">Edwards Plateau</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. As of the 2010 census, its population was 8,517. The county seat is <span class="loc">Hamilton</span>. The county was created in 1858. It is named for James Hamilton Jr., a former governor of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> who gave financial aid to the Republic of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Indigenous peoples were the first inhabitants of the area. Later Indian tribes settled in the area, including Tawakoni, <span class="loc">Tonkawa</span>, <span class="loc">Waco</span> and <span class="loc">Comanche</span>. In 1821, shortly after <span class="loc">Mexico</span> claimed its independence from <span class="loc">Spain</span>, <span class="loc">Anglo</span> settlers from the North came to <span class="loc">Texas</span>, claiming Mexican citizenship. Following Texas's independence from <span class="loc">Mexico</span> (1836) and its annexation by the <span class="loc">United States</span> (1845), Robert Carter and family became the first permanent white settlers in the county in 1854. The next year, settlers James Rice, Henry Standefer, Frederic Bookerman, William Beauchamp, and Asa Langford formed a community that later becomes the town of <span class="loc">Hamilton</span>. Asa Langford began Langford's Cove, which later grows into present-day <span class="loc">Evant</span>. In 1858 the Sixth Texas Legislature formed <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>, named after James Hamilton Jr., from parts of <span class="loc">Comanche</span>, <span class="loc">Bosque</span>, and <span class="loc">Lampasas counties</span>. In 1858, <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> was named the county seat.</p>
