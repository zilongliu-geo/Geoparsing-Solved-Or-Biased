<p><span class="loc">Chale</span> is a village and civil parish on the <span class="loc">Isle of Wight</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is located three kilometres from <span class="loc">Niton</span> in the south of the Island in the area known as the Back of the Wight. The village of <span class="loc">Chale</span> lies at the foot of St. Catherine's Down. <span class="loc">Chale</span> is recorded in the Domesday book as "Cela", which probably derives from the Old English word "ceole", meaning "throat". This is thought to refer to the nearby ravine or chine at <span class="loc">Blackgang</span>. The name was also recorded as "Chele" or "Chielle", but it has been "<span class="loc">Chale</span>" since the 12th century. There were 3 manors in <span class="loc">Chale</span> at the time of the Domesday Book: <span class="loc">Chale</span>, Gotten and Walpen. The Parish Church of St Andrew was founded by Hugh Gendon in <span class="loc">Chale</span> in 1114. However, the present church dates from the 14th century. It has 6 bells in its tower. One might have been made about 1360. It has some fine stained glass windows. The <span class="loc">Chale</span> Abbey farm has a window that dates from the 14th century. The name Abbey refers to the style of the building, not its religious use. <span class="loc">Chale</span> <span class="loc">Abbey Farm</span> and <span class="loc">Walpen</span> Manor are two of the oldest buildings on the <span class="loc">Isle of Wight</span>.</p>
