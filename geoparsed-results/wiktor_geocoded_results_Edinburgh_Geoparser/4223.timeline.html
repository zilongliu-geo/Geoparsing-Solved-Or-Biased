  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Winton</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Bournemouth</span> in <span class="loc">Dorset</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) north of <span class="loc">Bournemouth</span> town centre, along Wimborne Road (the A347). The name <span class="loc">Winton</span> derives from <span class="loc">Wintoun</span> Castle in <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, which was home to the <span class="per">Archibald Montgomerie</span>, 13th <span class="per">Earl of Eglinton</span>, a relative of the Talbot family: landowners who started the development of <span class="loc">Winton</span>. At the beginning of the 19th century the area was just rough heathland, with just a track linking ancient <span class="loc">Moordown</span> Village to Horseshoe Common. In <span class="date">1805</span> this all changed when a new main road through <span class="loc">Winton</span> was put in and named Muscliff Road (<span class="date">today</span> it is known as Wimborne Road). Around <span class="date">1850</span> wealthy Scottish philanthropists <span class="loc">Georgina</span> and <span class="loc">Marianne</span> <span class="loc">Talbot</span> saw the plight of local workers and set about trying to improve their lives by purchasing land along the road and building four artisan cottages and sinking wells to provide fresh water. By <span class="date">1891</span> the population of <span class="loc">Winton</span> had reached 4,000 and by <span class="date">1894</span> the needs of <span class="loc">Winton</span> were so great that they were put under the care of the <span class="loc">Winton Parish</span> Council and <span class="date">later in 1897</span> <span class="loc">Winton Urban</span> District Council was formed. In <span class="date">1901</span> <span class="loc">Bournemouth</span> (which was by then a county borough) increased its boundaries to include <span class="loc">Winton</span> and other districts.</p><br><br>
