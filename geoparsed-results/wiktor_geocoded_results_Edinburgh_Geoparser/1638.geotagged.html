<p><span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> (English /ˌpɔːrtə ˈriːkoʊ/ or /ˌpwɛərtə ˈriːkoʊ/; Spanish: [ˈpweɾto ˈriko], locally also [ˈpwelto ˈχiko; ˈʀ̥iko]), officially the Commonwealth of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>, literally the "Associated <span class="loc">Free State</span> of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>"), is a <span class="loc">United States</span> territory located in the northeastern Caribbean. <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> is an archipelago that includes the main island of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> and a number of smaller islands. The capital and most populous municipality is <span class="loc">San Juan</span>. The territory does not observe daylight saving time, and its official languages are Spanish, which is predominant, and English. The island's population is approximately 3.4 million. <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>'s rich history, tropical climate, diverse natural scenery, renowned traditional cuisine and attractive tax incentives make it a popular destination for visitors from around the world. Its location in the Caribbean, combined with centuries of colonization and subsequent migration, has made Puerto Rican culture a distinct melting pot of Amerindian, Spanish, African, and North American influences. Originally populated by the aboriginal Taíno people, the island was claimed in 1493 by Christopher Columbus for the <span class="loc">Kingdom of Spain</span>, enduring several invasion attempts by the French, Dutch, and British. During the four centuries of Spanish rule, the island's cultural and physical landscapes were transformed, with European knowledge, customs, and traditions being introduced, especially Roman Catholicism and the Spanish language. In 1898, following the Spanish–American War, <span class="loc">Spain</span> ceded the island to the <span class="loc">United States</span> under the terms of the Treaty of <span class="loc">Paris</span>.</p>
