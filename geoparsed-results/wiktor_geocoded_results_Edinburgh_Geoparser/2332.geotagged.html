<p>Dayton is a town in <span class="loc">York County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,965 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> statistical area. Dayton is one of the smallest towns in <span class="loc">York County</span>. The area was once inhabited by the <span class="loc">Sokokis</span> (or <span class="loc">Saco</span>) Indians, who hunted and fished along the <span class="loc">Saco</span> River. The old <span class="loc">Sokokis</span> Trail is now Route 5, which passes through Dayton. In 1664, Major William Phillips purchased from the sagamore the land which would become Little Falls Plantation—today the towns of Hollis, Dayton and part of <span class="loc">Limington</span>. In 1728, a stockaded fort which contained a trading post was built a half mile below <span class="loc">Union Falls</span>. Called the Saco Truck House or Saco Block House, the garrison was maintained throughout the French and Indian War until the fall of <span class="loc">Quebec</span> in 1759. Settlers arrived in 1753, and lumbering became a principal industry. Logs were rolled down the banks of the <span class="loc">Saco</span> River and floated to sawmills at <span class="loc">Saco</span>. Nathaniel Goodwin established the first local mill in 1782 at Goodwins Mills, where falls in Swan Brook drop 33 feet (10 m). A sawmill and gristmill were erected at <span class="loc">Union Falls</span> (then called Hopkinson's Mill) in 1806. Tanneries were built, and land was cleared for farms. In 1798, Little Falls Plantation was incorporated as <span class="loc">Phillipsburg</span>, in honor of Major William Phillips—but only until 1810. Considered difficult to pronounce and write, the <span class="loc">Phillipsburg</span> was changed to Hollis. Then, in 1854, the southern part of Hollis petitioned the state legislature to become a separate town. Permission was granted, and the community was named Dayton after Thomas Day, who submitted the petition.</p>
