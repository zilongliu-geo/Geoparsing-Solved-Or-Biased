According to one tradition, it was named from a pioneer settler's house that was known locally as the "new castle".

Located near <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> is the Ionia Volcano, a mineral deposit that once sat in cliffs on the edge of the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. Water from the river would leak through fissures in the cliff and cause steam to rise. Much of the so-called volcano washed into the river in the 1870s, and today the site is more than a mile from the river.</p>
