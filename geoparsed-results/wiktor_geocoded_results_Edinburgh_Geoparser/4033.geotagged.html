<p>Brooklyn (popularly known as <span class="loc">Lovejoy</span>), is a village in St. <span class="loc">Clair County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located two miles north of East St. Louis, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> and three miles northeast of downtown St. Louis, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, it is the oldest town incorporated by African Americans in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was founded by freed and fugitive slaves from St. Louis, led by "Mother" Priscilla Baltimore in the period of 1829 to 1839. Its motto is "Founded by Chance, Sustained by Courage". The current mayor is Mayor Vera Banks-Glasper. Superstar Tina Turner regularly performed at a local club in her early years as an entertainer. A missionary AME Church was established in the new settlement in 1836. Now known as Quinn's Chapel AME, its congregation is believed to have supported the Underground Railroad and aided fugitive slaves to freedom, together with members of the Antioch Baptist Church established in 1838. According to oral history tradition, by 1829 "Mother" Priscilla Baltimore led a group of eleven families, composed of both fugitive and free African Americans, to flee slavery in St. Louis, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. They crossed the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River to the free state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, where they established a freedom village in the American Bottoms. "Mother" Baltimore was said to have purchased her freedom as an adult from her master. She also bought the freedom of members of her family. Born in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, she tracked her white father to <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and bought her mother's freedom from him. The earliest black families included Anderson, Sullivan, Singleton, Wilson, Cox, Wyatt, and Carper.</p>
