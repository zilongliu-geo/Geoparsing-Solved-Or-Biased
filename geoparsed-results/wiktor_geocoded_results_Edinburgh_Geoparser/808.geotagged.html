<p><span class="loc">Duba</span> (Arabic: ضبا‎) is a small city on the northern <span class="loc">Red Sea</span> coast, of <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span>. It is in <span class="loc">Tabuk Province</span>. Local citizens describe it as The Pearl of the <span class="loc">Red Sea</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Duba</span> is about 22,000. The first reference to <span class="loc">Duba</span>, under this name, is from 1203. However, the Valley of Salma and Valley of Kafafah were already known many centuries before. The ancient Greek scholar Ptolemy mentioned a trade route leading from Kafafah to Lihyan (today's Al-`Ula). Sheikh Abdulghani Al Nabulsi wrote about <span class="loc">Duba</span> in 1790, in his account of going to Mecca for the Hajj. Historically it is part of <span class="loc">Madian</span>; the city is mentioned in Islamic scriptures. According to the Quran, Prophet Moussa settled in <span class="loc">Madian</span> (the region starts from <span class="loc">Jordan</span> river and extends to the town of <span class="loc">Duba</span>) where Prophet Shoaib hosted him. The town of Prophet Shoaib as it is called is said to be located near <span class="loc">Maqna</span> where an ancient well can still be seen. The well is said to be the one where <span class="loc">Moussa</span> fed Shoaib's flock.</p>
