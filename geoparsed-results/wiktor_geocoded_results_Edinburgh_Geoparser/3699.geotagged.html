<p><span class="loc">Palau</span> (/pəˈlaʊ/, historically <span class="loc">Belau</span> or Pelew), officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Palau</span> (Palauan: <span class="loc">Beluu er a Belau</span>), is an island country located in the western <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. The country's population of around 21,000 is spread across 250 islands, which form the western chain of the <span class="loc">Caroline Islands</span> in <span class="loc">Micronesia</span>. The most populous of these is <span class="loc">Koror</span>. The capital Ngerulmud is located on the nearby island of <span class="loc">Babeldaob</span>, in Melekeok State. <span class="loc">Palau</span> shares maritime boundaries with <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>, the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, and the Federated States of <span class="loc">Micronesia</span>. The country was originally settled approximately 3,000 years ago by migrants from the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> and sustained a Negrito population until around 900 years ago. The islands were first explored by Europeans in the 16th century, and were made part of the Spanish <span class="loc">East Indies</span> in 1574. Following <span class="loc">Spain</span>'s defeat in the Spanish–American War in 1898, the islands were sold to Imperial <span class="loc">Germany</span> in 1899 under the terms of the German–Spanish Treaty, where they were administered as part of German <span class="loc">New Guinea</span>. The Imperial Japanese Navy conquered <span class="loc">Palau</span> during World War I, and the islands were later made a part of the Japanese-ruled South Pacific Mandate by the League of Nations. During World War II, skirmishes, including the major Battle of Peleliu, were fought between American and Japanese troops as part of the Mariana and <span class="loc">Palau Islands</span> campaign. Along with other Pacific Islands, <span class="loc">Palau</span> was made a part of the <span class="loc">United States</span>-governed Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in 1947. Having voted against joining the Federated States of <span class="loc">Micronesia</span> in 1979, the islands gained full sovereignty in 1994 under a Compact of Free Association with the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p>
