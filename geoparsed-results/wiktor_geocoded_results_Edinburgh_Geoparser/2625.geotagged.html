<p><span class="loc">Tempe</span> is a suburb in the Inner West of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Tempe</span> is located 9 kilometres south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district in the local government area of Marrickville Council. <span class="loc">Tempe</span> sits on the northern bank of the <span class="loc">Cooks River</span> and is separated from <span class="loc">Sydney</span> Airport by the <span class="loc">Alexandra Canal</span>, also known as <span class="loc">Sheas Creek</span>. The <span class="loc">Wolli</span> Creek waterway also empties into the <span class="loc">Cooks River</span> near <span class="loc">Tempe</span>. <span class="loc">Tempe</span> was named after the mansion on the southern banks of the <span class="loc">Cooks River</span> in the area that is now known as <span class="loc">Wolli</span> Creek. Alexander Brodie Spark (1792–1856), an immigrant from <span class="loc">Elgin</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, built Tempe House in 1836. It was named after the '<span class="loc">Vale of Tempe</span>', a beautiful valley set at the foot of <span class="loc">Mount Olympus</span> in <span class="loc">Greece</span>, which was prominent in ancient Greek legend. Tempe House, designed by John Verge (1772–1861) in the Georgian style, is regarded as one of the great houses of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>. It is listed with the Heritage Council of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> as well as the State Heritage Register. Spark also donated money towards the purchase of land and the building of St Peter’s Church of England, which gave its name to the suburb of <span class="loc">St Peters</span>, to the north of <span class="loc">Tempe</span>.</p>
