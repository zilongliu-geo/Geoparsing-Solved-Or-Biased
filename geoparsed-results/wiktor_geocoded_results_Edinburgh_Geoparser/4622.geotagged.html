<p><span class="loc">Eltham</span> ( pronunciation ) is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 20 km north-east of Melbourne's Central Business District. Its local government area is the Shire of Nillumbik. At the 2011 Census, <span class="loc">Eltham</span> had a population of 18,162. <span class="loc">Eltham</span> is one of the 'green wedge' areas that provide relatively undeveloped, accessible environments within the <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> suburban region. These green wedge areas are under constant pressure from developments such as road and freeway expansions, but <span class="loc">Eltham</span> has managed to retain many tree-lined streets and leafy reserves. However, the character of the suburb is changing rapidly, with increased road traffic and higher-density housing becoming more common. Eltham's tourist attractions include the artists colony Montsalvat and the Diamond Valley Railway, the largest ridable miniature railway in <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Eltham</span> developed around what is now <span class="loc">Main Road</span> from the 1840s. A reserve for a village at the junction of the <span class="loc">Diamond Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Yarra River</span> is shown on maps around 1848. By 1851 the first Crown allotments were being subdivided and sold, along with a private subdivision developed by T. M. Holloway, known as Little Eltham. At this time, the town's centre was located around the intersection of <span class="loc">Pitt Street</span> and <span class="loc">Main Road</span>.</p>
