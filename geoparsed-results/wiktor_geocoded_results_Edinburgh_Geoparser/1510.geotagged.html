<p>Easton is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Northampton County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city's population was 26,800 as of the 2010 census. Easton is located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Delaware River</span> and the <span class="loc">Lehigh River</span>, roughly 55 miles (89 km) north of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and 70 miles (110 km) west of New <span class="loc">York City</span>. Easton is the easternmost city in the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley, a region of 731 square miles (1,893 km2) that is home to more than 800,000 people. Together with <span class="loc">Allentown</span> and <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>, the Valley embraces the <span class="loc">Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton metropolitan</span> area, including <span class="loc">Lehigh</span>, <span class="loc">Northampton</span>, and Carbon counties within <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, and <span class="loc">Warren County</span> in the adjacent state of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. Easton is the smallest of the three <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley cities, with approximately one-fourth of the population of the largest <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley city, <span class="loc">Allentown</span>. In turn, this metropolitan area comprises <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>'s third-largest metropolitan area and the state's largest and most populous contribution to the greater New <span class="loc">York City</span> metropolitan area. The city is split up into four sections: Historic Downtown, which lies directly to the north of the <span class="loc">Lehigh River</span>, to the west of the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River, continuing west to Sixth Street; The <span class="loc">West Ward</span>, which lies between Sixth and Fifteenth Streets; The <span class="loc">South Side</span>, which lies south of the <span class="loc">Lehigh River</span>; and College Hill, a neighborhood on the hills to the north which is the home of Lafayette College. The <span class="loc">boroughs of Wilson</span>, <span class="loc">West Easton</span>, and <span class="loc">Glendon</span> are also directly adjacent to the city; the first and largest of which, Wilson, partially aligns in the same North-South Grid as the <span class="loc">city of Easton</span>.</p>
