<p>Campbell is a town in the middle of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River in La <span class="loc">Crosse County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">La Crosse</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4358 as of the 2010 Census. All of the town's population resides in its eastern portion, on the section of <span class="loc">French Island</span> denoted French Island CDP by the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau. Some of the island is part of the city of <span class="loc">La Crosse</span>. The Town of Campbell borders the city of <span class="loc">La Crosse</span>. The unincorporated community of <span class="loc">West La Crosse</span> is also located in the town. The town was originally created in 1851, and was officially named after Erasmus D. Campbell, a former Lieutenant Governor of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. Today, the Town of Campbell is confined to part of a large island bordered by the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> and Black rivers and <span class="loc">Lake Onalaska</span>. This island has been traditionally known as "<span class="loc">French Island</span>." Joseph French, one of the earliest settlers of the town arrived in May 1851. French's family originated from <span class="loc">Leicestershire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Later, French-Canadian settlers, primarily farmers from the Canadian <span class="loc">Province of Quebec</span>, settled on the island-part of Campbell, then a much larger town between the incorporated settlements of <span class="loc">Onalaska</span> and <span class="loc">La Crosse</span>.</p>
