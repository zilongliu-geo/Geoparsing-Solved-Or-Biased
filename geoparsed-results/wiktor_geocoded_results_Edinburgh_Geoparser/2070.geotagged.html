<p><span class="loc">Lexington</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Holmes County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. The county's western border is formed by the <span class="loc">Yazoo River</span> and the western part of the county is considered to be within the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Delta. The population was 2,025 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Lexington</span> is located at 33°6′52″N 90°3′4″W (33.114329, -90.051191). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2), all land. Incorporated in 1836, the <span class="loc">city of Lexington</span> was founded by European-American settlers after the Choctaw people were forced to cede their land to the <span class="loc">United States</span> and remove to the Indian Territory. The new settlers initially developed riverfront land along the <span class="loc">Yazoo River</span> for cotton plantations, primarily worked by African Americans, most of whom were brought from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade. It transported more than one million African Americans to the South, breaking up many families. The slaves soon constituted the majority of the county population. On court days, the town served as a trading center for the county and attracted retail merchants who set up shop in the town. <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was a destination in the 1830s of some German-Jewish immigrants, who often became merchants. They were joined later in the century by Russian Jewish immigrants. The community built <span class="loc">Temple Beth El</span> in <span class="loc">Lexington</span> in 1905; it closed in 2009 because of declining population. During the plantation era, the city was bustling, as planters did well with a booming demand for cotton in the North and <span class="loc">Europe</span>.</p>
