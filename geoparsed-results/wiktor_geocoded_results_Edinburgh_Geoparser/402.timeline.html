  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">El Porvenir</span> (Spanish: "<span class="date">The Future</span>") is a municipio (municipality) and township in the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Chiapas</span>. <span class="loc">El Porvenir</span> was given town status with the creation of the municipality on <span class="date">13 January 1890</span>. The city was formally known as <span class="loc">El Porvenir</span> de <span class="per">Velasco</span> Suárez in honour of prominent neurologist <span class="per">Manuel Velasco</span> Suárez, Governor of <span class="loc">Chiapas</span> during the period <span class="date">1970</span> to <span class="date">1976</span>, but that nomenclature is <span class="date">now</span> considered obsolete. The town (locality) of <span class="loc">El Porvenir</span> is located at an official elevation of 2,839 m (9,314 ft) above mean sea level in the <span class="loc">Sierra Madre</span> highlands of <span class="loc">Chiapas</span>, at 15°27′20″N 92°16′46″W, close to the Guatemalan border. It is the second-highest municipal seat in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, trailing only the seat of <span class="per">Emiliano Zapata</span> Municipality, <span class="loc">Tlaxcala</span>. The municipality covers a total surface area of 121.70 km² and, in the <span class="date">2010</span> census, reported a population of 13,201 inhabitants. Of this total, 1,436 lived in the municipal seat, its only urban locality. On <span class="date">August 27, 2001</span> President <span class="per">Vicente Fox</span> attended a ceremony in <span class="loc">El Porvenir</span> in which the municipality was officially twinned with <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="per">Pedro Garza</span> García, Nuevo León, thus symbolically uniting the country's industrial, developed north with its rural, underdeveloped south.</p><br><br>
