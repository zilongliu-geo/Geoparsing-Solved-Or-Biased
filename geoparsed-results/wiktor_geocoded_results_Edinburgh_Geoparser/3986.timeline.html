  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Keith is a small farming town in the south-east of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is approximately 225 km from Adelaide at the junction of the Dukes Highway and the Riddoch Highway. It is sometimes referred to as the 'lucerne capital of <span class="loc">Australia</span>' due to the high number of lucerne growers in the region. At the <span class="date">2006</span> census, Keith had a population of 1,089. then in <span class="date">2011</span> census, Keith had a population of 1,320. A large granite outcrop outside the town called <span class="loc">Mount Monster</span> was a basis for the area's name until it was surveyed in <span class="date">1884</span> and officially proclaimed Keith in <span class="date">1889</span>. It is believed that the town is named after the home town of the Governor of <span class="loc">South Australia</span> at the time, <span class="per">Lord Kintore</span>. His home in <span class="loc">Aberdeenshire</span> in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> was called <span class="loc">Keith Hall</span> and he was also known as <span class="per">Earl of Kintore</span>. The Post Office opened around <span class="date">1874</span> as <span class="loc">Mount Monster</span> and was renamed Keith in <span class="date">1904</span>. In <span class="date">1905</span> the general store was opened, and in <span class="date">1907</span> the education department rented rooms out of the local institute to use as the school. <span class="date">1910</span> saw the opening of Keith Hotel and the town's provisional school became a public school in <span class="date">1912</span>.</p><br><br>
