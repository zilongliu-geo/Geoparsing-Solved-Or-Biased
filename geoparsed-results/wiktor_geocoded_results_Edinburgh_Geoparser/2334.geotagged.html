<p>Dayton is an unincorporated community located in <span class="loc">Howard County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. Dayton is located southwest of <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> and north of <span class="loc">Washington</span>, D.C., between <span class="loc">Clarksville</span> and <span class="loc">Glenelg</span>. A postal office operated in the community from 21 July 1864 to present with brief stops in service during the American Civil War. By 1878 the town expanded to three general stores and a wheelwright shop. One of which is Maloney's General Store built shortly after the civil war which served as a stagecoach stop and was later owned by Royal Harp III, Thomas Isaacs, Mr White, and the Grant Family. The Dayton single room school house was along Green Bridge Road. After a fire in the single room schoolhouse for colored children, a new brown tile two room school was built at the crossroads of <span class="loc">Ten Oaks</span>, Green Bridge and Howard roads, and the colored children moved to the old white school. The two room school is now on property owned by RLO Contractors. Dayton is in the 21036 zip code area and belongs to the 410 area code. Local landmarks are the Crossroads Pub famed for their <span class="loc">Maryland</span> blue crabs and once owned by the Harp family (Harp's Pub), who also owned Harp's grocery store; the Post Office; Hobbs Service Station; and a large wooden rabbit, which is decorated for major holidays.</p>
