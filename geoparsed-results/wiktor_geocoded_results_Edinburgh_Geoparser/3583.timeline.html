  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">London</span> /ˈlʌndən/ is the capital and most populous <span class="loc">city of England</span> and the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. Standing on the <span class="loc">River Thames</span> in the <span class="loc">south east of Great Britain</span>, <span class="loc">London</span> has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium. <span class="loc">London</span>'s ancient core, the <span class="loc">City of London</span>, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries and in <span class="date">2011</span> had a resident population of 7,375, making it the smallest city in <span class="loc">England</span>. Since at least the 19th century, the term <span class="loc">London</span> has also referred to the metropolis developed around this core. The bulk of this conurbation forms <span class="loc">Greater London</span>, a region of <span class="loc">England</span> governed by the Mayor of <span class="loc">London</span> and the <span class="loc">London</span> Assembly. The conurbation also covers two English counties: the small district of the <span class="loc">City of London</span> and the county of <span class="loc">Greater London</span>. The latter constitutes the vast majority of <span class="loc">London</span>, though historically it was split between <span class="loc">Middlesex</span> (a <span class="date">now</span> abolished county), <span class="loc">Essex</span>, <span class="loc">Surrey</span>, <span class="loc">Kent</span> and <span class="loc">Hertfordshire</span>. <span class="loc">London</span> is a leading global city, with strengths in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transport all contributing to its prominence. It is one of the world's leading financial centres and has the fifth-or sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the world depending on measurement. <span class="loc">London</span> is a world cultural capital. It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. <span class="loc">London</span> is the world's leading investment destination, hosting more international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city. <span class="loc">London</span>'s 43 universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in <span class="loc">Europe</span>, and a <span class="date">2014</span> report placed it first in the world university rankings. According to the report <span class="loc">London</span> also ranks first in the world in software, multimedia development and design, and shares first position in technology readiness. In <span class="date">2012</span>, <span class="loc">London</span> became the first city to host the modern <span class="date">Summer</span> Olympic Games three times.</p><br><br>
