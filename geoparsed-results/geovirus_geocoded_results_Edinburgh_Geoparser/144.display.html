<p>An E. coli outbreak linked to fresh bagged spinach in at least 20 states, has killed 1 person, a 77 year old woman in <span onClick="goto_name('Wisconsin')" class="loc">Wisconsin</span> and has made more than 95 sick, some severely and affecting people anywhere from 3 to 84 years old. <span onClick="goto_name('Michigan')" class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Oregon')" class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('New Mexico')" class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('New York')" class="loc">New York</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Indiana')" class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Ohio')" class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Wisconsin')" class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Idaho')" class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Connecticut')" class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Kentucky')" class="loc">Kentucky</span> and <span onClick="goto_name('Utah')" class="loc">Utah</span> all report human cases of the illness linked to the contaminated spinach. All individuals sickened by the outbreak have the same strain, E. coli O157:H7. Officials are currently investigating cases in <span onClick="goto_name('Washington')" class="loc">Washington</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Pennsylvania')" class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and <span onClick="goto_name('California')" class="loc">California</span> to determine if the new cases are linked to the current outbreak. "Based on the current information, FDA advises that consumers not eat bagged fresh spinach at this time. Individuals who believe they may have experienced symptoms of illness after consuming bagged spinach are urged to contact their health care provider," said a statement on the Food and Drug Administration's website. Health officials report that the symptoms from eating any contaminated spinach are kidney failure or Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome [HUS] which can occur easily in children and elderly people, bloody diarrhea, mild fever and in some cases death. At least 14 of the infected have suffered kidney failure. "Given the severity of this illness and the seriousness of the outbreak, FDA believes that a warning to consumers is needed. We are working closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] and state and local agencies to determine the cause and scope of the problem," added the statement. Consumers are urged to throw out any fresh spinach they may have as washing it does not help, but officials say that cooking the spinach could kill the bacteria though officials still urge consumers to throw out all spinach. "We are telling everyone to get rid of fresh bagged spinach right now. Don't assume anything is over," said <span onClick="goto_name('Wisconsin')" class="loc">Wisconsin</span> Governor Jim Doyle. <span onClick="goto_name('Wisconsin')" class="loc">Wisconsin</span> has seen the worst of the outbreak with one death reported and over 30 people infected. "If you wash it, it is not going to get rid of it," said the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition director, Robert Brackett. Health officials also say that they do not know what caused the contamination and do not know where the spinach originated from. Officials believe that the contamination was not "deliberate." "It is too early to say where the spinach has come from. This is an active investigation and we will provide more information as it becomes available. We have no evidence that this was deliberate," said a spokeswoman for the FDA, Laura Alvey. A company which produces natural foods in <span onClick="goto_name('California')" class="loc">California</span> is suspected to be the source of the illness. Natural Selection Foods LLC. located in <span onClick="goto_name('San Juan Bautista')" class="loc">San Juan Bautista</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('California')" class="loc">California</span> has recalled all of their spinach voluntarily, including any food items containing the vegetable. Some of those infected with the illness have reported eating spinach which came from the company, but officials say that the outbreak may not be entirely isolated to just Natural Selection and that the investigation into the origin of the outbreak is still ongoing. Natural Selection sells many different brand names of spinach including Dole, Trader Joe's, Green Harvest, Ready Pac, <span onClick="goto_name('Earthbound')" class="loc">Earthbound</span> Farm, Rave Spinach and their own brand of spinach, Natural Selections. Officials say that more cases are expected to be reported, but many individuals will recover from the illness within a week. E. coli, on average, affects more than 75,000 people a year and can kill as many as 60.</p>
