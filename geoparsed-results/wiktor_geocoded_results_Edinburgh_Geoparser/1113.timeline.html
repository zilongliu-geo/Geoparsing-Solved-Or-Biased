  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Chester</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,768 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It was home to the <span class="date">now</span> defunct <span class="org">Chester College</span> (formerly White Pines College). From <span class="per">Statistics</span> and <span class="per">Gazetteer</span> of New-Hampshire, <span class="date">1875</span>: "Chester is considered one of the old towns of the state. In <span class="date">1719</span>, about eighty persons, chiefly from <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> and <span class="loc">Hampton</span>, formed an association, for the purpose of securing a tract of land in the "Chesnut Country" (so called) and stationed three men upon this tract, to hold possession until they should procure a lawful title. After considerable difficulty they obtained a grant of land, ten miles [16 km] square. Immediately the settlement was commenced by several persons from <span class="per">Rye</span> and <span class="per">Hampton</span>, among whom were <span class="per">Samuel Ingalls</span>, <span class="per">Jonathan Goodhue</span>, <span class="per">Jacob Sargent</span>, Ebenezer Dearborn, <span class="per">Robert Smith</span>, <span class="per">E. Colby</span> and <span class="per">S. Robie</span>, who contributed largely to the permanent success of the enterprise. On the <span class="date">8th of May, 1722</span> the township which had hitherto been called <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>, was incorporated under its present name, and comprising an area of over 120 square miles [310 km2]."</p><br><br>
