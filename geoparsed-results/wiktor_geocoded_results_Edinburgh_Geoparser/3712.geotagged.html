<p>Sidney is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Richland County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, less than 10 mi (16 km) away from the <span class="loc">North Dakota</span> border. The population was 5,191 at the 2010 census. The city lies along the <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span> River and is in proximity to the badlands of the Dakotas. Sidney is approximately midway between <span class="loc">Glendive</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span> and <span class="loc">Williston</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>. Settlers began arriving in the area in the 1870s, and a post office was established in 1888. Six-year-old Sidney Walters and his parents were staying with Hiram Otis, the local justice of the peace, and Otis decided that Sidney was a good name for the town. The following year, <span class="loc">Montana</span> became a state and Sidney was incorporated in 1911. [1] Sidney was originally part of <span class="loc">Dawson County</span>, but became the county seat of <span class="loc">Richland County</span> at its inception in 1914. Agriculture became an important part of the region after the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Project was completed in 1909. A dam was built on the river south of <span class="loc">Glendive</span>, which diverted water from the river into a 115.2 km (71.6 mi) main canal, which runs north-south, parallel to the <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span>, irrigating land from <span class="loc">Glendive</span> north up to <span class="loc">Fairview</span>, where it dumps into the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. This project irrigates 51,429 acres (208.13 km2) and serves water to 450 farms, according to the manager of the Lower <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span> Irrigation Districts.</p>
