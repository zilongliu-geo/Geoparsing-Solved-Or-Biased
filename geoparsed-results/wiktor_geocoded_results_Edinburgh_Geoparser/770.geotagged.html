<p>Eureka is a small eastern suburb of Ballarat, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span> - (AU). At the 2011 census, Eureka had a population of 629. Eureka is bordered by Specimen Creek to the north, Canadian Creek to the south, Queen and Joseph streets to the west and <span class="loc">Kline</span> and <span class="loc">Stawell Street</span> to the east. It is a small section of land within the larger suburb of <span class="loc">Ballarat East</span>. The suburb takes its name from the Eureka Lead the gold mining lead of the Eureka Mining Company and is most notable as the site of the historic event of the Eureka Rebellion and the flag flown by the rebels known as the Eureka Flag both of which have national significance to <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The site is marked by several monuments including the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka (M.A.D.E), which opened in May 2013 and houses the symbolic Eureka Flag, on loan from the Art Gallery of Ballarat. Civil disobedience in Eureka led to <span class="loc">Australia</span>'s first and only armed civil uprising, the Eureka Rebellion (colloquially referred to as the Eureka Stockade) which took place on 3 December 1854. The event, in which 22 miners died, is considered to be a defining moment in Australian history.</p>
