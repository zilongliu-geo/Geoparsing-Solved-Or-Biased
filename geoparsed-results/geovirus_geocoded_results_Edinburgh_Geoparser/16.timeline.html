  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Two Indonesian women, 23 and 27, have tested positive for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. They are in "serious condition but seem to be improving," said Hariadi Wibisono, a senior health ministry official. They are being treated in the designated bird flu hospital, Sulianti Suroso in eastern <span class="loc">Jakarta</span>. It is believed that both women had contact with infected poultry. This brings <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>'s number of confirmed cases of the virus to 25. A <span class="date">26 year</span> old female farmer in <span class="loc">Fujian</span>, <span class="loc">China</span> whose surname is <span class="loc">Lin</span>, also has the deadly H5N1 virus. She was admitted to the hospital in <span class="date">January</span>, but it was only confirmed on <span class="date">Wednesday</span> that she had the virus. Some of the people that have come in close contact with the woman are under observation by local health officials. Her current condition is reported as stable. This is <span class="loc">China</span>'s eleventh confirmed case of the virus.</p><br><br>
