  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Eldorado</span> (/ɛldəˈreɪdoʊ/ or /ɛldəˈreɪdə/) is a city in <span class="loc">Saline County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,122 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, with a <span class="date">1925</span> peak of 8,000. Although the city's name is spelled as if it were Spanish, the name was originally "Elder-Reado"—a combination of the last names of the town's two founders, <span class="per">Judge Samuel Elder</span> and <span class="per">Joseph Read</span>. According to legend, a signpainter for the railroad painted the name "Eldorado" on the train depot; as a result, the spelling and pronunciation was forever changed. <span class="loc">Eldorado</span> is included in the Illinois-Indiana-Kentucky Tri-State Area and is a bedroom community in the <span class="org">Harrisburg Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. In <span class="date">September, 1963</span>, <span class="date">five months</span> before The Beatles' first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show brought them stardom in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="per">George Harrison</span> performed at <span class="org">the Veterans of Foreign Wars</span> hall in <span class="loc">Eldorado</span> with a local band. This was the first performance by a Beatle in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the time, <span class="per">Harrison</span> and his brother were visiting their sister, <span class="per">Louise</span>, who had recently relocated with her husband to nearby <span class="loc">Benton</span>.</p><br><br>
