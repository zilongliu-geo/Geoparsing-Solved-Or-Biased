  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Austin</span> is a small, unincorporated community and census-designated place in <span class="loc">Lander County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. In <span class="date">2010</span>, its population was 192. It is located on the western slopes of the Toiyabe Range at an elevation of 6,605 feet (2,013 m). <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 50 passes through the town. The <span class="loc">city of Austin</span> was mapped out in <span class="date">1862</span> by <span class="per">David Buell</span>, and named after his partner, <span class="per">Alvah Austin</span> during a silver rush reputedly triggered by a <span class="loc">Pony Express</span> horse who kicked over a rock. By <span class="date">summer 1863</span>, <span class="per">Austin</span> and the surrounding Reese River Mining District had a population of over 10,000, and it became the county seat of <span class="loc">Lander County</span> (the seat was shifted to <span class="loc">Battle Mountain</span> in <span class="date">1979</span>). In <span class="date">1864</span>, the town launched Reuel <span class="per">Colt Gridley</span>'s impromptu fundraising drive that raised over $250,000 for wounded Civil War veterans, by repeatedly auctioning a sack of flour. The <span class="org">Nevada Central Railroad</span> was built to connect <span class="per">Austin</span> with the transcontinental railroad at <span class="loc">Battle Mountain</span> in <span class="date">1880</span>. However, by that time the boom was almost over. Major silver production ended by <span class="date">1887</span>, although there was a slight revival in <span class="date">the 1910s</span>. In the mid-1950s there was a great deal of interest in uranium deposits in the area, but the ore proved to be of low quality. Gold and silver mining has continued in the area sporadically and at generally low levels of production. High quality turquoise is still mined in the area in small quantities. This active turquoise mining, together with several shops that manufacture jewelry from local turquoise have made <span class="per">Austin</span> a sort of <span class="loc">Nevada</span> Turquoise mecca.</p><br><br>
