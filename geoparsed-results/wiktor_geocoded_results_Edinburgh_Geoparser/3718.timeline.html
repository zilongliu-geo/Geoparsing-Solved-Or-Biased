  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Baoji</span>  (simplified Chinese: 宝鸡; traditional Chinese: 寶雞; pinyin: Bǎojī) is a prefecture-level city in <span class="loc">western Shaanxi province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. The prefecture-level <span class="loc">city of Baoji</span> has a population of 3,716,731 according to the <span class="date">2010</span> Chinese census, inhabiting an area of 18,172 km2 (7,016 sq mi). The city itself has a population of approximately 800,000. Surrounded on three sides by hills, <span class="loc">Baoji</span> is in a valley opening out to the east. Its location is strategic, controlling a pass on the <span class="loc">Qin</span> Mountains between the <span class="loc">Wei River</span> valley and the <span class="loc">Jialing</span> River. Passing through <span class="loc">Baoji</span> is the ancient Northern Silk Road, the northernmost route of about 2,600 kilometres (1,616 miles) in length, which connected the ancient Chinese capital of <span class="loc">Xi</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> to the West over the Wushao Ling Mountain to <span class="loc">Wuwei</span> and emerging in <span class="loc">Kashgar</span> before linking to ancient <span class="loc">Parthia</span>. Thriving early in the Tang dynasty, it has roots to <span class="date">2000 BC</span>, but is <span class="date">now</span> a large industrial center. Railways first reached <span class="loc">Baoji</span> in <span class="date">1937</span> and have been key to its modern growth. <span class="loc">Baoji</span> is also considered the gateway between western and eastern <span class="loc">China</span> since most trains from <span class="loc">Beijing</span>, <span class="loc">Shanghai</span> and <span class="loc">Xi</span>'an pass through here on their way to <span class="loc">Gansu</span>, <span class="loc">Sichuan</span>, <span class="loc">Xinjiang</span> and <span class="loc">Tibet</span> (Lhasa). Fa Men Si (Famen temple), home to one of Buddha's finger bones, is also located in <span class="loc">Baoji County</span>. The Baoji area was home to the legendary <span class="loc">Yandi</span>, one of the Han Chinese forefathers. His tomb is located in the southern part of the city and his temple is located in the North.</p><br><br>
