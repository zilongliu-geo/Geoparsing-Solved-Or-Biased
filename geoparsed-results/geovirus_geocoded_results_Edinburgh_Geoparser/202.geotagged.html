HFMD can start from a variety of viruses of which Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the most common, followed by the Coxsackie A virus (Cox A16). There is an Incubation period from time of contact to appearance of symptoms between three to seven days. HFMD warning signs begin with a small fever and then lesions and blisters around the mouth and rashes on the feet and hands. Deng Haihua, Ministry of Health spokesperson, expects the disease to reach its height between May and July. Yang Weizhong Deputy Director for the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said researchers are increasing research efforts to find a vaccine for EV71. Families are being instructed to embark on week-long disinfections with free medical supplies from local health authorities.</p>
