  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Winchester</span> is a city and the county town of <span class="loc">Hampshire</span>. The city lies at the heart of the wider <span class="loc">City of Winchester</span>, a local government district, and is located at the western end of the South Downs National Park, along the course of the <span class="loc">River Itchen</span>. It is situated 61 miles (98 km) south-west of <span class="loc">London</span> and 13.6 miles (21.9 km) from <span class="loc">Southampton</span>, its closest city. At the time of the <span class="date">2011</span> Census, <span class="loc">Winchester</span> had a population of 45,184. The wider <span class="loc">City of Winchester</span> district which includes towns such as <span class="loc">Alresford</span> and <span class="loc">Bishop's Waltham</span> has a population of 116,800 <span class="loc">Winchester</span> developed from the Roman town of Venta Belgarum, which in turn developed from an Iron Age oppidum. Winchester's major landmark is Winchester Cathedral, one of the largest cathedrals in <span class="loc">Europe</span>, with the distinction of having the longest nave and overall length of all Gothic cathedrals in <span class="loc">Europe</span>. The city is home to the <span class="org">University of Winchester and Winchester College</span>, the oldest public school in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> still to be using its original buildings. The area around <span class="loc">Winchester</span> has been inhabited since prehistoric times, with three Iron Age hillforts, Oram's Arbour, St. Catherine's Hill, and <span class="loc">Worthy Down</span> all in the nearby vicinity. In the Late Iron Age, a more urban settlement type developed, known as an oppidum, although the archaeology of this phase remains obscure. It was overrun by the confederation of Gaulish tribes known as the Belgae sometime during the first century BCE. It seems to have been known as WentƒÅ or <span class="loc">Venta</span>, from the Brittonic for "town" or "meeting place".</p><br><br>
