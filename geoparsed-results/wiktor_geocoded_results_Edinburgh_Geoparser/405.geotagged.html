<p><span class="loc">Salem</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 28,776 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Salem</span> is a marketing and distributing center north of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, with a major amusement attraction, <span class="loc">Canobie</span> Lake Park, and a large shopping mall, the Mall at <span class="loc">Rockingham Park</span>. The area was first settled in 1652. As early as 1736, <span class="loc">Salem</span> was the "North Parish" of <span class="loc">Methuen</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, or "<span class="loc">Methuen District</span>." In 1741, when the boundary line between <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> was fixed, the "North Parish" became part of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, and was given the name "<span class="loc">Salem</span>," taken from nearby <span class="loc">Salem</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. It was incorporated in 1750 by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth. In 1902, <span class="loc">Canobie</span> Lake Park was established in <span class="loc">Salem</span> by the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Northeast Street Railway Company, to encourage leisure excursions on its trolleys. The plan was successful, and the enterprise quickly became one of the leading resorts of its type in <span class="loc">New England</span>. Crowds arrived from all over, including the nearby mill towns of <span class="loc">Haverhill</span>, <span class="loc">Lawrence</span>, <span class="loc">Lowell</span> and <span class="loc">Methuen</span> in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, and <span class="loc">Manchester</span> and <span class="loc">Nashua</span> in <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. Factory workers and others found respite strolling along tree-lined promenades, between flower-beds or beside the lake. Rides, arcades and a dance hall provided lively entertainments. The rise of the automobile, however, brought the decline of the trolley. But <span class="loc">Canobie</span> Lake Park, one of the few former street railway amusement resorts still in existence, continues to be popular.</p>
