  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Liverpool</span> was the original county seat of <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> and one of the oldest towns in the area. <span class="date">Today</span>, it is a neighborhood of Lake Station, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. At <span class="date">the start of 1836</span>, the land that <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> would occupy was still owned by Potawatomi Amerinds. However, under the Treaty of <span class="loc">Tippecanoe</span>, some of the Potawatomi were given certificates that allowed them to claim parcels of land. <span class="per">John Chapman</span> bought one of these certificates, giving him ownership of section 24 of township 36 north of range 8 west. At the time, <span class="loc">Chicago</span> was a small but rapidly growing harbor town, and Chapman intended to make a city large enough to rival it. It joined the other four cities then competing to be the metropolis of Lake <span class="loc">Michigan</span>: <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan City</span>, City West, and <span class="loc">Indiana City</span>. Chapman platted <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> near the confluence of the <span class="loc">Little Calumet River</span> and <span class="loc">Deep River</span>, both of which were navigable at the time. An article from <span class="date">1929</span> describes the original plan for the town, enumerating central streets and blocks: "Of the streets thereon they had their <span class="loc">Broadway</span>, their Market Street, their <span class="loc">Chestnut Street</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, and others of like dignity and rank, some of which were 100 feet in width. One block was designated "Public Square;" another "Market Square;" another "Church Square." Then there were 40 blocks subdivided into lots, 435 in number. Through this city to be, flowed the waters of <span class="loc">Deep River</span>, then described upon the plat as being 14 feet in depth, there being 18 blocks north of the river and 23 south."</p><br><br>
