<p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> (<span class="loc">Canada</span> 2011 Census population 175,779), is a city located in <span class="loc">Halton Region</span> at the western end of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span>. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is part of the Greater Toronto Area, and is also included in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area. Physically, <span class="loc">Burlington</span> lies between the north shore of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span> and the <span class="loc">Niagara Escarpment</span>. Economically, <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is strategically located near the geographic centre of the <span class="loc">Golden Horseshoe</span>, a densely populated and industrialized region home to over 8 million people. Some of the city's attractions include <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s Largest Ribfest, Sound of Music Festival, Art Gallery of <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, and Spencer Smith Park, all located near the city's municipal offices in the downtown core. Additionally, the city attracts hikers, birders and nature lovers due to the Royal Botanical Gardens located on the border with <span class="loc">Hamilton</span>, as well as its proximity to a part of the <span class="loc">Niagara Escarpment</span> in the north end of the city that includes the Iroquoian section of the <span class="loc">Bruce</span> Trail. Before pioneer settlement in the 19th century, the area was covered by the primeval forest that stretched between the provincial capital of <span class="loc">York</span> and the town of <span class="loc">Hamilton</span>, and was home to various First Nations peoples. In 1792, John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant governor of <span class="loc">Upper Canada</span>, named the western end of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span> "<span class="loc">Burlington</span> Bay" after the town of <span class="loc">Bridlington</span> in the <span class="loc">East Riding</span> of <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. By the time land beside the bay was deeded to Captain Joseph Brant at the turn of the 19th century, the name "<span class="loc">Burlington</span>" was already in common use. With the completion of the local survey after the War of 1812, the land was opened for settlement. Early farmers prospered in the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> area because of the fertile soil and moderate temperatures. Produce from the farms was shipped out via the bustling docks of the lakeside villages of <span class="loc">Port Nelson</span> and Wellington Square, as well as Brown's Wharf in the nearby village of Port Flamborough (which was to become <span class="loc">Aldershot</span>). Lumber taken from the surrounding forests also competed for space on the busy docks. However, in the latter half of the 19th century, increased wheat production from Western <span class="loc">Canada</span> convinced local farmers to switch to fruit and vegetable production.</p>
