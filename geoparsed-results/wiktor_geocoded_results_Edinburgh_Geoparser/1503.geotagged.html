<p><span class="loc">Livingston</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Merced County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. <span class="loc">Livingston</span> is located 7 miles (11 km) west-northwest of <span class="loc">Atwater</span>, at an elevation of 131 feet (40 m). According to the 2010 census, the city population was 13,058, up from 10,473 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Livingston</span>'s total area is 3.7 square miles (9.6 km2), including undeveloped farmland annexed in anticipation of future growth. <span class="loc">Livingston</span> is located at 37°23′13″N 120°43′25″W. It lies slightly uphill from where the Southern Pacific Railroad crosses the <span class="loc">Merced River</span>. Highway 99 follows the Southern Pacific through the city. The <span class="loc">Livingston</span> post office opened in 1873, closed in 1882, and re-opened in 1883.The town was named for Dr. <span class="loc">David Livingstone</span>, a British explorer of <span class="loc">Africa</span> who was an international celebrity in the late 1800s. An error on the town’s Post Office application resulted in the difference in spelling between his name and the town’s. <span class="loc">Livingston</span> lies in the fertile <span class="loc">San Joaquin</span> Valley. Like the rest of the valley, it has long, dry summers and depends on irrigation water. The winters are mild, alternating between fog, rain, and sun, with occasional frost. The growing season is long, and there is a low risk of mold, drought, or bad weather interfering with crops. Due to deposits from the <span class="loc">Merced River</span>, <span class="loc">Livingston</span>'s soil is unusually sandy, distinguishing it from the clay-based soils predominant in most of the valley.</p>
