  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Escondido</span> (/ˌɛskənˈdiːdoʊ/ ES-kən-DEE-doh) is a city located in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span>'s <span class="loc">North County</span> region, 30 miles (48 km) northeast of Downtown <span class="loc">San Diego</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The city occupies a shallow valley ringed by rocky hills. Incorporated in <span class="date">1888</span>, it is one of the oldest cities in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span>. The city had a population of 143,911 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Its municipal government set itself an operating budget limit of $426,289,048 for the fiscal <span class="date">year 2010</span>–2011. The city is known as Eskondiid in Diegueño. "Escondido" is a Spanish word meaning "hidden". One source says the name originally referred to agua escondida or hidden water; another says it meant "hidden treasure". The Escondido area was first settled by the Luiseño, who established campsites and villages along the creek running through the area. They named the place "Mehel-om-pom-pavo." The Kumeyaay migrated from areas near the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span>, settling both in the <span class="loc">San Pasqual</span> Valley and near the <span class="loc">San Dieguito River</span> in the southwestern and western portions of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Escondido</span>. Most of the villages and campsites <span class="date">today</span> have been destroyed by development and agriculture.</p><br><br>
