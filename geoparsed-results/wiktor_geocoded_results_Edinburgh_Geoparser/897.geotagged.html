<p>Montgomery is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Chatham County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,523 at the 2010 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Savannah Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Montgomery is located south of the center of <span class="loc">Chatham County</span> at 31°56′36″N 81°6′24″W (31.943237, -81.106648). It occupies a neck of land bordered on the west by the <span class="loc">Vernon River</span>, on the east by the Moon River, and on the south by the <span class="loc">Burnside River</span>, all of which are tidal. The northeast border of the CDP is formed by <span class="loc">Georgia</span> SR 204 Spur, which leads to <span class="loc">Skidaway Island</span>. Downtown Savannah is 13 miles (21 km) north of the Montgomery town center. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 6.1 square miles (15.7 km2), of which 5.2 square miles (13.5 km2) is land and 0.85 square miles (2.2 km2), or 13.94%, is water. Montgomery is believed to be the location of an early settlement in the Savannah area (prior to General Oglethorpe's land grant in 1733) founded by three brothers, William, James, and Robert Montgomery, who were baronets, under a land grant of 1677. They failed to maintain a permanent settlement, due to poor location and disease, and so lost the English land grant. The brothers moved to the more established <span class="loc">Virginia Colony</span>. The name of the settlement continues in this area of Savannah as well as <span class="loc">Montgomery Street</span> and <span class="loc">Montgomery Crossroad</span>.</p>
