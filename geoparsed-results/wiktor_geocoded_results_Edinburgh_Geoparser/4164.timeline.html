  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Woodlands is a model village 3 miles (5 km) north of <span class="loc">Doncaster</span> in <span class="loc">South Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The village falls within the <span class="loc">Adwick Ward</span> of <span class="loc">Doncaster</span> <span class="org">MBC</span>. The colliery village was designed and built in the early 20th century by the architect <span class="per">Percy</span> Houfton as tied cottages for the miners of the neighbouring Brodsworth Colliery. In an era of model villages such as <span class="loc">Saltaire</span>, <span class="loc">Port Sunlight</span> and <span class="loc">Bournville</span>, Woodlands, with extensive open spaces, many different designs of houses, and overall living conditions superb for their time, possibly represents the height of the model village movement. The village is a conservation area. Lying between the historic Great North Road (the former A1, <span class="date">now</span> the A638) and a Roman Road, the houses in the village are in short terraces, typically of four, and face each other across wide avenues. At the back they typically overlook a large square open space. The Roman Road is <span class="loc">Ermine</span> Street, the branch from Lincoln to <span class="loc">York</span> via <span class="loc">Doncaster</span> and <span class="loc">Tadcaster</span>. Locally, it is colloquially known as the Roman <span class="loc">Rigg</span>, more correctly as the <span class="loc">Roman Ridge</span>.</p><br><br>
