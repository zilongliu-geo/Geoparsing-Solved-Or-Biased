<p>Alma is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Catron County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, north of <span class="loc">Glenwood</span> and south of Reserve. Sergeant James C. Cooney laid out a town on site of Alma in the early 1870s, but left it undeveloped. The town was bought by a Captain Birney, who named it "Alma" for his mother. In 1882 the U.S. Post Office opened in Alma, lasting until 1931. The town was home of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid's infamous Wild Bunch gang for a short period. They worked at the nearby WS ranch. Reportedly, the foreman and ranch manager were very happy with the Wild Bunch's work since the rustling stopped while they were employed at the ranch. Tom Ketchum, Harvey Logan and William Antrim, Billy the Kid's stepfather, also lived in Alma at some point. Artist Olaf Wieghorst once worked on the Cunningham Ranch near Alma. Alma is the site of a Boot Hill cemetery, which is located about two miles north of the town. The "Alma Massacre" involved a raid on <span class="loc">United States</span> settlers' homes around Alma in 1880. As many as 41 people were killed during and immediately after the event. There were two memorials erected to commemorate these events.</p>
