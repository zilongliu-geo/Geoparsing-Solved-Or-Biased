<p>Fiery crash kills three . Three people were in one pickup -- Marshall, his friend Andrew Kummer, 25, and an unidentified young man. Mason, <span class="loc">Devon</span> and the driver believed to be Mason's father were in the other. Business cards belonging to Jason Berube, of <span class="loc">Chatham</span>, were strewn across the scene. A happy family reunion in central Ontario's picturesque cottage country was marred by tragedy yesterday, as two bodies were pulled from a Muskoka lake and a distraught man tried to come to grips with how he helplessly watched his wife and 12-year-old daughter slip into the frigid waters.</p>
