  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Aberdeen</span> /ˈæbərdiːn/ is a city in <span class="loc">Grays</span> <span class="loc">Harbor County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, founded by <span class="per">Samuel Benn</span> in <span class="date">1884</span>. <span class="per">Aberdeen</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">May 12, 1890</span>. The city is the economic center of <span class="loc">Grays</span> <span class="loc">Harbor County</span>, bordering the <span class="loc">cities of Hoquiam and Cosmopolis</span>. <span class="per">Aberdeen</span> is called the "<span class="org">Gateway</span> to the <span class="loc">Olympic Peninsula</span>" and is best known for being the birthplace and hometown of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobainand <span class="per">Bryan Danielson</span>. Some Nirvana lyrics, in songs such as "Something in the Way" and parts of the Bleach album, referred to locations within the town. The population was 16,896 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Aberdeen</span> was named for a local salmon cannery to reflect its Scottish fishing port namesake of <span class="per">Aberdeen</span> and because it too is also situated at the mouth of two rivers just like its namesake in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> which is located between the rivers 'Don' at the north and the river 'Dee' to the south side of the Scottish city. Although it became the largest and best-known city in <span class="loc">Grays Harbor</span>, <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> lagged behind neighbors <span class="loc">Hoquiam</span> and <span class="loc">Cosmopolis</span> in the early <span class="date">years</span>. When A.J. West built the town's first sawmill in <span class="date">1894</span>, the other two municipalities had been in business for <span class="date">several years</span>. <span class="per">Aberdeen</span> and its neighbors vied to be the terminus for Northern Pacific Railroad, but instead of ending at one of the established mill towns, the railroad skimmed through <span class="loc">Cosmopolis</span> and headed west for <span class="loc">Ocosta</span>. <span class="per">Hoquiam</span> and <span class="per">Aberdeen</span> citizens banded together to build a spur; and in <span class="date">1895</span>, the line connected Northern Pacific tracks to <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span>.</p><br><br>
