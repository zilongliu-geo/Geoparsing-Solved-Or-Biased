  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Selma</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Bexar</span>, <span class="loc">Comal</span>, and <span class="loc">Guadalupe counties</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. It is part of the <span class="org">San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area</span>. The population was 5,540 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 788 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The <span class="loc">Retama</span> Park horse racing track is located in <span class="loc">Selma</span>. The town was famous as a speed trap as referenced in the <span class="per">Steve Earle</span> song "Guitar Town". <span class="loc">Selma</span> was settled in <span class="date">1847</span> by immigrants from various countries. In <span class="date">1849</span>, the <span class="per">Harrison</span> and <span class="per">Brown</span> stagecoach stop was built in <span class="loc">Selma</span> to handle passengers and freight on the <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> to Austin stagecoach line. <span class="per">John Harrison</span> and his wife <span class="per">Martha</span> moved to <span class="loc">Selma</span> in <span class="date">1852</span>, and he became the first postmaster of the town when the post office opened in <span class="date">1856</span>. <span class="per">Harrison</span> was also co-owner of the <span class="per">Harrison</span> and <span class="per">McCulloch</span> stage line, which ran a postal route through <span class="loc">Selma</span>. <span class="per">Harrison</span>'s house still stands by <span class="loc">Cibolo</span> Creek, where it was built and is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. German and Polish immigrants constituted most of the next wave of immigrants that settled in the area. By <span class="date">1885</span>, the population was 145, and at <span class="date">the turn of the century</span>, the population peaked at 600. The population began a quick decline, so much that by <span class="date">1906</span> the post office was closed. Selma's population dropped to 100 in <span class="date">1940</span>. The city incorporated in <span class="date">1964</span> and has seen tremendous growth along the Interstate 35 corridor since <span class="date">2000</span>.</p><br><br>
