  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Puerto Real</span> is a seaport in <span class="loc">Andalusia</span>, in the <span class="loc">province of Cádiz</span>. As of <span class="date">2010</span>, it had a population 40,667. The town is located on the northern shore of the inner lobe of the Bay of Cádiz, on the site of the ancient Roman settlement of Portus Gaditanus. An ancient trading post, it is probably the oldest settlement on the Bay of Cádiz. It owes its modern name to the fact that it was rebuilt in <span class="date">1488</span> by <span class="per">Ferdinand II</span> of <span class="per">Aragon</span> and <span class="per">Isabella</span> I of <span class="loc">Castile</span>. <span class="loc">Puerto Real</span> boasts public squares and broad streets; it also has a town-hall building and a 16th-century church, which was constructed in several styles (Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque). The town of <span class="loc">Puerto Real</span> has two separate zones with two separate characters, a maritime zone and a hinterland zone. Central <span class="loc">Puerto Real</span> lies entirely within the maritime zone, facing, as it does, the Bay of <span class="loc">Cadiz</span> and the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> beyond. The inland zone, the so-called hinterland, is far larger in area but far less populated. <span class="loc">Puerto Real</span> borders the towns and cities of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> to the southwest, <span class="loc">Chiclana de la Frontera</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Medina Sidonia</span> to the southeast, <span class="loc">Jerez de la Frontera</span> to the north and northeast, and <span class="loc">El Puerto de Santa Maria</span> to the northwest.</p><br><br>
