  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hanover</span>, a small town in the Northern Cape Province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>, is named after <span class="loc">Hanover</span> in <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The town was established in <span class="date">1854</span>. Much of the farming in the area is with Merino sheep. The Fountain, a powerful spring in town, releases about 205,000 litres of water per day. A footpath leads up to <span class="loc">Trappieskop</span> which offers panoramic views of the area. <span class="loc">Hanover</span> claims to be the country's most central place. It is equidistant from Cape Town and <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span>, centrally positioned between Cape Town and <span class="loc">Durban</span> as well as <span class="loc">Port Elizabeth</span> and <span class="loc">Upington</span> and it is the hub of an arc formed by <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">Middelburg</span> and <span class="loc">Colesberg</span>. Historic figures were at the centre of life here, people like <span class="per">Olive Schreiner</span>, author and women's rights champion, and the tempestuous <span class="per">Rev. Thomas Francois Burgers</span>. Among its residents were the wealthy and eccentric. The town's chief constable was the grandson of <span class="per">Lord Charles Somerset</span>, the magistrate's clerk a son of <span class="per">Charles John Vaughan</span>, Dean of <span class="loc">Llandaff</span>, well-known churchman and devotional writer of his day, and the local doctor was the son of a former Solicitor-General of <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>.</p><br><br>
