  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cache County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 9,495 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, with an estimated population of 11,014 in <span class="date">2014</span>. It is included in the Logan, <span class="loc">Utah-Idaho Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, and is the second largest city in the area after Logan, the county seat. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is home to Sky View High School, where students from all of northern <span class="loc">Cache County</span> come to study. Originally known as "<span class="loc">Summit Creek</span>", <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> was founded in <span class="date">1857</span> by <span class="per">Robert Thornley</span> and his cousin <span class="per">Seth Langdon</span> who were sent north from <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span> by <span class="per">Brigham Young</span> to found a settlement on <span class="loc">Summit Creek</span>. After a preliminary scouting, <span class="per">Robert</span> returned with his new wife <span class="per">Annie Brighton</span>. The first <span class="date">winter</span> was spent in a wagon box. By the <span class="date">next summer</span>, with more settlers arriving, a small fort was built on the edge of the creek, one cabin of which remains. As the settlement grew, a bishop was named and the town took his name. By <span class="date">1917</span> the town had planted trees on both sides of its Main Street and had acquired a <span class="loc">Carnegie</span> library and a Rotary club. Dependent for <span class="date">many years</span> on dairying, a <span class="loc">Del Monte</span> canning factory, and the sugar beet industry, the town is <span class="date">now</span> essentially a bedroom community for Logan and its <span class="org">Utah State University</span>.</p><br><br>
