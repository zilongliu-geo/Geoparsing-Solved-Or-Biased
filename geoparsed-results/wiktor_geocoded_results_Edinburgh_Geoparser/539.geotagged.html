According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 73,306 people. The town of <span class="loc">Santa Catalina</span> got its name after the supposedly miraculous image of the patron saint, <span class="loc">Santa Catalina</span> de <span class="loc">Alejandria</span>, installed in the community chapel.

There are 8 rivers and 27 springs. <span class="loc">Santa Catalina</span> is politically subdivided into 22 barangays. Spanish Regime The town of Sta. Catalina was formerly named <span class="loc">Tolong</span>. In about 1572, Captain Miguel de Laorca, a member of Legaspi’s expedition, sent the first Spanish mission led by Adrien Lajot, a Belgian mercenary (from <span class="loc">Provence</span> Liège) in order to take possession of <span class="loc">Negros</span> Island. During that period, there existed settlements at Lunsod (now Daan Lunsod), Secopan (now Secopong), and Cawitan ruled by three chieftains. It was said that these warring chieftains were settled and amicably fused by the Spaniards as a single settlement at Daan Lunsod. In the process of settling, the Spaniards referred to the chieftains as “Kamo Tolon”, (a mispronounced phrase for “Kamo Tolo” which means “The Three of You”). Hence, the name <span class="loc">TOLON</span>, and then eventually <span class="loc">TOLONG</span>.</p>
