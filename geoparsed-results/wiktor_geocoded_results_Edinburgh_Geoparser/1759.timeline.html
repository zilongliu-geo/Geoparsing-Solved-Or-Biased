  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Nelson</span> is a small fishing town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located on at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Glenelg River</span> and on <span class="loc">Discovery Bay</span>, a few kilometres from the South Australian border, and 422 kilometres (262 mi) west of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. At the <span class="date">2006</span> census, <span class="per">Nelson</span> and the surrounding area had a population of 226. In <span class="date">January 1852</span> the name of <span class="per">Nelson</span> was adopted for the settlement, after the ship <span class="per">Lady Nelson</span>,   which was used by Lieutenant <span class="per">James Grant</span> in explorations of the area in the early nineteenth century. A punt was built across the river in <span class="date">1848</span> by <span class="per">Henry Kellett</span>. A summerhouse was also built in <span class="date">1848</span>, which later became the town's current hotel. The town site was surveyed and named in <span class="date">1852</span> by <span class="per">Lindsay Clarke</span>, and sheep grazing began soon after. Settlement of the township came much later, a Post Office being opened on <span class="date">17 March 1876</span>. The Portland-Nelson Road is the only main road in and out of <span class="per">Nelson</span> and crosses the <span class="loc">Glenelg</span> at <span class="per">Nelson</span> and is the only crossing for over 25 km. The first crossing over the <span class="loc">Glenelg</span> was constructed out of wood in <span class="date">1893</span>. It was replaced by the current steel cantilever bridge in <span class="date">1963</span>.</p><br><br>
