<p><span class="loc">Stamford</span> is a city located on the border of <span class="loc">Jones</span> and <span class="loc">Haskell</span> counties in west central <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The population was 3,124 according to the 2010 census. Henry McHarg, president of the Texas Central Railroad, named the site in 1900 for his hometown of <span class="loc">Stamford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. The city is home to the Texas Cowboy Reunion. <span class="loc">Stamford</span> is located on <span class="loc">US</span> Highway 277 and State Highway 6. Most of the city is in <span class="loc">Jones County</span>, one of 46 dry counties in Texas. The portion of the city within <span class="loc">Jones County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Abilene</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. While the town was named by Henry King McHarg for <span class="loc">Stamford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, the townsite was donated by the family of Swante Magnus Swenson. Mr. Swenson was the first Swedish immigrant to <span class="loc">Texas</span>. He became one of the largest landowners in Texas, and by 1860 his holdings in West Texas approached 500,000 acres (202,343 ha). These ranches, which spread across twelve <span class="loc">Texas counties</span>, became known as SMS Ranches. Later reorganized as the <span class="loc">Swenson</span> Land and Cattle Company, it is headquartered in <span class="loc">Stamford</span> to this day. Mr. Swenson had two sons, Eric Pierson and Swen Albin, who became known as the Swenson brothers. They ran SMS Ranches, and even developed a Morab horse breeding program near the city.</p>
