  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mendez</span> (full name: Mendez-Nuñez) is a fourth class urban municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Cavite</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> Philippine census, it has a population of 28,570 people in an area of 43.27 square kilometers. The municipality of <span class="loc">Mendez</span> is located 66 kilometres (41 mi) from <span class="loc">Metro Manila</span> and is accessible via Aguinaldo Highway. It is one of the smallest and upland towns of <span class="loc">Cavite province</span>. It is bounded to the north and east by <span class="loc">Indang</span>, to the south by <span class="loc">Tagaytay</span>, and to the west by Alfonso. <span class="loc">Mendez</span> is politically subdivided into 24 barangays. The town of Mendez-Nuñez was originally known as "Gahitan", one of the many barrios of <span class="loc">Indang</span>. The name was derived from the word "gahit" meaning "to cut", because the people then had to cut down tall and thick cogon grass that abounded in the place in order to clear areas for agricultural and residential purpose. As time went on, the number of houses in Gahitan increased so that the sitio eventually became a barrio and finally a full-fledged town on <span class="date">1 December 1875</span>, thanks to <span class="per">Governor-General Jose Malcampo</span> y <span class="loc">Monje</span> (<span class="date">1874</span>-<span class="date">1877</span>). <span class="per">Malcampo</span> incorporated the three barrios of Gahitan, <span class="loc">Palocpoc</span> and <span class="loc">Anuling</span> into one independent municipality called Méndez Núñez, after a Spanish naval officer and close friend, Commodore Castro Méndez Núñez. In <span class="date">1856</span>, when they were still Spanish naval officers, <span class="per">Malcampo</span> and <span class="per">Mendez-Nuñez</span>, established the first Masonic lodge in <span class="loc">Kawit</span> under a charter from the <span class="loc">Grand Lodge</span> of <span class="loc">Portugal</span>. The friendship of these two officers had been tested in many a battle against Muslim pirates in <span class="loc">Mindanao</span>.</p><br><br>
