  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>County gets $36k for ‘05 bridge collapse. <span class="loc">Henry County</span> stands to receive about $36,000 in damages for the destruction of Bridge 136 over <span class="loc">Big Creek</span>, which collapsed in <span class="date">2005</span> while a semi was attempting to cross it. The case went to a jury <span class="date">last week</span>, with Trans Am Trucking Company, which operated the semi, seeking to pay no damages at all. Announcing the result at the county supervisors’ meeting this morning, County Engineer <span class="per">Bill Belzer</span> said the final award would be about $35,900, plus an unknown amount of interest. It was a considerably smaller amount than the county had hoped for. “I didn’t think we’d get less than $50,000,” <span class="per">Belzer</span> said, “considering the fact that <span class="loc">Washington County</span> had a smaller bridge that they got more money for.”</p><br><br>
