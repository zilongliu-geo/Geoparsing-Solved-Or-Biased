  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Quincy (formerly, Quinsy) is a census-designated place and the county seat of <span class="loc">Plumas County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The population was 1,728 during the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 1,879 during the <span class="date">2000</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. Quincy started as a Gold Rush community just outside <span class="loc">Elizabethtown, CA.</span> <span class="loc">Elizabethtown</span> started in <span class="date">1852</span> and slowly dissolved and moved a mile away into American Valley to form Quincy after <span class="date">1858</span>. Quincy is named after the <span class="loc">city of Quincy</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, named in turn after <span class="per">John Quincy Adams</span> (<span class="date">1767</span> - <span class="date">1848</span>), the sixth president of the <span class="loc">United States</span> (<span class="date">1825</span> - <span class="date">1829</span>). The Quincy post office opened in <span class="date">1855</span>. <span class="per">James H. Bradley</span>, one of the organizers of <span class="loc">Plumas County</span>, donated the land at Quincy for establishment of the county seat. He then laid out the town and named it after his ranch in <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. Quincy is located at 39°56′11″N 120°56′53″W (39.936279, -120.947921). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 4.2 square miles (11 km2), all of it is land. Quincy is underlain by metasedimentary rock of the Shoo Fly Complex. Its dominant silica-rich clastic material weathers to a stony coarse soil which includes the well or somewhat excessively drained alluvial fan material (mainly Forgay very gravelly sandy loam) on which most of Quincy's businesses and homes have been built. Cultivated land north of the residential area lies on poorly drained loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam.</p><br><br>
