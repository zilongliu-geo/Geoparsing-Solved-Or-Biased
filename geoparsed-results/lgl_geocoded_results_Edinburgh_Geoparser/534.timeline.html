  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Analysis: PA officials welcome failure of Schalit talks. Some Palestinian Authority officials in Ramallah have welcomed the failure of the prisoner exchange negotiations between <span class="loc">Israel</span> and Hamas as good news. Palestinian women attend a protest held by the Islamic Jihad movement calling for the release of prisoners jailed in <span class="loc">Israel</span>. Photo: AP "I know several Palestinian officials here who were happy to hear that the talks between <span class="loc">Israel</span> and Hamas had collapsed," he said. "They were concerned that such a deal would embolden Hamas and undermine the credibility of <span class="loc">Fatah</span>." The reopening of the crossings, especially the Rafah terminal, would only help Hamas tighten its grip on <span class="loc">Gaza</span>, the official pointed out. "We must not forget that Hamas seized power in the <span class="loc">Gaza Strip</span> through a military coup [in <span class="date">2007</span>]. As such, Hamas is not a legitimate authority there," he said. The PA was also worried the release of hundreds of Hamas operatives to their homes in the <span class="loc">West Bank</span> would have created a big headache for its security forces. The PA would have preferred to see many of the Hamas prisoners and their families "relocated" to other areas, such as the <span class="loc">Gaza Strip</span>. <span class="per">Hassan Salameh</span>, <span class="per">Ibrahim Hamed</span>, <span class="per">Abdullah Barghouti</span>, <span class="loc">Abbas</span> a-Sayed and Jamal <span class="per">Abu al-Hija</span> were behind one of Hamas's deadliest military infrastructures in the <span class="loc">West Bank</span>. As experts in preparing various types of explosive devices, they are responsible for the killing of hundreds of people during the second intifada. <span class="loc">Abbas</span>'s aides are not worried as much about the parties that would be held for the released Hamas prisoners as about the high probability the released men would rebuild their movement's military infrastructure in the <span class="loc">West Bank</span> and resume terror activities not only against <span class="loc">Israel</span>, but also against the PA. The crackdown, PA officials explained, was a preemptive measure designed to thwart any attempt by Hamas to extend its control to the <span class="loc">West Bank</span>. As far as these officials are concerned, the tough anti-Hamas measures are "working." <span class="date">Today</span>, there's almost no such thing as a Hamas political or military leadership in the <span class="loc">West Bank</span>, since most of the movement's prominent figures are either in Israeli prisons or in <span class="loc">Abbas</span>'s detention centers. Another PA official said the only way to "minimize the damage" resulting from a prisoner exchange deal with Hamas was by persuading <span class="loc">Israel</span> to release a large number of inmates as a gesture to <span class="loc">Abbas</span> and <span class="loc">Fatah</span>. He said it would be a "disaster" for <span class="loc">Abbas</span> if <span class="loc">Israel</span> released important prisoners such as <span class="loc">Fatah</span> leader <span class="per">Marwan Barghouti</span> in the context of a deal with Hamas and not <span class="loc">Fatah</span>.</p><br><br>
