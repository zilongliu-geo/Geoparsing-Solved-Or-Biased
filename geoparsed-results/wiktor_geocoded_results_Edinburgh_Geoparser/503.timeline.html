  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Miramar</span> is a suburb of Wellington, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, south-east of the city centre. It is on the <span class="loc">Miramar</span> Peninsula, directly east of the isthmus of Rongotai, the site of <span class="org">Wellington International Airport</span>. '<span class="loc">Miramar</span>' means "sea view" in Spanish. The name was chosen by the first European to settle in the area, <span class="loc">Scotsman</span> <span class="per">James Coutts</span> <span class="loc">Crawford</span> (<span class="date">1817</span>-<span class="date">1889</span>). <span class="loc">Crawford</span> was a former Royal Navy officer turned businessman and colonist, who arrived in Wellington in <span class="date">1840</span>. <span class="loc">Crawford</span> established a farm on the peninsula, which at the time was known as Watt's Peninsula, and drained a large lagoon known as <span class="loc">Burnham</span> Water. This lagoon covered much of the low-lying land on the peninsula; <span class="date">now</span> this area is occupied by suburban houses, streets, parks and shops. The original MƒÅori name for the area when it was still an island was Te Motu Kairangi (meaning "esteemed" or "precious" island). On <span class="date">18 November 1904</span> <span class="loc">Miramar Borough</span> was formed. In <span class="date">April 1921</span>, <span class="loc">Miramar</span> was incorporated into the <span class="loc">City of Wellington</span>. The records of the <span class="loc">Miramar Borough</span> Council were transferred to the <span class="loc">City of Wellington</span> at the time of amalgamation and can still be accessed <span class="date">today</span> through <span class="loc">Wellington City</span> Council.</p><br><br>
