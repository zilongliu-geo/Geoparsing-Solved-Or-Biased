  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">DuPage County</span> in 60 Seconds. Twin sisters <span class="per">Lindsay</span> and <span class="per">Charlotte</span> Graham, students at St. <span class="per">John</span>'s <span class="org">Lutheran School</span> in <span class="loc">Lombard</span>, won first- and second-place awards respectively in the annual <span class="per">Sheldon Peck</span> letter-writing contest. Each year <span class="loc">Lombard</span> fifth-graders pretend to be <span class="per">Sheldon Peck</span>, an early <span class="loc">Lombard</span> settler and portrait artist, writing to <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span> in <span class="date">1848</span>. <span class="date">This year</span> more than 40 handwritten letters were judged on historical accuracy, letter-writing skills and student research on pioneer life in <span class="loc">Babcock</span> Grove (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Lombard</span>). The awards were given <span class="date">Sunday</span> at <span class="loc">Sheldon Peck Homestead</span> in <span class="loc">Lombard</span>. <span class="per">Lindsay</span> received $40 with her first-place certificate and <span class="per">Charlotte</span> received $25. The third-place certificate and $10 was given to <span class="per">Amanda Chlebek</span>, a fifth-grader at Pleasant Lane School. The winning letters will be featured in a <span class="org">Lombard Historical Society</span> newsletter and <span class="loc">Lombard</span>'s TV Cable 6. Roselle police ticketed hundreds of motorists <span class="date">last month</span> as part of a traffic crackdown partially funded with state grant money. Police said they issued 584 citations for speeding in <span class="date">February</span>. They also made 13 DUI arrests and wrote 63 tickets for failure to wear a seat belt. Another 115 citations were issued for other violations. The grant money Roselle police received from <span class="loc">Illinois</span> <span class="loc">Department of Transportation</span> covered the cost of overtime for speed enforcement. Roselle officers <span class="date">this month</span> are continuing the speed enforcement efforts. DuPage Sheriff <span class="per">John Zaruba</span> is warning residents about two recent scams that his deputies are investigating. In one case, a resident who lives near <span class="loc">Bensenville</span> lost an undisclosed amount of money when they followed a caller's instructions to wire money to <span class="loc">Canada</span> for a family member's bond. The resident assumed the caller was truthful since the family member was named but, later, the resident learned that relative had never been arrested and was not even in <span class="loc">Canada</span>. In the second scam, a resident who lives near <span class="loc">Glen Ellyn</span> reported a telephone scam in which a caller requested the victim send money to cover processing fees for his Canadian Lottery winnings. The victim became suspicious and, instead of sending the money, alerted authorities.</p><br><br>
