<p><span class="loc">Santa Rita</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Grant County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>. The site of Chino copper mine, <span class="loc">Santa Rita</span> was located fifteen miles east of <span class="loc">Silver City</span>. Copper mining in the area began late in the Spanish colonial period, but it was not until 1803 that Franscisco Manuel Elguea, a Chihuahua banker and businessman, founded the town of <span class="loc">Santa Rita</span>. He named it <span class="loc">Santa Rita del Cobre</span> (Saint Rita of the Copper), after Saint Rita of <span class="loc">Cascia</span> and the existing mine. During the early 19th century the mine produced over 6 million pounds of copper annually. The crudely smeltered ore was shipped to Chihuahua for further smelting and then sent to <span class="loc">Mexico City</span> on mule back. The area was relatively peaceful, despite an occasional attack from the Warm Springs (<span class="loc">Mimbres</span>) band of the Chiricahua Apache, who lived nearby at the headwaters of the <span class="loc">Gila</span> and <span class="loc">Mimbres</span> rivers. In 1837, however, an American trader named John Johnson lured the Apaches to a gathering and then massacred them to sell their scalps for the bounty offer by the Mexican government.  This caused open warfare and almost all of the nearly 500 inhabitants of <span class="loc">Santa Rita</span> were killed in an attack on the town; only six managed to reach safety in Chihuahua. The town was abandoned until 1849, when the U.S.Army established a command post on the site, calling it Cantonment Dawson. (See Apache-Mexico Wars)</p>
