  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>For other places and things named <span class="loc">Trinidad</span>, see <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> (disambiguation). <span class="loc">Trinidad</span>, officially La Santísima Trinidad (Spanish: The Most <span class="loc">Holy Trinity</span>), is a city in <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>, capital of the department of <span class="loc">Beni</span>. The population is 130,000 (<span class="date">2010</span> official estimate). The city was founded in <span class="date">1686</span> by Padre Cipriano Barace. In <span class="date">1769</span> the town moved to its current location, 9 miles away, due to flooding. The original city was on the Mamoré River, but flooding and disease forced a move on the location of the city. It is located in the <span class="loc">province of Cercado</span>, one of Beni’s eight provinces. Sited on the southern edge of the Amazon basin on the <span class="per">Llanos de Moxos</span>/Mojos, the climate is hot and humid at all times. One of the more notable features of the city is the open drains that surrounds every block of buildings. These are linked together by lidded ditches and thence to the local river. These are necessary due to the heavy rainfall that occurs between <span class="date">December</span> and <span class="date">May</span>. <span class="loc">Trinidad</span>, located in the Bolivian tropics, is hot and humid most of the year. This region of the country is heavily forested and many large rivers (all tributaries of the Amazon river) run through <span class="loc">Beni</span>. Like most cities in <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>, it is built around a central plaza with a large Catholic cathedral as its centerpiece. <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> was originally a small Jesuit town but is <span class="date">now</span> a large city with over 100,000 inhabitants. Its mission-style church was demolished and rebuilt in <span class="date">1923</span>. Despite these changes, many of the original religious relics, paintings and statues are still housed in the cathedral, which faces the main plaza.</p><br><br>
