<p>Dalton /ˈdəltən/ is a small inland country town in the Southern Tablelands of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> in Upper Lachlan Shire. Dalton is north of the Hume Highway that joins <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, between <span class="loc">Goulburn</span> and <span class="loc">Yass</span> in southern <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, 255 kilometres (158 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and 79 kilometres (49 mi) north of the national capital, <span class="loc">Canberra</span>. Nearby towns are <span class="loc">Cullerin</span>, <span class="loc">Gundaroo</span>, <span class="loc">Gunning</span>, <span class="loc">Yass</span>, and <span class="loc">Murrumbateman</span>. The <span class="loc">Monaro region</span> is renowned for its sheep wool industry, notably for the Merino breed. The dry-land farming supports both summer and winter wheat, and some other cereal crops, but agriculture also extends to cattle production for meat. The vibrancy of Dalton's heyday in the 19th century as a sheep-shearing centre is gone, lost in 1875 when the train line was routed through nearby <span class="loc">Gunning</span> rather than Dalton. Today the town is taking on a new role as a rural-residential centre, with generally well-maintained wide streets and churches, a school, a viable hotel (pub), post office services, and a petrol station.</p>
