Its slogan is the "<span class="org">Crossroads of the South</span>". It is believed that early settlers in <span class="loc">Middleton</span> came from Slab Town, a small settlement about three miles north. The town was originally called Jenkins-McCommons Crossing, after <span class="per">Jesse Jenksins</span> and <span class="per">William Taylor McCommons</span>.

Following the expansion of the <span class="loc">Memphis</span> and Charleston Railroad and the construction of a railroad depot, <span class="loc">Middleton</span> was chartered in <span class="date">1850</span>. It was named after an official at the <span class="loc">Memphis</span> and Charleston Railroad. The town would suffer greatly during the Civil War. After the war, only one building, a small log structure that served as a store, was left standing. <span class="loc">Middleton</span> is located at 35°3′32″N 88°53′30″W (35.058798, -88.891728).
