<p><span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Tolland County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 26,543 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> was incorporated in October 1702 from the Town of <span class="loc">Windham</span>, in <span class="loc">Hartford County</span>. When <span class="loc">Windham County</span> was formed on 12 May 1726, <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> then became part of that county. A century later, at a town meeting on 3 April 1826, selectmen voted to ask the General Assembly to annex <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> to <span class="loc">Tolland County</span>. That occurred the following year. The town of <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> contains the community of <span class="loc">Storrs</span>, which is home to the main campus of the University of Connecticut and the associated Connecticut Repertory Theatre. The first silk mill in the <span class="loc">United States</span> was constructed in <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> and financed by pilgrim descendent, William Fisk. The town, along with neighboring <span class="loc">Willimantic</span>, played an important role in the manufacture of thread and other textiles. Though nothing remains of the mill (now on display at the Henry <span class="loc">Ford Museum</span> in <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>), <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> has held onto several other historic landmarks. A fully intact gristmill, dating to 1835, the Gurleyville Gristmill is the only one of its kind in <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. Built on the <span class="loc">Fenton River</span>, this stone grist mill remains intact with the original equipment. There are tours available May through October. The adjacent miller's house is the birthplace of former CT governor Wilbur L. Cross. More recent yet rare nonetheless, the Mansfield Drive-in, a drive-in movie theater, and Lucky Strike Lanes, a duckpin bowling alley, are among the last of their breed in the nation.</p>
