As of the 2010 census, the population was 49,221. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Catskill</span>. The county's name is in honor of the American Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene. On March 25, 1800, <span class="loc">Greene County</span> was created by the partitioning of <span class="loc">Albany</span> (360 Square Miles) and <span class="loc">Ulster</span> (270 Square Miles) counties, producing a county of 620 square miles (1,600 km2). On April 3, 1801, 90 square miles (230 km2) of land was transferred from <span class="loc">Delaware</span> and <span class="loc">Ulster</span> counties, raising the total area to 710 square miles (1,800 km2). This transferred <span class="loc">Prattsville</span>, <span class="loc">Vly Mountain</span>, Halcott Center, <span class="loc">Bushnellsville</span>, <span class="loc">Highmount</span>, <span class="loc">Shandaken</span>, <span class="loc">Lanesville</span>, and <span class="loc">Pine Hill</span> within <span class="loc">Greene County</span>. On May 26, 1812, <span class="loc">Greene County</span> lost 20 square miles (52 km2) to <span class="loc">Ulster County</span>, lowering the total area to 690 square miles (1,800 km2), reassigning <span class="loc">Pine Hill</span>, <span class="loc">Highmount</span>, and <span class="loc">Shandaken</span> to <span class="loc">Ulster County</span>. On April 15, 1814, the county borders were re-surveyed, and the line adjusted with no change in area.</p>
