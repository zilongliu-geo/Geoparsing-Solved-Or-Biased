<p><span class="loc">Boya</span> is a locality on the Darling Scarp, in the Shire of <span class="loc">Mundaring</span>, Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>. On the south side of <span class="loc">Greenmount</span> Hill, and just west of <span class="loc">Darlington</span>. The name of <span class="loc">Boya</span> was not a local Aboriginal word, but was imposed by government officials in the early twentieth century. It was crucial as a site of quarries. The Mountain Quarry and the Government Quarry were both important blue stone quarries in their time. The harbour and moles at <span class="loc">Fremantle</span> were built using stone from the Government quarry. The Government Quarry (on the south eastern part of the locality) was variously named during its time of operation as Mr O'Connor's quarry, the Fremantle Harbour Works <span class="loc">Darlington</span> Quarry, the Public Works Quarry, the Government Quarry, and, currently, as Hudman Road Quarry. Being at the edge of the <span class="loc">Greenmount</span> National Park and the Hudman Road Quarry, <span class="loc">Boya</span> has been subject to serious threatening bushfires spreading from these locations in recent years. In the history of the early Eastern Railway, which passed through <span class="loc">Boya</span>, <span class="loc">Boya</span> was the location of '<span class="loc">Cape Horn</span>' a notorious curve at the 22 miles mark, where runaway trains derailed a number of times.</p>
