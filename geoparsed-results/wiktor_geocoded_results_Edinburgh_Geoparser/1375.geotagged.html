<p><span class="loc">Cleveland</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Pawnee County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. The 2010 census population was 3,251, a decrease of 0.9 percent from 3,282 at the 2000 census. After the Cherokee Outlet opening, a homesteader by the name of <span class="loc">Willis</span> H. Herbert established a town named Herbert by opening a post office on the current townsite of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> on October 28, 1893. The Post Office department subsequently withdrew the approval of the Herbert post office. The post office was then moved 100 feet, and reestablished under the name <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, named in honor of then President <span class="loc">Grover Cleveland</span> on April 19, 1894. By 1900, the town's population was 211. Before the discovery of oil in the area, the town served as a trade center between the local farmers and the Osage Tribe who lived on the reservation was on the other side of the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> river. In 1904, a railroad line owned by the <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> Railroad (later known as <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Texas Railway or Katy) from <span class="loc">Oklahoma City</span> reached <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> and crossed the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River into <span class="loc">Osage County</span>. On May 27, 1904, the first oil well was spudded near the community, and it caused an influx of oil workers and other people. At the time of statehood in 1907, <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> had 1,441 residents.</p>
