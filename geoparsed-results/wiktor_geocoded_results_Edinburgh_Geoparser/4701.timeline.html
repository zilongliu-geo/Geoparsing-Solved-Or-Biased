  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Grantham</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Lockyer</span> Valley region of <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The town is located 100 kilometres (62 mi) west of the state capital, <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Grantham</span> and the surrounding area had a population of 492. The area was first settled in <span class="date">1841</span>, by <span class="per">George Mocatta</span>. In <span class="date">1866</span> a railway siding from the main Toowoomba line was opened which assisted in the development of a small settlement. It wasn't until the mid-1879s that a railway station was built. A butter factory was established in <span class="date">1907</span>. The building was replaced in <span class="date">1926</span> by a brick building which operated until <span class="date">1971</span>. <span class="org">Grantham Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">1 January 1890</span> (a receiving office had been open from <span class="date">1876</span>). On <span class="date">10 January 2011</span>, <span class="loc">Grantham</span> was severely damaged in a huge flash flood. Twelve people lost their lives and a large number of houses and other buildings were destroyed. Following the floods, <span class="loc">Grantham</span> received visits by politicians including <span class="org">Queensland Premier</span> <span class="per">Anna Bligh</span> on numerous occasions. <span class="loc">Australia</span>'s Governor-General <span class="per">Quentin Bryce</span> also visited the town. In <span class="date">May 2011</span>, it was announced that the town would be moved to higher ground to prevent future damaging floods. A 935-acre site was purchased so that landholders could be provided a voluntary swap of equivalent-sized blocks. The new site is situated on a hill overlooking <span class="loc">Grantham</span> and has permission from the state government to bypass the normal development approval process. Resident of nearby <span class="loc">Murphys Creek</span>, Postmans Ridge, <span class="per">Withcott</span> and <span class="per">Helidon</span> have been included in the fast-tracked plan.</p><br><br>
