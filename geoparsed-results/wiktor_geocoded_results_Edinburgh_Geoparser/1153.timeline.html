  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Ceres</span> is the administrative centre and largest town of the Witzenberg Local Municipality in the Western Cape Province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. <span class="loc">Ceres</span> serves as a regional centre for the surrounding towns of <span class="org">Wolseley</span>, <span class="loc">Tulbagh</span>, <span class="loc">Op-die-Berg</span> and <span class="loc">Prince Alfred Hamlet</span>. It is situated in the <span class="loc">Warmbokkeveld</span> (Afrikaans: "warm antelope field") Valley about 170 km north-east of Cape Town. <span class="loc">Ceres</span> is located at the north-eastern entrance to <span class="loc">Michell's Pass</span> and was the old route north between Cape Town and <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span>, which was later replaced by the N1 highway, which traverses the Breede River Valley to the south. It was named after the Roman goddess of agriculture, <span class="loc">Ceres</span>, a name which is fitting as the valley in which the town is situated is extremely fertile and is a major producer of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>'s deciduous fruit. <span class="loc">Ceres</span> experiences a typical Mediterranean climate tempered by its altitude. The town experiences warmer temperatures in <span class="date">summer</span>, due to its inland location with infrequent rainfall, however winters are cool to quite cold and wet, with frequent snowfalls on the surrounding higher-lying ground, rarely falling on the valley floor itself. Total annual precipitation averages <span class="date">1088</span> mm, with average temperatures ranging from a <span class="date">February</span> maximum of 29,9 °C to a <span class="date">July</span> minimum of 2,4 °C.</p><br><br>
