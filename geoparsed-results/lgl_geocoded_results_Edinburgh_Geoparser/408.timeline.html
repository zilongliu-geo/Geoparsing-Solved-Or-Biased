  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>3 officers treated at hospital after cruisers collide. Three <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> police officers were in stable condition last night at the <span class="org">Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania</span> after their cruisers collided at 50th Street and Haverford Avenue, authorities said. The officers, whose names were not released, were responding <span class="date">yesterday afternoon</span> to a call for assistance from another police officer who was pursuing a drug suspect at 50th and Arch Streets, according to authorities. A squad car with two officers was traveling west on <span class="loc">Haverford</span> when it collided shortly after 4 p.m. with another police vehicle carrying the third officer south on 50th. The impact pushed one of the vehicles onto the sidewalk. The officers - one was extracted from his car by <span class="org">the Jaws of Life</span> - complained of neck and back injuries and were being evaluated. The narcotics suspect was finally stopped by police but was not found to have any drugs on him.</p><br><br>
