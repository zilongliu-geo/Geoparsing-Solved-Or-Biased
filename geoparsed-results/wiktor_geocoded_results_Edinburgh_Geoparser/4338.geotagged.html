<p><span class="loc">Jalapa</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>. It is the capital of the department of <span class="loc">Jalapa</span>; it is also the municipal seat of that department's municipality of <span class="loc">Jalapa</span>. It is located 174 kilometres (108 mi) from <span class="loc">Guatemala City</span>. However, there is a shorter road from <span class="loc">Guatemala City</span> to <span class="loc">Jalapa</span> using Atlantic Highway and then going south (exit toward the <span class="loc">city of Sanarate</span>). This way <span class="loc">Jalapa</span> is only around 97 kilometres (60 mi), from <span class="loc">Guatemala City</span>. As of 1850, the population of <span class="loc">Jalapa</span> was approximately 3,500. As of 2002, the town's population reached 122,483. Its cathedral Nuestra Señora de la Expectación is the episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="loc">Jalapa</span> (<span class="loc">Guatemala</span>). The <span class="loc">city of Jalapa</span> was built in a valley, surrounded by the Jumay volcano and the mountains of Alcoba and Arluta and the <span class="loc">Jalapa</span> Mountains. For this reason and its altitude, 1,362 meters above sea level, the weather is mild temperate; it is never too cold and never too hot. The local economy is based on agricultural and livestock products. The department of <span class="loc">Jalapa</span> produces corn and beans which are the main diet of Guatemalans, but also produces fruits such as peaches, apples, blackberries, bananas, avocados and vegetables such as cabbage, lettuce, broccoli and cauliflower, most of which are exported to <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>. <span class="loc">Jalapa</span> also produces dairy products and is famous for its cheese, especially queso seco ("dry cheese", a drier version of queso fresco) and mantequilla de costal ("sack butter"), which is produced mainly in <span class="loc">Monjas</span>, San Manuel Chaparrón, <span class="loc">San Carlos Alzatate</span> and <span class="loc">Jalapa</span>.</p>
