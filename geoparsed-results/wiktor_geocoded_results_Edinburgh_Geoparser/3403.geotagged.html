History People are friendly and courteous to visitors. Most people from the neighboring “cantones” or hamlets display Caucasian features; they may be blond, with fair skin and blue eyes. This may be because the entire department of <span class="loc">Chalatenango</span> was populated by early Spanish settlers attracted by the boom of indigo cultivation in colonial times and sent there by Baron of Carardalet, governor of <span class="loc">Guatemala</span> in the late 18th century. A pdf document published by FISDL, (http://www.fisdl.gob.sv/index2.php?option 902) indicates that “As per Antonio Gutierrez y <span class="loc">Ulloa</span> in 1807 <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> was simply a hacienda of cattle and indigo belonging to Bernardino Aguilar, five leagues N. E. of Tejutla, away from the Royal Road. As per other traditions, that hacienda became a hamlet in 1819 and then, fulfilling the Laws and Orders of Indias it became a village with the long name of San Jose <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> de las <span class="loc">Flores</span>. The new municipality was incorporated to the Region of Tejutla. From 1824 to 1833 it belonged to the department of <span class="loc">San Salvador</span>; to the department of Tejutla in 1833; to the department of <span class="loc">San Salvador</span> from 1833 to 1835; to the department of Cuzcatlan from 1835 to 1855. From then on it has been a municipality of <span class="loc">Chalatenango</span>. In 1890 it had 2,340 souls. Its name comes from two hot springs in the area and another one in the canton of Obrajuelo.”</p>
