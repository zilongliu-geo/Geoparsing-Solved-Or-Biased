<p>Flora is a city in <span class="loc">Clay County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,070 at the 2010 census. Flora was founded by Samuel White. White was born September 10, 1831 in <span class="loc">Warren County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. He and his family came to <span class="loc">Clay County</span> in 1852. During that time, he purchased 85 acres (34 ha) of land from the State of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. His first wife, Sarah Ann Wall was born in 1833. Sarah died December 13, 1859 in Flora, and is buried in the family plot in Elmwood Cemetery. In December 1860, White married Helen M. Riggs in Flora. The original town of Flora was laid out, surveyed and platted in February 1854 by Ethelred Nixon, County Surveyor; John Brown, Trustee for Songer, Camp &amp; Company; and Samuel White. It embraced eighty-five acres of the west half of Section 25, Township 3 north Range 6 east. Samuel White who still owned the land, deeded one-half interest in forty acres to John Brown, Trustee, with a view of securing the town and depot. An effort had already been made to establish a town one mile west called <span class="loc">Mooresville</span>, where over 100 lots had been sold and some buildings done. After the collapse of that village, the principal house was moved to Flora, and was then known as the "Commercial House."</p>
