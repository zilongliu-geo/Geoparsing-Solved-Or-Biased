  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cachoeira</span> (Portuguese, meaning the waterfall), is an inland town of <span class="loc">Bahia</span>, <span class="loc">Brazil</span>, on the Paraguaçu River. The town exports sugar, cotton and tobacco and is a thriving commercial and industrial centre. First settled by the Indians, it was later settled by the Portuguese families of <span class="loc">Dias Adorno</span> and <span class="loc">Rodrigues</span> Martins. It became known as <span class="loc">Nossa Senhora</span> do Rosário in <span class="date">1674</span>. It was a strategic area and was linked with the mining <span class="loc">city of Salvador</span>, the former colonial capital. It became a parish on <span class="date">December 27, 1693</span>. It also became Vila de <span class="loc">Nossa Senhora</span> do Rosário do <span class="loc">Porto</span> da <span class="loc">Cachoeira</span> do Paraguaçu in <span class="date">1698</span>. Sugar cane farming, gold mining on rio das <span class="loc">Contas</span>, increased traffic on royal streets, and navigation on the Rio Paraguaçu combined to boost the regional economy at the beginning of the 18th century. In <span class="date">early 1800</span>, the Cachoeirense society became very important politically. It actively participated in the war of the Independence of <span class="loc">Bahia</span>. The town became a city under the imperial decree of <span class="date">March 13, 1873</span> (Provincial Law 43).</p><br><br>
