It is part of the Wheeling, <span class="loc">West Virginia Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 453 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Belmont</span> was originally known as <span class="loc">Wrightstown</span>, and under the latter name was laid out in 1808 by Joseph Wright. The name was switched to <span class="loc">Belmont</span> in anticipation of being the county seat of <span class="loc">Belmont County</span>. St. Clairsville, however, was given the honor of having <span class="loc">Belmont County</span>'s center of government. The <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio</span> Railroad cut through the town until its dismantling in the 1980s. <span class="loc">Belmont</span> has recently undergone a public sewer project that will enable the village to have sustainable growth and more business development. <span class="loc">Belmont</span> is located at 40°1′39″N 81°2′27″W (40.027560, -81.040807).
