"She was always in the fray and in the thick of things," state party chairman <span class="per">Nick Casey</span> said <span class="date">Monday</span>. "<span class="per">Emilie</span> spent her entire life working tirelessly for what she believed in. This loss is not only a loss to <span class="loc">Mercer County</span>, but to our West <span class="org">Virginia Democratic Party</span> and our entire state, as well," <span class="per">Casey</span> said. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Sens. <span class="per">Robert C. Byrd</span> and <span class="per">Jay Rockefeller</span>, both D-W.

She knew and worked for presidents, senators, congressmen, governors and state legislators, but she also knew county officials and poll workers and others who labor behind the scenes to get things done." Gov. <span class="per">Joe Manchin</span> said he's never met anyone more passionate about her family, her beliefs and her community than <span class="per">Holroyd</span>. "The truth is that we did not always agree, but I have to tell you that I liked it much better when we did," <span class="per">Manchin</span> said. "<span class="per">Emilie</span> had such strong devotion, and she was respected by all who knew her. Our thoughts go out to her husband, <span class="per">Bob</span>, and the many loved ones as they go through this difficult time." <span class="loc">CHARLESTON</span>, <span class="per">W.Va</span>. -- <span class="per">Emilie Holroyd</span>, a longtime fixture in West <span class="org">Virginia Democratic</span> politics and a frequent representative of her state at the party's national conventions, has died at age 74.</p><br><br>
