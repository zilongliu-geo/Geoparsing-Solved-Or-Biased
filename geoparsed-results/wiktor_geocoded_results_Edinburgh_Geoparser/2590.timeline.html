The population was 1,807 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census.

Originally known as <span class="loc">Reno</span> Junction (descendants of <span class="per">Major Reno</span> from Custer's troop resided in the area), the town was renamed "Wright" after the owner of the Long Branch <span class="per">Bar, Dale</span> Wright, who agreed to sell land to <span class="org">Atlantic Richfield Corporation</span>, the developer of the Black Thunder Mine, who planned to build the town to accommodate the work force that would be hired to operate the mine.
