<p><span class="loc">Colonia</span> is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) located within Woodbridge Township, in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the CDP's population was 17,795. In 1919, the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> State Highway Commission built a new road that became part of the Lincoln Highway, an early plan to create a transcontinental highway. The stretch was constructed on the west side of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Railroad (now the Northeast Corridor) from near the northeast of Dow Avenue between <span class="loc">Colonia</span> and <span class="loc">Iselin</span> to Cedar Street in <span class="loc">Menlo</span> Park, to avoid two railroad crossings. The old road is now Middlesex-Essex Turnpike and Thornall Street, on the east side of the tracks. Public schools Schools in <span class="loc">Colonia</span> operated as part of the Woodbridge Township School District are: Elementary schools (K-5) Claremont Avenue Elementary School #20 - Claremont Avenue, Colonia Lynn Crest Elementary School #22 - New Dover Road, <span class="loc">Colonia</span> Oak Ridge Heights Elementary School #21 - <span class="loc">Inman Avenue</span> <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Avenue Elementary School #27 - <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Avenue Middle school (6th-8th)</p>
