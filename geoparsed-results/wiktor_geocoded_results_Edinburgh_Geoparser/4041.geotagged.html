<p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 152,021. The largest city and county seat is Monroe. The county was established as the second county (after <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>) in the Michigan Territory in 1817 and was named for then-President James Monroe. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Monroe</span>, <span class="loc">MI</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area and is included in the Detroit-Warren-Ann <span class="loc">Arbor</span>, <span class="loc">MI</span> Combined Statistical Area. It is unofficially considered a northerly extension of the <span class="loc">Toledo Metropolitan</span> Area. Before the countyâ€™s formation, the primary settlement was <span class="loc">Frenchtown</span>, which was settled in as early as 1784 along the banks of the <span class="loc">River Raisin</span>. The small plot of land was given to the early French settlers by the Potawatomi Native Americans, and the area was claimed for New <span class="loc">France</span>. The settlement of <span class="loc">Frenchtown</span> and the slight northerly settlement of <span class="loc">Sandy Creek</span> drew in a total of about 100 inhabitants. During the War of 1812, the area was the site of the Battle of <span class="loc">Frenchtown</span>, which was the worst American defeat in the war and remains the deadliest conflict ever on Michigan soil. The site of the battle is now part of the <span class="loc">River Raisin</span> National Battlefield Park.</p>
