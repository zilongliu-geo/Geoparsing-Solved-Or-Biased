  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salem</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Dent County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,950 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census which allows <span class="loc">Salem</span> to become a Class 3 city in <span class="loc">Missouri</span>; however, the city has chosen to remain a Class 4 city under <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Revised Statutes. <span class="loc">Salem</span> is located a few miles north of the Ozark Scenic Riverways and close to Montauk State Park, which contains the headwaters of the Current River. The name <span class="loc">Salem</span> is derived from the Hebrew word Shalom, meaning "peace". <span class="loc">Dent County</span> was first explored by Dustin Counts and settled between <span class="date">1818</span> and <span class="date">1829</span>. In <span class="date">1851</span> the <span class="org">Missouri Assembly</span> created <span class="loc">Dent County</span> from <span class="per">Crawford</span> and <span class="per">Shannon</span> counties. It was named for early settler <span class="per">Lewis Dent</span>, who served as the first representative. A log courthouse, built about <span class="date">1851</span> or <span class="date">1852</span>, was <span class="loc">Dent County</span>'s first and was located on the <span class="loc">Wingfield</span> farm northeast of <span class="loc">Salem</span>. <span class="per">W. P. Williams</span> became the first mayor of <span class="loc">Salem</span> in <span class="date">1860</span>, just after the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> State Legislature passed laws regarding the administration of village government. During the American Civil War, <span class="loc">Salem</span> was sometimes manned by units of the 5th <span class="loc">Missouri</span> State Militia. Village governments were suspended during the Civil War. In <span class="date">1881</span>, <span class="loc">Salem</span> was incorporated as a town.</p><br><br>
