<p><span class="loc">San Fernando</span> is a fourth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 33,281. <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> is administratively subdivided into 22 barangays. Ambos Camarines, the old <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span>, included among its "visitas" or barrios the town of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>. The town, however, also remained as a "barrio" of <span class="loc">Milaor</span> for more than 230 years. Pueblo de <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> separated from <span class="loc">Milaor</span> and was established as an independent pueblo on 1 January 1813. The residents of this old settlement were noted for their religious devotion as manifested by their honor and dedication to <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>, the town's patron saint. This patron of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>, according to historical records, was however not the original patron saint for whom the first settlers built the chapel. They actually built a chapel in honor of their patron saint <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>. However, for some unusual reasons, the image was lost after it had been transferred into the newly erected chapel. It was said that efforts were wielded to find the missing icon but it all ended into great frustration as the lost image of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> was not found. One resident from the old site where the image was housed later informed the people of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> that the image returned to its original location. With this incident, the Teniente del Barrio then decided to install the image of another saint, <span class="loc">Saint John</span> the <span class="loc">Baptist</span>. Their celebration of the town and parish fiesta is held every 24 June.</p>
