<p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> has been a civil parish of the <span class="loc">Borough of Chelmsford</span>, <span class="loc">Essex</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> since 1907. The parish takes in the portion of the town north of river <span class="loc">Chelmer</span> and west of the A12 bypass and originally comprised the manors of <span class="loc">Springfield</span> Hall, <span class="loc">Springfield</span> <span class="loc">Barnes</span> (now <span class="loc">Chelmer Village</span>), <span class="loc">Cuton Hall</span>, and in part <span class="loc">New Hall</span> (now <span class="loc">Beaulieu</span> Park). Until the 1950s the parish was a semi-rural village lying one mile north east of <span class="loc">Chelmsford</span>, on the old Roman Road, with little to attract the visitor outside of the annual <span class="loc">Essex</span> show, a half dozen pubs and the town's prison and <span class="loc">Essex</span> Police headquarters, both of which still lie to the east of the Roman road. The <span class="loc">Essex</span> show-ground was once located on fields north of The Green, and south of Pump lane. Since this time the former show site along with a thousand or so acres of surrounding arable land have been developed to create the most populous suburb of <span class="loc">Chelmsford</span>. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is continuing to expand with the planned <span class="loc">Greater Beaulieu</span> Park development, which is a mixed use development comprising a residential development of up to 3,600 dwellings, new business park, retail spaces, hotel, leisure facilies, open space, education and community facilities, landscaping, new highways including a radial distributor road, public transport provisions and associated and ancillary development, including full details in respect of roundabout access from <span class="loc">Essex</span> Regiment Way and a priority junction from White Hart Lane.</p>
