<p><span class="loc">Monterey</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Berkshire County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Pittsfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 961 at the 2010 census. Prior to official settlement, the area of <span class="loc">Monterey</span> was inhabited by Mahicans, the local Native American tribe. <span class="loc">Monterey</span> was first settled by colonists in 1739 as a part of Housatonic Township Number One. The township had two villages, along Hop Brook to the north (modern <span class="loc">Tyringham</span>) and <span class="loc">Konkapot River</span> in the south (modern <span class="loc">Monterey</span>). The town was officially incorporated as <span class="loc">Tyringham</span> in 1767. In the earliest days of 1776, General Henry Knox passed through the town, bringing cannons from <span class="loc">Fort Ticonderoga</span> in <span class="loc">New York</span> to aid in ending the Siege of <span class="loc">Boston</span>. Today, the path he took is known as the Henry Knox Trail. However, the long divide between the two towns led to their separation in 1847. Previously called Green Woods or <span class="loc">South Tyringham</span>, the local people voted to name the new town <span class="loc">Monterey</span> to commemorate the Battle of <span class="loc">Monterey</span> that took place a year earlier in the Mexicanâ€“American War. <span class="loc">Palo Alto</span> and <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> were also considered, but thought to be "too foreign sounding". The town was mostly known for its sawmills, but today it is a rural community, known more for its recreational areas in the state forests and along <span class="loc">Lake Garfield</span>.</p>
