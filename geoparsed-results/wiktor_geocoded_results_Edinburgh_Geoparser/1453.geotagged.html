<p>Rochester is a town and historic city in the unitary authority of <span class="loc">Medway</span> in <span class="loc">Kent</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is situated at the lowest bridging point of the <span class="loc">River Medway</span> about 30 miles (50 km) from <span class="loc">London</span>. Rochester was for many years a favourite of Charles Dickens, who owned nearby Gads <span class="loc">Hill Place</span>, <span class="loc">Higham</span>, basing many of his novels on the area. The <span class="loc">Diocese of Rochester</span>, the second oldest in <span class="loc">England</span>, is based at <span class="loc">Rochester</span> Cathedral and was responsible for the founding of a school, now The King's School in 604 AD, which is recognised as being the second oldest continuously running school in the world. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> Castle, built by Bishop Gundulf of Rochester, has one of the best preserved keeps in either <span class="loc">England</span> or <span class="loc">France</span>, and during the First Barons' War (1215â€“1217) in King John's reign, baronial forces captured the castle from Archbishop Stephen Langton and held it against the king, who then besieged it. Neighbouring Chatham, <span class="loc">Gillingham</span>, <span class="loc">Strood</span> and a number of outlying villages, together with Rochester, nowadays make up the <span class="loc">Medway</span> Unitary Authority area. It was, until 1998, under the control of Kent County Council and is still part of the ceremonial <span class="loc">county of Kent</span>, under the latest Lieutenancies Act.</p>
