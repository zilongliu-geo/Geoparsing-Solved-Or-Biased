  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Reading (/ˈrɛdɪŋ/ RED-ing) is a large town and unitary authority area in the ceremonial <span class="loc">county of Berkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It was an important centre in the medieval period, as the site of Reading Abbey, a monastery with strong royal connections. The town was seriously affected by the <span class="org">English Civil War</span>, with a major siege and loss of trade, and played a pivotal role in the Revolution of <span class="date">1688</span>, with that revolution's only significant military action fought on the streets of the town. The 19th century saw the coming of the Great Western Railway and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. <span class="date">Today</span> Reading is a commercial centre, with involvement in information technology and insurance, and, despite its proximity to <span class="loc">London</span>, has a net inward commuter flow. The first evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century. By <span class="date">1525</span>, Reading was the largest town in <span class="loc">Berkshire</span>, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in <span class="loc">England</span> when measured by taxable wealth. By <span class="date">1611</span>, it had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. During the 19th century, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre. It is ranked the <span class="loc">UK</span>'s top economic area for economic success and wellbeing, according to factors such as employment, health, income and skills. Reading is also a retail centre serving a large area of the <span class="loc">Thames</span> Valley, and is home to the <span class="org">University of Reading</span>. Every year it hosts the Reading Festival, one of <span class="loc">England</span>'s biggest music festivals. Sporting teams based in Reading include Reading Football Club and the <span class="loc">London</span> Irish rugby union team, and over 15,000 runners annually compete in the Reading Half Marathon.</p><br><br>
