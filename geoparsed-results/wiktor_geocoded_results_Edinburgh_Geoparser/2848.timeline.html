  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Charleston</span> is the oldest and second-largest city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, the county seat of <span class="loc">Charleston County</span>, and the principal city in the <span class="loc">Charleston–North Charleston–Summerville Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The city lies just south of the geographical midpoint of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>'s coastline and is located on <span class="loc">Charleston</span> Harbor, an inlet of the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> formed by the confluence of the <span class="loc">Ashley</span> and <span class="per">Cooper Rivers</span>, or, as is locally expressed, "where the <span class="per">Cooper</span> and <span class="per">Ashley</span> Rivers come together to form the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>." Founded in <span class="date">1670</span> as <span class="per">Charles</span> Town in honor of King <span class="per">Charles II</span> of <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">Charleston</span> adopted its present name in <span class="date">1783</span>. It moved to its present location on <span class="loc">Oyster Point</span> in <span class="date">1680</span> from a location on the west bank of the <span class="loc">Ashley River</span> known as <span class="loc">Albemarle Point</span>. By <span class="date">1690</span>, <span class="per">Charles</span> Town was the fifth-largest city in <span class="loc">North America</span>, and it remained among the 10 largest cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span> through the <span class="date">1840</span> census. With a <span class="date">2010</span> census population of 120,083  (and a <span class="date">2014</span> estimate of 130,113), current trends put <span class="loc">Charleston</span> as the fastest-growing municipality in <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. The population of the <span class="loc">Charleston</span> metropolitan area, comprising <span class="loc">Berkeley</span>, <span class="loc">Charleston</span>, and <span class="loc">Dorchester Counties</span>, was counted by the <span class="date">2014</span> estimate at 727,689 – the third-largest in the state – and the 78th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p><br><br>
