<p><span class="loc">Croydon</span> is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 27 km east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>'s Central Business District. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Maroondah</span>. At the 2011 Census, <span class="loc">Croydon</span> had a population of 23,553. Dating back to 1840 the land was first utilised by settlers for grazing and the first road cut through the area now known as <span class="loc">Croydon</span>, was initially known as Sawmill Road, as a sawmill was nearby. Later it became known as Oxford Road and later Mt Dandenong Road, some time in the early 1900s. Owing to the coarse silvery-white grass, the area now known as <span class="loc">Croydon</span> was first called "<span class="loc">White Flats</span>". The Lacey family from <span class="loc">Essex</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> named the area <span class="loc">Croydon</span> after Mrs Lacey's home town. They preferred this to Mr Lacey's home town, <span class="loc">Steeple Bumpstead</span>. The Lacey family has a street named after them near the Main St. shopping precinct. In 1868 parcels of land were surveyed and the first habitations were constructed with wattle and daub. These were later rebuilt in timber and the area prospered in sheep, beef and dairy farming, and sawmills. Orchards were soon established and thrived. Crops included apples, cherries, pears, peaches and plums. Street names in and around <span class="loc">Croydon</span> now reflect the impact orchards had on "<span class="loc">White Flats</span>".</p>
