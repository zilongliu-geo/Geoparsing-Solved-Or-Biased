<p><span class="loc">Mountain View</span> is an Unincorporated community in northwest <span class="loc">Clayton County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is bounded on the east and south by <span class="loc">Forest Park</span>, on the north by the <span class="loc">Fulton County</span> line, and on the west by Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> was originally called Rough &amp; Ready. The name came from the Rough and Ready Tavern, which was a stagecoach stop on the line from <span class="loc">Macon</span> to Upper <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. The town was later the site of the first railroad station south of <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> on the <span class="loc">Macon</span> and Western Railroad, 13 miles from the terminus at <span class="loc">East Point</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. In August 1864, prior to the Battle of <span class="loc">Jonesborough</span>, the Rough and Ready Tavern served briefly as headquarters for Confederate General William J Hardee. Its name was changed when it was incorporated as a city in 1956. The name "<span class="loc">Mountain View</span>" refers to the fact that, on a clear day, one can see <span class="loc">Stone Mountain</span> 20 miles to the east. The slogan, "Gateway to <span class="loc">Clayton County</span>," was featured on the city seal. <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> was a city from 1956 to January 1978, when the Georgia General Assembly voted to repeal the city charter. A five-member delegation of <span class="loc">Clayton County</span> legislators proposed a bill to abolish the city in order to clean up corruption in the city government. During his four terms in office (1972-1977) Mayor Ray King, though popular with his constituents, was charged with bribery, nepotism, conspiracy, assault, and violating the city charter by accepting an illegal salary. Rather than reform the city leadership, <span class="loc">Clayton County</span> sought to dissolve <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> entirely. State Representative Rudolph Johnson of Morrow, chair of the delegation said, “They’ve had controversy out there for 20 years. It’s an accumulation of things, really.”</p>
