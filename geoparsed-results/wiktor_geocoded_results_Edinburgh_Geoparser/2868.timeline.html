According to the <span class="date">2001</span> Indian census, <span class="loc">Chamba</span> has a population of 20,312 people. Located at an altitude of 996 metres (3,268 ft) above mean sea level, the town is situated on the banks of the <span class="loc">Ravi River</span> (a major tributary of the Trans-Himalayan <span class="loc">Indus River</span>), at its confluence with the <span class="loc">Sal River</span>.

Though historical records date the history of the <span class="loc">Chamba region</span> to the Kolian tribes in the <span class="date">2nd century BC</span>, the area was formally ruled by the Maru dynasty, starting with the Raju Maru from around <span class="date">500 AD</span>, ruling from the ancient capital of <span class="loc">Bharmour</span>, which is located 75 kilometres (47 mi) from the town of <span class="loc">Chamba</span>.
