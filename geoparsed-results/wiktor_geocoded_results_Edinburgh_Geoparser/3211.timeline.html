  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Warren</span> is an unincorporated community in the remote north central region of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, near the Frank <span class="loc">Church River</span> of No Return Wilderness. Located within the <span class="loc">Payette National Forest</span> in southern <span class="loc">Idaho County</span>, <span class="per">Warren</span> is northeast of <span class="loc">McCall</span>, approximately 50 miles (80 km) by vehicle and about 30 miles (50 km) by air.

According to the Köppen climate classification system, <span class="per">Warren</span> has a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc). Miners from the previous gold strikes in <span class="per">Pierce</span> and <span class="per">Florence</span> fanned out to the south and discovered gold in the <span class="loc">Warren Creek</span> area in <span class="date">August 1862</span>. It led to the formation of the settlement, then in Washington Territory, making it one of the oldest settlements in present-day <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. With a gold mining boom in multiple regions during the Civil War, the Idaho Territory was established in <span class="date">1863</span>.
