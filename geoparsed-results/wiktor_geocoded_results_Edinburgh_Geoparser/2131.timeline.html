  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Troy is a city in <span class="loc">Latah County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located in the eastern part of the <span class="loc">Palouse region</span>, its population was 862 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Troy is located at 46°44′19″N 116°46′15″W (46.738571, -116.770785)., east of <span class="loc">Moscow</span> on State Highway 8, at an elevation of 2,487 feet (758 m) above sea level. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.79 square miles (2.05 km2), all of it land. The community was originally known as Huffs Gulch when <span class="per">J. Wesley</span> <span class="org">Seat</span> homesteaded in the area in <span class="date">1885</span>. In <span class="date">1890</span>, area businessman <span class="per">John P. Vollmer</span> rechristened the area with his own surname when he brought the railroad through. <span class="per">Vollmer</span> gained much of his 30,000 acres of land by foreclosing on the bank loans of local farmers. This made him so unpopular that in <span class="date">1897</span> the residents decided to rename the town. Local legend states that the name Troy was selected when a Greek railroad worker offered free shots of whiskey to any who would support the name. The defunct Tamarack Ski Area was 7 miles (11 km) northwest of Troy on <span class="loc">East Moscow Mountain</span>, near the top of Tamarack Road. Founded in <span class="date">1966</span>, the ski hill operated intermittently due to varying conditions, and seldom after <span class="date">1980</span>. The primary lift, a T-bar, was removed in <span class="date">1992</span> and its A-frame lodge was later razed.</p><br><br>
