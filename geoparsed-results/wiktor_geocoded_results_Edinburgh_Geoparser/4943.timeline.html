  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Korgan</span> is a town and <span class="loc">district of Ordu</span> Province in the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> region of <span class="loc">Turkey</span>. According to the <span class="date">2000</span> census, the population of the district is 41,628 of which 15,587 live in the town of <span class="loc">Korgan</span>. The district covers an area of 233 km2 (90 sq mi), and the town lies at an elevation of 673 m (2,208 ft). The villages of <span class="loc">Korgan district</span> include Aşağıkozpınar, <span class="loc">Belalan</span>, Beypınarı, Büyükakçakese, Çitlice, <span class="loc">Durali</span>, Karakışla, Koççığaz, Soğukpınar, Tatarcık, Tepeköy, <span class="loc">Terzili</span>, Yeniköy, Yeşilalan, Yeşildere, Yeşilyurt, and Yukarıkozpınar. The <span class="loc">district of Korgan</span> has been a source of iron ore since the reign of Mithridates, <span class="per">King of Pontus</span>, and even before that the area was occupied by Persians in the reign of <span class="per">Darius I</span> in the <span class="date">6th century BC</span>, as part of the Satrapy of <span class="loc">Pontus</span> and <span class="loc">Cappadocia</span>. The Persian presence was erased by the armies of Alexander the Great in 331BC, and the area eventually became part of the Kingdom of <span class="per">Pontus</span> and then the Roman Empire. This era ended in <span class="date">1083</span> when <span class="loc">Korgan</span> was conquered by the Turkish armies of Danishmend Gazi. Subsequently a number of Turkish tribes ruled here until <span class="date">1398</span> when <span class="loc">Bayezid</span> I brought the area, then known as Keşdere after a tributary of the River Bolaman, into the Ottoman Empire.</p><br><br>
