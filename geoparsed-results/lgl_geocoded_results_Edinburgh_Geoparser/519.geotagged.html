<p>St. Pat's festival is today in <span class="loc">Rock Hill</span>. The annual St. Patrick's Day party at McHale's Irish pub expands onto Rock Hill's Main Street this afternoon. A bagpiper will leave the <span class="loc">Cotton Factory</span> parking lot at 5:30 p.m. for a parade into downtown. It's open to all dressed in green. The costume contest winner will win $200. <span class="loc">Rock Hill</span>-based Carolinas Cab Co. is co-sponsoring the festival and will be on call to give rides to those who enjoy too much green beer. Aside from the libations, the main draw should be live music, which starts at 3:30 p.m. with traditional Irish songs by the James Burbane Project. The Thistledown Tinkers will open a stage on Main Street at 5:30, followed by local act Heavy Sandwich playing Irish rock favorites. The scene moves back inside McHale's at 10 p.m. for a show by the Truckstop Preachers. Main Street will be closed through the afternoon. Admission is free.</p>
