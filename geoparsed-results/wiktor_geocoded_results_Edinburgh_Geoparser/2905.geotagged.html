<p><span class="loc">El Nido</span> (officially the Municipality of <span class="loc">El Nido</span>) is a first class municipality and managed resource protected area in the <span class="loc">province of Palawan</span> in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It is about 420 kilometres (260 mi) south-west of Manila, and about 238 kilometres (148 mi) north-east of <span class="loc">Puerto Princesa</span>, <span class="loc">Palawan</span>â€™s capital. According to CNNGo, it is the Best Beach and Island destination in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> for its "extraordinary natural splendor and ecosystem." Situated in <span class="loc">Bacuit Bay</span>, <span class="loc">El Nido</span>, covering a land area of 465.1 square kilometres (179.6 sq mi) in the northernmost tip of mainland <span class="loc">Palawan</span>, is bordered by the <span class="loc">Linapacan Strait</span> in the north, the <span class="loc">Sulu Sea</span> in the east, and the <span class="loc">South China Sea</span> in the west. It is composed of 45 islands and islets, each has its own unique geological formations. The highest peak is at <span class="loc">Cadlao Island</span>, towering up to 640 metres (2,100 ft) above sea level. Together with <span class="loc">Sulu Archipelago</span>, <span class="loc">Sabah</span>, and <span class="loc">South China Sea</span>, <span class="loc">El Nido</span>, being part of <span class="loc">Palawan</span>, is located in the tectonically active and seismically active Sunda Plate, a plate that is entirely separate from the Philippine Mobile Belt to which the rest of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> belongs. The Permian to Paleogene rocks and limestone cliffs of <span class="loc">El Nido</span> are similar to those that can be found in Ha <span class="loc">Long Bay</span> in <span class="loc">Vietnam</span>, <span class="loc">Guilin</span> in <span class="loc">China</span>, as well as <span class="loc">Krabi</span> in <span class="loc">Thailand</span>, all of which are part of the Sunda Plate.</p>
