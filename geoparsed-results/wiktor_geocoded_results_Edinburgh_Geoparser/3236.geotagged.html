<p>Rodrigues (French: île <span class="loc">Rodrigues</span>) is a 108 square km autonomous outer island of the <span class="loc">Republic of Mauritius</span> in the <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span>, about 560 kilometres (350 mi) east of <span class="loc">Mauritius</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Mascarene Islands</span> which include <span class="loc">Mauritius</span> and Réunion. It is of volcanic origin surrounded by coral reef, and just off its coast lie some tiny uninhabited islands. The island used to be the tenth <span class="loc">District of Mauritius</span>; it gained autonomous status on 10 December 2002, and it is governed by the Rodrigues Regional Assembly. The capital of the island is <span class="loc">Port Mathurin</span>. Its inhabitants are Mauritian citizens. As of 2014, the island's population was about 41,669, according to Statistics <span class="loc">Mauritius</span>. Most of the inhabitants are of mixed African and French descent. Its economy is based mainly on fishing, farming, handicraft and a developing tourism sector. The island (together with Agaléga and <span class="loc">Saint Brandon</span>) forms part of the larger territory of the <span class="loc">Republic of Mauritius</span> with the President as head of state and the Chief Commissioner as head of government. The island was named after the Portuguese explorer D. Diogo Rodrigues in February 1528. Many maps also describe it as Diego Roiz. From the 10th century, Arabs have been known to visit the <span class="loc">Mascarene Islands</span>. A 12th-century map by the Arab geographer Ash-Sharif al-Idrisi supposedly contains them, and the Cantino planisphere of c.1500 and some other contemporary maps clearly show the three islands of the Mascarenes as Dina <span class="loc">Arobi</span> (or Harobi), Dina Margabin and Dina Moraze. These are apparently corrupted transliterations or transcriptions of the Arabic ديفا هاراب Diva Harab ("<span class="loc">Desert Island</span>"), ديفا مغربين Diva Maghrebin ("<span class="loc">Western Island</span>") and ديفا ماشريق Diva Mashriq ("<span class="loc">Eastern Island</span>"). While the second clearly refers to Réunion, sources disagree about which of the other is <span class="loc">Mauritius</span> and which one Rodrigues, which are both to the east of Réunion and arranged in a somewhat stylised way on these maps. However, even in its original state, Rodrigues had some karst, while <span class="loc">Mauritius</span> even after suffering 500 years of deforestation can by no means be called "desert" even in a colloquial sense.</p>
