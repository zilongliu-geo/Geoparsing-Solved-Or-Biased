  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Perth</span> (/ˈpɜːrθ/) is the capital and largest city of <span class="org">the Australian</span> state of Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is the fourth-most populous city in <span class="loc">Australia</span>, with an estimated population of 2.02 million (as of <span class="date">30 June 2014</span>) living in Greater <span class="loc">Perth</span>. <span class="loc">Perth</span> is part of the South West Land Division of Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, with the majority of the metropolitan area of <span class="loc">Perth</span> located on the <span class="org">Swan</span> Coastal Plain, a narrow strip between the <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span> and the Darling Scarp, a low coastal escarpment. The first areas settled were on the <span class="loc">Swan River</span>, with the city's central business district and port (Fremantle) both located on its shores. <span class="loc">Perth</span> is formally divided into a number of local government areas, which themselves consist of a large number of suburbs, extending from <span class="loc">Two Rocks</span> in the north to <span class="loc">Rockingham</span> in the south, and east inland to The Lakes. <span class="loc">Perth</span> was originally founded by Captain <span class="per">James Stirling</span> in <span class="date">1829</span> as the administrative centre of the <span class="org">Swan</span> <span class="loc">River Colony</span>. It gained city status (currently vested in the smaller <span class="loc">City of Perth</span>) in <span class="date">1856</span>, and was promoted to the status of a <span class="per">Lord Mayorality</span> in <span class="date">1929</span>. The city is named after <span class="loc">Perth</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, due to the influence of Sir <span class="per">George Murray</span>, Member of Parliament for <span class="loc">Perthshire</span> and Secretary of <span class="org">State for War</span> and the Colonies. The city's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century, largely as a result of emigration from the eastern colonies of <span class="loc">Australia</span>. During <span class="loc">Australia</span>'s involvement in World War II, <span class="loc">Fremantle</span> served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre, and a <span class="loc">US</span> Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at <span class="loc">Matilda Bay</span>. An influx of immigrants after the war, predominantly from <span class="loc">Britain</span>, <span class="loc">Greece</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span> and <span class="loc">Yugoslavia</span>, led to rapid population growth. This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st <span class="date">centuries</span> that saw <span class="loc">Perth</span> become the regional headquarters for a number of large mining operations located around the state.</p><br><br>
