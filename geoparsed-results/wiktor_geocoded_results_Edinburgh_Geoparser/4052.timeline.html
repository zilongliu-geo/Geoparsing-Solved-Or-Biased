  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 8,149, making it the fifth-least populous county in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The county seat is <span class="per">Clarendon</span>, while its largest city is <span class="loc">Brinkley</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>'s 20th county, formed on <span class="date">November 2, 1829</span>, from portions of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> and <span class="loc">Phillips</span> counties, and named for <span class="per">James Monroe</span>, the fifth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Sheffield Nelson, the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Republican National Committeeman and his party's gubernatorial nominee in <span class="date">1990</span> and <span class="date">1994</span>, was born in <span class="date">1940</span> in <span class="loc">Monroe County</span>. A portion of <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is represented in the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> State Senate by the Republican <span class="per">Ronald R. Caldwell</span>, a real estate businessman from <span class="loc">Wynne</span> in <span class="loc">Cross County</span>. The state representative from <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a Democrat, <span class="per">Marshall Wright</span>, a lawyer from <span class="loc">Forrest City</span> in St. <span class="loc">Francis County</span>. Settlement in <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> began when Dedrick Pike settled where the <span class="loc">Cache River</span> enters the <span class="loc">White River</span> in <span class="date">1816</span>. The settlement was named <span class="loc">Mouth of the Cache</span>, and a post office by that name was opened <span class="date">years</span> later. The community renamed itself <span class="per">Clarendon</span> in <span class="date">1824</span> in honor of the <span class="per">Earl of Clarendon</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was established under the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> territorial legislature in <span class="date">1829</span>, and the county seat was established at <span class="loc">Lawrenceville</span> where a jail and courthouse were erected. A ferry across the <span class="loc">White River</span> came in <span class="date">1836</span>, and the county seat was moved to <span class="per">Clarendon</span> in <span class="date">1857</span>, with the new brick courthouse nearly finished at the outbreak of the American Civil War. The county sent five units into Confederate service, and the <span class="org">Union</span> captured <span class="per">Clarendon</span> in <span class="date">1863</span> and destroyed the city. Martial law was established for <span class="date">four years</span> after the war as guerilla warfare continued and the county struggled to rebuild. The <span class="org">Union</span> had completely dismandled the brick courthouse and shipped the bricks to <span class="loc">De Valls</span> Bluff. The <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> Sun was established in <span class="date">1876</span>.</p><br><br>
