<p>Davenport is a village in <span class="loc">Thayer County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 294 at the 2010 census. In 1872, the village was platted by the <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> Land and Town Company, and the St. Joseph and <span class="loc">Denver City</span> railroad line (later taken over by Union Pacific) was built through the site of village. It was named after Davenport, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. In 1887, the village was officially incorporated. In 1888, North Western Railroad also built a line through the village. Two railroad lines with passenger and freight service brought much business to the village and helped support several hotels. The public school was established in 1877. A Methodist Society was organized in 1881, a Church of Christ in 1882, Christ's Lutheran Church in 1892, and St. Peter's <span class="loc">Lutheran</span> in 1912. Major fires destroyed large sections of the business district in 1889, 1917, and 2011. Also, a Lutheran school once existed, St. Peters Lutheran School, but was closed in 2010 because of lack of students. Davenport is located at 40°18′48″N 97°48′45″W (40.313312, -97.812490).</p>
