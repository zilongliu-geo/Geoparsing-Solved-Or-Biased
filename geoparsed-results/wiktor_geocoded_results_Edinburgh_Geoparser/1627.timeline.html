  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newport</span> is a small unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Wakulla County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>, situated where <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 98 meets State Road 267. In <span class="date">1841</span>, the current <span class="loc">Newport</span> area and the community of <span class="loc">Port Leon</span>, just south, endured a severe yellow fever epidemic. In <span class="date">1843</span> <span class="loc">Port Leon</span>, located on the St. Marks River, was devastated by a hurricane that produced a 10 foot storm surge. The area still struggles against the same recurring hurricane surges that move up the St. Marks River entrance. After the hurricane of <span class="date">September 13, 1843</span>, washed away all of the homes, buildings and railroad tracks in <span class="loc">Port Leon</span> promoters <span class="per">Nathaniel Hamlin</span>, <span class="per">James Ormond</span>, Peter H. Swain and several others met <span class="date">a week later</span> and made plans to establish another town. They spent <span class="date">several days</span> searching for a site safe from the sea, then selected a piece of land on the west side of the St. Marks River, about two miles below the old town of Magnolia, <span class="loc">Florida</span>. This location offered high ground, fewer swamps, and beautiful bubbling springs. It was owned by the <span class="org">Apalachicola Land Co</span>. The organization permitted citizens who had suffered from the storm to draw lots at a cost of $25 and up.</p><br><br>
