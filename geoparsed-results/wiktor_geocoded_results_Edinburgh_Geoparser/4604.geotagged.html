<p><span class="loc">Bradford</span> is a village and civil parish in the local government <span class="loc">district of Torridge</span>, <span class="loc">Devon</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The parish, which lies about six miles east of the town of <span class="loc">Holsworthy</span> has part of its eastern boundary formed by the <span class="loc">River Torridge</span>, and it is surrounded clockwise from the north by the parishes of <span class="loc">Milton Damerel</span>, <span class="loc">Shebbear</span>, <span class="loc">Black Torrington</span>, <span class="loc">Ashwater</span>, <span class="loc">Cookbury</span> and <span class="loc">Thornbury</span>. In 2001 its population was 359, compared to 280 in 1901. The parish church, dedicated to <span class="loc">All Saints</span>, is in the village of <span class="loc">Bradford</span> and mostly dates from the early 14th century although it has a Norman doorway and baptismal font. By the 19th century the church was in poor condition and was restored twice, in 1869 and in 1875â€“89. Within the parish are several former manors mentioned in the Domesday book of 1086: <span class="loc">Bradford</span>, <span class="loc">Dunsland</span>, <span class="loc">Henscott</span> and <span class="loc">Lashbrook</span>. <span class="loc">Dunsland</span> was the home of several notable <span class="loc">Devon</span> families and the fine house had just been extensively renovated by the National Trust when it was destroyed by fire in 1967. Hengist the Saxon is said to have camped at <span class="loc">Bradford</span>.</p>
