  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mandu</span> or Mandavgad is a ruined city in the present-day Mandav area of the <span class="loc">Dhar district</span>. It is located in the <span class="loc">Malwa region</span> of <span class="loc">western Madhya Pradesh</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>, at 35 km from the <span class="loc">Dhar city</span>. In the 11th century, <span class="loc">Mandu</span> was the sub division of the Tarangagadh or Taranga kingdom . This fortress town on a rocky outcrop about 100 km (62 mi) from <span class="loc">Indore</span> is celebrated for its fine architecture. The earliest reference to <span class="loc">Mandu</span> is available in the Sanskrit inscription of <span class="date">555 AD</span>, which tells that <span class="loc">Mandu</span> was a fortified city even in the <span class="date">6th century BC</span>. It gained prominence in 10th and 11th century under the Parmars (who called it Mandavgarh), from whom control was snatched by the Khiljis of <span class="loc">Delhi</span> in <span class="date">1305</span>. Then ruler Allauddin Khilji named Mandav as "Shadiabad" meaning the city of happiness (Anand Nagari), after the name of princess Mandvi Chouhan of <span class="loc">Khandwa</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Mandu</span>, situated at an elevation of 633 metres (2079 feet),is perched on the Vindhya Range extending for 13 km (8.1 mi) while overlooking the plateau of <span class="loc">Malwa</span> to the north and the valley of the <span class="loc">Narmada</span> River to the south, which acted as natural defences for the fort-capital of Rajput Parmara rulers of <span class="loc">Malwa</span>,who originally built it. Towards the end of the 11th century, it came under the sway of the Taranga kingdom.</p><br><br>
