<p><span class="loc">Somerset</span> /ˈsʌmərsɛt/ is a borough in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,277 at the 2010 census. The borough is surrounded by <span class="loc">Somerset</span> Township. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> is just off Exit 110 of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Turnpike (I-70 and I-76). <span class="loc">Somerset</span> is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, <span class="loc">PA</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area, and is also one of two cities, the other being <span class="loc">Johnstown</span>, that make up the larger Johnstown-Somerset, PA Combined Statistical Area. The <span class="loc">Somerset County Courthouse</span> and Uptown <span class="loc">Somerset</span> Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> is located at 40°0′25″N 79°4′53″W (40.006920, -79.081297). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 2.7 square miles (7.0 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> has the ninth-highest elevation of towns in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, at 2,190 feet (670 m) above sea level. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> has a humid continental climate that is affected by the high elevation, rendering them colder much of the winter than <span class="loc">Altoona</span>, <span class="loc">Johnstown</span>, or State College, despite being well south of either location and quite similar to those seen in northern <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, although the average winter high temperatures are a bit higher. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> holds the June and November record lows for the state of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> is also the only place in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> to receive accumulations of snow in June (other places received a partial dusting at most) when they received 3 inches of snow from the same polar front that caused them to drop to 20 degrees on June 10, 1913, and due to the arctic air, it was powdery snow that was photographed being swept off porches with brooms. That same cold snap brought snow to many other <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> communities, especially in the northern counties.</p>
