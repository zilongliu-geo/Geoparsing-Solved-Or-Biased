Around <span class="date">1905</span>, representatives of the Pacific Railway and Navigation Company, interested in putting a (rail)line through from <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> to Tillamook on the coast, began approaching farmers living northeast of <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. With the railroad coming through the <span class="loc">Tualatin</span> Valley a mile north of the Vandervelden farm, William (Vandervelden) and his sons, J.W. and Frank, decided to buy land around the intended railway went through <span class="per">Lewis Roy</span>'s place and thus, the road crossing was called <span class="per">Roy</span>. The railroad went through that region in <span class="date">1907</span>, and a new church was built north of the tracks in <span class="date">1908</span>. <span class="per">Roy</span> post office was established in <span class="date">1907</span> and named for the <span class="per">Roy</span> family, who were local pioneers. In <span class="date">1908</span>, a Catholic school called St. Ferdinand's opened in the local church. A standalone wood-framed school opened in <span class="date">September 1912</span>, which was renamed as <span class="date">St. Francis of Assisi</span> Catholic School in <span class="date">1920</span>. The railroad reached <span class="per">Roy</span> in <span class="date">1912</span>. <span class="per">St. Francis</span> moved into a new brick building in <span class="date">1951</span>. <span class="per">Roy</span> post office closed in <span class="date">1955</span>. <span class="per">Roy</span> currently has a Banks mailing address. Different parts of the area are served by the Forest Grove Rural Fire Protection District, Banks Rural Fire Protection District, and <span class="loc">Washington County</span> Fire District 2.</p><br><br>
