  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Coldstream</span> is a district municipality in British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, located at the northern end of <span class="loc">Kalamalka Lake</span> in the <span class="loc">Okanagan Valley</span>. Incorporated on <span class="date">December 21, 1906</span>, <span class="loc">Coldstream</span> celebrated its centennial in <span class="date">2006</span>. The municipality is directly southeast of <span class="per">Vernon</span> and is considered part of <span class="per">Greater Vernon</span>. It is a member municipality of, and also the location of the head offices, of <span class="org">the Regional District of North</span> <span class="loc">Okanagan</span>. <span class="loc">Coldstream</span> is best known for the Coldstream Ranch, established in <span class="date">1863</span> by Captain <span class="per">Charles Frederick Houghton</span>. He transferred the ranch to Forbes G. and <span class="per">Charles Albert Vernon</span> who in <span class="date">1891</span> sold it to <span class="per">John Hamilton-Gordon</span>, 1st <span class="loc">Marquess</span> of <span class="per">Aberdeen</span> and <span class="per">Temair</span>, future Governor General of <span class="loc">Canada</span> (<span class="date">1893</span>–<span class="date">1898</span>). The ranch was purchased by its current owners in <span class="date">1994</span> and continues to be a working cattle ranch. <span class="loc">Coldstream</span> is governed by a seven-member council, led by Mayor <span class="per">Jim Garlick</span>. <span class="org">The Member of Parliament</span> is <span class="per">Mel Arnold</span> (Okanagan—Shuswap) and the Member of the Legislative Assembly is <span class="per">Eric Foster</span> (Okanagan-Vernon). The <span class="per">Greater Vernon</span> area was once based in forestry and agriculture. However, manufacturing, retail trade and services are <span class="date">now</span> the primary industries. A form of suburbs also lies within <span class="loc">Coldstream</span>, known as <span class="loc">Middleton</span> Mountain. This is one of the more expensive areas to live in <span class="loc">Coldstream</span>, and it is located just above the North end of <span class="loc">Kalamalka Lake</span>.</p><br><br>
