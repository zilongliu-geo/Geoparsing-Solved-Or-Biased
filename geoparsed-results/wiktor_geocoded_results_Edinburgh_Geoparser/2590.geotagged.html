<p>Wright is a town in <span class="loc">Campbell County</span>, <span class="loc">Wyoming</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,807 at the 2010 census. Settlement began in the area near Wright in the 1970s, with the creation of the Black Thunder Coal Mine, the largest mine in the Powder River Basin and most productive mine in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town itself was incorporated in 1985. Originally known as <span class="loc">Reno</span> Junction (descendants of Major Reno from Custer's troop resided in the area), the town was renamed "Wright" after the owner of the Long Branch Bar, Dale Wright, who agreed to sell land to Atlantic Richfield Corporation, the developer of the Black Thunder Mine, who planned to build the town to accommodate the work force that would be hired to operate the mine. On August 12, 2005, an F2 rated tornado struck a mobile home park at Wright, destroying 91 homes, damaging others, and killing two people. Wright is located at 43°45′18″N 105°29′26″W (43.754988, -105.490691). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 2.85 square miles (7.38 km2), all of it land.</p>
