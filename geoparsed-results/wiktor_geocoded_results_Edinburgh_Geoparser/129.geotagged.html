<p><span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> is the name of the capital of the Santa <span class="loc">Fe District</span> in the <span class="loc">province of Veraguas</span> in <span class="loc">Panama</span>. It has a population of 3200 and lies at an altitude of about 430m. <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> lies close to the continental divide and just 60 km from the <span class="loc">Mosquito Coast</span> at the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span>, but is only connected to the Pacific coast with a paved road to the Pan-American Highway and the <span class="loc">city of Santiago</span> de <span class="loc">Veraguas</span>. <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> is known throughout <span class="loc">Panama</span> for its natural beauty. The <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> national park surrounds the town in three directions, measuring 72.636 hectares. The park is home to at least 300 bird species, 300 species of orchids and a host of rare flora and fauna. The <span class="loc">Santa Maria River</span> and its tributaries spring from the park. The cool air and pristine forests make the area a popular tourist destination for outdoor activities such as hiking and birding. After the Spanish conquests in <span class="loc">the Americas</span>, what is now the <span class="loc">province of Veraguas</span> was awarded to Columbus’ grandson Luís, who launched several expeditions to subdue the native population and firmly establish control. He sold his rights back to the Spanish crown after the attempts proved unsuccessful. The Spanish crown then established the <span class="loc">Province of Veragua</span> and made the Spanish captain Francisco Vázquez, survivor of a dramatic <span class="loc">El Dorado</span> expedition, its first governor in 1560. <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> was founded around that time for the purpose of gold mining.</p>
