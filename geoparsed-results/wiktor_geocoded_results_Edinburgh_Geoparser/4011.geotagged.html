<p><span class="loc">Puerto Madero</span>, also known within the urban planning community as the <span class="loc">Puerto Madero</span> Waterfront, is a barrio (district) of the Argentine capital at <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> CBD, occupying a significant portion of the RÃ­o de la Plata riverbank and representing the latest architectural trends in the city of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>. From its inception, the city of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> had a problem accommodating large cargo ships, as per <span class="loc">Puerto</span> <span class="loc">La Boca</span>, because the shallow river did not allow for direct docking. Instead ships were moored away from the shore and passengers and merchandise were unloaded onto barges and ferries for transport to the pier. In 1882 the national government contracted the local businessman Eduardo Madero to take charge of the construction of a new port which would solve these problems. Construction began in 1887 and was completed in 1897, although the installed fittings had been partially operative some years before completion of the port. It was a costly project and an engineering landmark at the time but ten years after its completion the appearance of larger cargo ships made <span class="loc">Puerto Madero</span> obsolete. The government had to then face the construction of a new port, this time contracting engineer Luis Huergo, whose plans for a port of staggered docks which would open directly onto the river was among those rejected in the 1880s. His plans resulted in the "<span class="loc">Puerto Nuevo</span>" (New Port), still operating today, whose first section opened in 1911.</p>
