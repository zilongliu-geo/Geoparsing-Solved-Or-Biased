  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Centro</span> ("Center") is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Centro</span> of <span class="loc">Rio de Janeiro</span>, <span class="loc">Brazil</span>. It represents the financial heart of the city, and the crux of the <span class="loc">Central Region</span>. Despite still having a large number of residences, the neighborhood is predominantly commercial with a mixture of historical buildings as well as modern skyscrapers. Residential areas lie mainly along <span class="loc">Rua</span> do <span class="loc">Riachuelo</span> and <span class="loc">Castelo</span>. The historic and financial centre of the city, sites of interest include the Paço Imperial, Candelária Church, the Old Cathedral of <span class="loc">Rio de Janeiro</span>, and the modern-style Saint <span class="per">Sebastian</span>'s Cathedral. Around Marechal Floriano Square, there are several landmarks from the Belle Époque such as the Municipal Theatre and the National Library building. The Centro area also has several museums such as the <span class="org">National Museum of Fine Arts</span> and the National Historical Museum. Other important historical attractions in downtown <span class="loc">Rio</span> include its Passeio Público, an 18th-century public garden, as well as the imposing arches of the Carioca Aqueduct. A "bondinho" (tram) leaves from a station near Saint <span class="per">Sebastian</span>'s Cathedral, crosses the aqueduct (converted to a tram viaduct in <span class="date">1896</span>) and rambles through the hilly streets of the nearby <span class="loc">Santa Tereza</span> neighbourhood. Downtown remains the heart of the city's business community. Some of the largest companies in <span class="loc">Brazil</span> have their head offices here, including <span class="org">Petrobras</span>, Eletrobras, BNDES and Vale. Most of Rio's skyscrapers, especially the tallest ones, are located in this neighbourhood. Crowded from <span class="date">Monday</span> to <span class="date">Friday</span> during regular work hours, it becomes empty during the evening and on Saturdays, <span class="loc">Sundays</span>, and holidays.</p><br><br>
