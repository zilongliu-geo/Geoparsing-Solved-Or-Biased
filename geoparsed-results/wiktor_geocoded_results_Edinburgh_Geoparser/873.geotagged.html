<p><span class="loc">Dublin</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Harford County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Dublin</span> was founded in the early 19th century by George McCausland and a friend who migrated from <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. The first record of the village of <span class="loc">Dublin</span> is found in the Act of Assembly Districts of the 18th century, which divided the county into election districts and designated <span class="loc">Dublin</span> the vote place for the Fifth district. Martenet's map of 1878 shows McCausland built a home on one side of what is now Route 440 and a tavern or inn on the other side. The tavern on the southeast side was a long two story building that was very close to the road. The building had a porch on the first and second stories. In old records reference is made of the Mt. <span class="loc">Ararat</span> Lodge of Masons, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, which moved its meeting place in 1809 from a tavern in Delta, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> to George McCausland's tavern in <span class="loc">Dublin</span>. The lodge remained there until 1826, then moved to the old Masonic Lodge on Bond Street in <span class="loc">Bel Air</span>. On the northeast corner of Routes 440 and 136 was a small log house, with a short circular stairway and a fireplace which was used as a school and referred to as "the academy". Along with several of the older homes, it burned in 1971.</p>
