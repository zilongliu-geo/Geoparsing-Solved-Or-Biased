  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="hold three years earlier">
    The roots of last year's unprecedented decision to close the California coast to salmon fishing took hold three years earlier, in the spring of 2005 when juvenile fish swam through the Golden Gate to an ocean lacking ample food for them, a new report says.

  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="abandoned their nests that year">
    On the Farallon Islands bird sanctuary, nearly all the Cassin's auklets, which eat the same kind of food as juvenile salmon, abandoned their nests that year.

  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="2007 starved">
    The salmon that would have returned to spawn in 2007 starved, or were weakened and eaten by other fish or birds.

  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="happened in 2006">
    The same thing happened in 2006, causing low numbers to return again last year.

  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="were made available last year">
    Naturally varying ocean conditions were the immediate cause of a fishing season closure for which $170 million in federal disaster funds were made available last year, according to a report released Wednesday by a team of scientists assigned last year to investigate the collapse.

  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="2007 just 88,000 fish returned">
    Those fish may have produced as many as 900,000 spawners in years past, but in 2007 just 88,000 fish returned.

    Last year was even lower, and regulators expect just 122,000 spawners this fall.

  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="2006 was caused">
    The lack of food off the coast in the spring of 2005 and 2006 was caused by the weak upwelling — where nutrient-rich waters off the coast rise toward the surface and, in a good year, cause an explosion of marine life that is especially apparent in places like the Farallon Islands.

    Ocean conditions have improved in recent years and that, combined with new restrictions on water pumping out of the Delta, could help fuel a recovery next year, Grader said.

    It's virtually assured that regulators will close the California coastal salmon fishing season to commercial anglers again this year.
