  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newton</span> (or Newton-in-the-Isle) is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">Fenland district</span> of <span class="loc">north Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, four miles to the north of <span class="loc">Wisbech</span>. It was formerly also known as <span class="loc">Newton</span> in the Isle or <span class="loc">Newton</span> on the Isle, where "isle" refers to the <span class="loc">Isle of Ely</span>. The village is situated on the Silt Fen, a sea bank formed <span class="date">thousands of years ago</span>. Unlike the salt marshes to the north or the formerly water-logged fens to the south, this narrow strip (also known as the <span class="loc">Townland</span>) has been inhabited for <span class="date">many centuries</span>. Its location as a corridor for trade brought wealth to the villages during medieval times in an otherwise relatively poor area. <span class="loc">Newton</span>, however, was not listed in the Domesday Book and was thus probably settled later, with its first mention appearing in <span class="date">1210</span>. The <span class="org">College of St</span> Mary by the Sea was founded here during the reign of <span class="per">Henry IV</span> by Sir <span class="per">John Colville</span>. The lands were given to the rectory of <span class="loc">Newton</span> when the college was dissolved by <span class="per">Henry VIII</span>. <span class="loc">Newton</span>, <span class="loc">South Cambridgeshire Media</span> related to <span class="loc">Newton</span>, <span class="loc">Fenland</span> at Wikimedia Commons</p><br><br>
