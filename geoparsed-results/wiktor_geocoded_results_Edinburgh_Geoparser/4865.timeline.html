  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gabon</span> (/ɡəˈbɒn/; French pronunciation: ​[ɡabɔ̃]), officially the <span class="loc">Gabonese Republic</span> (French: République gabonaise), is a sovereign state on the west coast of Central <span class="loc">Africa</span>. Located on the equator, <span class="loc">Gabon</span> is bordered by <span class="loc">Equatorial Guinea</span> to the northwest, <span class="loc">Cameroon</span> to the north, the <span class="loc">Republic of the Congo</span> on the east and south, and the <span class="loc">Gulf of Guinea</span> to the west. It has an area of nearly 270,000 square kilometres (100,000 sq mi) and its population is estimated at 1.5 million people. Its capital and largest city is <span class="loc">Libreville</span>. Since its independence from <span class="loc">France</span> in <span class="date">1960</span>, <span class="loc">Gabon</span> has had three presidents. In <span class="date">the early 1990s</span>, <span class="loc">Gabon</span> introduced a multi-party system and a new democratic constitution that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and reformed many governmental institutions. <span class="loc">Gabon</span> was also a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the <span class="date">2010</span>–<span class="date">2011</span> term. Low population density, abundant petroleum, and foreign private investment have helped make <span class="loc">Gabon</span> one of the most prosperous countries in Sub-Saharan <span class="loc">Africa</span>, with the 4th highest HDI and the third highest GDP per capita (PPP) (after <span class="loc">Equatorial Guinea</span> and <span class="loc">Botswana</span>) in the region. GDP grew by more than 6% per year from <span class="date">2010</span> to <span class="date">2012</span>. However, because of inequality in income distribution, a significant proportion of the population remains poor.</p><br><br>
