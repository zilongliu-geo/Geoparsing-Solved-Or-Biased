  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Magna</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) and township in Salt <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 26,505 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, a moderate increase over the <span class="date">2000</span> figure of 22,770. Settlement of the area began in <span class="date">1851</span> shortly after the Mormon pioneers reached the Salt Lake Valley. Early farmers settled in <span class="date">1868</span> at the base of the northern <span class="loc">Oquirrh Mountains</span> and called their community <span class="loc">Pleasant Green</span>. By <span class="date">1900</span>, there were about 20 families in the area. One of the first <span class="loc">Pleasant Green</span> pioneers was <span class="per">Abraham Coon</span>, who established a livestock ranch and settlement called “Coonville” in a canyon mouth at about 5400 South. The canyon is <span class="date">now</span> known as Coon Canyon, and <span class="loc">Coon Creek</span> flowing out of it, is one of the <span class="per">major Oquirrh</span> Mountain drainages. <span class="loc">Coon Creek</span> flows north and west through <span class="loc">Magna</span> to the <span class="loc">Great Salt Lake</span>. In <span class="date">1897</span>, the first <span class="loc">ward of The Church</span> of <span class="per">Jesus Christ</span> of Latter-day Saints, Pleasant <span class="loc">Green Ward</span>, was constructed. The <span class="loc">Pleasant Green</span> Cemetery located in the <span class="per">Oquirrh</span> foothills, at about 3500 South, where many community pioneers are buried, was established in <span class="date">1883</span>. In <span class="date">1890</span>, in response to a law requiring all children to receive free public education, the first school was built in the community.</p><br><br>
