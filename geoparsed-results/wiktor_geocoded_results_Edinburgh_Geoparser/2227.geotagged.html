<p><span class="loc">Monroe</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Grafton County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 788 at the 2010 census. The town is located along a bend of the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>, across from <span class="loc">Barnet</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. It was originally chartered as part of Lyman. In 1762 Colonial Governor John Wentworth issued a grant ("Number 11") to 64 persons obligated to clear, farm and settle one tenth of each of their parcels or forfeit the grant. Only two made the attempt but the charter was extended, in 1769, for another five years. Eleven of the original 64 grantees were named Lyman. In that same year, Wentworth also granted to one Colonel John Hurd (of <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> part of the land which is today within the bounds of <span class="loc">Monroe</span>. The grant was named Hurd's Location and included five small islands in the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>, known as "<span class="loc">Deer Islands</span>," and a parcel of land from below the present Village Bridge to the foot of Fifteen Mile Falls. In addition to Hurd's Location, and the governor's 500 acres (2.0 km2), there were 23 lots of the 64 portions of Lyman located in "West Lyman," or the "<span class="loc">Lyman</span> Plain," now <span class="loc">Monroe</span>, making up less than 7,500 acres (30 km2) of the present area. A portion of Bath, to the south, was annexed in 1897.</p>
