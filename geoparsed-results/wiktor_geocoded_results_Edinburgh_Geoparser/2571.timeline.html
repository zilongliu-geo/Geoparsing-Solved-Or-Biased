  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hammond</span> is the largest city in <span class="loc">Tangipahoa Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is forty-five miles east of <span class="loc">Baton Rouge</span>. The population was 20,019 in the <span class="date">2010</span> census and is home to <span class="org">Southeastern Louisiana University</span>. <span class="per">Hammond</span> is the principal city of the <span class="org">Hammond Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which includes all of <span class="loc">Tangipahoa Parish</span>. The city is named for <span class="per">Peter Hammond</span> (<span class="date">1798</span>–<span class="date">1870</span>) — the surname anglicized from <span class="per">Peter</span> av <span class="loc">Hammerdal</span> (<span class="per">Peter</span> of <span class="loc">Hammerdal</span>) — a Swedish immigrant who first settled the area around <span class="date">1818</span>. <span class="per">Peter</span>, a sailor, had been briefly imprisoned by the British at Dartmoor Prison during the Napoleonic Wars. He escaped during a prison riot, made his way back to sea, and later on arrived in <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. <span class="per">Hammond</span> used his savings to buy then-inexpensive land northwest of <span class="loc">Lake Pontchartrain</span>. There he started a plantation to cultivate trees, which he made into masts, charcoal, and other products for the maritime industry in <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. He transported the goods by oxcart to the head of navigation on the <span class="loc">Natalbany River</span> at <span class="loc">Springfield</span>. He owned at least thirty slaves before the Civil War. <span class="per">Peter Hammond</span> lost his wealth during the war, as Union soldiers raided his property.</p><br><br>
