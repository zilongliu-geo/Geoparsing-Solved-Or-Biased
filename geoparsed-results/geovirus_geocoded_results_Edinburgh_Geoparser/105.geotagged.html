<p>Today, in <span class="loc">Khartoum</span> and <span class="loc">Al Jazirah</span> in <span class="loc">Sudan</span>, one farmer and about 100,000 chickens were diagnosed with the first appearance of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu. The samples will be sent abroad to the World Health Organization for further testing. Most of the infected poultry has already been disposed of. H5N1, which has spread throughout <span class="loc">Europe</span>, northern <span class="loc">Africa</span> (including neighboring <span class="loc">Egypt</span>), central <span class="loc">Asia</span>, and <span class="loc">the Middle East</span>, has already killed about 100 people. There is no word yet on the man's identity or condition.</p>
