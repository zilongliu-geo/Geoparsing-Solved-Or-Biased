  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Western Mass. stargazers to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Italian astronomer <span class="per">Galileo Galilei</span>. Meg Thacher, who teaches astronomy at Smith College in <span class="loc">Northampton</span> and lives in <span class="loc">West Springfield</span> with her husband and two children, is organizing her hometown's star party. It will be held <span class="date">Friday</span> from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. at <span class="loc">Mittineague</span> Park. Everyone is invited to come, and anyone with a telescope should bring it along. <span class="date">April</span> presents some interesting celestial scenes. "Saturn looks really lovely at this time of year," <span class="loc">Thacher</span> said. Its rings are edge on, enabling sky-gazers to view the brightest of Saturn's many moons. On <span class="date">Friday</span>, the moon is in its <span class="date">first quarter</span>, a perfect time to observe the lunar landscape. "You can really see the craters," she said. Just going outside and looking at the moon with the naked eye is one thing. It can be beautiful, and some details are evident. But add a telescope, and it's a whole new experience. "The level of detail is amazing," <span class="loc">Thacher</span> said. If peering at the moon seems too ordinary, what about a nebula? The <span class="org">Orion</span> Nebula is one of the closest star formation regions. Because it is so close to earth, it is a great location to see how stars are born and progress. "It's several times the size of our own solar system," <span class="loc">Thacher</span> said. "These are stars formed by dust and gas. The light is so strong that it can push away the dust," she said. Through the telescope, these formations are remarkable to view, she said. Other events in the region are scheduled for 100 Hours of Astronomy. The <span class="org">Springfield Science Museum</span> will host "Stars Over Springfield" on <span class="date">Friday</span> at 7:30 p.m. Amateur astronomer <span class="per">Michael Kozicki</span> will speak on "Saturn's Disappearing Rings." Members of the <span class="org">Springfield Stars Club</span> will be on hand, and participants may gaze at the stars in the museum observatory and through telescopes on the Quadrangle green. The cost is $3 for adults and $2 for children. <span class="org">Amherst College's Wilder Observatory</span> open house at 9 p.m. on <span class="date">Saturday</span> will give people a chance to use the 6-ton <span class="per">Clark Refractor</span> as well as smaller telescopes set up by the <span class="org">Amherst Area Amateur Astronomy Association</span>. The association also will offer a free program, Safe Solar Observing on <span class="date">Saturday</span> from 1 to 2:30 p.m. at the <span class="loc">Amherst</span> Common and from 3 to 4:30 p.m. at A2Z <span class="per">Science</span> and <span class="per">Learning</span> <span class="loc">Center</span> in <span class="loc">Northampton</span>. Stargazing at the Sofinowski will take place sunset to 9:30 p.m. on <span class="date">Saturday</span> at the Sofinowski Land Preserve in <span class="loc">Southwick</span>. Stargazers throughout Western <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> will be joining others across the planet <span class="date">this week</span> in celebrating <span class="per">Galileo</span>. The "100 Hours of Astronomy" program is part of an international celebration of the 400th anniversary of <span class="per">Galileo</span>'s work. From <span class="date">Thursday</span> through <span class="date">Sunday</span>, astronomers, amateur astronomers and anyone interested in stars and planets will gather to point telescopes skyward. The goal is to get as many people throughout the world to look through a telescope as <span class="per">Galileo</span> did. Advancements by <span class="per">Galileo Galilei</span>, born in <span class="loc">Italy</span> around <span class="date">1564</span>, include making significant improvements to the telescope and astronomical observation, discovering moons of <span class="loc">Jupiter</span>, and defending Copernicus's theory that the Earth revolved around the sun, in contrast to the teachings of the Roman Catholic church. He died under house arrest ordered by the Roman Inquisition.</p><br><br>
