<p><span class="loc">Columbia County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 49,351. The county seat is <span class="loc">St. Helens</span>. It was named for the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span>, which forms its eastern and northern borders. <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> is included in the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA <span class="loc">Portland metropolitan</span> area. The Chinook and Clatskanie Native Americans inhabited this region for centuries prior to the arrival of Robert Gray, captain of the ship Columbia <span class="loc">Rediviva</span>, in 1792. The Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled and camped along the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span> shore in the area later known as <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> in late 1805 and on their return journey in early 1806. <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> was created in 1854 from the northern half of <span class="loc">Washington County</span>. Milton served as the county seat until 1857 when it was moved to <span class="loc">St. Helens</span>. <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> has been afflicted by numerous flooding disasters, the most recent in December 2007. Heavy rains caused the <span class="loc">Nehalem River</span> to escape its banks and flood the <span class="loc">city of Vernonia</span> and rural areas nearby. <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> received a presidential disaster declaration for this event.</p>
