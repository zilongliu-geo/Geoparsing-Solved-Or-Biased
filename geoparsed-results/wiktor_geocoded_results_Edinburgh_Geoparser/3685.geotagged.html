<p><span class="loc">Denton</span> is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside, <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, five miles (8 km) east of <span class="loc">Manchester</span> city centre. Historically part of <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, it had a population of 36,591 at the 2011 Census. <span class="loc">Denton</span> probably derives its name from Dane-town, an etymology supported by other place names in the area such as Danehead-bank and Daneditch-bourne. The word 'Dane' is itself derived from Anglo-Saxon denu, dene, daenland, meaning a valley. So literally <span class="loc">Denton</span> means valley town. A Byzantine coin was discovered in Danesheadbank, dating from the sixth or seventh century, as part of the <span class="loc">Denton</span> coin hoard. The early medieval linear earthwork Nico Ditch passes through <span class="loc">Denton</span>; it was probably used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9th centuries. A 300 m stretch is still visible on <span class="loc">Denton</span> golf course, about 4 m wide and 1.5 m deep. Felt hatting was recorded in <span class="loc">Denton</span> as early as 1702 and <span class="loc">Denton</span> gained supremacy in the hatting industry towards the end of the 19th century. The increasing importance of <span class="loc">Denton</span> and <span class="loc">Haughton</span> as centres of felt hat production is demonstrated by the increase of manufacturers in the area: in 1800 there were 4 hatting firms in <span class="loc">Denton</span> and <span class="loc">Haughton</span>, but by 1825 there were 25 manufacturers, making it the third largest hat making centre in the north west. By 1840, 24,000 felt hats were produced in <span class="loc">Denton</span> a week. The prosperity of the hatting industry is reflected in the growth of the town from 2,501 in 1801 to 6,759 in 1841.</p>
