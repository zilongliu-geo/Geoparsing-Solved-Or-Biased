<p><span class="loc">White River</span> is a township located in <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, on the intersection of Highway 17 and Highway 631. It was originally set up as a rail town on the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885. In 1961, it was finally made accessible by car via Highway 17 of the Trans-Canada Highway. The forest industry was the largest employer until 2007, when the Domtar mill shut down. The township is perhaps best known for being the home of <span class="loc">Winnie</span> the Pooh. In August 1914, a trapped black bear cub was sold to Captain Harry Colebourn in <span class="loc">White River</span>, and Colebourn named it <span class="loc">Winnipeg</span>, or <span class="loc">Winnie</span>, after his hometown of <span class="loc">Winnipeg</span>. Over the years, the animal became the basis for the popular literary character. The town celebrates "<span class="loc">Winnie</span>'s Hometown Festival" every third week in August. The <span class="loc">White River</span> railway station is the western terminus of the <span class="loc">Sudbury</span> – <span class="loc">White River</span> train. <span class="loc">White River</span> advertises itself as "The Coldest Spot in <span class="loc">Canada</span>" with recorded temperatures as low as −58 °C (−72 °F). However, this is a myth, as the coldest temperature in <span class="loc">Canada</span> has been recorded in Snag, <span class="loc">Yukon</span>, at −62.8 °C (−81.0 °F) on 3 February 1947. Even in <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, the coldest recorded temperature was in <span class="loc">Iroquois Falls</span> at −58.3 °C (−72.9 °F) (23 January 1935), which is the lowest temperature reported in Eastern <span class="loc">Canada</span> too. <span class="loc">White River</span>'s reputation for coldest area is probably based on the fact that for many years its reported temperature was deemed "the coldest in the nation today" from the handful of stations reporting daily temperature extremes in newspapers and on radio, climatological stations data being only available monthly to Environment <span class="loc">Canada</span>.</p>
