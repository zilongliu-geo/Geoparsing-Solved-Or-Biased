  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Zelenogorsk</span> (Russian: Зеленого́рск; before <span class="date">1948</span> <span class="loc">Terijoki</span>, a name still used in Finnish and Swedish), is a municipal town in <span class="loc">Kurortny District</span> of the federal <span class="loc">city of St. Petersburg</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located in part of the <span class="loc">Karelian Isthmus</span> on the shore of the <span class="loc">Gulf of Finland</span>. Population: 14,958 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census); 12,074 (<span class="date">2002</span> Census); 13,032 (<span class="date">1989</span> Census). It has a station on the St. Petersburg-Vyborg railroad. It is located about 50 kilometers (31 mi) northwest of central <span class="loc">Saint Petersburg</span>. From <span class="date">1323</span> to <span class="date">1721</span> the Zelenogorsk area was a part of <span class="loc">Sweden</span>. It was ceded to <span class="loc">Russia</span> in <span class="date">1721</span>, becoming "Old <span class="loc">Finland</span>", which again was united with the Grand-Duchy of <span class="loc">Finland</span> in <span class="date">1811</span>. Until <span class="date">1917</span>, <span class="loc">Terijoki</span> was part of the Grand-Duchy of <span class="loc">Finland</span>, ruled by the Grand Dukes of <span class="loc">Finland</span>, who were the Tsars of <span class="loc">Russia</span>, (<span class="date">1812</span>–<span class="date">1917</span>). Even though all of <span class="loc">Finland</span> was part of the Russian Empire, a customs border was located at <span class="loc">Terijoki</span>. A valid Passport was needed for crossing the border between <span class="loc">Russia</span> and the Grand Duchy of <span class="loc">Finland</span>.</p><br><br>
