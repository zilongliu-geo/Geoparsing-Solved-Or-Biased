  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Film Festival director visits <span class="org">Columbia</span> State. The <span class="org">Columbia State Lyceum Committee and Student Services</span> presented a lecture by <span class="org">Nashville Film Festival</span> Director, <span class="per">Brian Owens</span> <span class="date">March 4</span>. <span class="per">Owens</span> gave students a sneak preview of short films, which will debut <span class="date">next month</span> when the <span class="org">Nashville Film Festival</span> Season opens, and answered students’ questions about opportunities in the film industry. <span class="per">Owens</span> encouraged students that, despite the current economic climate, he believes the area of film and entertainment will continue to grow and there will be many new jobs generated by festivals. “As the distribution of cinema changes, film festivals are more important than ever for shedding light on works of unique and challenging cinema that most filmgoers don’t get to see at the cineplex,” <span class="per">Owens</span> said. “There is a growing infrastructure being created to help young filmmakers and open new markets among people who like to make and watch movies on television, on the computer and in theaters.” <span class="org">Nashville Film Festival</span> Director <span class="per">Brian Owens</span>, right, speaks with <span class="per">Stewart Lenig</span>, head of the <span class="org">Columbia State Community College</span> drama department, and CSCC student Trishae Dotson following his presentation at the college <span class="date">earlier this month</span>.</p><br><br>
