  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Monument For Sale</span>. There are 12 houses for sale on Monument Avenue. That’s up almost 60% from <span class="date">last year</span>. This could be your chance to snap up a Monument mansion for a cool million (or two). Houses range from the low end at $620,000 up to two million and change. The biggest house clocks in at 7,526 square feet at <span class="date">2031</span> Monument Ave. with five kitchens, six living rooms, ten office spaces plus five bedrooms. Its asking price is $899,000. The brick mansion designed by architect <span class="per">William Lawrence Bottomley</span> who designed several houses in the Virginia area as well as <span class="loc">New York</span> is for sale at <span class="date">2714</span> Monument Ave for $2,195,000. It features formal living and dining rooms, a powder room, an octagonal library and a gourmet kitchen. Marianne Donohue, a real estate agent with Long &amp; Foster, says there’s no real reason for the increase. The market varies from year to year. She does say that house prices are down in the <span class="loc">Richmond</span> area and that there is more inventory on the market than in <span class="date">the past</span>. “But it’s a great time to buy a house,“ <span class="loc">Donohue</span> says. “The rates are great. And there’s an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers with no interest. “</p><br><br>
