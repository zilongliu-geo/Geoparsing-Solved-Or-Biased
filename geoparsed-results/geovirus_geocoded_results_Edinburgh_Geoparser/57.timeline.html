  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>New research findings from <span class="loc">South Africa</span> on an extremely drug-resistant (XDR) strain of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB) alarm experts. XDR-TB is defined as resistance to three or more second line antibiotics for TB. The condition remains treatable with other types of medications, but those are less effective, costlier and toxic. <span class="per">Dr. Tony Moll</span> discovered the Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region KwaZulu-Natal. In an interview, he said the new variant was "very highly troubling and alarming because of the very high fatality rate." Some patients might have contracted the bug in the hospital, <span class="per">Dr. Moll</span> thinks, and at least two were hospital health workers. These distressing findings urged a two-day meeting in <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span> to discuss the situation. Experts like <span class="per">Dr. Moll</span> believe the new strain is also present in other provinces than KwaZulu-Natal. Conference organizers report cases in <span class="loc">Mozambique</span> and <span class="loc">Botswana</span> too. The World Health Organization has called for renewed efforts to combat the disease. Meanwhile, officials of the Health Ministry are suspected to be enforcing a media ban on the topics of AIDS and possibly TB. During <span class="date">the 1990s</span>, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin, emerged as a threat to TB control, both in the <span class="loc">United States</span> and worldwide.</p><br><br>
