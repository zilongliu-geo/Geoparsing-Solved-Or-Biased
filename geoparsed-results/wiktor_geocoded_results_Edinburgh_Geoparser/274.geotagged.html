<p><span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> (2011 population 599) is a small town in central <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> approximately 40 km northeast of <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span> on the <span class="loc">Fish Creek</span> in Division No. 15. <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> was first settled by immigrants of Russian, English, Scottish and Ukrainian descent in the 1890s. The railway arrived in 1905. Initial settlers in <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> moved from Eastern and Atlantic <span class="loc">Canada</span> (of English or Scottish ancestry), Ukrainian immigrants (1898â€“1899) and Mennonite's (from <span class="loc">Manitoba</span>) in 1901. In 1905 the Canadian Northern Railway reached the town, by 1908 the railway had become critical for the sale of wheat, with 120 rail cards of hard wheat leaving the town that year. The business on main street peaked in the early 1930s, until much of Main Street was destroyed by fire in 1937. The Aberdeen Rec Complex is located in the town and consists of a Library, meeting room, ice rink, curling rink, bowling alley, dance studio, music room and meeting rooms. SaskWater purchases water from the <span class="loc">city of Saskatoon</span> and then sells the water to the town of <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span>, that in turn sells the water to local residents. This is facilitated through the use of a $4 Million pipeline that was completed in 2010.</p>
