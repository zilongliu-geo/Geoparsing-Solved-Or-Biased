<p><span class="loc">Manchester</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Clay County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the seat of its county and the home of a minimum- and medium-security federal prison. The city's population was 1,255 at the 2010 census. The town was founded to be the seat of the newly formed Clay Co. in 1807 on a 10-acre (4.0 ha) parcel near the Lower Goose Creek Salt Works. The county court stipulated that the town be named <span class="loc">Greenville</span> in honor of the War-of-1812 general who gave the county its name. The <span class="loc">Greenville</span> in <span class="loc">Muhlenberg County</span> had already preëmpted that name, however, and it was changed to "Manchester" in December. There was a local legend in the town that this was in honor of the hometown of Gen. Garrard's second wife Lucy Lees, but Rennick points out that she was born well after the naming of the city. He opines that it is more likely that the local businessmen simply wanted a name evocative of the English industrial success. <span class="loc">Manchester</span> is located at 37°9′10″N 83°45′48″W (37.152818, -83.763403). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.5 square miles (3.9 km2), all land.</p>
