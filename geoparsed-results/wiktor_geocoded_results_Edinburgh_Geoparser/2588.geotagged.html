<p><span class="loc">Buda</span> is a historical neighbourhood in the Belgian <span class="loc">city of Courtray</span>. The neighbourhood is part of the historical old town. Since it lies between two branches of the River Leie, it is an island and is also called the 'Buda-island'. <span class="loc">Buda</span> has been known as the area north of the River Leie for centuries. From 1454 onwards, <span class="loc">Buda</span> was incorporated within the city boundaries thanks to new ramparts. This stone wall around the city was 2.3 km long. The name <span class="loc">Buda</span> rose for the first time at the end of the 17th century. In 1686, the <span class="loc">city of Buda</span> in <span class="loc">Hungary</span> was conquered from the Turks. Compared to Pest, the upper town of <span class="loc">Buda</span> lies on the other side of the <span class="loc">Donau</span> River. When <span class="loc">Vauban</span> in 1690 and 1698 developed the new fortifications around the <span class="loc">Buda</span> Island in Courtray, people said they had built a little <span class="loc">Buda</span> over here, near the existing Broel Towers. This name was kept alive among the inhabitants of the city and was found for the first times in the city archives in 1734. Later on, this name was given to the main street along the island. This <span class="loc">Buda</span> street (Budastraat in Dutch) is one of the eldest streets in town.</p>
