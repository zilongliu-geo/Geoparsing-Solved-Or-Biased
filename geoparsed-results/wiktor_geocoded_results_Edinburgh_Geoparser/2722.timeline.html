It is currently located in the present-day municipality of <span class="loc">Tvedestrand</span> in the <span class="loc">Sørlandet region</span>. It is located along the Nordkalottruta. The church at <span class="loc">Holt</span> probably dates from the twelfth century and has an ancient font. The interior was decorated by Torsten Hoff. The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Holt farm (Old Norse: <span class="loc">Holt</span>), since the first church was built there.

The municipality (originally the parish) of <span class="loc">Holt</span> was established on <span class="date">1 January 1838</span> (see formannskapsdistrikt). According to the <span class="date">1835</span> census, the municipality had a population of 3,116. On <span class="date">1 January 1881</span>, a part of <span class="loc">Holt</span> with 52 inhabitants was moved to the neighboring municipality of Dypvåg, and on <span class="date">1 July 1919</span> another part of <span class="loc">Holt</span> with 14 inhabitants was moved to the neighboring municipality of <span class="loc">Moland</span>.
