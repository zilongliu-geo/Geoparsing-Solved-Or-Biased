The population was 3,147 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Las Lomas</span> is one of several colonias in <span class="loc">Starr County</span>, within the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> Valley region. The name is derived from the community's terrain. <span class="loc">Las Lomas</span> is located at 26°21′50″N 98°46′29″W (26.363943, -98.774670). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.6 square mile (1.5 km²), all land. Emanuella Grinberg of <span class="org">CNN</span> said that <span class="loc">Las Lomas</span> at one time "consisted of dilapidated shacks, trailers or homes in various stages of completion. Homes with no foundations, no floors, no windows, doors, or walls were scattered throughout" the community. Grinberg added that "strong winds stirred up suffocating clouds of dust in the streets" because all of the streets were unpaved. She added that "[s]mall gullies formed when it rained because there was no drainage system. Gangs of teens prowled the area, burning unattended construction sites, stealing TVs or the few households appliances people owned". As of <span class="date">2011</span>, residents are increasingly gaining basic services.</p><br><br>
