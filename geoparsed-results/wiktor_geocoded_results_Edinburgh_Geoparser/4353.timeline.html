  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Davis</span>, <span class="per">Massachusetts</span> is the abandoned location of the <span class="per">Davis</span> Pyrite Mine. Once the largest iron pyrite-mine in <span class="per">Massachusetts, Davis</span> grew to be a decent sized mining village at the beginnings of the Second Industrial Revolution (<span class="date">1870</span>–<span class="date">1915</span>). But, in <span class="date">1911</span>, a non-fatal collapse of the mine due to “poor mining practices” ended the nearly 30-year run. By <span class="date">1937</span>, the mining camp had faded, and all that remained were a blacksmith shop and about 150 cellar holes. <span class="per">Davis</span> is located at 42°41′52″N 72°52′13″W. The abandoned mining village is located in the Town of <span class="loc">Rowe</span>, in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, about three miles north of <span class="loc">Charlemont</span> and two miles south-southeast of <span class="loc">Rowe</span>. The area is east of <span class="per">Davis</span> Mine Road and west of <span class="per">Davis</span> Mine Brook. Both <span class="loc">Rowe</span> (<span class="date">2000</span> pop - 351) and <span class="loc">Charlemont</span> (<span class="date">2000</span> pop - <span class="date">1358</span>) are picturesque small towns in the rolling hills of northwestern <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Both communities have a long heritage. <span class="loc">Rowe</span> was established in <span class="date">1762</span> and incorporated in <span class="date">1785</span>, and <span class="loc">Charlemont</span> was established in <span class="date">1742</span> and incorporated in <span class="date">1765</span>. It was in the wooded hills between the two towns that an iron pyrite outcrop was discovered and a mine developed by <span class="per">H.J. Davis</span> around <span class="date">1882</span>. The eastern section of <span class="loc">Rowe</span>, called <span class="per">Davis</span>, became the center of activity because of the profitable operation of <span class="per">Davis</span> <span class="loc">Sulfur</span> <span class="loc">Ore</span> Mine for <span class="date">twenty-nine years</span>. The <span class="per">Davis</span> Mine supplied a major economic boost to both <span class="loc">Rowe</span> and <span class="loc">Charlemont</span>.</p><br><br>
