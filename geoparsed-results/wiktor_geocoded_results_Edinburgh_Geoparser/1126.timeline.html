  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Progress, <span class="loc">Oregon</span> is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Originally an unincorporated community that stood apart from any city, most of Progress <span class="date">now</span> lies within the city limits of either <span class="loc">Tigard</span> or <span class="loc">Beaverton</span>. Other nearby communities include Garden Home and <span class="loc">Metzger</span>. Progress is located in the area surrounding the intersection of <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 217, <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 210 (Scholls Ferry Road), and the unsigned <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 141 (Hall Boulevard). <span class="date">Today</span>, Scholls Ferry Road forms much of the boundary between <span class="loc">Tigard</span> and <span class="loc">Beaverton</span>. The Progress area is home to Washington Square, a large, upscale shopping mall. Progress is also located along the Tigard-Beaverton branch line, a rail line operated by <span class="loc">Portland</span> &amp; Western Railroad, which currently provides freight service to <span class="loc">Washington County</span>. This line is one of many rail lines in <span class="loc">Oregon</span> that formerly provided passenger service. With the opening of the <span class="org">Westside Express Service</span> (WES) commuter-rail service in <span class="date">February 2009</span>, passenger service returned to these tracks, in weekday peak periods only. The WES line's Hall/Nimbus station is located at the western edge of Progress.</p><br><br>
