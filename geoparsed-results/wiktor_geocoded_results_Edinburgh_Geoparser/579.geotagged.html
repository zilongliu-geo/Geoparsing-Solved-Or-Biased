<p>Milton is a district in the Scottish <span class="loc">city of Glasgow</span>, situated north of the <span class="loc">River Clyde</span>. The housing scheme is about 2.5 miles north of <span class="loc">Glasgow City</span> Centre. The construction of Milton started in the late 1940s as a part of a general post-war construction programme by Glasgow Corporation to deal with the housing shortages and slum clearances. The district is bordered to the south and east by Ashgill Road. It is also bordered by <span class="loc">Liddesdale</span> Road, which had previously connected <span class="loc">Colston</span> to <span class="loc">Balmore</span> Road. The new streets were named after the Scottish islands: <span class="loc">Berneray</span>, <span class="loc">Birsay</span>, <span class="loc">Castlebay</span>, <span class="loc">Cathay</span>, <span class="loc">Egilsay</span>, <span class="loc">Longay</span>, <span class="loc">Mingulay</span>, <span class="loc">Ornsay</span>, <span class="loc">Raasay</span>, Ronaldsay, <span class="loc">Scalpay</span>, Scaraway, Shilay Skerray, <span class="loc">Stornoway</span>, <span class="loc">Torogay</span>, <span class="loc">Vallay</span> and <span class="loc">Westray</span>. The area had only a few private homes (in <span class="loc">Liddesdale</span> Road/<span class="loc">Birsay</span> Road and Loskin Drive) prior to the new development. The scheme was completed in 1952, but further housing was added in later years, including high-rise flats in <span class="loc">Castlebay</span> Drive in the late 1960s. Housing styles varied from gray stone apartment houses with back and front doors, to brown or white clad pre-fabricated apartment housing, and 4 storey flats of 8 units each, some with open verandas. All housing was rented social housing.</p>
