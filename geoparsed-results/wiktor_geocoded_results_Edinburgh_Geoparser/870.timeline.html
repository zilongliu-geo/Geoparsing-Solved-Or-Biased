  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dublin</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Cheshire County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,597 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is home to <span class="org">Dublin School</span> and Yankee magazine is based there. In <span class="date">1749</span>, the Masonian proprietors granted the town as Monadnock No. 3 (or North Monadnock) to <span class="per">Matthew Thornton</span> and 39 others. But the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span> thwarted permanent settlement until the 1760s, when <span class="per">Henry Strongman</span> moved from <span class="loc">Peterborough</span>. Other early settlers arrived from <span class="loc">Sherborn</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. In <span class="date">1771</span>, Governor <span class="per">John Wentworth</span> incorporated the town, naming it after <span class="per">Strongman</span>'s birthplace: <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. Like all towns in this area, the terrain features hills and valleys. Farmers found the soil hard and rocky, but with effort it yielded maize, oats, barley and potatoes, with some wheat and rye. Orchards were common. The first census, taken in <span class="date">1790</span>, reported 901 residents. By <span class="date">1859</span>, there were 1,088. Then in <span class="date">1870</span>, the small mill town of <span class="loc">Harrisville</span> voted to separate from <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, leaving the latter with only 455 residents during the <span class="date">1880</span> census.</p><br><br>
