<p><span class="loc">Croydon</span> is a village and civil parish in <span class="loc">South Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is 10 miles (16 km) south-west of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> and immediately west of the A1198 road (the Roman <span class="loc">Ermine</span> Street). The population in 2001 was 221 people. The site of the deserted medieval village of <span class="loc">Clopton</span> is in <span class="loc">Croydon parish</span>, which was formerly known as Croydon-cum-Clopton. The village's name was spelled Crauudene in the 1086 Domesday book - it is derived from the Old English crawe and denu, meaning 'valley of the crows'. The parish is now known as <span class="loc">Croydon</span>, but it used to be called 'Croydon-with-Clopton' or 'Croydon-cum-Clopton' - In 1086, about 28 peasants lived at <span class="loc">Croydon</span>. The separate vills of <span class="loc">Croydon</span> and <span class="loc">Clopton</span> were joined in 1561 and <span class="loc">Croydon</span>'s population may have increased to around 140 people early in the 17th century, but fell to 90 during the reign of Charles II. Open fields surrounding <span class="loc">Croydon</span> village were inclosed for pasture around 1640, but from the late 18th century arable farming recommenced. Current-day <span class="loc">Croydon</span> grew up along a street which runs east-west along the ridge to the north of the parish. Some timber-framed houses dating from the late 17th or early 18th centuries still stand, though most of the cottages date from the early 19th century. The main route through the parish followed a terrace along the steep hillside towards <span class="loc">Tadlow</span>. The track, called 'Royston road', was improved and incorporated into the Cambridge-Biggleswade turnpike, later became the A603 and it has now been downgraded to the B1042. <span class="loc">Croydon</span> Old Lane, in the north, went towards <span class="loc">Hatley</span>, while the current road up <span class="loc">Croydon Hill</span> to <span class="loc">Hatley</span> was first built in 1830.</p>
