  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Easton is a town in <span class="loc">Fairfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,490 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Easton contains the historic <span class="loc">district of Aspetuck</span>. The town is situated amongst <span class="loc">Redding</span>, <span class="loc">Monroe</span>, <span class="loc">Trumbull</span>, <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, <span class="loc">Weston</span>, and <span class="loc">Newtown</span>. Easton is made of green terrain. Easton was first settled in <span class="date">1757</span> by men from <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>. In <span class="date">1762</span> a congregation called the <span class="loc">North Fairfield</span> Society was established, and it gradually evolved into Easton. In <span class="date">1787</span> <span class="loc">Weston</span>, then including lands <span class="date">now</span> defined as Easton, was incorporated out of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>. The area was slow to develop because of the rough hills along the <span class="loc">Aspetuck River</span>, and so it was not until <span class="date">1845</span> that what is <span class="date">now</span> Easton separated from <span class="loc">Weston</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, half of the town's property is owned by the Aquarion Water Company of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, the major supplier of water in the area. On <span class="date">June 1, 1968</span>, the deaf and blind activist <span class="per">Helen Keller</span> died at the age of 87 in her Easton home, where she chose to spend her final <span class="date">days</span>. Her house is still intact <span class="date">today</span> and has been owned by several families since her death. The local middle school bears her name.</p><br><br>
