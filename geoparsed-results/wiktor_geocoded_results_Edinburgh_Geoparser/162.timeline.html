  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Banda</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Sindhudurg district</span> in <span class="loc">Maharashtra</span>, <span class="loc">India</span> near the Goa-Maharashtra border. <span class="loc">Banda</span> is the last town of Mahrashtra state on Mumbai-Goa national highway (NH-17). <span class="loc">Terekhol</span> is main river on the bank of which <span class="loc">Banda city</span> is established. God Shree <span class="per">Bandeshwar</span> and <span class="per">Goddess</span> Shree Bhumika are the Main Temples in the Village. Apart from these temples, temples of <span class="per">Lord Vitthal</span>, <span class="loc">Hanuman</span> are also in the town. The name of the village <span class="loc">Banda</span> is only because of the <span class="per">God Bandeshwar</span>, a Jagrit Swayambhu Shivalinga.In ancient age the <span class="loc">Banda</span> was known as <span class="loc">Adilabad</span> due to reign of Adilshahi. Evidences of his reign can still be seen in the form of Redeghumat, Bailghumat and other ancient constructions in and around the town. <span class="loc">Adil</span> was defeated by Portuguese. During the time of Shivaji, name <span class="loc">Adilabad</span> got converted into <span class="loc">Banda</span> because of the deity <span class="per">Lord Bandeshwar</span>. This 300+ <span class="date">years</span> old <span class="org">Temple of Lord</span> <span class="per">Bandeshwar</span> is being renovated. All the devotees are contributing for the same. It is a very real faith that the <span class="per">Lord Bandeshwar</span> can only be worshipped, by entering into the Garbhagriha, by Holy Priest that is the Brahmin of the Temple. To keep devine purity and holiness of the Temple, all the citizens of <span class="loc">Banda</span> follow this tradition very heartily and do not enter into the garbhagriha. There are total 12 Shivalingas inside the Garbhgriha of the <span class="per">Bandeshwar</span> temple. There is various temples of other deities e.g.Bhumika, Ravalnath, <span class="loc">Vetal</span>, <span class="loc">Ganapati</span>, Maharingan etc. around the main <span class="per">Bandeshwar</span> temple. Jatra is being celebrated in the month of <span class="date">December</span> every year.</p><br><br>
