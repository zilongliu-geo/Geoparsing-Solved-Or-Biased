  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Marion</span> is a census-designated place in <span class="loc">Summit County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 685, according to the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Marion</span> is a small farming community located about 40 miles (64 km) east of <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span> and 18 miles (29 km) east of <span class="loc">Park City</span> in the upper <span class="loc">Kamas</span> Valley, part of the Wasatch Back region of <span class="loc">Utah</span>. Lying 2 miles (3.2 km) due north of the <span class="loc">city of Kamas</span> on <span class="loc">Utah</span> State Route 32, <span class="loc">Marion</span> has always been closely associated with <span class="loc">Kamas</span>. Approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) to the north, across the <span class="loc">Weber River</span>, is the <span class="loc">city of Oakley</span>. The area that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Marion</span> was used in the 1860s by rancher <span class="per">Samuel P. Hoyt</span>, whose 600â€“700 head of cattle grazed over most of Marion's land. The settlement itself was founded in the mid-1870s and was originally named "<span class="per">Morrell</span>" after <span class="per">William Morrell</span>, who built the first house. A large portion of the early settlers were Danish American immigrants, and the community was also often called "<span class="loc">Denmark</span>". The name <span class="loc">Marion</span> has been credited to two different sources: <span class="per">Francis Marion Lyman</span>, who, as President of the Quorum of the <span class="loc">Twelve Apostles</span> of The Church of <span class="per">Jesus Christ</span> of Latter-day Saints, organized the first ward in the area in <span class="date">1909</span>, and Marion Myrick Sorensen, who settled here with her first husband in <span class="date">1882</span>. The Marion precinct first appeared under that name in the <span class="date">1900</span> census.</p><br><br>
