  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Stamford</span> is a city located on the border of <span class="loc">Jones</span> and <span class="loc">Haskell</span> counties in west central <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The population was 3,124 according to the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Henry McHarg</span>, president of the <span class="org">Texas Central Railroad</span>, named the site in <span class="date">1900</span> for his hometown of <span class="loc">Stamford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. The city is home to the <span class="per">Texas</span> Cowboy Reunion. <span class="loc">Stamford</span> is located on <span class="loc">US</span> Highway 277 and State Highway 6. Most of the city is in <span class="loc">Jones County</span>, one of 46 dry counties in <span class="per">Texas</span>. The portion of the city within <span class="loc">Jones County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Abilene</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. While the town was named by <span class="per">Henry King McHarg</span> for <span class="loc">Stamford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, the townsite was donated by the family of Swante Magnus <span class="per">Swenson</span>. <span class="per">Mr. Swenson</span> was the first Swedish immigrant to <span class="loc">Texas</span>. He became one of the largest landowners in <span class="per">Texas</span>, and by <span class="date">1860</span> his holdings in <span class="per">West Texas</span> approached 500,000 acres (202,343 ha). These ranches, which spread across twelve <span class="loc">Texas counties</span>, became known as SMS Ranches. Later reorganized as the <span class="loc">Swenson</span> Land and Cattle Company, it is headquartered in <span class="loc">Stamford</span> to <span class="date">this day</span>. <span class="per">Mr. Swenson</span> had two sons, <span class="per">Eric Pierson</span> and <span class="per">Swen Albin</span>, who became known as the <span class="org">Swenson brothers</span>. They ran SMS Ranches, and even developed a Morab horse breeding program near the city.</p><br><br>
