<p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 21,704. The county seat is <span class="loc">Washington</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">IA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was originally formed on January 18, 1838 as <span class="loc">Slaughter County</span> in honor of William B. Slaughter, the secretary of Wisconsin Territory. A short time later it was renamed <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, in honor of <span class="loc">George Washington</span>. The first settlers arrived in <span class="loc">Washington County</span> in 1835. The homesteads did not start until 1836. A town was built in the present day township of <span class="loc">Oregon</span> named <span class="loc">Astoria</span>. It became the first county seat and housed the first court house. In 1839, <span class="loc">Washington</span> became the final location of the seat of justice. The first religious society organized by Reverend J.L. Kirkpatrick, a Methodist reverend was created in 1839. The first newspaper was established in 1853; lasting only two years before crumbling. The very next year another newspaper was created, which is still viable today. The major waterways through <span class="loc">Washington County</span> are the Skunk and English Rivers and the <span class="loc">Crooked Creek</span>. Timber is found in abundance around these bodies of waters which helps in the major business of lumber. Soon after the year 1855, a bank was started in the <span class="loc">city of Washington</span> and other institutions followed soon after. No major increase in population happened until the year 1858 when the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> and <span class="loc">Missouri Railroad</span> was finished through <span class="loc">Washington</span>.</p>
