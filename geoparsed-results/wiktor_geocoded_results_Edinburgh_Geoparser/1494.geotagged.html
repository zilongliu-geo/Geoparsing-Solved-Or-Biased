<p>The <span class="loc">Claremont district</span> is a neighborhood straddling the city limits of <span class="loc">Oakland</span> and <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> in the <span class="loc">East Bay</span> section of the San Francisco Bay Area in <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies at an elevation of 266 feet (81 m). The main thoroughfares are <span class="loc">Claremont</span> and <span class="loc">Ashby Avenues</span>. The name was given in the late 19th century by a real estate developer. Previously, the area was grazing land owned by a man named <span class="loc">Harwood</span>. Harwood's name was given to the canyon and the creek draining the canyon, previously shown on maps as the north fork of <span class="loc">Temescal</span> Creek. When a telegraph line was strung through this canyon, it was dubbed "Telegraph Canyon". A stage coach line ran up the canyon and over the summit into Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span>. This became an early auto route over the <span class="loc">Berkeley Hills</span> until the first auto tunnel opened up in the 1910s at the top of Old Tunnel Road to the south of <span class="loc">Claremont Canyon</span>, above where the Caldecott Tunnel is today. Today, Harwood's/Telegraph Canyon is <span class="loc">Claremont</span> Canyon, and North Fork <span class="loc">Temescal</span>/Harwood's Creek is <span class="loc">Claremont</span> Creek.</p>
