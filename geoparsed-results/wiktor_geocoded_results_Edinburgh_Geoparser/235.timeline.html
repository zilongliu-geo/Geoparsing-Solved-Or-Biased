  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Martin County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 516 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The current mayor is <span class="per">Gil Matthews</span>. Elected Town Commissioners include <span class="per">Franky Stokes Lee</span> (mayor pro tem), <span class="per">Herbert Lee Everett</span>, Kerry Spivey, Mamie Staton, and <span class="per">Ervin Williams</span>. The mayor and all 5 commissioners were re-elected without opposition in the <span class="date">November 5, 2013</span> municipal election. All commissioners and the mayor serve <span class="date">2 year</span> terms. The town's municipal building is located at 101 North Front Street and is open Monday-Friday 8 AM - noon and 1 PM - 5 PM. <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is located at 35°56′39″N 77°12′28″W (35.944116, -77.207772). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.5 square miles (1.3 km2), all of it land. It is located on the <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> River at the 60 <span class="per">Mile Mark</span>. The town was founded in <span class="date">1804</span> on the highest point of the <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> River. The most significant historical event of early <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> was the battle and fall of Fort Branch, when Union vessels and troops came upriver from <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> (see <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> History) in an attempt to reach <span class="loc">Weldon</span> to cut off supplies to General <span class="per">Robert E. Lee</span> during the Civil War. The fort protected <span class="loc">Weldon</span> until the day after the <span class="per">General Lee</span> surrendered at Appomattox <span class="loc">Court House</span>, whereupon the railroad line over the <span class="loc">Weldon</span> bridge had no more military significance. Afterwards, the fort was abandoned and the cannons were dumped into the <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> River by departing Confederate troops, and were only recently discovered. In <span class="date">July 1972</span>, a group of men from <span class="loc">Alabama</span> came and began pulling cannons from the river. The group was accused of violating <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>'s antiquities laws in an effort to keep the cannons in <span class="loc">Martin County</span>. The courts officially decided that the cannons belong to the state under the North <span class="org">Carolina Department of Archives and History</span>. The department decided to permanently loan the artifact to Fort Branch.</p><br><br>
