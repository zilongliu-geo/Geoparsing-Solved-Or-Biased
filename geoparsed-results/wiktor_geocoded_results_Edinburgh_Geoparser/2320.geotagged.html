<p><span class="loc">Marino</span> is a suburb in the south of Adelaide, <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It sits on coastal hills overlooking Gulf <span class="loc">St Vincent</span>, within the <span class="loc">City of Marion</span> local government area. It neighbours <span class="loc">Seacliff</span>, <span class="loc">Hallett Cove</span> and <span class="loc">Kingston Park</span>. The suburb features the <span class="loc">Marino Rocks</span> beach which has a steep cliff face and then a low and flat rocky beach, leading out to a reef on the southern end of <span class="loc">Seacliff</span>. Fishing and snorkelling are common recreation activities. At the northern end of the beach, the public artwork Contemplation can be viewed, by artist Marijana Tadic. Launched in 2006, the artwork takes the form of a rocked boat. Also as of 2006, at the access point to the beach, there is mosaic artwork on the outer walls of the toilet facility. These were designed and constructed by South Australian artist Michael Tye. Michael worked with local artists and community members in the design and construction of the mosaic artwork along the nearby retaining wall. The <span class="loc">Seaford</span> railway line passes through the suburb, and there are two railway stations: <span class="loc">Marino</span> and <span class="loc">Marino Rocks</span>. The line has had an active history, first being built In 1913 to <span class="loc">Marino</span> and extending to <span class="loc">Willunga</span> in 1915. The section from <span class="loc">Hallett Cove</span> to <span class="loc">Willunga</span> was closed in 1969. In the 1970s the line was extended south from <span class="loc">Hallett Cove</span>, reaching <span class="loc">Christie</span> Downs in 1976 and Noarlunga Centre in 1978.</p>
