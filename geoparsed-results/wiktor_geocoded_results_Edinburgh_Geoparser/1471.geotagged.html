<p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Burlington County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and a suburb of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city's population was 9,920, reflecting an increase of 184 (+1.9%) from the 9,736 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn declined by 99 (-1.0%) from the 9,835 counted in the 1990 Census. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> was first incorporated on October 24, 1693, and was reincorporated by Royal charter on May 7, 1733. After American independence, the city was incorporated by the State of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> on December 21, 1784. On March 14, 1851, the city was reincorporated and enlarged with portions of the surrounding township. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> was originally the county seat of <span class="loc">Burlington County</span> but in 1796, as the population had been increasing to the east away from the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River, the county seat was moved to Mount Holly Township, a more central location. The council of <span class="loc">West Jersey</span> Proprietors purchased roughly 30 miles (48 km) of riverfront land in 1676 from the Lenape Native Americans. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> was founded on part of that land by English settlers (primarily Quakers) in 1677, and served as the capital of the province until 1702, when <span class="loc">West Jersey</span> and East Jersey were combined into a singe Crown Colony.</p>
