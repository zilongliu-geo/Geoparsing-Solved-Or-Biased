<p><span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Banner County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 100 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, and all of <span class="loc">Banner County</span>, were originally part of <span class="loc">Cheyenne County</span> and began with a homestead in 1884. A settlement, at first called Randall and then <span class="loc">Centropolis</span>, developed around this and neighboring homesteads. In November, 1888, <span class="loc">Cheyenne County</span> subdivided into five counties, and the settlement was included in the territory which became <span class="loc">Banner County</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat was originally located at <span class="loc">Ashford</span>, a few miles northeast. However, in 1889 Charles Schooley, a settler, donated part of his land for the development of a formal town. A migrant being from <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> caused the name to be selected. Because of its central location, <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> became the home base for stagecoach and mail carrier lines in the county, and the county government moved its operations from <span class="loc">Ashford</span> in mid-1891. By 1892, Harrsiburg had two hotels, two livery stables, a brickwork, a cheese factory, two banks and three newspapers. It was the principal community for the county, which was almost entirely devoted to wheat farming and cattle ranching. In 1951, oil (which had first been discovered in 1919) became the county's third commodity.</p>
