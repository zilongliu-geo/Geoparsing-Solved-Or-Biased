<p>Bedford is a city located in the <span class="loc">Montérégie region</span> of <span class="loc">southern Quebec</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The population as of the <span class="loc">Canada</span> 2011 Census was 2,684. This small community is just an hour's drive from larger cities such as <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and <span class="loc">Montreal</span>, and is the home to southern <span class="loc">Quebec</span>'s largest boy scout troop. The name "Bedford" could have been given by Loyalists who knew of several <span class="loc">Bedfords</span> back in the former American colonies. The name could also have been a tribute to Lord John Russell, who was the fourth Duke of Bedford (1710–1771), an English politician and Secretary of State (1748–1751), and governor general of <span class="loc">Ireland</span> from 1756 to 1761. Bedford is part of Brome-Missisquoi <span class="loc">Regional County</span> Municipality, in the administrative region of Montérégie. The town, located 86 kilometres (53 mi) southeast of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>, is completely enclaved within the township of Bedford. Seated in the Saint-Lawrence lowlands, at the beginning of the steep leading to the Appalachian Mountains, the <span class="loc">Pike River</span> (Rivière aux Brochets) flows through the middle of the town, separating it into south and north parts.</p>
