<p><span class="loc">Hougang</span> (Chinese: 后港, <span class="loc">Tamil</span>: ஹவ்காங்), officially Hougang Town, is an urban planning area and residential town located in the North-East Region of <span class="loc">Singapore</span>. <span class="loc">Hougang</span> is bordered by <span class="loc">Sengkang</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Geylang</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Bedok</span> to the south-east, <span class="loc">Toa Payoh</span> to the south-west, <span class="loc">Paya Lebar</span> to the east and <span class="loc">Serangoon</span> to the west. <span class="loc">Hougang</span> is the pinyin version of Aū-káng, a Hokkien and Teochew name meaning "river end", as <span class="loc">Hougang</span> is located upstream or at the back of Sungei Serangoon. In the past, the name connoted the area stretching from the fifth milestone junction of Upper Serangoon Road and Upper Paya Lebar Road/Boundary Road to the seventh and a half milestone junction of Upper Serangoon Road and Punggol Road. The area just beyond the seventh milestone along Punggol Road was formerly considered part of Punggol but is now within Hougang Town and that section of Punggol Road is now Hougang Avenue 8, with Punggol Road starting further north. Pig farming was carried out in Punggol, including the area of Punggol that is now part of Hougang Town. The last of these pig farmers were relocated by the late-1990s to flats built in <span class="loc">Hougang</span>. Today, <span class="loc">Hougang</span> is an HDB new town with over 40,000 housing units interspersed with pockets of private residential areas.</p>
