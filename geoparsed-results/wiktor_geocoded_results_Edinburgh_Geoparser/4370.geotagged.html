<p>Lode is a small village in <span class="loc">East Cambridgeshire</span> on the southern edge of The Fens. It lies just north of the B1102 between Quy and <span class="loc">Swaffham Bulbeck</span>, 8 miles (13 km) to the north east of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>. The village's name is derived from its location at the southern end of <span class="loc">Bottisham Lode</span> that links it to the <span class="loc">River Cam</span>. A lode is an artificial water channel used to drain the Fens, thought to be of Roman origin. Lode also has the smaller hamlet settlement of <span class="loc">Long Meadow</span> as part of the parish to the east along the B1102. Lode is a comparatively new civil parish, having been separated from <span class="loc">Bottisham</span> in 1894. Lode is the location of <span class="loc">Anglesey Abbey</span>, which was formerly the home of the Fairhaven family, who lived there for many years, but is now the property of the National Trust. The 1st Lord Fairhaven was responsible for the unique gardens in the grounds of the former 12th-century abbey. Also part of the estate is Lode Mill, a restored watermill that is open to the public. In the 19th century, <span class="loc">Anglesey Abbey</span> was owned and occupied by Reverend Hailstone who was also vicar of <span class="loc">Bottisham</span>. Convinced that Lode merited its own church, he built the present church of <span class="loc">St James</span>, which was dedicated in 1853. The Hailstone family provided a vicar for the following 80 years.</p>
