  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>City Council talks money. Sales tax revenue is down, but officials say budget is still ‘in line’ The <span class="loc">Athens City</span> Council was given a budget update on <span class="date">Wednesday morning</span>. “It is no surprise sales tax was down,” Director of Finance <span class="per">David Hopkins</span> said at the special session. <span class="per">Hopkins</span> said sales tax revenues were down 6.86 percent from <span class="date">last year</span>. He said revenues are down 5 percent overall from <span class="date">last year</span>. <span class="per">Hopkins</span> said the city has saved money in other areas to help balance the budget. It saved $15,000 to $20,000 on its health insurance premiums, lower gas prices and attrition, according to <span class="per">Hopkins</span>. “Everything else is pretty much in line,” he said. “The one bright spot is the hotel/motel tax.” The occupancy tax revenues have increased about $10,000 over <span class="date">last year</span>. He said the revenues have been trending downward over <span class="date">the last two months</span>. <span class="per">Hopkins</span> said the city has about $400,000 in reserves if needed. The council also discussed:â ¢ canceling the <span class="date">May 9</span> <span class="loc">City of Athens</span> general elections. City Administrator <span class="per">Pam Burton</span> said only Mayor Randy <span class="per">Daniel</span> and <span class="per">Councilmember</span> Place 1 <span class="per">Jerry Don Vaught</span> filed for the two available seats. Since the law allowing entities without a contested race to cancel elections went into effect in <span class="date">1996</span>, <span class="loc">Athens</span> has had few contested municipal races. Elections were canceled in <span class="date">1997</span>, <span class="date">1998</span>, <span class="date">1999</span>, <span class="date">2001</span>, <span class="date">2003</span>, <span class="date">2004</span>, <span class="date">2007</span> and <span class="date">2008</span>. â ¢ authorizing a contract with Brinkley Sargent Architects for a facility needs study. The council voted on <span class="date">Jan. 13</span> to put the matter on hold for <span class="date">60 days</span>. <span class="per">Burton</span> said at the time the council should wait to see what the economic conditions would be before committing to spending the $39,500. “As you can tell there has not been any positive change,” <span class="per">Burton</span> said. <span class="per">Athens Mayor Randy Daniel</span> said caution is advised at this time of the budget year.</p><br><br>
