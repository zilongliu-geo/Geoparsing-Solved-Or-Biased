  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Union County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 25,748. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">La Grande</span>. <span class="loc">Union County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">La Grande</span>, <span class="loc">OR</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. It is one of the eight counties of eastern <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. According to <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Geographic Names, the county is named for the town of Union. <span class="loc">Union County</span> was originally part of <span class="loc">Wasco County</span>. The northern end of the Grande Ronde Valley was the first part to be settled. During the 1860s, population growth in eastern <span class="loc">Oregon</span> prompted the State Legislature to split <span class="per">Umatilla</span> and <span class="per">Baker</span> Counties from <span class="loc">Wasco County</span> in <span class="date">1862</span>. Further settlement in the Grande Ronde Valley led to the division of <span class="loc">Baker County</span> to create <span class="loc">Union County</span> on <span class="date">October 14, 1864</span>. The county doubled in population between <span class="date">1880</span> and <span class="date">1890</span>. The choice of a county seat resulted in competition, based on geography and on economic and population growth, between <span class="loc">La Grande</span> and the <span class="loc">city of Union</span>. The county seat alternated between Union and <span class="loc">La Grande</span> until it permanently came to rest at <span class="loc">La Grande</span> in <span class="date">1905</span>. Between <span class="date">1875</span> and <span class="date">1913</span>, adjustments were made between <span class="loc">Union County</span>'s borders and the borders of Baker, <span class="loc">Umatilla</span>, and <span class="loc">Wallowa</span> counties.</p><br><br>
