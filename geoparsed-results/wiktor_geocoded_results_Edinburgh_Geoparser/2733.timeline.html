  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Columbia</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 486 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Many of the major events of <span class="org">Columbia</span>'s past have been summarized in this section from local texts, newspaper accounts, and from the recollections of residents. The first formal record of government is a petition for a Justice of the Peace in <span class="date">1770</span> to the Governor of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> by persons living in the <span class="loc">Pleasant River</span> valley. The town of <span class="loc">Columbia</span> was originally known as Township 12. Neighboring Township 13, <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Columbia Falls</span>, was joined with Township 12 and incorporated as the Town of <span class="loc">Columbia</span> in <span class="date">1796</span>. This association lasted for <span class="date">67 years</span> until <span class="loc">Columbia Falls</span> incorporated as a separate town in <span class="date">1863</span>. In the 1790s, "Lottery Townships" (including Twp 12) sold for 20 cents an acre. <span class="per">Alexander Baring</span> refers to a settlement of about 30 Quaker families located near the center of Township 12. Families supported themselves with sawmills and shipbuilding. The first sawmill in <span class="loc">Columbia</span> was in <span class="loc">Epping</span>, near the present <span class="per">Fish</span> and <span class="per">Game</span> Club, built by <span class="per">Moses Worcester</span>. It later burned, giving Burnt Mill Rips its name. Others were as follows: <span class="loc">Little River</span>, <span class="loc">Saco Falls</span>, <span class="per">Branch Brook</span>, <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>, <span class="loc">Webb District</span> and on <span class="org">the Eastern Branch of Great Marsh Stream</span>. Ship building also took place along <span class="per">Branch Brook</span>.</p><br><br>
