  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Union is a city in <span class="loc">Boone County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,379 in the <span class="date">2010</span> Census. The area was rural until mass residential growth in <span class="date">1990's</span> and <span class="date">2000</span>'s <span class="org">The City of Union</span> grew from a small settlement that may have existed as early as the late 18th century. However, by the early 19th century, much of the land that <span class="date">now</span> lies in Union was owned by the Fowler family, and <span class="per">Benjamin Piatt</span> Fowler built his home in what is <span class="date">now</span> the northern area of the city c. <span class="date">1817</span>. It has been recorded that Union was established as early as <span class="date">1833</span>, but existing documentation shows that Union was officially incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1838</span>. Why the name Union was chosen no one actually knows, but the story goes that since it was a connection point between <span class="loc">Florence</span> and <span class="loc">Big Bone Lick</span>, "Union" seemed somehow appropriate. Salt was manufactured at <span class="loc">Big Bone Lick</span> during the early 19th century, and then brought to Union for distribution to other area settlements. Union is located at 38°56′43″N 84°40′19″W (38.945185, -84.671866).</p><br><br>
