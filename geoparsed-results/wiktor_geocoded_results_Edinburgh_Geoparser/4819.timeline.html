  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 21,218. The county seat is <span class="loc">Eatonton</span>. Since the early 21st century, the county has seen a housing boom due to its proximity to Lake Oconee, as well as major employment centers such as <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, <span class="loc">Athens</span>, and <span class="loc">Macon</span>. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is named in honor of <span class="per">Israel Putnam</span>, a hero of the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span> and a general in the American Revolutionary War. It began to be settled after the war, as migrants moved down from the Upper South. <span class="loc">The County</span> was created on <span class="date">December 10, 1807</span> by an act of the <span class="org">Georgia General Assembly</span>. The county was developed for cotton cultivation, where plantations were dependent on the field labor of numerous African-American slaves. African Americans still comprise more than 40 percent of the county population, even after thousands left during the Great Migration of the first half of the 20th century. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is home to the nationally known Dairy Festival. According to the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span>, the county has a total area of 361 square miles (930 km2), of which 345 square miles (890 km2) is land and 16 square miles (41 km2) (4.4%) is water. The entirety of <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is located in the Upper <span class="loc">Oconee River</span> sub-basin of the <span class="loc">Altamaha River</span> basin.</p><br><br>
