It was also referred to early in its history as Haldimand, which is the name of the township it is located in. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> is an excellent example of the type of hamlets that flourished in the 19th century. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> had a bustling port for many years, shipping grain, barley and other commodities to communities along the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span>. In addition, the hamlet included a Sons of Temperance group, an order of Freemasons, and numerous other social leagues. Bolstered by satellite communities such as <span class="loc">Centreton</span>, <span class="loc">Castleton</span>, <span class="loc">Wicklow</span>, and Vernonville, <span class="loc">Grafton</span> was a productive hamlet that supported itself through both agriculture and services.</p>
