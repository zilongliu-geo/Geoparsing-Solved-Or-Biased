  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Fremont</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Newaygo County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 4,081 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The first inhabitants of the <span class="per">Fremont</span> area were Native Americans. A group of settlers led by <span class="per">Daniel Weaver</span> first settled the area in <span class="date">1855</span>, the Weaver homestead serving as the first post office and public school. In <span class="date">November 1855</span>, <span class="per">Fremont</span> Township was established and named in honor of <span class="per">John C. Fremont</span>, western explorer and Republican Party candidate for United States President. Weaver and his fellow settlers cleared the dense timber in order to farm. Early in the 1870s, Dutch immigrant families came from <span class="per">Holland</span> and <span class="per">Muskegon</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>; and <span class="per">Fremont</span> continues to recognize its early Dutch heritage in local festivals and pageants. Due to rich stands of virgin timber, lumbering became a major industry, and a railroad spur soon linked <span class="per">Fremont</span> to the national rail network. The lumbering industry declined in the 1860s because of the American Civil War; and in <span class="date">1871</span>, <span class="per">Fremont</span> experienced a major forest fire that caused extensive damage, especially to the lumber mills. Nevertheless, <span class="per">Fremont</span> rebuilt and was even able to supply some lumber to rebuild <span class="loc">Chicago</span> after the Great Fire of <span class="date">1871</span>.</p><br><br>
