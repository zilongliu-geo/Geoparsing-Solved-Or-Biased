<p><span class="loc">Florence</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Idaho County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. About 14 air miles (22 km) east-northeast of present-day <span class="loc">Riggins</span> in remote north central <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, it was settled as a mining camp in the winter of 1861. Then in Washington Territory, the town at an elevation of 6,080 feet (1,850 m) quickly became the seat of a new <span class="loc">Idaho County</span> and the rich placer gold fields in the <span class="loc">Florence</span> Basin attracted thousands of prospectors to the area, contributing to the establishment of the <span class="loc">Idaho</span> Territory in 1863. However, intensive mining depleted the richest ground and the county seat moved elsewhere in 1869. The town thrived again from 1895â€“1900, based more on lode mining. Then the town slowly faded away, having only ten inhabitants in 1940, and was totally abandoned sometime after 1951. The discovery of gold around Pierce and Orofino in 1861 drew thousands of prospectors into the <span class="loc">Clearwater River</span> area of present-day north central <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, east of <span class="loc">Lewiston</span>. With all the best ground claimed, many newcomers began to look elsewhere. In late summer 1861, a party of men headed south toward a local divide between the <span class="loc">Clearwater River</span> drainage and the <span class="loc">Salmon River</span> watershed. At that time, much of that area was still part of the <span class="loc">Nez Perce Indian Reservation</span>. (A new treaty in June 1863 reset the reservation boundary.) Perhaps because of Indian protests, the party split at some point. A smaller band of five made their way into a high mountain basin about thirty miles (50 km) south of today's <span class="loc">Grangeville</span>. There, they found very rich placer gold along most of the nearby streams in August 1861. Despite mutual promises to keep the find quiet when they returned to <span class="loc">Elk City</span> for supplies, word quickly got out.</p>
