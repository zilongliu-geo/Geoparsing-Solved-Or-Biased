<p>Assad: <span class="loc">Syria</span> still believes in peace with <span class="loc">Israel</span>. Syrian President Bashar Assad told the weekly magazine the New Yorker that though it may take some time, <span class="loc">Syria</span> still believes in the power of serious dialogue to produce a lasting peace with <span class="loc">Israel</span>. In an interview via email several days after <span class="loc">Israel</span> and Hamas declared unilateral cease-fires following <span class="loc">Israel</span>'s three-week offensive in the <span class="loc">Gaza Strip</span>, Assad said that though <span class="loc">Israel</span> was "doing everything possible to undermine the prospects for peace," he was still very interested in closing a deal. "We have to wait a little while to see how things will evolve and how the situation changes," Assad wrote as <span class="loc">Israel</span> voted in a new government headed by Benjamin Netanyau. "We still believe that we need to conclude a serious dialogue to lead us to peace," he declared. In the interview, Assad argued that <span class="loc">Israel</span> understands that the return of the <span class="loc">Golan Heights</span>, which <span class="loc">Israel</span> captured from <span class="loc">Syria</span> during the 1967 Six-Day War, is not negotiable. "The Israelis know that we are not going to negotiate the line of 1967," Assad wrote, but suggested that compromises were possible. "We only demarcate the line," he wrote. "We negotiate the relations, the water and everything else." ? You discuss everything after the peace and getting your land. Not before," Assad stressed. "Hezbollah is in <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> and Hamas is in <span class="loc">Palestine</span>," Assad continued. "If they want to solve the problem with Hezbollah they have to deal with <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>. For Hamas, they have to deal with <span class="loc">Gaza</span>. For <span class="loc">Iran</span>, it is not part of the peace process anyway. This peace is about peace between <span class="loc">Syria</span> and <span class="loc">Israel</span>." The Syrian president reiterated his stance that it was now, more than ever, "essential that the <span class="loc">United States</span> play a prominent and active role in the peace process," explaining that <span class="loc">Syria</span> required direct contact with <span class="loc">U.S.</span> President Barack Obama in order to advance the diplomatic process. Assad also lauded the diplomatic efforts of former <span class="loc">U.S.</span> president Jimmy Carter, saying that "Carter is most knowledgeable about <span class="loc">the Middle East</span> and he does not try to dictate or give sermons. He sincerely is trying to think creatively and find solutions that are outside the box."</p>
