  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lima</span> (/ˈlaɪmə/ LY-mə) is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Allen County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The municipality is located in northwestern <span class="loc">Ohio</span> along Interstate 75 approximately 72 miles (116 km) north of Dayton and 78 miles (126 km) south-southwest of <span class="loc">Toledo</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a population of 38,771. It is the principal city of and is included in the <span class="loc">Lima</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Lima-Van Wert–Wapakoneta, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Lima</span> was founded in <span class="date">1831</span>. The <span class="org">Lima Army Tank Plant</span>, built in <span class="date">1941</span>, is the sole producer of the M1 <span class="loc">Abrams</span>. In the <span class="date">years</span> after the American Revolution, the <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> were the most prominent residents of west central <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, growing in numbers and permanency after the <span class="date">1794</span> Treaty of <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. By <span class="date">1817</span>, the <span class="loc">United States</span> had created the Hog Creek Reservation for the local <span class="loc">Shawnee</span>, covering portions of what would become <span class="per">Allen</span> and <span class="per">Auglaize</span> counties, and including part of present-day <span class="loc">Lima</span>. The creation of the <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> reservation freed other lands in the area for settlement, and in <span class="date">February 1820</span>, the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> legislature formally established <span class="loc">Allen County</span>. In <span class="date">1831</span> the <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> were forced to surrender all their land in the area to the <span class="loc">United States</span> and relocated to <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, opening all of <span class="loc">Allen County</span> to settlement. The <span class="loc">Ohio</span> legislature mandated that a county seat be established and "<span class="loc">Lima</span>" was the result.</p><br><br>
