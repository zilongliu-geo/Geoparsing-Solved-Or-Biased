<p>Manhattan is a city in northeastern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, located at the junction of the <span class="loc">Kansas River</span> and <span class="loc">Big Blue River</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Riley County</span>, although it also extends into <span class="loc">Pottawatomie County</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 52,281. The city was founded by settlers from the New England Emigrant Aid Company as a Free-State town in the 1850s, during the Bleeding <span class="loc">Kansas</span> era. Nicknamed "The Little Apple" as a play on New <span class="loc">York City</span>'s "Big Apple", Manhattan is today best known as being the home of Kansas State University and has a distinct college town atmosphere. The town was named an <span class="loc">All-American City</span> in 1952, becoming the first city in <span class="loc">Kansas</span> to win the award. More recently, in 2007 CNN and Money magazine rated Manhattan as one of the ten best places in <span class="loc">America</span> to retire young. And in 2011 <span class="loc">Forbes</span> rated Manhattan No. 1 for "Best Small Communities for a Business and Career." Manhattan Regional Airport (MHK) is the second-busiest commercial airport in <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. Eight miles (13 km) west of the city is Fort Riley, a <span class="loc">United States</span> Army post.</p>
