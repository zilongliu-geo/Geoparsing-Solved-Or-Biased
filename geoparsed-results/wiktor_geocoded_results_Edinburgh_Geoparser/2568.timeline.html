  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Helena is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Texas</span> located approximately 70 mi (110 km) southeast of <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> in <span class="loc">Karnes County</span>. The seat of <span class="loc">Karnes County</span> from <span class="date">1854</span> to <span class="date">1894</span>, Helena was once known as the self-proclaimed "toughest town on earth" in the mid-19th century. It was named for the second wife of <span class="per">Lewis Owings</span>, <span class="per">Helen Marr</span> <span class="loc">Swisher</span> (<span class="date">1831</span>–<span class="date">1910</span>). The town was the birthplace of the so-called "Helena Duel", in which the left hands of two opponents are tied together with buckskin and each fighter is given a knife with a three-inch blade—too short to reach a vital organ or cause a single fatal stab. After the combatants are whirled around a few times, they slash away at each other until one bleeds to death from the accumulation of cuts and stabs. Crowds of spectators would view this gory, gruesome spectacle and even bet on the outcome. Helena is a ghost town allegedly because of the vendetta of <span class="per">Colonel William G. Butler</span> (<span class="date">1831</span>–<span class="date">1912</span>) had against the town he blamed for the death of his son, <span class="per">Emmett Butler</span>, who on <span class="date">December 26, 1884</span>, was killed by a stray bullet from a saloon brawl. <span class="date">A few days later</span>, <span class="per">Colonel Butler</span> went to Helena with group of cowhands and demanded to know who had shot his son and found that none of the townspeople was willing to tell the truth. Enraged, <span class="per">Colonel Butler</span> reportedly shouted: "All right! For that I'll kill the town that killed my son!" Following through on his threat, Butler, a veteran of the American Civil War and a wealthy rancher, arranged for the tracks of the <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> and Aransas Pass Railway to be built 7 mi (11 km) away from Helena. Then, in a bitterly contested election in <span class="date">1894</span> the county seat was moved from Helena to <span class="loc">Karnes City</span>. Helena quickly died.</p><br><br>
