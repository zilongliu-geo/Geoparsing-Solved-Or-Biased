  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sanya</span> (Chinese: 三亚) is the southernmost city on <span class="loc">Hainan Island</span>, and one of the four prefecture-level cities of <span class="loc">Hainan Province</span>, in Southeast <span class="loc">China</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, the population of <span class="loc">Sanya</span> is of 685,408 inhabitants, living in an area of 1,919.58 square kilometres (741.15 sq mi). The city is renowned for its tropical climate and has emerged as a popular tourist destination, also serving as the training site of the Chinese national beach volleyball team. <span class="loc">Sanya</span> is home to small concentrations of Utsul people. Known in ancient times as <span class="loc">Yazhou</span>, postal romanization: Aichow (崖州), literally "cliff state or prefecture", Sanya's history dates to the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BCE). Due to its remoteness from the political centers during the <span class="org">Imperial</span> <span class="loc">China</span> eras on Mainland <span class="loc">China</span>, <span class="loc">Sanya</span> was sometimes called Tianya Haijiao (天涯海角), meaning "the end of the sky and ocean" or "the end of the earth". As a result, the city served as a place of exile for officials who found themselves out of favor with the country's rulers.</p><br><br>
