  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kent</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,507 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The name is that of an early settler family. The town is in the north-central part of the <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>. Many of the lakes are reservoirs for New <span class="loc">York City</span>. <span class="loc">Kent</span> was part of the Philipse Patent of <span class="date">1697</span>, when it was still populated by the Wappinger tribe. <span class="per">Daniel Nimham</span> (<span class="date">1724</span>â€“<span class="date">1778</span>) was the last chief of the Wappingers and was the most prominent Native American of his time in the <span class="loc">Hudson</span> Valley. The town was first settled by Europeans in the mid-18th century by <span class="per">Zachariah Merritt</span> and others, from <span class="loc">New England</span>, <span class="loc">Westchester County</span>, or the <span class="loc">Fishkill</span> area. <span class="per">Elisha Cole</span> and his wife <span class="per">Hannah Smalley</span> built <span class="loc">Coles</span> Mills in <span class="date">1748</span>, having moved to that location <span class="date">the previous year</span> from Cape Cod. <span class="loc">Coles</span> Mill operated until <span class="date">1888</span> when it was submerged under West Branch Reservoir. Around this same time the northeastern part of the county was settled by the <span class="loc">Kent</span>, <span class="loc">Townsend</span>, and <span class="loc">Ludington</span> families, among others. The father of <span class="per">Hannah Smalley</span> and his family moved to <span class="loc">Kent</span> <span class="date">about two years</span> before <span class="per">Elisha Cole</span> and his family.</p><br><br>
