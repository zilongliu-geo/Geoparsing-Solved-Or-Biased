  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Celebrating <span class="per">Frank Buck</span>'s 125th birthday. <span class="per">Frank Buck</span> Zoo is inviting all of its friends, new and old, to join them in celebrating <span class="per">Frank</span> “Bring ‘Em Back Alive” Buck’s birthday on <span class="date">March 17</span>. <span class="per">Frank Howard Buck</span> was born in <span class="loc">Gainesville</span> on <span class="date">March 17, 1884</span>. As a child Buck was fascinated by all kinds of animals and loved to study school geography books filled with exotic names of far-off places, said <span class="per">Frank Buck</span> Zoo Director <span class="per">Susan Kleven</span> in an e-mail sent to the Register. In <span class="date">1911</span>, she added, Buck began his <span class="date">24 year</span> career in the business of collecting animals for exhibit. “At a time when ‘big game hunting’ abroad was a popular pastime of the wealthy, <span class="per">Frank Buck</span> concentrated on capturing and preserving the world’s wildlife,” said <span class="per">Kleven</span>. “Buck abhorred the senseless slaughter of animals. His efforts play a large role in making American’s aware of how important it is to conserve the vast treasure that is our native wildlife. ”“During his career, Buck placed many animals into environments in which they could breed and propagate without the threat of extinction. Thus, <span class="per">Frank Buck</span> was one of the first wildlife conservationist at a time when conservation was a sadly neglected matter.” In honor of Buck’s birthday, zoo admission will be a buck a head ($1) during <span class="date">Tuesday, March 17</span> from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.Visitors will also be able to explore the world’s only <span class="per">Frank Buck</span> Exhibit located in the zoo’s gift shop. Cake will also be available while it lasts. <span class="per">Frank Buck</span> Zoo is located at <span class="date">1000</span> W. California Street.
