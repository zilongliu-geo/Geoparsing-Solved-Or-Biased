<p><span class="loc">Guildford</span> /ˈɡɪlfərd/ is a large town in <span class="loc">Surrey</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, located 27 miles (43 km) southwest of central <span class="loc">London</span> on the A3 trunk road mid-way between the capital and <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>. It is the seat of the <span class="loc">borough of Guildford</span>. <span class="loc">Guildford</span> has Saxon roots and historians attribute its location to the existence of a gap in the <span class="loc">North Downs</span> where the <span class="loc">River Wey</span> was forded by the Harrow Way By AD 978 it was home to an early English Royal Mint. On the building of the <span class="loc">Wey Navigation</span> and <span class="loc">Basingstoke Canal</span> <span class="loc">Guildford</span> was connected to a network of waterways that aided its prosperity. In the 20th century, the University of Surrey and Guildford Cathedral, an Anglican cathedral, were added. Due to recent development running north from <span class="loc">Guildford</span>, and linking to the <span class="loc">Woking</span> area, <span class="loc">Guildford</span> now officially forms the southwestern tip of the Greater London Built-up Area, as defined by the Office for National Statistics. The root of the first part may be the word "gold" rather than Guild, a society or meeting of tradesmen: the only known 10th century (Saxon) record uses Guldeford and in the 11th century Geldeford; both meaning gold and ford. Local historians with an interest in toponyms cite the lack of gold in the region's sedimentary rocks and have suggested that the mention of "gold" may refer to golden flowers found by the ford itself, or the golden sand; several older sources such as Lewis's topological dictionary of 1848 prefer and give an unreferenced assertion there was a guild. There is an old coaching inn on the Epsom Road previously called the "Sanford Arms", which may derive from "Sand Ford", adding weight to the suggestion that the first part of "Guildford" and its many historic predecessors may refer to the very distinctive golden sand showing on the banks of the <span class="loc">River Wey</span> where it cuts through the sandy outcrop just south of the town.</p>
