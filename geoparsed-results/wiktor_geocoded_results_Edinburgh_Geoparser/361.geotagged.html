<p><span class="loc">Kingston</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population at the 2010 census was 6,025. <span class="loc">Kingston</span> was the fifth town to be established in <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. Originally, it was a part of <span class="loc">Hampton</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. After King Philip's War, the establishment of new settlements was made possible by peace treaties with the local Indian tribes and, in 1692, by geographical and jurisdictional agreements between the <span class="loc">provinces of Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. Consequently, certain residents of <span class="loc">Hampton</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> petitioned for a grant of a separate township to be created from the western part of <span class="loc">Hampton</span>. And so, in 1694, King William of <span class="loc">England</span> granted a royal charter establishing the town of "Kingstown", so named in honor of the King. Use of the title rather than the King's name was common at the time. The original charter still exists to this day. The <span class="loc">Kingston</span> historic district encompasses the town center of <span class="loc">Kingston</span>. Historic buildings and sites within the district include the <span class="loc">Kingston</span> town hall; the Josiah Bartlett House, home of the second signer of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Declaration of Independence; the First Universalist Church; the Sanborn Seminary; the Nichols Memorial Research Library; the Kingston Historical Museum (housed in the town's first fire house); The 1686 House restaurant; the Masonic building; the Cemetery at the Plains (where Josiah Bartlett is buried); the Church on the Plains, and the Grace Daley House and barn, home to the town's first church owned parsonage (1835).</p>
