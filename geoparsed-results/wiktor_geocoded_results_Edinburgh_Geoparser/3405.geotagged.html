<p><span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> is an historic entertainment center and present day <span class="loc">district of Tijuana</span>, <span class="loc">Baja California</span>, at the southeastern end of the <span class="loc">Centro borough</span>. The <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Tourist Complex formed in the late 1920s along <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Boulevard when a road was built that led from the historic Rio Zone to a natural hot springs two miles up the Tijuana River Valley. Paramount icons of <span class="loc">Tijuana</span> developed in <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> such as the <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Casino and Hotel and the <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Racetrack. Today <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> is one of Tijuana's paramount tourist centers and the location of some of the city's most affluent neighborhoods. The hot springs around which the <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Tourist Complex grew was a well known location and prior to major development, was the site of small hotels and cabins. With the development of the casino and resort in 1928, <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> developed as a premier tourist attraction that drew the likes of Charles Chaplin, Rita Hayworth, and Laurel and Hardy. The resort was designed in a Mexican and Californian colonial style, fitted with gardens, its own airstrip, bungalows, minarets, baths, and the casino and hotel itself. The Agua Caliente Club was a golf course adjacent to the city that later became the Tijuana Country Club. In 1930 the golf course had its first PGA Tour event at the <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Open, won by Gene Sarazen.</p>
