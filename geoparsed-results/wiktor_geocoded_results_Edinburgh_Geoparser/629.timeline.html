  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Belmont</span> is a semi-ghost town in <span class="loc">Dawes County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, about 11 miles (18 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Crawford</span>. Originally known as Evergreen City, the settlement was existent by <span class="date">summer 1889</span>, thanks to the construction of the Belmont Tunnel. However, when the town site was surveyed in <span class="date">1890</span>, only five blocks were sold. <span class="loc">Belmont</span> reached its population peak of around eighty residents in <span class="date">the late 1920s</span>. The trend of decline population started with the Great Depression and accelerated with changes in transportation. Improved vehicles meant that shopping and selling of farm products could be done in larger towns nearby, and the <span class="per">Burlington</span> Railroad ceased passenger service in <span class="date">1969</span>. Shortly after the founding of <span class="loc">Dawes County</span> in <span class="date">1885</span>, two townships in its southwestern portion were designated the Evergreen Precinct. The <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="per">Burlington</span> and <span class="per">Quincy</span> Railroad built a rail line through the precinct in 1888-1889, and decided the deep canyons of the area made a tunnel necessary. A construction camp was soon erected near the tunnel site, and by the time the railroad reached the temporary community, <span class="date">now</span> known as Evergreen City, around two hundred men were employed working on the tunnel.</p><br><br>
