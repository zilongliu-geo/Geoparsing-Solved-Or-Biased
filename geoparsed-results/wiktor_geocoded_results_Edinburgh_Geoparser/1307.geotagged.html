<p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 54,876. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Abingdon</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is part of the Kingsport–Bristol–Bristol, <span class="loc">TN-VA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area, commonly known as the "Tri-Cities" region. For thousands of years, indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area. At the time of European encounter, the Chiska had a chief village near what is now <span class="loc">Saltville</span>, destroyed by the Spaniards in 1568. The <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> annexed the region from the Xualae around 1671, and ceded it to the <span class="loc">Virginia Colony</span> in 1770 at the Treaty of <span class="loc">Lochaber</span>. The county was formed by Virginians in 1776 from <span class="loc">Fincastle County</span>. It was named for <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, who was then commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is among the first geographical regions to be named after the president of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was raided by the Chickamauga <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> during the Cherokee–American wars. In July, 1776, Chief Dragging Canoe led an attack on Black's Fort (renamed <span class="loc">Abingdon</span> in 1778). The area remained prone to attack until after Chickamauga leader Bob Benge was finally slain by settlers in <span class="loc">Washington County</span> in 1794.</p>
