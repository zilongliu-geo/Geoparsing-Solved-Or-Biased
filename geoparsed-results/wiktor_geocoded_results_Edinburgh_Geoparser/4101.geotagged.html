<p>Delta is a district municipality in British Columbia, and forms part of Greater Vancouver. Located south of <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, it is bordered by the <span class="loc">Fraser River</span> to the north, the <span class="loc">United States</span> (<span class="loc">Point Roberts</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>) to the south and the <span class="loc">city of Surrey</span> to the east. Delta is composed of three distinct communities: <span class="loc">Ladner</span>, <span class="loc">Tsawwassen</span>, and <span class="loc">North Delta</span>. Prior to European settlement, Delta's flatlands and coastal shores were inhabited by the <span class="loc">Tsawwassen</span> indigenous peoples, of the Coast Salish First Nations. The land was first sighted by Europeans in 1791, when Spanish explorer Lieutenant Francisco de Eliza mistook the area for an island and named it "Isla Capeda". The first European settler in Delta was James Kennedy who pre-empted 135 acres in what later became <span class="loc">Annieville</span> in February 1860. Thomas and William <span class="loc">Ladner</span>, began farming the area named after them in 1868. Farming and fishing helped the community grow quickly over the next few decades. In 1879, the area was incorporated to become "Delta", and the village of <span class="loc">Ladner</span> was made as its administrative centre.</p>
