  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Oneida County</span> is a county located in the state of <span class="loc">New York</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 234,878. The county seat is <span class="loc">Utica</span>. The name is in honor of the <span class="loc">Oneida</span>, an Iroquoian tribe that had this territory at the time of European encounter and has a reservation in the region. <span class="loc">Oneida County</span> is part of the Utica-Rome, <span class="loc">NY Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. When colonial counties were established by <span class="loc">England</span> in <span class="loc">New York</span> State in <span class="date">1683</span>, the territory of present <span class="loc">Oneida County</span> was included in a very large, mostly undeveloped <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of <span class="loc">New York</span> State as well as all of the present state of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> and, in theory, extending westward to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. This county was reduced in size on <span class="date">July 3, 1766</span> by the creation of <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, and further on <span class="date">March 16, 1770</span> by the creation of <span class="loc">Gloucester County</span>, both containing territory <span class="date">now</span> in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. On <span class="date">March 12, 1772</span>, what was left of <span class="loc">Albany County</span> was split into three parts, one remaining under the name <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. One of the other sections, <span class="loc">Tryon County</span>, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of <span class="loc">Tryon County</span> was approximately five miles west of the present <span class="loc">city of Schenectady</span>, and the county included the western part of the <span class="loc">Adirondack Mountains</span> and the area west of the <span class="loc">West Branch of the Delaware River</span>. The area then designated as <span class="loc">Tryon County</span> included what are <span class="date">now</span> 37 individual <span class="loc">counties of New York State</span>. The county was named for <span class="per">William Tryon</span>, colonial governor of <span class="loc">New York</span>.</p><br><br>
