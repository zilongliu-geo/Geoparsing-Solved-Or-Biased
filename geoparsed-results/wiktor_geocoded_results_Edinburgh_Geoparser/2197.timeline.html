  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Suba</span> (Arabic: صوبا‎) was a Palestinian Arab village west of <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> that was depopulated and destroyed in <span class="date">1948</span>. The site of the village lies on the summit of a conical hill called Tel Tzova (Hebrew: תל צובה‎), or <span class="loc">Jabal Suba</span>, rising 769 metres above sea level, and it was built on the ruins of a <span class="org">Crusader</span> castle. It has been suggested that <span class="loc">Suba</span> was Subahiet, one of 21 villages given by <span class="per">King Godfrey</span> as a fief to <span class="org">the Church of the Holy</span> Sepulchre. In <span class="date">1114</span>, the gift was re-confirmed by Baldwin I of <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>. A "<span class="per">Brother William</span> of <span class="loc">Belmont</span>" was mentioned in <span class="org">Crusader</span> sources in the <span class="date">years</span> <span class="date">1157</span> and <span class="date">1162</span>, he might have been castellan at <span class="loc">Belmont</span>. Sometime before <span class="date">1169</span>, the Crusaders built a castle there called <span class="loc">Belmont</span>, run by the Hospitallers. In <span class="date">1170</span> an unnamed castellan was mentioned. <span class="date">Today</span>, parts of the northern and western <span class="org">Crusader</span> wall remain, as well as ruins of a tower and other structures. These include large underground cisterns, some pre-dating the <span class="org">Crusader</span> period. <span class="loc">Belmont Castle</span> was taken by <span class="loc">Saladin</span> in <span class="date">1187</span>. According to the chronicles it was destroyed by him in <span class="date">1191</span> but no trace of the destruction was located during the archaeological investigation.</p><br><br>
