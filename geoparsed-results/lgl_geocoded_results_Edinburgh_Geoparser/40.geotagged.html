<p>80-year-old killed in <span class="loc">Arlington</span> by neighbor backing up. An 80-year-old woman was killed this morning in <span class="loc">Arlington</span> when a neighbor accidentally hit her while backing out of a driveway. The woman was walking the 3800 block of <span class="loc">Silkwood Trail</span> in <span class="loc">South Arlington</span> about 7 a.m. when the collission occured, said Tiara Ellis, an Arlington spokeswoman. She was struck by an SUV driven by a female neighbor. The driver was leaving to take her 15-year-old son to school, Ellis said, when she felt resistance while backing out of the driveway. After pulling the car forward, she saw the 80-year-old. The son called 911. Ellis said the driver told police that while she'd seen the elderly woman walking in the neighborhood before, she didn't see her when she started backing out of the driveway today. Poor visibility related to the rain may have been a factor, police said. Police are still investigating, but no criminal charges are expected. “It looks like it was just an unfortunate accident,” Ellis said.</p>
