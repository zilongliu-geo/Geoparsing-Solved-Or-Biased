<p><span class="loc">Jura</span> (/ˈdʒʊərə/ JOOR-ə; Scottish Gaelic: Diùra [ˈtʲuːɾə]) is an island in the <span class="loc">Inner Hebrides</span> of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, adjacent and to the north-east of <span class="loc">Islay</span>. Compared with its fertile and more populous neighbour, <span class="loc">Jura</span> is mountainous, bare and infertile, covered largely by vast areas of blanket bog, hence its small population. In a list of the islands of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> ranked by size, <span class="loc">Jura</span> comes eighth, whereas ranked by population it comes thirty-first. It is in the council area of <span class="loc">Argyll</span> and <span class="loc">Bute</span>. Evidence of settlements on <span class="loc">Jura</span> dating from the Mesolithic period was first uncovered by the English archaeologist John Mercer in the 1960s. There is evidence of Neolithic settlement at <span class="loc">Poll a' Cheo</span> in the southwest of the island. The modern name "Jura" dates from the Norse-Gael era and is from the Old Norse Dyrøy meaning "beast [wild animal] island". In the sixth century, it is believed that <span class="loc">Jura</span> may have been the location of Hinba, the island to which the Irish founder of the Christian Church in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> Saint Columba retreated for prayer and contemplation from the monastic community which he founded on <span class="loc">Iona</span>.</p>
