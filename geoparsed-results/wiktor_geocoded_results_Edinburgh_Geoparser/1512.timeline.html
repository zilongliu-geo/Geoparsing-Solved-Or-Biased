  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Easton is a town in <span class="loc">Bristol County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 23,112 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the Greater Boston area, but is also part of the 6-county definition of the Providence MSA. Easton is governed by an elected committee of selectmen and a town administrator. Easton was first settled in <span class="date">1694</span> and was officially incorporated in <span class="date">1725</span>. In <span class="date">1694</span>, the first settler, <span class="per">Clement Briggs</span>, established his home near the <span class="loc">Easton Green</span>. In <span class="date">1711</span>, the Taunton North Purchase area became <span class="loc">Norton</span>, and in <span class="date">1713</span>, the sixty-nine families settled in Easton and hired Elder <span class="per">William Pratt</span> as their first minister. Prior to the settlers' establishment, the area was occupied by Native Americans as a hunting area and a burial ground. During <span class="per">King Philip</span>'s War, Metacom, also known as <span class="per">King Philip</span>, used part of Easton as a headquarters for his troops. There was no legal parish in Easton until <span class="date">1722</span>, when the East Precinct of <span class="loc">Norton</span> was recognized. In <span class="date">1725</span>, the area was incorporated as the Town of Easton; it was so named because it was formerly called the "<span class="loc">East End</span>" of the Taunton North Purchase and was shortened by pronunciation to Easton. During the Revolutionary War, General <span class="loc">George Washington</span> stayed at the <span class="per">Benjamin Williams</span> Tavern on Bay Road, which is <span class="date">now</span> the second oldest existing house in Easton, while on his way to negotiate for cannonballs at the old Perry Foundry in <span class="loc">Taunton</span>.</p><br><br>
