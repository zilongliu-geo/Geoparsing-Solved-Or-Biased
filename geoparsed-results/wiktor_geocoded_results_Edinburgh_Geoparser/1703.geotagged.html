<p><span class="loc">Marlborough</span> (often spelled <span class="loc">Marlboro</span>) is a city in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 38,499 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> became a prosperous industrial town in the 19th century and made the transition to high technology industry in the late 20th century after the construction of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Turnpike. <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> was declared a town in 1660. It was incorporated as a city in 1890 when it changed its Municipal charter from a <span class="loc">New England</span> town meeting system to a Mayorâ€“council government. Christopher Allen was recorded as marshal of <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> in 1638 and married to Mary Wetherbee. John Howe, Jr. in 1656 was a fur trader and built a house at the intersection of two Indian trails, <span class="loc">Nashua Trail</span> and <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> path. He could speak the language of the Algonquian Indians though the local tribe referred to themselves as the Pennacooks. The settlers were welcomed by the Indians because they protected them from other tribes they were at war with. In the 1650s, several families left the nearby town of <span class="loc">Sudbury</span>, 18 miles west of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, to start a new town. The village was named after <span class="loc">Marlborough</span>, the market town in <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It was first settled in 1657 by 14 men led by Edmund Rice, John Ruddock and John Howe; in 1656 Rice and his colleagues petitioned the Massachusetts General Court to create the town of <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> and it was officially incorporated in 1660. Rice was elected a selectman at <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> in 1657. Sumner Chilton Powell wrote, in Puritan Village: The Formation of a New <span class="loc">England</span> Town, "Not only did Rice become the largest individual landholder in <span class="loc">Sudbury</span>, but he represented his new town in the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> legislature for five years and devoted at least eleven of his last fifteen years to serving as selectman and judge of small causes."</p>
