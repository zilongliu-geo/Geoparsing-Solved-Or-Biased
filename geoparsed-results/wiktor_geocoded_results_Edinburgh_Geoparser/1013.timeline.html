  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Somerset</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Bristol County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 18,165 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the birthplace and hometown of <span class="per">Clifford Milburn Holland</span> (<span class="date">1883</span>â€“<span class="date">1924</span>), the chief engineer and namesake of the <span class="per">Holland</span> Tunnel in New <span class="loc">York City</span>. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1677</span> on the Shawomet lands, and was officially incorporated in <span class="date">1790</span>. It was named for <span class="loc">Somerset Square</span> in <span class="loc">Boston</span>, which was, in turn, named for the <span class="loc">county of Somerset</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. It was once a vital shipping point, and after the War of <span class="date">1812</span> it was one of <span class="loc">America</span>'s chief distribution points. In <span class="date">1872</span>, it became the site of a major coal port, and in the early 20th century a large cannery existed in the town. However, as neighboring <span class="loc">Fall River</span>'s industry grew, it absorbed much of Somerset's, and the town took on more of a suburban character. In fact, the town's population grew during the Great Depression, as many people from <span class="loc">Fall River</span> and other localities moved to the suburb. <span class="date">Today</span>, the town's major industry (other than suburban services) is power generation, with the <span class="org">Montaup Electric Company</span> plant upriver (founded in <span class="date">1923</span>) and the <span class="loc">Brayton Point</span> Power Plant at the town's southern tip (founded in <span class="date">1963</span>). <span class="loc">Brayton Point</span> has been the target of much criticism for its pollution problems.</p><br><br>
