<p>See <span class="loc">Hampton</span> Township, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> for the municipality in <span class="loc">Sussex County</span> <span class="loc">Hampton</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 1,401, reflecting a decline of 145 (-9.4%) from the 1,546 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 31 (+2.0%) from the 1,515 counted in the 1990 Census. What is now <span class="loc">Hampton</span> was originally incorporated by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature as Junction Borough on February 20, 1895, from portions of both <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> Township and Bethlehem Township, based on the results of a referendum held on the previous day. By a resolution of the borough council, the name was changed to <span class="loc">Hampton</span> as of February 11, 1909. In 1931, additional territory was annexed from both <span class="loc">Glen Gardner</span> borough and Bethlehem Township. Located on the banks of the <span class="loc">Musconetcong River</span>, <span class="loc">Hampton</span> has changed little since it was first settled in 1800. In 1880, the town consisted of a store, hotel, cabinet manufacturer, blacksmith, wheelwright shop, grist mill, school house and about 25 dwellings. <span class="loc">Hampton</span> was once known as "Junction" because the Central Railroad of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> and the <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, Lackawanna and Western Railroad crossed through here.</p>
