<p>City Council talks money. Sales tax revenue is down, but officials say budget is still ‘in line’ The <span class="loc">Athens City</span> Council was given a budget update on Wednesday morning. “It is no surprise sales tax was down,” Director of Finance David Hopkins said at the special session. Hopkins said sales tax revenues were down 6.86 percent from last year. He said revenues are down 5 percent overall from last year. Hopkins said the city has saved money in other areas to help balance the budget. It saved $15,000 to $20,000 on its health insurance premiums, lower gas prices and attrition, according to Hopkins. “Everything else is pretty much in line,” he said. “The one bright spot is the hotel/motel tax.” The occupancy tax revenues have increased about $10,000 over last year. He said the revenues have been trending downward over the last two months. Hopkins said the city has about $400,000 in reserves if needed. The council also discussed:â ¢ canceling the May 9 <span class="loc">City of Athens</span> general elections. City Administrator Pam Burton said only Mayor Randy Daniel and Councilmember Place 1 Jerry Don Vaught filed for the two available seats. Since the law allowing entities without a contested race to cancel elections went into effect in 1996, <span class="loc">Athens</span> has had few contested municipal races. Elections were canceled in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007 and 2008. â ¢ authorizing a contract with Brinkley Sargent Architects for a facility needs study. The council voted on Jan. 13 to put the matter on hold for 60 days. Burton said at the time the council should wait to see what the economic conditions would be before committing to spending the $39,500. “As you can tell there has not been any positive change,” Burton said. Athens Mayor Randy Daniel said caution is advised at this time of the budget year.</p>
