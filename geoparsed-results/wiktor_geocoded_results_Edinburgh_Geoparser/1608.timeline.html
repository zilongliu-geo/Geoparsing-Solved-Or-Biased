  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newport</span> (/ˈnjuːpɔːt/; Welsh: <span class="loc">Casnewydd</span>) is a cathedral and university city and unitary authority area in south east <span class="loc">Wales</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">River Usk</span> close to its confluence with the Severn estuary, approximately 12 miles (19 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Cardiff</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census it is the third largest city in <span class="loc">Wales</span>, with a city population of 145,700 and an urban population of 306,844. The city forms part of the <span class="loc">Cardiff-Newport metropolitan</span> area with a population of 1,097,000. <span class="loc">Newport</span> has been a port since medieval times, when a castle was built by the <span class="loc">Normans</span>. The town outgrew the earlier Roman town of <span class="loc">Caerleon</span>, immediately upstream, and gained its first charter in <span class="date">1314</span>. It grew significantly in the 19th century, when its port became the focus of coal exports from the eastern valleys of <span class="loc">South Wales</span>. Until the rise of <span class="loc">Cardiff</span> from the 1850s, <span class="loc">Newport</span> was <span class="loc">Wales</span>' largest coal-exporting port. It was the site of the last large-scale armed insurrection in <span class="loc">Britain</span>, the <span class="loc">Newport</span> Rising of <span class="date">1839</span> led by the Chartists. During the 20th century, when the docks declined in importance, <span class="loc">Newport</span> remained an important manufacturing and engineering centre. It was granted city status in <span class="date">2002</span>. <span class="loc">Newport</span> hosted the Ryder Cup in <span class="date">2010</span>. The city was the venue of the <span class="date">2014</span> <span class="org">NATO</span> summit.</p><br><br>
