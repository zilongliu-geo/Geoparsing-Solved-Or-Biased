  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>County lifts burn ban. The <span class="org">Henderson County Commissioners Court</span> lifted the five-week-old burn ban <span class="date">Tuesday</span>. With the threat of wildfires greatly reduced by heavy rains, commissioners unanimously voted for an end to the ban. County Fire Marshal <span class="per">John Holcomb</span> presented the commissioners with the latest information from the Texas Forest Service, showing the county in the blue category on the Keetch-Byrum Drought Index indicating ample moisture in the soil. According to Athens Review rainfall records, about seven inches fell <span class="date">last week</span>. “I make a motion to lift the burn ban immediately,” Precinct 3 Commissioner <span class="per">Ronny Lawrence</span> said. County <span class="per">Judge David Holstein</span> noted that the ban, which had been in effect since <span class="date">February 11</span>, was lifted as of 9:45 a.m.In other action, commissioners voted 3-2 to deny a request from <span class="per">Pct</span>. 4 Constable Rick Stewart for a larger patrol vehicle, but left the door open to discuss the issue during budget talks beginning in <span class="date">June</span>. <span class="per">Stewart</span> told commissioners in <span class="date">January</span> that he had difficulty exiting his <span class="org">Chevrolet</span> Impala patrol car during an incident in <span class="loc">Frankston</span> in which he fatally shot 29-year-old <span class="per">Jason Jermaine Cumby</span> of <span class="loc">Athens</span>. He asked for a larger car or a <span class="org">Chevrolet</span> S-10 pick-up. <span class="per">Pct</span>. 4 Commissioner <span class="per">Jerry West</span> made the motion to approve Stewart’s request. “I felt that it needed to be addressed because of the situation in <span class="loc">Frankston</span>,” <span class="per">West</span> said. <span class="per">Pct</span>. 1 Commissioner <span class="per">Joe Hall</span> seconded West’s motion. “Big guys do have a major problem when they get in and out of some of these cars,” <span class="per">Hall</span> said. “Some of these vehicles they drive, I couldn’t drive them.” <span class="per">Pct</span>. 2 Commissioner Wade McKinney objected to make the change so close to the beginning of work on the <span class="date">2010</span> budget. “I know we’re asking a great deal of them by not doing it, but I’m looking to the coming budget year,” <span class="loc">McKinney</span> said. <span class="per">West</span> said Stewart and others had asked for larger vehicles in past budget sessions without success. West and Hall voted in favor of allowing Stewart to get a new vehicle. <span class="loc">McKinney</span>, <span class="per">Holstein</span> and <span class="per">Pct</span>. 3 Commissioner <span class="per">Ronny Lawrence</span> were opposed. On other agenda items, commissioners approved: a contract to be presented by the <span class="loc">Henderson County</span> Sheriff’s Department to other counties for the purposes of housing out-of-county inmates in the <span class="loc">Henderson County</span> Jail; a contract with Marex group for software to be used for digitizing court records dating from <span class="date">1950</span>; a contract with Diminsion Imaging to scan the records; a <span class="date">2008</span> bill from <span class="loc">Templeton</span> Construction for work on the jail in the amount of $34,070.05 (the vote was 4-1 with <span class="loc">McKinney</span> opposed); and bills from <span class="date">2009</span> in the amount of $564,740.07.</p><br><br>
