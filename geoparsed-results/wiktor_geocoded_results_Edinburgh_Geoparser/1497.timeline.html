  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tambo</span> is a town located in Central <span class="loc">West Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, on the banks of the <span class="loc">Barcoo River</span>. <span class="loc">Tambo</span> is 101 kilometres (63 mi) southeast of the town of <span class="loc">Blackall</span> via the Landsborough Highway, and approximately 862 kilometres (536 mi) north west of the state capital, <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>. At the <span class="date">2006</span> census, <span class="loc">Tambo</span> had a population of 345. The town was settled in <span class="date">1863</span>, making it the oldest town in western <span class="loc">Queensland</span>. Like much of the west, sheep became the mainstay of the economy. The town takes its name from an Indigenous Australian word, meaning "hidden place", or, "resting place, fish, shady waters, hidden waters, a secluded spot, hidden place and native yam." <span class="date">Today</span>, cattle and tourism are of major importance to the town. A number of heritage buildings survive from the earliest <span class="date">days</span> of settlement. The Carnarvon National Park (<span class="per">Salvator Rosa</span> section) lies to the east of the town. The area on which the town of <span class="loc">Tambo</span> <span class="date">now</span> sits was home of many different Aboriginal groups including the Wadjaling, Wadjalad, Wadjabangai, and Pitjara.</p><br><br>
