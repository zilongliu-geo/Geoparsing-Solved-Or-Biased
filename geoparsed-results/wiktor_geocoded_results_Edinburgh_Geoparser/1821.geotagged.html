<p><span class="loc">Amherst</span> (/ˈæmərst/) is a town in <span class="loc">Hampshire County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> in the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> valley. As of the 2010 census, the population was 37,819, making it the largest community in <span class="loc">Hampshire County</span> (although the county seat is <span class="loc">Northampton</span>). The town is home to Amherst College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, three of the Five Colleges. The name of the town is pronounced without the h ("AM-erst"), giving rise to the local saying, "only the 'h' is silent", in reference both to the pronunciation and to the town's politically active populace.

The earliest known document of the lands now comprising <span class="loc">Amherst</span> is the deed of purchase dated December 1658 between John Pynchon of <span class="loc">Springfield</span> and three native inhabitants, referred to as Umpanchla, Quonquont, and Chickwalopp. According to the deed, "ye Indians of Nolwotogg (Norwottuck) upon ye River of Quinecticott (Connecticut)" sold the entire area in exchange for "two Hundred fatham of Wampam &amp; Twenty fatham, and one large <span class="loc">Coate</span> at Eight fatham wch Chickwollop set of, of trusts, besides severall small giftes"  [sic]. <span class="loc">Amherst</span> celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2009.
