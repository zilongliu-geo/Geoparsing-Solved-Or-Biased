  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Linton</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Palmerston North</span>, situated 11km south-west of the city. It is home to the <span class="per">Linton</span> Military Camp, which is the largest army camp in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. It was built in <span class="date">1945</span> 3.5 kilometres to the north-east of <span class="loc">Palmerston North</span>. It became the country’s second largest base in <span class="date">1985</span> when the permanent force at <span class="loc">Singapore</span> was relocated there. More units have transferred from <span class="per">Auckland</span> and <span class="per">Waioru</span> <span class="per">Manawatu</span> Prison is in <span class="per">Linton</span>. <span class="per">Linton</span> is home to: <span class="per">Linton</span> Camp School, a full primary school (catering to <span class="date">years</span> 0-8). <span class="loc">Linton</span> Camp school has a roll of approximately 190 students. <span class="org">Linton Country School</span>, a primary school (catering to <span class="date">years</span> 0-6) The school was established in <span class="date">1889</span> making it the oldest school in the area. <span class="org">Linton Community Library</span> caters to <span class="org">NZ Defence Force</span> personnel and civilian staff, the local community and school. The population count in <span class="date">2001</span> was 1,512. In the <span class="date">2013</span> census <span class="per">Linton</span> has shed 24.7 per cent of its population, or 441 people. [1] <span class="per">Linton</span> is named for <span class="per">James Linton</span>, an early settler in the area and also twice Mayor of <span class="loc">Palmerston North</span>. <span class="loc">Scotsman</span> <span class="per">James Linton</span> was one of the first European settlers in <span class="loc">Palmerston</span>. He and his wife <span class="per">Sarah</span> arrived on horseback from Wairarapa <span class="date">early in 1871</span>. <span class="per">Linton</span> served as mayor of <span class="loc">Palmerston North</span> 1879-82 and 1884-5, and was a director and ardent promoter of the <span class="per">Wellington</span> and <span class="per">Manawatu</span> Railway Company. <span class="date">Today</span> <span class="per">Linton</span> is best known for the army camp. But the site first planned as <span class="per">Linton</span> township is several kilometres away from there. Only the school and a few houses <span class="date">now</span> provide clues to where the <span class="per">Wellington</span> and <span class="per">Manawatu</span> Railway Company decided that the next stop on their <span class="per">Wellington</span> ‒ <span class="loc">Longburn</span> railway line would be. Along with several other directors of this private company, <span class="per">James Linton</span> was honoured by having a railway station settlement on the line named after him. The line, opened in <span class="date">1886</span>, was a successful venture, but the <span class="per">Linton</span> township did not develop. The site of the <span class="per">Linton</span> Military Camp was bought by the <span class="loc">New</span> <span class="loc">Zealand</span> Government in <span class="date">October 1941</span>. Tents for the 2 Field Regiment formed the first accommodation on this site in <span class="date">February 1942</span>, but within <span class="date">six months</span> the first prefabricated huts were being built. The first housing blocks for officers were constructed in <span class="date">1955</span>. It was in <span class="date">1985</span> that <span class="per">Linton</span> Military Camp became <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>’s largest, when the permanent force then stationed in <span class="loc">Singapore</span> was withdrawn and accommodated at <span class="per">Linton</span>. It has grown even bigger since then with the transfer of frontline units from <span class="loc">Auckland</span> and <span class="loc">Waiouru</span> The site purchased for <span class="per">Linton</span> Military Camp included an area by the <span class="loc">Manawatu River</span> which had been a <span class="per">major Rangitane Maori</span> village known as Te Kairanga (the place where much food is gathered) but by <span class="date">the 1940s</span> the name was in common use for the district on the other side of the river. Instead the camp took the name of <span class="per">Linton</span></p><br><br>
