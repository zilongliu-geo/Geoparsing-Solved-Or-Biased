<p>Mosquitoes in <span class="loc">East Providence</span> and <span class="loc">Barrington</span> have tested positive for <span class="loc">West Nile</span> virus, according to <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> state environmental officials. “..tests are an important reminder that people should protect themselves against mosquito bites by using bug repellant and window screens and getting rid of standing water, where mosquitoes breed, says Alan Gettman of the Department of Environmental Management.” These are the first cases of <span class="loc">West Nile</span> virus reported in <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> this year. There have, however, been two cases reported in neighboring <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>.</p>
