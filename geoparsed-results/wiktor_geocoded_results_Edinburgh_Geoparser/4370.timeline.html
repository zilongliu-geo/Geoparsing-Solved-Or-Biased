  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Lode is a small village in <span class="loc">East Cambridgeshire</span> on the southern edge of The Fens. It lies just north of the B1102 between Quy and <span class="loc">Swaffham Bulbeck</span>, 8 miles (13 km) to the north east of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>. The village's name is derived from its location at the southern end of <span class="loc">Bottisham Lode</span> that links it to the <span class="loc">River Cam</span>. A lode is an artificial water channel used to drain the Fens, thought to be of Roman origin. Lode also has the smaller hamlet settlement of <span class="loc">Long Meadow</span> as part of the parish to the east along the B1102. Lode is a comparatively new civil parish, having been separated from <span class="loc">Bottisham</span> in <span class="date">1894</span>. Lode is the location of <span class="loc">Anglesey Abbey</span>, which was formerly the home of the <span class="per">Fairhaven</span> family, who lived there for <span class="date">many years</span>, but is <span class="date">now</span> the property of the National Trust. The 1st <span class="per">Lord Fairhaven</span> was responsible for the unique gardens in the grounds of the former 12th-century abbey. Also part of the estate is Lode Mill, a restored watermill that is open to the public. In the 19th century, <span class="loc">Anglesey Abbey</span> was owned and occupied by <span class="per">Reverend Hailstone</span> who was also vicar of <span class="loc">Bottisham</span>. Convinced that Lode merited its own church, he built the present church of <span class="loc">St James</span>, which was dedicated in <span class="date">1853</span>. The <span class="per">Hailstone</span> family provided a vicar for <span class="date">the following 80 years</span>.</p><br><br>
