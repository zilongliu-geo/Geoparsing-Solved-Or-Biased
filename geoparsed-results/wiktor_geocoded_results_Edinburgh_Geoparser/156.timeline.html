  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Vicente</span> is a municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Palawan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 30,919 people. <span class="loc">San Vicente</span> is located in the north-western side of the main island of <span class="loc">Palawan</span> and is 186 kilometres (116 mi) from <span class="loc">Puerto Princesa City</span>. It occupies a total land area of 146,294 hectares (361,500 acres). <span class="loc">San Vicente</span>'s 14.2 kilometres (8.8 mi) of beachfront is being converted into an emerging tourist destination that will be the beneficiary of government spending on infrastructure. In <span class="date">1952</span>, migrants from <span class="loc">Manamoc</span>, an island of the Cuyo Archipelago, arrived in a place called Malagnang ( muddy/ maputik) a sitio of Kemdeng, formerly part of <span class="loc">Puerto Princesa City</span>. The first to arrive were the Dandal brothers (<span class="loc">Anastacio</span>, <span class="loc">Ricardo</span>, and <span class="loc">Lauro</span>), <span class="per">Alberto Radam</span>, and Marcelino Gadiano with their families. After sometime their relatives followed forming a small community which gave rise to the election of Anastascio Dandal as the first Barrio Lieutenant. The small ethnic group of <span class="per">Agutayno</span> and <span class="per">Cuyuno</span> increased in number and with the increase disputes emerged particularly in the choice of the Townâ€™s Patron Saint. The <span class="per">Cuyuno</span> wanted <span class="loc">Saint Vincent Ferrer</span> while the choice of <span class="per">Agutayno</span> was Saint <span class="loc">Isidro</span> <span class="loc">Labrador</span>. The group decided to resolve the issue by drawing a lot. The name of <span class="loc">Saint Vincent Ferrer</span> was drawn thus the name Malagnang was changed to <span class="loc">San Vicente</span>.</p><br><br>
