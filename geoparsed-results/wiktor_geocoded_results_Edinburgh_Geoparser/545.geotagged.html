<p><span class="loc">Hastings</span> is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Adams County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 24,907 at the 2010 census. It is known as the town where Kool-Aid was invented by Edwin Perkins in 1927, and celebrates that event with the Kool-Aid Days festival every August. <span class="loc">Hastings</span> is also known for Fisher Fountain, and during World War II operated the largest Naval Ammunition Depot in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Hastings</span> was founded in 1872 at the intersection of the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and <span class="loc">Missouri River Railroad</span> and the St. Joseph and Denver City Railroad. It was named for Colonel D. T. <span class="loc">Hastings</span> of the St. Joseph and Grand Island Railroad, who was instrumental in building the railroad through <span class="loc">Adams County</span>. The area was previously open plain: the Donner party passed through on its way to <span class="loc">California</span> in 1846 and a pioneer cemetery marker in <span class="loc">Hastings</span> bears an inscription taken from <span class="loc">Tamsen</span> Donner's journal: "The country between the Blue and the <span class="loc">Platte</span> is beautiful beyond compare. Never have I seen so varied a country so suitable to cultivation." In the 1870s, railroads lured European immigrants to the new state of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> with advertisements. <span class="loc">Hastings</span>' first settlers were English, from <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>, and were quickly joined by other English, Irish, <span class="loc">Germans</span>, <span class="loc">Danes</span>, and <span class="loc">Germans</span> from <span class="loc">Russia</span>.</p>
