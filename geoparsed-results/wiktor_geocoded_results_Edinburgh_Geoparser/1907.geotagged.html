<p><span class="loc">Lakewood</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Nashville</span>, <span class="loc">Davidson County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The population was 2,302 at the 2010 census, at which time it was an incorporated city. Originally incorporated as <span class="loc">Dupontonia</span> in 1959 (in reference to the DuPont rayon manufacturing facility located nearby), the city changed its name to <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> and reincorporated in 1961. In 1963, the governments of <span class="loc">Davidson County</span> and the <span class="loc">City of Nashville</span> merged to form a consolidated metropolitan government. <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> chose to remain autonomous, retaining its charter as a "satellite city". It operated its own city council and funded its own police department. On August 5, 2010, voters within the city passed a referendum to dissolve the municipal charter and become part of the General Services District of the Metropolitan Government of <span class="loc">Nashville</span> and <span class="loc">Davidson County</span>. The dissolution passed by one vote: 400 to 399. The <span class="loc">city of Lakewood</span> filed a lawsuit alleging voter fraud in the referendum, including thirteen people voting illegally and others not being allowed to vote because of irregularities. Several leaders of the group "Citizens to Reform Lakewood" were named in the lawsuit. A <span class="loc">Davidson County</span> Chancery Court Judge settled the litigation by ordering a new election be held March 15, 2011, on which date residents in <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> voted 458 to 447 to surrender their charter and merge services with Metro <span class="loc">Nashville</span>.</p>
