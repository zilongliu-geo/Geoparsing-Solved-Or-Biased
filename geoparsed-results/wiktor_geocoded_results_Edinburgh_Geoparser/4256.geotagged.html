<p><span class="loc">Jinan</span> is the capital of <span class="loc">Shandong province</span> in Eastern <span class="loc">China</span>. The area of present-day <span class="loc">Jinan</span> has played an important role in the history of the region from the earliest beginnings of civilization and has evolved into a major national administrative, economic, and transportation hub. The city has held sub-provincial administrative status since 1994. <span class="loc">Jinan</span> is often referred to as the "<span class="loc">Spring City</span>" for its well-known 72 artesian springs inside urban area. Its population was 7,067,900 in 2014 with an urban population of 4,693,700. The modern-day name "Jinan" literally means "south of the <span class="loc">Ji</span> (Waters)" and refers to the old <span class="loc">Ji</span> River that had flowed to the north of the city until the middle of the 19th century. The <span class="loc">Ji</span> River disappeared in 1852 when the <span class="loc">Yellow River</span> changed its course northwards and took over its bed. The current pronunciation of the character "<span class="loc">Ji</span>" with the third tone ("jǐ") was established in the late 1970s. Prior to this, it was pronounced with the fourth tone ("jì"). Older texts spell the name as "Tsinan" (Wade-Giles romanizaton) or "Chi-nan".</p>
