<p>Trenton is a city in <span class="loc">Grundy County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,001 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Grundy County</span>. The city claims to be the world's largest producer of vienna sausages (at its biggest employer ConAgra Grocery Foods plant). Trenton was first settled in 1834 and was known as Lomax Store for the J.S. Lomax General Store on a bluff above the Thompson Branch of the <span class="loc">Grand River</span> (<span class="loc">Missouri</span>). It was renamed Bluff Grove and won a battle with <span class="loc">Tindall</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> to become the county seat of <span class="loc">Grundy County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The hilly area today is called the "<span class="loc">Green Hills</span>." It was renamed again in 1842 in honor of Trenton, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. The <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and Southwestern Railroad (which became part of the Rock Island Line) arrived in 1869. In 1890 Avalon College, which had been founded in <span class="loc">Avalon</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> by the United Brethren in 1869 moved to Trenton because of proximity to the railroad. The College nearly closed again. . In 1900 George McAnelly Miller started to turn the school around. He was soon joined by Walter Vrooman who had just returned from <span class="loc">Oxford</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> where he established <span class="loc">Ruskin</span> Hall, a university called the "College for the People" based on the Utopian Socialist writings of John Ruskin. Avalon College was renamed Ruskin College after Vrooman donated 1,500 acres (6.1 km2) to it.</p>
