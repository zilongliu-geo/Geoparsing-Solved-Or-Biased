  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Rafael</span> is a first class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Bulacan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 85,921 inhabitants. <span class="loc">San Rafael</span> is politically subdivided into 34 barangays (5 urban, 29 rural). The Americans succeeded the Spaniards with their policy of benevolent assimilation. Schools were established as a potent factor for pacification. In <span class="date">1903</span>, schools were opened in <span class="loc">San Rafael</span>. The municipal building was used as a school house. Since then, with the supervision of the American administrators, <span class="loc">San Rafael</span> has enjoyed the education and the progress which was denied to them during the threeâ€“century rule of the Spaniards. In <span class="date">1899</span>, the Americans incorporated the town to <span class="loc">Baliwag</span> when <span class="loc">Baliwag</span> was intended to be the Provincial Capital of <span class="loc">Bulacan</span>. However, due to a number of petitions of the people of <span class="loc">San Rafael</span>, especially when the plan to make <span class="loc">Baliwag</span> the capital of <span class="loc">Bulacan</span> did not materialize, the Americans where convinced to separate <span class="loc">San Rafael</span> as an independent town from <span class="loc">Baliwag</span>. <span class="per">Mr. Julian V. Valte</span> was appointed to be the first Presidente Municipal of <span class="loc">San Rafael</span>, and <span class="per">Mr. Emilio</span> <span class="loc">Reyes</span> was the last.</p><br><br>
