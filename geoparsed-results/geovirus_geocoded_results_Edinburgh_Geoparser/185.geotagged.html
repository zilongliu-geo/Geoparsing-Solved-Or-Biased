<p>Earlier yesterday, California state senators voted 21-11 in favor the prohibition of sales of sugared sports drinks at public schools during class hours. Soft drinks are already banned during school hours. "Sugar-sweetened electrolyte replacement beverages are still available and have surged in popularity among kids," said Senator Alex Padilla. "This is a common sense step forward in the effort to address the obesity epidemic in <span class="loc">California</span>," he added. Padilla's bill is now on its way to the Assembly. Studies have shown that drinks, especially sweetened, contribute to obesity among adults and children, leading to diseases like diabetes. "Eight out of ten drinks sold in <span class="loc">California</span> public schools are sports drinks," Padilla said, citing information from the California Department of Public Health. Governor Schwarzenegger is sponsoring a package of legislation aimed at reducing child obesity in <span class="loc">California</span>.</p>
