<p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, locally also referred to as Montco, is a county located in the Commonwealth of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 799,874, making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, after <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="loc">Allegheny Counties</span>. The county seat is <span class="loc">Norristown</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is very diverse, ranging from farms and open land in Upper Hanover to densely populated rowhouse streets in <span class="loc">Cheltenham</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is included in the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, <span class="loc">PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is a suburban county northwest of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>, and marks the region's northern border, with the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley region of the state to the north. In 2010, it was the 51st wealthiest county in the country (measured by median household income). In 2008, it was named the 9th Best Place to Raise a Family by <span class="loc">Forbes</span>. The county was created on September 10, 1784, out of land originally part of <span class="loc">Philadelphia County</span>. The first courthouse was housed in the Barley Sheaf Inn. It is believed to have been named either for Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture <span class="loc">Quebec City</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, or for the Welsh <span class="loc">county of Montgomeryshire</span> (which was named after one of William the Conqueror's main counselors, Roger de Montgomerie), as it was part of the Welsh Tract, an area of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> settled by Quakers from <span class="loc">Wales</span>. Early histories of the county indicate the origin of the county's name as uncertain.</p>
