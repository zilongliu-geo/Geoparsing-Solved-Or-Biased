<p><span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> (/lɒs ˈændʒəlᵻs/ loss AN-jə-ləs or loss AN-jə-liss) (Spanish for "The Angels"), officially the City of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-largest city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> after New <span class="loc">York City</span>, the most populous city in the state of <span class="loc">California</span>, and the county seat of <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>. Situated in <span class="loc">Southern California</span>, <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over 10,000 feet (3,000 m). Historically home to the Chumash and Tongva, <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> was claimed by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo for <span class="loc">Spain</span> in 1542 along with the rest of what would become Alta California. The city was officially founded on September 4, 1781, by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve. It became a part of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and the rest of <span class="loc">California</span> were purchased as part of the Treaty of <span class="loc">Guadalupe Hidalgo</span>, thereby becoming part of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before <span class="loc">California</span> achieved statehood. The city experienced rapid growth with the discovery of oil.</p>
