  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sande</span> is a municipality in <span class="loc">Vestfold county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of "<span class="loc">Sande i Vestfold</span>". The municipality of <span class="loc">Sande</span> was established on <span class="date">1 January 1838</span> (see formannskapsdistrikt). The municipality is located about 60 kilometres (37 mi) (50 minutes driving time) south of <span class="loc">Oslo</span>, and lies beautifully by the sea. In <span class="date">recent years</span>, the administrative center of <span class="loc">Sande</span> has grown significantly due to a large number of new apartments and stores. Parts of the Olsenbanden-movie Olsenbanden tar gull from <span class="date">1973</span> was filmed in <span class="loc">Sande</span>, and another part in <span class="loc">Stavern</span>. The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Sande farm (Old Norse: <span class="loc">Sandvin</span>), since the first church was built here. The first element is sandr which means "sand" and the last element is vin meaning "meadow" or "pasture". The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on <span class="date">19 December 1986</span>. The arms represent a silver-colored Sandebukta bay, with its typical triangular shape, surrounded by the forests and mountains.</p><br><br>
