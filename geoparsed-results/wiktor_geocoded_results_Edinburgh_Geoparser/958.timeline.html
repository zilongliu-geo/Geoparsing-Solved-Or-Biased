  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mari</span> (modern Tell <span class="loc">Hariri</span>), was an ancient <span class="loc">Semitic city</span> in <span class="loc">Syria</span>. Its remains constitute a tell located 11 kilometers north-west of <span class="loc">Abu Kamal</span> on the Euphrates river western bank, some 120 kilometers southeast of Deir ez-Zor. It flourished as a trade center and hegemonic state between <span class="date">2900 BC</span> and <span class="date">1759 BC</span>. As a purposely built city, the existence of <span class="loc">Mari</span> was related to its position in the middle of the Euphrates trade routes; this position made it an intermediary between <span class="loc">Sumer</span> in the south and the Levant in the west. <span class="loc">Mari</span> was first abandoned in the middle of the <span class="date">26th century BC</span> but was rebuilt and became the capital of a hegemonic East-Semitic state before <span class="date">2500 BC</span>. This second <span class="loc">Mari</span> engaged in a long war with its rival Ebla, and is known for its strong affinity with the Sumerian culture. It was destroyed in the <span class="date">23rd century BC</span> by the Akkadians who allowed the city to be rebuilt and appointed a military governor bearing the title of Shakkanakku (military governor). The governors later became independent with the rapid disintegration of the Akkadian empire and rebuilt the city as a regional center in the middle Euphrates valley. The Shakkanakkus ruled <span class="loc">Mari</span> until the second half of the <span class="date">19th century BC</span> when the dynasty collapsed for unknown reasons. <span class="date">A short time</span> after the Shakkanakku collapse, <span class="loc">Mari</span> became the capital of the Amorite Lim dynasty. The Amorite Mari was short lived as it was annexed by <span class="loc">Babylonia</span> in c. <span class="date">1761 BC</span>, but the city survived as a small settlement under the rule of the Babylonians and the Assyrians before being abandoned and forgotten during the Hellenistic period.</p><br><br>
