  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bel Air</span> is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Minot</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>, located in the <span class="loc">Souris River</span> Valley. It is roughly bound by <span class="loc">North Hill</span> to the north, Sixteenth Street NW to the east, Fourth Avenue NW to the south and the city limits on the west. The neighborhood was home to about a thousand people in <span class="date">2010</span>. The neighborhood is home to <span class="org">Bel Air Elementary School</span> on Twenty Fifth Street NW. The neighborhood was developed as the <span class="org">Bel Air Addition</span> in <span class="date">1956</span>. Fourth Avenue is home to a number of businesses in <span class="loc">Bel Air</span>, many of which were severely damaged in the <span class="loc">Souris River</span> flood in <span class="date">2011</span>. <span class="loc">Bel Air</span> is home to the Church of the Living God, the <span class="org">Bible Fellowship Church</span> and the Christ Lutheran Church. <span class="loc">Minot City</span> Transit operates three lines that serve the <span class="loc">Bel Air</span> neighborhood in the morning and afternoon: Bel Air-Perkett Route, the North Central Route and the West Route. The West Route in the early afternoon also services the <span class="loc">Bel Air</span> neighborhood. North Ridge Villas is a planned community currently being constructed in the western part of <span class="loc">Bel Air</span>. The community will be home to two story single family homes. It is being built along a coulee to the west of Twenty-Seventh Street NW. Two streets are planned for the community: Ninth Avenue NW and Twenty-Eighth Street NW. Ninth Avenue will connect Twenty-Seventh and Twenty-Eighth Street and will not connect with the existing Ninth Avenue-University Avenue corridor. Likewise, Twenty-Eighth Street will have cul-de-sacs at both ends of the development and will not connect with other segments of the street. The neighborhood will only be accessible from Ninth Avenue from the east at Twenty-Seventh Street. A trail along the neighboring coulee has also been proposed in plans for the community.</p><br><br>
