  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Clarke County</span> is a county in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 14,034. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Berryville</span>. <span class="loc">Clarke County</span> is included in the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, <span class="loc">DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The first settlement of the <span class="loc">Virginia Colony</span> in <span class="date">the future</span> <span class="loc">Clarke County</span> was in <span class="date">1736</span> by <span class="per">Thomas Fairfax</span>, 6th <span class="per">Lord Fairfax</span> of Cameron who built a home, <span class="loc">Greenway Court</span>, on part of his 5 million acre (20,000 kmÂ²) property, near what is <span class="date">now</span> the village of <span class="loc">White Post</span>. <span class="loc">White Post</span> was named for the large signpost pointing the way to <span class="per">Lord Fairfax</span>'s home. As it lay just west of the Blue Ridge border demarcated under <span class="per">Governor Spotswood</span> at <span class="loc">Albany</span> in <span class="date">1722</span>, the area was claimed along with the rest of the <span class="loc">Shenandoah</span> Valley by the Six Nations Iroquois (who had overrun it during the later Beaver Wars in around <span class="date">1672</span>), until the Treaty of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> in <span class="date">1744</span>, when it was purchased from them by <span class="per">Governor Gooch</span>. Many of the early settlers of what became <span class="loc">Clarke County</span> were children of Tidewater planters, who settled on large land grants from <span class="per">Lord Fairfax</span>. Two-thirds of the county was settled by the plantation group, and the plantation lifestyle thrived until the Civil War. County status came in <span class="date">1836</span> when it was divided off from <span class="loc">Frederick County</span>. <span class="loc">Clarke</span> was known for its large crops of wheat.</p><br><br>
