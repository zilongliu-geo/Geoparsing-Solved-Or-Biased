<p><span class="loc">Fremont</span> is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in <span class="loc">western Carter County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 60 about 10 miles (16 km) west of <span class="loc">Van Buren</span> in Pike Creek Valley. The community was founded in about 1887. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 129. The site of the town of <span class="loc">Fremont</span> was originally patented by Julius N. Russell. The claim was filed at Jackson, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, on January 1, 1859. Like most communities that came to be in <span class="loc">Carter County</span>, <span class="loc">Fremont</span>'s origins can be tied to the activity of the Missouri Lumber and Mining Company. In 1887 they granted the Current River branch of the Frisco Railroad a right-of-way across their land in <span class="loc">Carter County</span>. By July 3, 1888, the tracks were laid and the first train ran through the new town. The plat for the town was submitted to the county on July 10, 1888. The new town, which was laid out on land the railroad had acquired as part of its right-of-way through <span class="loc">Carter County</span>, was originally to be called "McDonald", after the chief engineer who had laid out the site of the town for the railroad. But the postal service rejected this name because it was too similar to <span class="loc">McDowell</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>.</p>
