  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Anton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Hockley County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,200 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="per">Anton</span> was founded in <span class="date">1924</span> near the center of the north pasture of the former Spade Ranch when ranch owner <span class="per">William Leonard Ellwood</span> contracted with the <span class="org">Anton Townsite Company</span> to plat a town at the site of Danforth Switch, a spur of the <span class="loc">Pecos</span> and Northern <span class="loc">Texas Railway</span>. The town was named in honor of <span class="per">J.F. Anton</span>, a <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> railroad executive. <span class="per">Anton</span>'s first mayor was <span class="per">Paul Grover</span> <span class="loc">Whitfield</span>, who was born in <span class="date">July of 1908</span> so in <span class="date">1924</span> was only 16 or <span class="date">17 years</span> old, but told everyone he was 18 and so was able to accept the position. He's therefore on record as being the youngest mayor ever in the state of <span class="loc">Texas</span> at the time and since he was under the age of 18 it's likely that record stands to <span class="date">this day</span> and will for all time. It's unclear if there was an election or if he simply volunteered for the position. In those <span class="date">days</span> an ID was not required because most things were done with a handshake.</p><br><br>
