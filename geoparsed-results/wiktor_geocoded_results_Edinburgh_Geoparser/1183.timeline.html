  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Parma</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 769 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Parma</span> is the birthplace of world-renowned ecologist and soil scientist Dr. <span class="per">Robert E. Horton</span> and <span class="per">NASCAR</span> driver <span class="per">Brian Tyler</span>. <span class="per">Parma</span> was originally located a few miles east of its current location along the <span class="org">Michigan Central Railroad</span> at a stop known as Gidley's Station. When it was moved to its current location, it was known as <span class="loc">Groveland</span>, after a noticeable grove of trees within the town. Part of this grove still exists where Grove St. curves around a copse of trees near its intersection with Westlawn St. in the eastern half of <span class="per">Parma</span>. When the village was incorporated in <span class="date">1847</span>, its name was changed to <span class="per">Parma</span>. In <span class="date">the early 1900s</span> <span class="per">Parma</span> was also known as Cracker Hill. A book was published called Cracker Hill Crumbs in <span class="date">1976</span>. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.06 square miles (2.75 km2), all land. <span class="per">Parma</span> is bisected by a township line; as a result, the town lies in both <span class="per">Parma</span> and <span class="per">Sandstone</span> townships.</p><br><br>
