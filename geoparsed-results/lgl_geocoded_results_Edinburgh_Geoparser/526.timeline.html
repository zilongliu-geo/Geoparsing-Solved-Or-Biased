  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Morecambe</span> and <span class="per">Lancaster</span> shops give away festive bells. SHOPPERS are being offered tiny bells to pin on their bags and purses in a bid to help tackle thieves and pickpockets. It is the third year that ‘jingle’ bells have been handed out in <span class="loc">Morecambe</span> and <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> in the run-up to <span class="date">Christmas</span> as a pro-active approach to help prevent purse, wallet, mobile phone and handbag thefts. Cash to pay for 10,000 bells has come from a number of organisations including the St Nicholas <span class="per">Arcades</span> and <span class="per">Marketgate</span> shopping areas in <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> and <span class="loc">Morecambe</span>’s <span class="org">Arndale Centre</span>. Crime prevention officer <span class="date">Jan</span> Brown, says: “The bells are a simple but effective way of crime prevention and they were an extremely popular item <span class="date">last year</span>. “The jingle bells are just one of a range of measures in place <span class="date">this Christmas</span> to help keep people who live and work locally and their property safe. “This simple initiative decreases the risk of becoming a victim of theft by increasing people’s awareness. The bells are not only a deterrent for thieves, but they also act as a reminder to secure your wallet or purse. If you can hear the bell ringing then your purse or wallet is not secure enough and you need to put it at the bottom of your bag with the opening securely fastened.”</p><br><br>
