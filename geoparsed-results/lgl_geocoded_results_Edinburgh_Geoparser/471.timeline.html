  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Firearms expert to testify at <span class="per">Dziekanski</span> inquiry. A <span class="org">Delta</span> police officer has been called to testify at the public inquiry into the death of Polish immigrant <span class="per">Robert Dziekanski</span> following a <span class="date">2007</span> confrontation with RCMP officers at <span class="org">Vancouver International Airport</span>. <span class="per">Dziekanski</span> died after he was shocked several times by a Taser wielded by RCMP Const. Kwesi Millington, one of four airport police who said <span class="per">Dziekanski</span> was hit with the high-voltage electrical stun gun because he was acting in a threatening manner. Following the incident, the RCMP asked the <span class="org">Delta Police Department</span>’s firearms expert Const. <span class="per">Craig Baltzer</span> to examine the Taser that was fired at <span class="per">Dziekanski</span> by <span class="loc">Millington</span>. <span class="per">Baltzer</span> downloaded information from a computer chip that is included with each Taser designed to record every discharge of the device. The constable will give evidence about his findings when the public inquiry chaired by <span class="per">Thomas Braidwood</span> resumes on <span class="date">March 23</span>. The <span class="org">Delta</span> officer is expected to take the stand some time after RCMP Cpl. <span class="per">Benjamin Robinson</span>, one of the four airport officers and the supervisor on duty at the time <span class="per">Dziekanski</span> died. Before the inquiry took a two-week break, it heard the RCMP officer who fired the Taser admit that he’d made erroneous statements in his report about the deadly encounter. <span class="loc">Millington</span> originally stated that <span class="per">Dziekanski</span> had to be repeatedly shocked because he didn’t immediately fall to the ground. But a video taken by a witness shows that <span class="per">Dziekanski</span> did fall to the ground when stunned. <span class="loc">Millington</span> also denied the officers had met to discuss the incident, even though one of his colleagues said they had. And he told the inquiry he never overheard his fellow officers discuss the incident. <span class="loc">Millington</span> was the only officer armed with a Taser, and had only recently been trained in its use. He also said he didn’t issue a warning to Dziekanski that he was going to use the Taser because he felt he didn’t have time and that <span class="per">Dziekanski</span>, who was holding a stapler, was posing a threat to himself and the other officers. <span class="per">Dziekanski</span> died in the international arrivals area of <span class="org">Vancouver International Airport</span> after spending more than 10 hours waiting for his mother Zofia Cisowski.</p><br><br>
