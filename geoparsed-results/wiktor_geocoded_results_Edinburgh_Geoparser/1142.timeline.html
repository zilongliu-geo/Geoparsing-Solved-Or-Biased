  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Eden is a coastal town in the South Coast region of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The town is 478 kilometres (297 mi) south of the state capital <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and is the most southerly town in <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, located between <span class="loc">Nullica Bay</span> to the south and <span class="loc">Calle Calle Bay</span>, the northern reach of <span class="loc">Twofold Bay</span>, and built on undulating land adjacent to the third deepest natural harbour in the southern hemisphere, and Snug Cove on its western boundary. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, Eden had a population of 3,043. The eastern coastline has rugged cliffs at the southern end and a wide, sandy surf beach, Aslings Beach, north of the cliffs. The beach ends at the entrance to Lake Curalo, a safe boating inlet of <span class="loc">Twofold Bay</span>. Although the urban settlement of Eden commenced in <span class="date">1843</span> the settlement was not officially proclaimed as a township until <span class="date">20 March 1885</span>. The townâ€™s main industries include fishing, forestry, and tourism. The local Aboriginal people who lived in the region prior to the arrival of Europeans were the <span class="loc">Thaua</span> or <span class="loc">Thawa</span> people of the Yuin nation.</p><br><br>
