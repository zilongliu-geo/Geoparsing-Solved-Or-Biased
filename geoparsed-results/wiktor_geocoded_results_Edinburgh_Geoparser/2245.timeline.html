  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The Town of <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> is a Home Rule Municipality located in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> is situated west of, and adjacent to, the City and <span class="loc">County of Denver</span>. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau estimates that the town population was 529 on 2005-07-01. The <span class="org">Denver Post Office</span> (ZIP Code 80212) serves <span class="loc">Mountain View</span>. <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1904</span> on the land occupied by the Berkeley Annex subdivision established in <span class="date">1888</span>, which itself was part of the <span class="loc">Berkeley Farm</span> founded by <span class="per">John Brisben Walker</span> in <span class="date">1879</span>. The town grew to approximately 500 residents living in 272 houses by <span class="date">2008</span>, with approximately 20 businesses in operation, but occupying a total of only 12 square-blocks "sandwiched between Wheat Ridge and <span class="loc">Denver</span>." By <span class="date">2009</span>, the town was going through a bit of an existential crises. Several businesses closed down, sales taxes declined, and city workers were paid late on three occasions over <span class="date">two months</span>. The Town Council added a US$162 fee to sewer bills in order to maintain basic services. <span class="org">The Government of the State</span> of <span class="loc">Colorado</span> stepped in to pay for getting the city's financial records in order. The Town wrote a letter to city residents saying: " 'Our town is in serious trouble and we need your help!' [offering] three options: Get some more businesses into town, unincorporate and be absorbed into <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> or let a neighboring community annex the town."</p><br><br>
