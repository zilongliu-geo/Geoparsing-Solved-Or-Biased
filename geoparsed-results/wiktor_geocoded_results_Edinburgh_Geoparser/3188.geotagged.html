The <span class="loc">city of Madison</span>, named for James Madison, the fourth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, developed along a bustling railroad track in antebellum <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. It began in 1856 when the Illinois Central Railroad opened <span class="loc">Madison</span> Station, the forerunner of the <span class="loc">city of Madison</span>. The nearby town of <span class="loc">Madisonville</span> was a settlement established along the stagecoach route on the Natchez Trace. It was the first county seat of <span class="loc">Madison County</span> in 1828, and had a race track, two banks, a wagon factory, and at least one hotel. Its residents gradually moved to the new railroad community, and old <span class="loc">Madisonville</span> became defunct. . Like many railroad towns in the South, <span class="loc">Madison</span> Station was heavily damaged by the Union Army during the Civil War. Ten miles from the state capital of Jackson, Madison Station was largely destroyed in 1863 after the July 18â€“22 siege of Jackson. No battles were fought in <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, but Major General Stephen D. Lee concentrated his command in <span class="loc">Madison</span> Station during the month of February 1864. Stephen Lee was later appointed as the first president of Mississippi State College (now Mississippi State University).</p>
