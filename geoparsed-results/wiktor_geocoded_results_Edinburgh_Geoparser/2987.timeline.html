  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Acton is a large area within the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Ealing</span> in <span class="loc">west London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, 6.1 miles (10 km) west of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, its four wards, <span class="loc">East Acton</span>, <span class="loc">Acton Central</span>, <span class="loc">South Acton</span> and <span class="loc">Southfield</span>, had a population of 62,480, a ten-year increase of 8,791 people. <span class="loc">North Acton</span>, <span class="loc">West Acton</span>, <span class="loc">East Acton</span>, <span class="loc">South Acton</span>, <span class="loc">Acton Green</span>, <span class="loc">Acton Town</span>, <span class="loc">Acton Vale</span> and <span class="loc">Acton Central</span> are all parts of Acton. Acton means "oak farm" or "farm by oak trees", and is derived from the Old English āc (oak) and tūn (farm). Originally an ancient village, as <span class="loc">London</span> expanded, Acton became absorbed into the city. Since <span class="date">1965</span>, Acton equates to the east of the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Ealing</span> though some of <span class="loc">East Acton</span> is in the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Hammersmith</span> and <span class="loc">Fulham</span> and a small portion of <span class="loc">South Acton</span> is in the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Hounslow</span>. <span class="per">Acton</span> and <span class="per">Harrow</span> are the two locations with the most stations bearing their name anywhere in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> (apart from the full names of the <span class="loc">London</span> terminus stations), with seven each.</p><br><br>
