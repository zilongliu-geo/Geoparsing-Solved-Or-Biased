  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Garden City</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 27,692. The city is part of the Metro <span class="loc">Detroit region</span>. The origins of <span class="loc">Garden City</span> started with the transfer of the property to <span class="per">John Lathers</span> from <span class="per">Andrew Jackson</span> for 160 acres (0.65 km2) in <span class="date">October 1835</span>. The city was patterned after the "garden city" concept that became popular in <span class="loc">England</span> during the 19th century, with most home sites sectioned off into 1-acre (4,000 m2) plots to allow adequate farming area to support the family with fruit and vegetables. <span class="date">Now</span>, most sites are considerably smaller, some as small as 40 feet by 135 feet, with little room for gardening of fruits and vegetables, though the city maintains some large lots where an extra street has not been placed between two of the older streets, such as between some parts of <span class="loc">Bock</span> Street and <span class="per">John Hauk</span> Street where Donnelly Avenue does not cut through. In <span class="date">June 1927</span>, <span class="loc">Garden City</span> became a village, with Arnold Folker as Village President. <span class="date">Six years later</span> the village became the city of <span class="loc">Garden City</span>. Areas of interest in <span class="loc">Garden City</span> include the first Kmart store (opened <span class="date">1962</span> and still in use), the first Little Caesars (also still in use), and the first dine-in <span class="loc">McDonalds</span> in <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The honeymoon cottage of <span class="per">Henry Ford</span> and his wife, <span class="per">Clara Jane Bryant</span>, was moved here from <span class="loc">Dearborn</span> in <span class="date">1952</span>.</p><br><br>
