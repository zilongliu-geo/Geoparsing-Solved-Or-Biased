<p><span class="loc">Albany</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Athens County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 828 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Albany</span> is located at 39°13′44″N 82°12′1″W (39.228787, -82.200363). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.27 square miles (3.29 km2), of which 1.25 square miles (3.24 km2) is land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) is water. <span class="loc">Albany</span> was laid out in about 1832. It was incorporated as a village in 1842. The small rural village became one of several stops in <span class="loc">Athens County</span> for the Underground Railroad, as fugitives could come upriver on the <span class="loc">Hocking River</span> from the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>. Free blacks, many of whom had migrated from the Upper South, settled the village in the mid-19th century. The black population increased during the 1850s from four in the township to 174 by 1860, largely because of the chance for their children to attend the Albany Manual Labor Academy, which was open to both genders and all races. The outbreak of the Civil War caused the academy to lose students and close.</p>
