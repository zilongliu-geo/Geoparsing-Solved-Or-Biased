<p><span class="loc">Aston</span> is an area in Central Birmingham, in the <span class="loc">West Midlands</span> of <span class="loc">England</span>. Commencing immediately to the north-east of the city centre, <span class="loc">Aston</span> constitutes a ward within the unitary authority. <span class="loc">Aston</span> was first mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 as "Estone", having a mill, a priest and therefore probably a church, woodland and ploughland. The Church of SS Peter &amp; Paul, <span class="loc">Aston</span> was built in medieval times to replace an earlier church. The body of the church was rebuilt by J. A. Chatwin during the period 1879 to 1890; the 15th century tower and spire, which was partly rebuilt in 1776, being the only survivors of the medieval building. The ancient <span class="loc">parish of Aston</span> (known as <span class="loc">Aston</span> juxta <span class="loc">Birmingham</span>) was large. It was separated from the <span class="loc">parish of Birmingham</span> by <span class="loc">AB Row</span>, which currently exists in the <span class="loc">Eastside</span> of the city at just 50 yards in length. It was partly included in the <span class="loc">borough of Birmingham</span> in 1838, and a further part, <span class="loc">Saltley</span> was added in 1891. Old buildings which became popular within <span class="loc">Aston</span> included the Aston Hippodrome and the Bartons Arms public house. Gospel Hall on <span class="loc">Park Lane</span> was opened in 1892 and demolished in the 1970s to be rebuilt at the top of <span class="loc">Park Lane</span> in 1979. The original hall had a seating capacity of 73. Another meeting place was the Ellen Knox Memorial Hall which was next door to the Midland Vinegar Brewery. The brewery was owned by the Midland Brewery Company was built around 1877. It was located on Upper Thomas Street. The brewery was a three storey brick building with rounded corners and semi-circular windows. The roof was slated. Other industry that was located in <span class="loc">Aston</span> include the Premier Motor Works which produced cars during the early 20th century. The works were situated at the junction of <span class="loc">Aston Road</span> and <span class="loc">Dartmouth Street</span>. On Miller Street was a tramcar depot which had a storage capacity of 104 tramcars. It opened in 1904.</p>
