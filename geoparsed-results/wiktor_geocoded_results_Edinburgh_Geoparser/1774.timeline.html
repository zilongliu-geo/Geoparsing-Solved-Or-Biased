  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county located in the Blue Ridge foothills of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of Virginia. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 56,159. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Rocky Mount</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Roanoke</span>, <span class="loc">VA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area and is located in the <span class="loc">Roanoke Region</span> of Virginia. The <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> River forms its northeast boundary with <span class="loc">Bedford County</span>. The Blue Ridge Foothills had long been inhabited by indigenous peoples. At the time of European encounter, mostly Siouan-speaking tribes lived in this area. A few colonists moved into the area before the American Revolutionary War, but most settlement happened afterward, as people moved west seeking new lands. Cultivation of tobacco had exhausted soils in the eastern part of the state. The county was formed in <span class="date">1785</span> from parts of <span class="per">Bedford</span> and <span class="per">Henry</span> counties. It was named for <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>. The <span class="loc">Piedmont</span> and backcountry areas were largely settled by Scots-Irish, who were the last major immigrant group from the <span class="loc">British Isles</span> to enter the colonies before the Revolutionary War. There were also migrants from coastal areas, including free people of color, who moved to the frontier to escape racial strictures associated with the slave society of Virginia.</p><br><br>
