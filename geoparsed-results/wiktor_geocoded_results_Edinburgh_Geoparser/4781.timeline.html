The village is situated in a valley, protected from wind and the elements by high mountain ridges creating a beautiful panorama. The valley surrounding the village resembles an enormous carpet, woven from hundreds of green, white, and brown plots created by potato fields and mountain meadows. The valley is criss-crossed by the brown strands of woodland roads leading visitors to wild and untouched nature. <span class="loc">Borino</span> is a multi-ethnic village where Turks, Bulgarians, Bulgarian-Muslims, and <span class="loc">Roma</span> live like neighbors, creating a unique example of ethnic tolerance. A popular saying in <span class="loc">Borino</span> says that neighbors, regardless of ethnicity or race, are closer than relatives.
