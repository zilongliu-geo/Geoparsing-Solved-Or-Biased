  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Swansea</span> is a ghost town in La <span class="loc">Paz County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. It was settled around <span class="date">1909</span> in what was then the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Territory. It served as a mining town as well as a location for processing and smelting the copper ore taken from the nearby mines. Prospecting and mining in the area first began around <span class="date">1862</span>, but the remote location and lack of transportation kept activity to a minimum. By <span class="date">1904</span>, the railroad was coming to nearby Parker, and local miners <span class="per">Newton Evans</span> and <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson Carrigan</span> saw an opportunity to develop the area. Within <span class="date">a few years</span>, the two miners had built a 350-ton furnace, a water pipeline to the <span class="loc">Bill Williams River</span>, and hoists for five mine shafts. They called the new town Signal (not to be confused with the other <span class="loc">Arizona</span> ghost town of Signal). By <span class="date">1908</span>, the claims in the area had been consolidated by the <span class="per">Clara Gold</span> and Copper Mining Company, which set up its headquarters in the mining camp that would become <span class="loc">Swansea</span>. That same year, what was to become the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> and <span class="loc">Swansea Railroad</span> connected Signal to <span class="loc">Bouse</span> some 25 miles (40 km) away. These two factors spurred the growth of the town, and its population quickly grew to about 300 residents.</p><br><br>
