  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Suspects identified in fatal hit-and-run. A Crime Stoppers tip provided the break investigators needed to make an arrest in the hit-and-run death of <span class="per">Terry A. Corbin</span>. “Right <span class="date">now</span>, we are in the process of drawing up arrest warrants for two persons,” Detective <span class="per">Jeff Goodwin</span> of the <span class="org">Paris Police Department</span> said shortly before 1 p.m. Tuesday. <span class="per">Goodwin</span> said a Crime Stoppers tip led investigators to Ashley L. Evens, 26, of rural <span class="per">Paris</span> and <span class="per">Guy</span> <span class="per">C. Harminson</span>, 26, also of rural <span class="loc">Paris</span> as suspects in the case. “We’ve been looking at them since <span class="date">March 14th</span>,” said <span class="per">Goodwin</span>. The detective added police believe the evidence gathered in the case will show that Evens was driving a <span class="date">1996</span> <span class="org">Dodge</span> pickup that struck <span class="per">Corbin</span> at 1:33 a.m. on <span class="date">Dec. 6, 2008</span>. <span class="per">Paris</span> police and fire departments and the <span class="loc">Edgar County</span> Special Service Area Ambulance responded to the early morning call on <span class="date">Dec. 6</span> and found <span class="per">Corbin</span> in the southbound lane of state Route 1 at the <span class="per">Marshall Street</span> cutoff. He was first transported to <span class="org">Paris Community Hospital</span> and subsequently airlifted to <span class="org">Carle Foundation Hospital</span>, <span class="loc">Urbana</span>, where he succumbed to his injuries at 10:22 a.m. The warrant for Evens charges her with a Class 1 felony of leaving the scene of an accident involving a death and driving while license suspended. <span class="per">Harminson</span> is being arrested on a Class 4 felony of obstructing justice. A check of <span class="org">Edgar County Court</span> records through the judici website reveals that Evens has a prior speeding conviction in <span class="loc">Edgar County</span>. <span class="per">Harminson</span>’s name does not appear in the records. <span class="per">Goodwin</span> confirmed that both <span class="per">Evens</span> and <span class="per">Harminson</span> were interviewed by the police as part of the investigation, and he anticipated them surrendering on the warrants <span class="date">later Tuesday afternoon</span>.</p><br><br>
