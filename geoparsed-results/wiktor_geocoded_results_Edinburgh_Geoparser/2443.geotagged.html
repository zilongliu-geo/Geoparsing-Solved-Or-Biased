<p><span class="loc">Jauja</span> (Shawsha Wanka Quechua: Shawsha or Shausha, formerly in Spanish Xauxa, with pronunciation of "x" as "sh") is a city and capital of <span class="loc">Jauja Province</span> in <span class="loc">Peru</span>. It is situated in the fertile <span class="loc">Mantaro</span> Valley, 45 kilometres (28 mi) to the northwest of <span class="loc">Huancayo</span> (the capital of <span class="loc">Junín Region</span>), at an altitude of 3,400 metres (11,200 ft). Its population according to the 2007 census was 16,424. <span class="loc">Jauja</span>, which flourished for a short time, was once the capital of Spanish <span class="loc">Peru</span>, prior to the founding of <span class="loc">Lima</span> as the new capital. Its name is referenced in the popular Spanish expression país de <span class="loc">Jauja</span>, which literally means "country of <span class="loc">Jauja</span>", but is used figuratively to mean a “never never land" or a "land of milk and honey”. The town, with a laid back ambiance and salubrious climate, has narrow streets with houses painted blue. Laguna de Paca lake is close to the city. An important Xauxa town was located in the vicinity before the Incas. During the <span class="loc">Inca</span> civilization, the town of "Hatun Xauxa" was established. Today the ruins of this settlement can be seen on a hill, approximately 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) southeast of the town. Oral tradition mentions that the <span class="loc">Inca</span> ordered the mutilation of men's and women's hands in <span class="loc">Jauja</span> and that this occurred in the Pampa de Maquinhuayo, 5 miles (8.0 km) south of present-day <span class="loc">Jauja</span>.</p>
