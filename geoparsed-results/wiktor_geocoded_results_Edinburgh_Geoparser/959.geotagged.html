<p>Cartagena (Spanish pronunciation: [kartaˈxena]; Arabic: Al-Qartājanna قرطاجنة‎, Latin: Carthago Nova) is a Spanish city and a major naval station located in the Region of <span class="loc">Murcia</span>, by the Mediterranean coast, south-eastern <span class="loc">Spain</span>. As of January 2011, it has a population of 218,210 inhabitants being the Region’s second largest municipality and the country’s 6th non-Province capital city. The metropolitan area of Cartagena, known as Campo de Cartagena, has a population of 409,586 inhabitants. Cartagena has been inhabited for over two millennia, being founded around 227 BC by the Carthaginian Hasdrubal the Fair as Qart Hadasht, the same name as the original <span class="loc">city of Carthage</span>. The city had its heyday during the Roman Empire, when it was known as Carthago Nova (the <span class="loc">New Carthage</span>) and Carthago Spartaria, capital of the <span class="loc">province of Carthaginensis</span>. It was one of the important cities during the Umayyad invasion of <span class="loc">Hispania</span>, under its Arabic name of Qartayannat al-Halfa. Much of the historical weight of Cartagena in the past goes to its coveted defensive port, one of the most important in the western Mediterranean. Cartagena has been the capital of the Spanish Navy's Maritime Department of the Mediterranean since the arrival of the Spanish Bourbons in the 18th century. As far back as the 16th century it was one of the most important naval ports in <span class="loc">Spain</span>, together with <span class="loc">Ferrol</span> in the North. It is still an important naval seaport, the main military haven of <span class="loc">Spain</span>, and is home to a large naval shipyard.</p>
