<p><span class="loc">Southern Province</span> is one of <span class="loc">Zambia</span>'s ten provinces, and home to <span class="loc">Zambia</span>'s premier tourist attraction, Mosi-oa-Tunya (<span class="loc">Victoria Falls</span>), shared with <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>. The centre of the province, the <span class="loc">Southern Plateau</span>, has the largest area of commercial farmland of any Zambian province, and produces most of the maize crop. The <span class="loc">Zambezi River</span> is the province's southern border, and <span class="loc">Lake Kariba</span>, formed by the <span class="loc">Kariba</span> Dam, lies along the province's south-eastern edge. The eastern border is the <span class="loc">Kariba Gorge</span> and <span class="loc">Zambezi</span>, and the north-east border is the <span class="loc">Kafue</span> River and its gorge, dividing it from <span class="loc">Lusaka Province</span>. The <span class="loc">Kafue Flats</span> lie mostly within the province's northern border with <span class="loc">Central Province</span>. In the north west lies part of the famous <span class="loc">Kafue</span> National Park, the largest in <span class="loc">Zambia</span>, and the lake formed by the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam. The south-western border with <span class="loc">Western Province</span> runs through the teak forests around <span class="loc">Mulobezi</span> which once supported a commercial timber industry and for which the Mulobezi Railway was built. The provincial capital is <span class="loc">Choma</span>. Until 2011 the provincial capital was <span class="loc">Livingstone City</span>. The <span class="loc">Batonga</span> are the largest ethnic group in the Province. A rail line and the Lusaka-Livingstone road forms the principal transport axis of the province, running through its centre and its farming towns: <span class="loc">Kalomo</span>, <span class="loc">Choma</span>, <span class="loc">Pemba</span>, <span class="loc">Monze</span>, and <span class="loc">Mazabuka</span>. In addition to maize, other commercially important activities include sugar cane plantations at the edge of the <span class="loc">Kafue Flats</span>, and cattle ranching.</p>
