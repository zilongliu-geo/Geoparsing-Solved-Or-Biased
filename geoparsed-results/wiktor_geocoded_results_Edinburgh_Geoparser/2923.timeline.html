  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Hill County</span> in Central <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The population was 8,456 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span>, located on Interstate 35 where I-35E and I-35W split south of the Dallasâ€“Fort Worth metroplex, is the primary center for trade and commerce in <span class="loc">Hill County</span>. It is located almost midway between the <span class="per">Metroplex</span> and <span class="per">Waco</span>, and is the gateway to the popular <span class="loc">Lake Whitney</span>. There are many antique stores located downtown, and a popular outlet mall is located along the Interstate, surrounded by numerous hotels and motels. The city is known for its abundance of restored Victorian homes and its historic county courthouse, which on <span class="date">January 1, 1993</span> was heavily damaged by an electrical fire. It was rebuilt, courtesy of donations from around the world and two concerts sponsored by <span class="loc">Hill County</span> native <span class="per">Willie Nelson</span>. The courthouse (See <span class="loc">Hill County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> for photograph.) won the Downtown Association's <span class="date">1999</span> award for "Best Restoration". The renovation sparked an interest in restoring <span class="loc">Texas</span>'s historic courthouses. The <span class="loc">Hill County</span> courthouse is eight miles from <span class="per">Willie Nelson</span>'s hometown, <span class="loc">Abbott</span>.</p><br><br>
