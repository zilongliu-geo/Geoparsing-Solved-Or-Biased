  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Nicolas</span> or Bayan ng <span class="loc">San Nicolas</span> is a second class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Ilocos Norte</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 34,237 people. San Nicole√±os are famous for their traditionally-designed pots (called "bangas"). The present name of <span class="loc">San Nicolas</span> was given in the <span class="date">year 1733</span>, after <span class="loc">Saint Nicholas</span> de <span class="loc">Tolentino</span> who was believed to have protected the people against floods, earthquakes, fires, typhoons and other calamities. It is significant that in <span class="loc">Ilocos Norte</span>, only <span class="loc">San Nicolas</span> was named after a Saint. Like any other town in the ancient <span class="loc">province of Ilocos</span>, <span class="loc">San Nicolas</span> was established by Augustinian missionaries. <span class="loc">Vigan</span>, the first Spanish mission center in this region, was founded in <span class="date">1575</span>. In the <span class="date">year 1572</span>, when the Spaniards first explored the <span class="loc">Laoag</span> (Padsan) River, they met hostile resistance from the natives of <span class="loc">San Nicolas</span> and <span class="loc">Laoag</span>. In another expedition dispatched from <span class="loc">Vigan</span> in <span class="date">1584</span> <span class="loc">San Nicolas</span> was established and <span class="loc">Laoag</span> followed <span class="date">a year later</span>. <span class="org">San Nicolas Catholic Church</span> built in <span class="date">1701</span> is one of the oldest buildings in this province. Its original structure is one of the must see places of the town. The Church and the attached Sta. Rosa <span class="loc">Academy Building</span>, the well preserved Municipal Hall and the old Town Plaza sprawled between them constitute the heart of the town center. These buildings and structures are originally built and continue to be festooned with earthen bricks, which is among the products of the surviving local earthenware industry.</p><br><br>
