  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Woodlands is a village in the New Forest National Park of <span class="loc">Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The village lies 6 miles (9.7 km) west from <span class="loc">Southampton</span> and 2.75 miles (4.43 km) north-east from <span class="loc">Lyndhurst</span>. The village is in the civil parish of <span class="loc">Netley Marsh</span>. Before the 20th century Woodlands was a sparsely populated settlement. Two historic buildings are known as <span class="per">Goldenhayes</span> and <span class="per">Woodlands</span> Lodge Hotel. The latter was a hunting lodge dating from around <span class="date">1770</span> – it was converted to a hotel in <span class="date">the 1950s</span>. There was a pub here by the beginning of the 20th century known as the <span class="loc">Royal Oak</span> – it is <span class="date">now</span> known as the Gamekeeper. Woodlands experienced some growth following the arrival of <span class="per">Sir Richard Leys</span>, who was a major employer in <span class="date">the 1920s</span>. <span class="per">Sir Richard</span> had Woodlands House built in <span class="date">1905</span>. Many of the other Edwardian houses in Woodlands were due to him - Lampits house was his coach house where his chauffeur lived, and a house on the double bend near Busketts Lawn was his stables. More infilling of houses occurred in <span class="date">the 1920s and 30s</span>, and especially in the post World War II period with the building of many of the bungalows along the northern end of Woodlands Road.</p><br><br>
