  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Albany County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The population was 33,656 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is south of <span class="loc">Albany</span>. <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> includes the following hamlets: <span class="loc">Delmar</span>, <span class="loc">Elsmere</span>, <span class="loc">Slingerlands</span>, <span class="loc">Glenmont</span>, <span class="loc">Selkirk</span>, <span class="loc">South</span> and <span class="loc">North Bethlehem</span>. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 9W passes through the town. The town is named after the biblical <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>. When <span class="per">Henry Hudson</span> sailed up the river that would eventually bear his name, he is thought to have landed at what is <span class="date">now</span> the town of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>. The spot where he is presumed to have landed is commemorated at the town's <span class="per">Henry Hudson Park</span>. The town was established on <span class="date">March 12, 1793</span> from the town of <span class="loc">Watervliet</span>. In <span class="date">1832</span>, part of the town was used to form the town of <span class="loc">New Scotland</span>. The town's earliest growth took place in <span class="loc">Normansville</span> named for its location along the <span class="loc">Normans Kill</span>, a creek, which forms the town's border with <span class="loc">Albany</span>. <span class="loc">Normansville</span> still exists <span class="date">today</span>, though it is unnoticed by most living in <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> since it is accessible only by one downhill road (which has no outlet). In the mid-19th century the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> and <span class="per">Hudson</span> railroad initiated service into the hamlet then called <span class="loc">Adamsville</span>, renaming the hamlet <span class="loc">Delmar</span>. <span class="loc">Delmar</span> has become the most populous hamlet and its <span class="loc">Delaware</span> Avenue is the site of the present day town hall, police station, justice court, and public library, as well as numerous businesses. The railroad discontinued passenger service in <span class="date">the 1960s</span> and its tracks started being removed in the <span class="date">year 2000</span> with the last of the track removed in <span class="date">2005</span>. The town has continued to grow, and is <span class="date">today</span> considered to be an affluent suburb of the <span class="loc">city of Albany</span>.</p><br><br>
