    Simonyi, a software designer paying $35 million for his second trip on the Soyuz, joined Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka and American astronaut Michael Barratt in the cramped capsule, where they will sit for nearly two days before hooking up with the station, orbiting some 350 kilometers above the Earth.

    Also watching was Paul Allen, a co-founder of software giant Microsoft Corp., where Simonyi worked for many years.
