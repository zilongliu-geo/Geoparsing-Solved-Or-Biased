<p><span class="loc">Buenavista</span> is a second-class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Guimaras</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 46,703 people. The town acts as a cheaper link between <span class="loc">Panay</span> and <span class="loc">Negros</span>, as opposed to taking a ship directly between the two islands. <span class="loc">Buenavista</span> is located at the northern tip of <span class="loc">Guimaras Island</span>, and is one of the five towns comprising the <span class="loc">province of Guimaras</span>. The northern and north-west part of the town overlooks <span class="loc">Panay Island</span> and the north-east portion faces <span class="loc">Negros</span> Island. <span class="loc">Iloilo Strait</span> lies between the town and <span class="loc">Panay</span>, and <span class="loc">Guimaras Strait</span> lies between the town and <span class="loc">Negros</span>. The McArthur wharf serves as the municipal wharf for <span class="loc">Buenavista</span> and part of <span class="loc">San Lorenzo</span> is used by passengers from the neighboring <span class="loc">Panay Island</span> in going to <span class="loc">Negros Province</span> and vice versa. This transportation route serves as a cheaper link, rather than taking a ship. Buenavista's terrain ranges from plains (nearly level in the central and north-west coastal areas) to mountains (north-western part). The climate is mild and cool, due to its being bounded by the sea on the three directions.</p>
