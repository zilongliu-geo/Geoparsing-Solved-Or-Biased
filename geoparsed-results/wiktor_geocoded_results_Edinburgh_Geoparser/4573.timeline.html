  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Imi</span> (also transliterated as <span class="per">Imay</span> and <span class="per">Hinna</span>) is a town in the Somali Region of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. It is currently divided to two separate towns. <span class="loc">East Imi</span> located in Imiberi woreda of the Gode Zone and <span class="loc">West Imi</span> located in Mirab Imi woreda of the Afder Zone. The <span class="loc">Shebelle</span> River runs between these towns. It's located at latitude and longitude 6°28′N 42°10′E with an elevation of 442 meters above sea level. The Central Statistical Agency has not published an estimate for this village's <span class="date">2005</span> population. <span class="loc">Imi</span> hosts an airport (ICAO code <span class="loc">HAIM</span>) which consists of an unpaved airstrip about 1050 meters in length, possibly the shortest in an Ethiopian civil airport. Probably the earliest European explorer to visit <span class="loc">Imi</span> was <span class="per">Arthur Rimbaud</span>, who was working at the time as a commercial agent in <span class="loc">Harar</span> for the firm of Mazeran, <span class="per">Vinnay</span> and <span class="per">Barday</span>. In a report of his expeditions into the "Ogadine" (or <span class="loc">Ogaden</span>), dated <span class="date">10 December 1883</span>, <span class="per">Rimbaud</span> proposed setting up a trading post at <span class="loc">Imi</span>, "a large, permanent village situated on the Ogadine bank of the river, <span class="date">eight days</span> from <span class="loc">Harar</span> by caravan."</p><br><br>
