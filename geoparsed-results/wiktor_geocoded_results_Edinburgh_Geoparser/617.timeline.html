  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> is a barrio (neighbourhood or district) of <span class="loc">Montevideo</span>, <span class="loc">Uruguay</span> and part of the Capurro / <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> composite barrio, with Artigas Boulevard separating the two. <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> shares borders with <span class="loc">Capurro</span> to the north west, <span class="loc">Prado</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Reducto</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Aguada</span> and the Port of <span class="loc">Montevideo</span> (which belongs to the <span class="loc">Ciudad Vieja</span>) to the south, and it borders the Bay of <span class="loc">Montevideo</span> to the south west. The south part of <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> has also been known as <span class="loc">Arroyo Seco</span> (dry stream) from as early as <span class="date">1756</span>. The name is still used <span class="date">today</span>, though there are no precise limits that describe this area. Though there had been a few villas in this area before the 1840s, among which the residence of <span class="per">Joaquín Suárez</span>, it was Francisco Farías who started auctioning building lots of the area in <span class="date">1842</span>. At the time, <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> was famous for offering a most scenic view of the bay and the city, hence its name. In <span class="date">1869</span> the first train station was inaugurayed in the area, but in <span class="date">1873</span> the Estación Central <span class="loc">General Artigas</span> in <span class="loc">Aguada</span> took its place.</p><br><br>
