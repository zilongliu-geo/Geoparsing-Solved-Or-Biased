  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montebello</span> (Italian for beautiful mountain) is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located in the southwestern area of the <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Valley on 8.4 sq mi (22 km2) 8 mi (13 km) east of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. It is considered part of the <span class="org">Gateway</span> Cities, and is a member of the <span class="org">Gateway Cities Council of Governments</span>. In the early 20th century, <span class="loc">Montebello</span> was a well-known source for oil reserves. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 62,500. The estimated population as of <span class="date">July 1, 2013</span> was 63,495. Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the area known <span class="date">today</span> as <span class="loc">Montebello</span>, the land along the <span class="loc">Rio</span> <span class="loc">Hondo River</span> was populated by the Tongva (Gabrielino) portion of the Uto-Aztecan family of Native Americans. The Tongva occupied much of the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> basin and the southern <span class="loc">Channel Islands</span> - <span class="loc">Santa Catalina</span>, <span class="loc">San Nicolas</span>, <span class="loc">San Clemente</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Barbara</span>; when Spanish explorer <span class="per">Juan Rodrigues</span> <span class="loc">Cabrillo</span> arrived off the shores of <span class="loc">Santa Catalina</span> in <span class="date">1542</span>, he was met by the Tongva people. Because the language of the Tongva was different from the neighboring tribes it was called "Gabrielino" by the Spanish. As more non-natives arrived and settlements were established, illness and disease came with them. By <span class="date">1870</span>, the area had few remaining indigenous inhabitants as disease brought by the Europeans killed many of the Tongva.</p><br><br>
