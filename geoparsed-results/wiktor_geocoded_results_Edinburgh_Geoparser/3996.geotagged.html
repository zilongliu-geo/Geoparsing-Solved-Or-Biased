<p>Poling /pɒlɪŋ/ is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">Arun District</span> of <span class="loc">West Sussex</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, 2 miles (3.2 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Arundel</span> on a minor road south of the A27. About 25% of the parish is wooded foothill slopes of the <span class="loc">South Downs</span> which is the area north of the A27 here. The 2001 Census recorded 173 people lived in 75 households, of whom 96 were economically active. The small village has two Grade I Listed buildings: the Church of England parish church of <span class="loc">Saint Nicholas</span>, (in whose churchyard the cricketer Colin Cowdrey is buried), and some remains of St John's Priory (founded by the Knights Hospitallers) beside the main road. Many of the cottages are Grade II listed. Poling was an agricultural part of the Rape of <span class="loc">Bramber</span>, one of the traditional sub-divisions of <span class="loc">Sussex</span> and a former Norman barony. In the Anglo-Saxon era Poling, like most coastal villages, had outlying areas of land in the <span class="loc">Weald</span> (forest) within <span class="loc">Sussex</span> used for summer grazing and timber production. Thus Poling gave its name to Pallingham north of <span class="loc">Stopham</span> and Pallinghurst west of <span class="loc">Rudgwick</span>. Poling also had land north of <span class="loc">Petworth</span>, then known as "Palinga Schittas", mentioned in a charter of AD 953. in connection with the pannage of pigs to feed on acorns.</p>
