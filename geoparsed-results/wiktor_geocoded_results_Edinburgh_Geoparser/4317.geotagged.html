<p>Prospect is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. It lies along Oregon Route 62 on the <span class="loc">Rogue River</span>, in the <span class="loc">Rogue River</span> â€“ <span class="loc">Siskiyou National Forest</span>. Prospect began as a logging town; its first sawmill began operating in 1870. Prospect had a post office established in 1882 that was first named "Deskins" after the first postmaster. In 1888, there was a mill named Deskins Sawmill. The name of the community was changed to "Prospect" in 1889 because of plans made to run a railroad up the <span class="loc">Rogue River</span>, which would ostensibly improve the community's prospects. The Prospect Hotel, which opened in 1892, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. As of 2013, the population of the community was 650. On the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, Prospect holds the Mill Creek Memorial festival. It honors veterans with a parade, a flag retirement ceremony, live music and games for children. All the proceeds go to a fund to help veterans. In July Prospect hosts an airplane "fly-in" that helps support the Jackson County Search and Rescue, and in August a jamboree and timber carnival (a festival that includes lumberjack contests such as log rolling) are held.</p>
