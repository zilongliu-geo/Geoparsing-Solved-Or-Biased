<p>Paris Library to offer Illinois skills match workshop. The Paris Public Library will offer a workshop at 6:30 p.m. on March 31 for job seekers with little or no computer experience who wish to sign up for Illinois Skills Match. The free online service from the Illinois Department of Employment Security matches job seekers with suitable job openings in <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. Participants will use library computers to create an account. Setting up an Illinois Skills Match account is similar to completing a job application so plan to bring information about job skills, work history, and education. Call 463-3950 or visit the library to register; space is limited and registration is required. Paris Public Library is open Monday-Thursday 10-8, Friday 10-6, and Saturday 10-5.</p>
