<p>Stroke-blocking device shows promise, doctors say . <span class="loc">ORLANDO</span>, <span class="loc">Fla</span>. (AP) â€” A novel device to treat a common heart problem that can lead to stroke shows promise, according to a new study. The device, called the Watchman, targets a heartbeat problem called atrial fibrillation. The current standard treatment is the drug warfarin, but it requires frequent blood tests to get the dose right. A study presented Saturday at a cardiology conference in <span class="loc">Orlando</span>, <span class="loc">Fla.</span>, showed the Watchman was just as effective as the drug. However, the research showed there were safety risks with it, too.</p>
