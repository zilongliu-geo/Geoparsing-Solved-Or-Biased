  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Kingston is a Canadian city in Eastern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> located where the St. <span class="loc">Lawrence River</span> flows out of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span>, and at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Cataraqui</span> River (south end of the <span class="loc">Rideau Canal</span>). It is located midway between <span class="loc">Toronto</span> and <span class="loc">Montreal</span>. Growing European exploration in the 17th century and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade led to the founding of a French trading post known as Fort Frontenac in <span class="date">1673</span>. The fort became a focus for settlement. Kingston was named the first capital of the <span class="loc">Province of Canada</span> on <span class="date">February 10, 1841</span>. While its time as a political centre was short, Kingston has remained an important military installation. Kingston was the county seat of <span class="loc">Frontenac County</span> until <span class="date">1998</span>. Kingston is <span class="date">now</span> a separated municipality from the <span class="loc">County of Frontenac</span>. Kingston is nicknamed the "<span class="loc">Limestone City</span>" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone. Archaeological evidence suggests that Native peoples lived in the <span class="loc">Kingston region</span> as early as the Archaic Period (about 9,000–<span class="date">3,000 years ago</span>). <span class="org">Evidence</span> of Late Woodland Period (about <span class="date">1000</span>–500 AD) early Iroquois occupation also exists.</p><br><br>
