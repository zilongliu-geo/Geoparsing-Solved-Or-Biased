<p><span class="loc">San Antonio</span> is a large district in <span class="loc">Oakland</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, encompassing the land east of <span class="loc">Lake Merritt</span> to <span class="loc">Sausal Creek</span>. It is one of the most diverse areas of the city. It takes its name from <span class="loc">Rancho San Antonio</span>, the name of the land as granted to Luís María Peralta by the last Spanish governor of <span class="loc">California</span>. The settlement that became <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> began in 1851 when J.B. Larue purchased Peralta's land west of <span class="loc">San Antonio Creek</span>. The site was west of Clinton. Larue built a store and wharf and the community grew up around them. The <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="loc">Oakland</span> Railroad built a station at <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>. When the Central Pacific Railroad took over the line in 1870, the name was changed to Brooklyn. When the Southern Pacific Railroad took over the line in 1883, the name was changed to <span class="loc">East Oakland</span>. Clinton and <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> joined in 1856 to form a new town called Brooklyn named after the ship that had brought Mormon settlers to <span class="loc">California</span> in 1846. Brooklyn joined with nearby Lynn to incorporate in 1870 under the name Brooklyn. In 1872, Brooklyn voters approved their city's annexation by <span class="loc">Oakland</span>.</p>
