<p><span class="loc">Mbala</span> is <span class="loc">Zambia</span>â€™s most northerly large town and seat of <span class="loc">Mbala District</span>, occupying a strategic location close to the border with <span class="loc">Tanzania</span> and controlling the southern approaches to <span class="loc">Lake Tanganyika</span>, 40 km by road to the north-west, where the port of <span class="loc">Mpulungu</span> is located. It had a population of about 20,000 in 2006. Under the name <span class="loc">Abercorn</span>, <span class="loc">Mbala</span> was a key outpost in British colonial control of this part of south-central <span class="loc">Africa</span>. It is headquarters of an administrative district of the <span class="loc">Northern Province</span>. A number of archaeological sites in the area (such as at <span class="loc">Kalambo Falls</span>) provides a record of human activity in the <span class="loc">Mbala</span> area over the past 300,000 years. Before colonial times, <span class="loc">Mbala</span> was the village of Chief Zombe on the <span class="loc">Lucheche</span> River. It became the focus of British interest as a result of travels by the explorer <span class="loc">David Livingstone</span>, the first European to visit the area, in the 1860s. He was followed some years later by Verney Lovett Cameron who surveyed <span class="loc">Lake Tanganyika</span>. <span class="loc">Livingstone</span> inspired missionaries of the London Missionary Society to come in the 1880s to Niamkolo on the lake and <span class="loc">Fwambo</span> and <span class="loc">Kawimbe</span> on the plateau. These missions had links to the African Lakes Company which later set up in <span class="loc">Mbala</span> and <span class="loc">Mpulungu</span>. The area was ravaged by the slave trade during much of the 19th Century, and the African Lakes Company devoted some efforts to trying to stamp it out. This activity drew in the representative of the British Government in the region, Harry Johnston in <span class="loc">Nyasaland</span>, and decisions were taken to strengthen the imperial presence south of the lake and prevent other colonial powers establishing a foothold there.</p>
