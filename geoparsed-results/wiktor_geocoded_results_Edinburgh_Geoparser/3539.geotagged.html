<p><span class="loc">Wilmington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,253 at the 2010 census. The town is named after <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> is on the county's north border and is southwest of <span class="loc">Plattsburgh</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">Whiteface region</span> of the <span class="loc">Adirondack</span> Park. The town was first settled circa 1812. The town was formed in 1821 from the town of Jay. At that time the town was called "Dansville". In 1822, the name was changed, as suggested by a settler from <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, to "<span class="loc">Wilmington</span>" due to confusion with another "Dansville" in <span class="loc">New York</span>. In 1848, part of the town was partitioned off to form the town of St. Armand. At the beginning of the 20th century, the tourist industry began to develop in the town. "Santa's Workshop", one of the nation's first theme parks for children, is located near the community of <span class="loc">North Pole</span>. <span class="loc">Whiteface Mountain</span> (4,870 feet) was the site of alpine events for the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics.</p>
