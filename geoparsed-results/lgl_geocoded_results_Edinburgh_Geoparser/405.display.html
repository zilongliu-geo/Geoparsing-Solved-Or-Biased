In other incidents: More information has been released on the Wednesday arrest of a Paris woman for child abuse and neglect, as was originally reported in Thursday’s Post-Intelligencer. According to a report by PPD Patrolman Jamie James, Katrina L. Chappell, 24, of 1199 N. Poplar St., allegedly left her baby inside a vehicle at a Mineral Wells Avenue store for approximately 45 minutes while she was inside shopping. Witnesses said they noticed the baby in the vehicle when they went inside the store. They came out of the store 20 minutes later and the baby had not been moved. Chappell told police that she forgot the baby was with her. The windows had been up and the doors were unlocked, but the baby’s vital signs were all normal. Chappell was arrested with a bond of $2,500, and she was originally scheduled to appear Thursday in General Sessions Court. Money was stolen from a woman’s purse Thursday night or Friday morning as it sat inside an unlocked truck at her Clearview Drive home east of <span onClick="goto_name('Whitlock')" class="loc">Whitlock</span>. According to a report by <span onClick="goto_name('Henry County')" class="loc">Henry County</span> Sheriff’s Department Deputy Wayne Fuqua, dogs were heard barking at the residence Thursday night. When the residents awoke Friday, they found the purse on the ground outside with $150 in cash missing from it. Nothing else appeared to be missing. Approximately $100 in cash was stolen during a burglary of Ridgeway Funeral Home, 201 Dunlap St. in Paris, Thursday night or Friday morning. According to a report by <span onClick="goto_name('Whitaker')" class="loc">Whitaker</span>, money was taken from two different unlocked cash drawers inside the funeral home and two filing cabinets also had been opened. The theft occurred sometime between 9 p.m. Thursday and 8:30 a.m. Friday. There were no signs of forced entry and all doors and windows were locked. A Paris woman was arrested at her residence Friday night for filing a false report and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
