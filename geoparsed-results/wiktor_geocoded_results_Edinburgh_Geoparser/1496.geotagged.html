There were schools and churches there, too. In 1949 and 1969 modern highways rolled through cutting the heart from the town. What was left was a town with 'no services', only a rebulit IOOF building, a rebuilt town hall, the planing mill and <span class="loc">St Agnes</span> catholic Church, the school building plus a few houses. But the pulse of the community does not stop with the removal of its heart."</p>
