<p><span class="loc">Concordia</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Cloud County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located along the Republican River in the <span class="loc">Smoky Hills</span> region of the <span class="loc">Great Plains</span> in north-central <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 5,395. <span class="loc">Concordia</span> is home of the Cloud County Community College and the Nazareth Convent and Academy. <span class="loc">Concordia</span> holds the distinction of being elected the county seat before the town was created. The founder of the town, James M. Hagaman had created a complete layout of the town on paper including streets, blocks, courthouse, and parks. The name "<span class="loc">Concordia</span>" was chosen because a member of the early group of promoters ("Cap" <span class="loc">Snyder</span>) had once lived in <span class="loc">Concordia</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. December 1869 was the first election for the county seat with <span class="loc">Concordia</span>, <span class="loc">Clyde</span> and the now defunct town <span class="loc">Sibley</span>. Without a clear majority, a second election was held between <span class="loc">Concordia</span> and <span class="loc">Sibley</span> on January 4, 1870. <span class="loc">Concordia</span> was declared the winner over <span class="loc">Sibley</span> 165 votes to 129. It was over a year later when <span class="loc">Concordia</span> officially became a town when the Republican Land District Office opened on January 16, 1871. The <span class="loc">Concordia</span> Land Office continued until February 28, 1889 when it was consolidated with the land office in <span class="loc">Topeka</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>.</p>
