<p><span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is an eastern suburb of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, Western <span class="loc">Australia</span> in the local government areas of the City of Swan and the Shire of <span class="loc">Mundaring</span>. It is at the foot of the slopes of <span class="loc">Greenmount</span>, a landmark on the Darling Scarp that is noted in the earliest of travel journals of the early Swan <span class="loc">River Colony</span>. <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> has been dissected by the Roe Highway, railway, and substantial changes in the eastern parts of Midland. The Bellevue Primary School was closed and amalgamated with the Koongamia Primary School to form the new Clayton View Primary School slightly up the hill towards <span class="loc">Greenmount</span>. It was the location of the original offices of what became the Mundaring Shire Council. It was also the location of the Catholic Church that preceded the <span class="loc">St Anthony</span>'s church in <span class="loc">Greenmount</span>. <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is bounded by the <span class="loc">Helena River</span> to the south, Great Eastern Highway to the north and Military Road and Cowie Close to the west. The suburb is an even mix of residential, industrial and parkland (mainly along the <span class="loc">Helena River</span>). <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> has changed over the duration of its existence due to a number of factors - the extensive claypits of the early twentieth century (most having been since filled in),and the industrial locations adjacent to the railway lines.</p>
