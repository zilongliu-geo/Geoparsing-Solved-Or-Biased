<p><span class="loc">Derbent</span> (Russian: Дербе́нт; Persian: دربند‎‎; Azerbaijani: Dərbənd; Lezgian: Кьвевар; <span class="loc">Avar</span>: Дербенд), formerly romanized as <span class="loc">Derbend</span>, is a city in the Republic of <span class="loc">Dagestan</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Caspian Sea</span>, north of the Azerbaijani border. It is the southernmost city in <span class="loc">Russia</span>, and it is the second-most important <span class="loc">city of Dagestan</span>. Population: 119,200 (2010 Census); 101,031 (2002 Census); 78,371 (1989 Census). <span class="loc">Derbent</span> occupies the narrow gateway between the <span class="loc">Caspian Sea</span> and the <span class="loc">Caucasus Mountains</span> connecting the Eurasian steppes to the north and the Iranian Plateau to the south. Derbent claims to be the oldest city in <span class="loc">Russia</span> with historical documentation dating to the 8th century BCE. Due to its strategic location, over the course of history, the city changed ownership many times, particularly among the Persian, Arab, Mongol, Timurid, <span class="loc">Shirvan</span> and Iranian kingdoms. In the 19th century, the city permanently passed from Iranian into Russian hands by the 1813 Treaty of <span class="loc">Gulistan</span>. The city's name derives from the Persian <span class="loc">Darband</span> (دربند), meaning "locked gate", and it is often identified with the legendary Gates of Alexander. The Persian name for the city came into use at the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century CE, when the city was re-established by Kavadh I of the Sassanid dynasty of <span class="loc">Persia</span>, but <span class="loc">Derbent</span> was probably already in the Sasanian sphere of influence as a result of the victory over the Parthians and the conquest of Caucasian <span class="loc">Albania</span> by <span class="loc">Shapur</span> I, the first shah of the Sassanid Persians. Since antiquity, the value of the area as the gate to the Caucasus has been understood and exploited, and <span class="loc">Derbent</span> has archaeological structures over 5,000 years old. As a result of this geographic peculiarity, the city developed between two walls, stretching from the mountains to the sea. These fortifications were continuously employed for a millennium and a half, longer than any other extant fortress in the world. Over the years, different nations gave the city different names, all connected to the word gate, as in the Arabic Bab al-Abwab ("Gate of all Gates").</p>
