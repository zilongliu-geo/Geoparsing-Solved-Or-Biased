<p>Paloma, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> is an unincorporated community in Honey Creek Township, <span class="loc">Adams County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Its main auxiliary route is <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 24 and is within two miles of <span class="loc">Coatsburg</span>, another rural community. During the early 1900s the village was famous for its pickle production and was often nicknamed "Pickleville" because of the vast pickle farms. Paloma is part of the Quincy, IL–MO Micropolitan Statistical Area. Paloma is located at 40°1′22″N 91°11′43″W (40.022778°, -91.195278°). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) 62359 includes and surrounds the community. For the 62359 ZCTA in the 2000 census, which includes Paloma, there were 192 people, 76 households, and 63 families residing in the area. The community was once known as <span class="loc">Pickleville</span>. Local producers shipped pickles to Quincy off a rail platform about a mile west of the present Paloma. Daniel Gooding, an early settler, offered to build the railroad a depot and platform if it would move the Pickleville platform to the town he platted on his land. The railroad agreed, <span class="loc">Gooding</span> built the depot and a railroad conductor's wife was responsible for changing the name of the community, deciding <span class="loc">Pickleville</span> wasn't very fitting. She named it after a small tribe of Indians, the Paloma, a term which is also Spanish for dove.</p>
