  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Orange County</span> is a county located in the state of <span class="loc">Florida</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 1,145,956, making it the fifth-most populous county in <span class="loc">Florida</span>. The county seat is Orlando. <span class="loc">Orange County</span> is included in the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, <span class="loc">Florida Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The land that is <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was part of the first land to emerge from below the Early Oligocene sea 33.9â€“28.4 million <span class="date">years</span> ago and is known as <span class="loc">Orange Island</span>. <span class="loc">Orange County</span>'s Rock Spring location is a Pleistocene fossil bearing area and has yielded a vast variety of birds and mammals including giant sloth, mammoth, camel, and the dire wolf dating around 1.1 million <span class="date">years</span> ago. In <span class="date">1821</span>, there were two counties that formed <span class="loc">Florida</span>: Escambia to the west and <span class="loc">St. Johns</span> to the east. In <span class="date">1824</span>, the area to the south of St. <span class="loc">Johns County</span> became <span class="loc">Mosquito County</span>, and Enterprise was named the county seat. This massive county took up much of central <span class="loc">Florida</span>. <span class="loc">Mosquito County</span> was renamed <span class="loc">Orange County</span> in <span class="date">1845</span> when <span class="loc">Florida</span> became a state. Several counties, such as <span class="loc">Osceola</span>, <span class="loc">Seminole</span>, <span class="loc">Lake</span>, and <span class="loc">Volusia</span> were carved out of <span class="loc">Orange County</span>.</p><br><br>
