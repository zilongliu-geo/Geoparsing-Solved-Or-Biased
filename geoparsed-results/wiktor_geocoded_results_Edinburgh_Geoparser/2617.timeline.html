  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Luoyang</span> (IPA: [lwɔ̂jɑ̌ŋ]; Chinese: 洛阳), formerly romanised as <span class="loc">Loyang</span>, is a city located in the confluence area of <span class="loc">Luo River</span> and <span class="loc">Yellow River</span> in <span class="loc">Central China</span>. It is a prefecture-level city in <span class="loc">western Henan province</span>. It borders the provincial capital of <span class="loc">Zhengzhou</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Pingdingshan</span> to the southeast, <span class="loc">Nanyang</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Sanmenxia</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Jiyuan</span> to the north, and <span class="loc">Jiaozuo</span> to the northeast. As of the final <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="loc">Luoyang</span> had a population of 6,549,941 inhabitants with 1,857,003 people living in the built-up (or metro) area made of city's five urban districts, all of which except the <span class="loc">Jili District</span> not urbanized yet. Situated on the central plain of <span class="loc">China</span>, <span class="loc">Luoyang</span> is one of the cradles of Chinese civilization, and is one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of <span class="loc">China</span>. The name "Luoyang" originates from the city's location on the north or sunny ("yang") side of the <span class="loc">Luo</span> River. Since the river flows from west to east and the sun is to the south of the river, the sun always shines on the north side of the river. <span class="loc">Luoyang</span> has had several names over the <span class="date">centuries</span>, including "Luoyi" (洛邑) and "Luozhou (洛州)", though <span class="loc">Luoyang</span> has been its primary name. It has been called, during various periods, "Dongdu" (东都, meaning the <span class="org">Eastern Capital</span>, during the Tang Dynasty), "Xijing" (西京, meaning the <span class="org">Western Capital</span>, during the Song Dynasty), or "Jingluo" (京洛, meaning the general capital for <span class="loc">China</span>).</p><br><br>
