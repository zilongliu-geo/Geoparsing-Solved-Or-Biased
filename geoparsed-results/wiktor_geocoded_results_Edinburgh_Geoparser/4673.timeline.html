  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Warburton</span> is a town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 72 kilometres east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>'s central business district. Its local government area is the Shire of Yarra Ranges. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="per">Warburton</span> had a population of 2,171. The name "<span class="per">Warburton</span>" has been shared between two townships over the <span class="date">years</span>. The mining town of "Yankee Jim's Creek" was located on the gold-bearing slopes of Mount <span class="loc">Little Joe</span>, and was renamed "<span class="per">Warburton</span>" after the mining warden of the district, <span class="per">Charles Warburton</span> <span class="loc">Carr</span>. Gold depletion caused a declining population in the 1880s, so the town was renamed "<span class="per">Old Warburton</span>" and the town of "<span class="per">Upper Warburton</span>" on the banks on the <span class="loc">Yarra River</span> was renamed "<span class="per">Warburton</span>". The Post Office opened around <span class="date">1884</span>. Two earlier offices named <span class="per">Warburton</span> were renamed as Launching <span class="per">Place</span> and <span class="per">Hoddle</span>'s Creek. <span class="per">Warburton</span> was connected to <span class="loc">Lilydale</span> by a Victorian Railways branch line, which was closed in <span class="date">1965</span>. The railway path is <span class="date">now</span> used for the <span class="loc">Lilydale</span> to <span class="per">Warburton</span> Rail Trail, a rail trail used by pedestrians, cyclists, and horse-riders.</p><br><br>
