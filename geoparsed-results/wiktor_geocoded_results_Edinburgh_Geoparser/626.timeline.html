  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Belmont</span> is a village at the southern end of the town of <span class="loc">Sutton</span> in the <span class="loc">southwest London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Sutton</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is located off the A217 road and near to <span class="loc">Banstead Downs</span> in <span class="loc">Surrey</span>. It is a suburban development situated 10.8 miles (17.4 km) south-southwest of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. <span class="loc">Belmont</span> did not exist until the late 19th-century. <span class="loc">Belmont</span> railway station opened in <span class="date">May 1865</span> and was originally called 'California Station', named after the California Arms public house on the opposite side of Brighton Road which was built by <span class="per">John Gibbons</span> in approximately <span class="date">1858</span>. The station was renamed '<span class="loc">Belmont</span>' in <span class="date">1875</span>, and the name was attached to the village that emerged subsequently. The original pub was heavily damaged by German bombing in the Second World War. The new building, built on the site in <span class="date">1955</span>, was known as 'The <span class="loc">Belmont</span>', but in <span class="date">2014</span>, under new management, reverted to its original name of The 'California'. St. <span class="per">John</span>'s Church (C of E) stands in Queens Road, near the end of the small High Street ("Station Road").</p><br><br>
