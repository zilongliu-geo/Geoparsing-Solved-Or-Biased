  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Louisville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Pottawatomie County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 188. Founded in <span class="date">1857</span> by <span class="per">Robert Wilson</span>, <span class="loc">Louisville</span> was originally known as Rock Post. The area was once part of the Potawatomi Hunting grounds and a large majority of the settlers were either associated with the <span class="loc">Pottawatomie Indian Reservation</span> or commerce on the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trail. <span class="loc">Louisville</span> was named for <span class="per">Robert Wilson</span>'s son, <span class="per">Louis</span>, and for <span class="per">Louis Vieux</span>, a successful businessman in the area. The town was a contender for county seat of <span class="loc">Pottawatomie County</span> but lost to <span class="loc">St. George</span> in <span class="date">1861</span> and <span class="loc">Westmoreland</span> in <span class="date">1882</span>. On <span class="date">November 8, 1875</span>, <span class="loc">Louisville</span> was struck by an earthquake. In <span class="date">1882</span>, with the county seat in <span class="loc">Westmoreland</span> and the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific Railroad built through <span class="loc">Wamego</span>, the town's population swiftly declined. <span class="per">Louis Vieux</span> was a prominent citizen of <span class="loc">Louisville</span> who operated a trail crossing across the <span class="loc">Vermillion River</span>. He was born in <span class="date">1809</span> in <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> and was of Pottawatomie and French descent. <span class="per">Vieux</span> and his wife, Sha-Note, moved first to <span class="loc">Cedar Bluffs</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span> in <span class="date">1832</span> until moving to <span class="loc">Indianola</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> (northwest of <span class="loc">Topeka</span> along <span class="loc">Soldier Creek</span>) in <span class="date">1846</span>. Sha-Note died in <span class="date">1857</span> and <span class="per">Vieux</span> moved to the <span class="loc">Vermillion River</span> near present-day <span class="loc">Louisville</span>. <span class="per">Vieux</span> began his trail crossing business and worked as a caller for the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Government working the pay station in St. Mary's and he also served on the tribal council and made trips to <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span> on behalf of the Pottawatomies. <span class="per">Vieux</span> also signed the treaty that split the Pottawatomies into two separate tribes-the Prairie Band and Citizen Potawatomi Nation. <span class="per">Vieux</span> died in <span class="date">1872</span> and left behind a 200-page will leaving half the town of <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, all of <span class="loc">Belvue</span> and other personal property to his wife and children.</p><br><br>
