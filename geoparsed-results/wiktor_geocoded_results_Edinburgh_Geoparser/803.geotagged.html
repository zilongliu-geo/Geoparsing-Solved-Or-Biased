<p><span class="loc">Fortuna</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Divide County</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 22 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Fortuna</span> was founded in 1913 along a Soo Line Railroad branch line running between <span class="loc">Flaxton</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span> and <span class="loc">Whitetail</span>, Montana. The name comes from the Roman goddess of fortune and was chosen by railroad officials to note the settlers' expectations of prosperity with the arrival of the railroad. The city is located 6 miles from the Canadian border and is the northernmost <span class="loc">city on U.S. Route</span> 85 before it crosses into <span class="loc">Canada</span> at Port of <span class="loc">Oungre</span>, <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span>. <span class="loc">Fortuna</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span> has the latest sunset time on the summer solstice (June 23) in the contiguous, lower 48 States. The sun sets at 10:03 PM Central Daylight Time (CDT). This is due to Fortuna's location at the far western edge of the Central Time Zone. Although other communities in the lower 48 States are located farther north, none of them are located as far west in their respective time zones. Fortuna's westerly location in the time zone gives it the latest local time when the sun sets on the summer solstice.</p>
