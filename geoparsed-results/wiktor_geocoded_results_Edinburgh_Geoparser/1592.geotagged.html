<p><span class="loc">Newton</span> is the county seat and most populous city in <span class="loc">Jasper County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located 30 mi (48 km) miles <span class="loc">east of Des Moines</span>, <span class="loc">Newton</span>, is in Central <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 15,254. It is the home of <span class="loc">Iowa Speedway</span>, <span class="loc">Maytag Dairy Farms</span>, and the <span class="loc">Iowa Sculpture Festival</span>. <span class="loc">Newton</span> was founded in 1850 and incorporated as a city in 1857. In the late 19th century, <span class="loc">Newton</span>'s growth was fueled by the development of coal mines in the region. The first significant mine in the area was the Couch mine of the Jasper County Coal and Railway Company, opened in the 1870s. It was, for a while, the largest mine in the county, producing 70 tons per day. William Snooks opened a mine near <span class="loc">Newton</span> in 1886. In the early 20th century, large scale mining in the <span class="loc">Newton</span> area had declined, but there were still several mines in the area that were worked intermittently. In the 20th century, <span class="loc">Newton</span> was a manufacturing community, much of its growth derived from the washing machine industry. Its most distinctive landmark, the <span class="loc">Jasper County</span> Courthouse, was built in 1911.</p>
