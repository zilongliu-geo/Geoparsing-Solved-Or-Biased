  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Douglas</span> (officially known as <span class="org">the City of the Village</span> of <span class="per">Douglas</span>) is a city in <span class="loc">Allegan County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 1,232 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city is surrounded by Saugatuck Township and the <span class="loc">city of Saugatuck</span> is adjacent on the north. On <span class="date">December 13, 2004</span>, residents voted to adopt a charter changing the status of the village into a city form of government. Under Michigan law, cities are independent entities whereas villages are part of the township. The official name is <span class="org">City of the Village</span> of <span class="per">Douglas</span>. <span class="per">Douglas</span>, originally known as <span class="loc">Dudleyville</span>, was first settled in <span class="date">1851</span> as a lumber mill town. In <span class="date">1861</span>, residents changed the name to <span class="per">Douglas</span>. Reportedly the name was chosen to honor the American statesman <span class="per">Stephen A. Douglas</span>, but other reports indicate that a relative of the original owner of the land also suggested the name because he came from <span class="per">Douglas</span>, the capital of the <span class="loc">Isle of Man</span>. <span class="per">Douglas</span> was incorporated as a village in <span class="date">1870</span>. Area sawmills provided much of the lumber used to rebuild <span class="loc">Chicago</span> after the Great Chicago Fire of <span class="date">1871</span>. After most of the harvestable trees in the area were cleared by the lumber industry, the area became a center for growing and shipping fruit, especially peaches. Tourism and resorts also became an important part of the area economy.</p><br><br>
