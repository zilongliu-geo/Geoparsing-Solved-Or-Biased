  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The 34 British medical students who had been quarantined due to A(H1N1) flu virus in the Kenyan lakeside town of <span class="loc">Kisumu</span> were transported to the capital <span class="loc">city of Nairobi</span> amid tight police security on <span class="date">Sunday</span>. The students, who have completed their courses of Tamiflu, are expected to fly back to the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> <span class="date">Sunday</span>, ending their <span class="date">one week</span> ordeal in <span class="loc">East Africa</span>. The government's swift response to contain the disease has been impressive. The <span class="org">World Health Organisation</span>, which collects data on all laboratory confirmed cases of the flu put the number of visiting students who became infected at 12. The infection spread from their fellow medical student who was originally infected in <span class="loc">Nottingham</span> from his girlfriend there. Public Health and Sanitation Minister Beth Mugo reported that it was <span class="loc">Kenya</span>'s first case of A(H1N1). Test results of the primary school children who had come into contact with the students during their visit are awaited. In a further twist, eight more people are suspected to have the H1N1 virus in the north eastern town of <span class="loc">Garissa</span>. The eight are reported to have arrived in <span class="loc">Kenya</span> from the <span class="loc">UK</span>. If confirmed they will bring the total number of swine flu cases reported in <span class="loc">Kenya</span> to 20.</p><br><br>
