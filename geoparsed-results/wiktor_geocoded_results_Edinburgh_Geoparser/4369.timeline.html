  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Scranton</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Tooele County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located in <span class="loc">Barlow Canyon</span> near the <span class="loc">Juab County</span> line, it was a short-lived mining town. <span class="per">Scranton</span> has been uninhabited for nearly <span class="date">a century</span>, but some of its ruins have survived relatively intact. <span class="per">Scranton</span> was founded in <span class="date">1908</span> around the New Bullion Mine, a lead and zinc mine. It was part of the <span class="loc">North Tintic Mining District</span>, organized in <span class="date">1902</span> for the area's silver, lead, and zinc mines. The new town became the home of the <span class="org">Scranton Mining and Smelting Company</span>, the owners naming it after <span class="loc">Scranton</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, their home town. Some 90 miners lived in <span class="per">Scranton</span>, a few with families. The town included homes, a boarding house, general store/post office, and assay office. The large pocket of good ore at the New Bullion lasted only <span class="date">about two years</span>, and the town began to dwindle. Then in <span class="date">October 1914</span> a new company called the <span class="loc">South Scranton</span> was organized, and miners dug a long tunnel in search of other mineral resources. During World War <span class="per">I Scranton</span> produced tungsten, sending it by insured parcel post due to its scarcity. After the war the town quickly emptied.</p><br><br>
