  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Polk County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 75,403. The county seat is <span class="per">Dallas</span>. The county is named for <span class="per">James Knox</span> <span class="per">Polk</span>, the 11th president of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Polk County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Salem</span>, <span class="loc">OR</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Portland-Vancouver-Salem, OR-WA Combined Statistical Area. It is located in the <span class="loc">Willamette</span> Valley. The Oregon Provisional Legislature created <span class="loc">Polk County</span> from <span class="loc">Yamhill District</span> on <span class="date">December 22, 1845</span>, granting to it the entire southwestern portion of present day <span class="loc">Oregon</span> to the California border. County boundaries were periodically changed to reflect the creation of <span class="per">Benton</span> and <span class="per">Lincoln</span> counties. Many other counties were subsequently carved out of these as settlement spread towards the south, leaving <span class="loc">Polk County</span> many counties away from its former border with <span class="loc">California</span>. The first county seat was a settlement on the north side of <span class="loc">Rickreall Creek</span> named <span class="loc">Cynthian</span> (also known as <span class="per">Cynthia Ann</span>). In <span class="date">1852</span> city officials renamed <span class="loc">Cynthian</span> to <span class="per">Dallas</span> after Vice President <span class="per">George M. Dallas</span>, vice president (<span class="date">1845</span>-<span class="date">1849</span>) to <span class="per">James Polk</span>. During the 1880s and 1890s, there were a series of unsuccessful efforts to move the county seat to nearby Independence.</p><br><br>
