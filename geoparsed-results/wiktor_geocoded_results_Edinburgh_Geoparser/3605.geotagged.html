<p><span class="loc">Huntington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Emery County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,131 at the 2000 census. It is the largest town in <span class="loc">Emery County</span>. <span class="loc">Huntington</span> is named after <span class="loc">Huntington Creek</span>, and <span class="loc">Huntington Creek</span> was probably named for William, Oliver, and Dimick Huntington, brothers who led exploring parties into the region during the 1850s. The first settlers of European extraction in the area were four stockmen, <span class="loc">Leander</span> Lemmon, James McHadden, Bill Gentry, and Alfred Starr, who brought their herds to <span class="loc">Huntington Creek</span> in 1875. In the fall of 1877, in response to the same call from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that brought settlers to the other creeks in Castle Valley, a small group from <span class="loc">Fairview</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, under the leadership of Elias Cox, established a dugout colony on the banks of <span class="loc">Huntington Creek</span> and began digging irrigation canals. The colony grew from 126 in 1880 to 738 in 1890 and 1,293 in 1910. A majority of the early settlers came from <span class="loc">Sanpete</span> Valley, which by the late 1870s had outgrown its irrigable land, and many belonged to three or four interrelated kinship groups, making for an abundance of cousins in the community.</p>
