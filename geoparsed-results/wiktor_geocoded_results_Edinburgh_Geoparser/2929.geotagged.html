<p><span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Northumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,390 at the 2000 census. It is located 88 miles (141 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and 71 miles (114 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, in the Anthracite Coal Region. It is completely encompassed by <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> Township. Sawmill operator, Albert Bradford, gave <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> its name because of its elevation and beautiful setting in the mountains. He decided that it deserved a special name and named it after the holy mountain in <span class="loc">Israel</span>. <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> began as a logging town. Coal wasn't discovered until 1790 by Isaac Tomlinson. It took twenty-four years until the first shipment of anthracite was shipped from the borough. <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> Inn was opened in 1812 by Richard Yarnall and was strategically located on the Centre Turnpike (also known as the Reading-Sunbury Road or Old Reading Road) halfway between <span class="loc">Pottsville</span> and <span class="loc">Danville</span>. During the latter part of 1854 the <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="loc">Sunbury Railroad</span> was completed from <span class="loc">Shamokin</span> to Mt. <span class="loc">Carmel</span>, which led to the opening and development of a number of collieries in the region. During the same year, the <span class="loc">Locust Mountain</span> Coal and Iron Company commenced making extensive openings and improvements upon their valuable coal lands in the vicinity of Mt. <span class="loc">Carmel</span>, building breakers for two collieries - the <span class="loc">Coal Ridge</span> and <span class="loc">Locust Mountain</span> collieries. The township was erected in 1854, formed from part of Coal Township; by 1862 the borough was incorporated within the township.</p>
