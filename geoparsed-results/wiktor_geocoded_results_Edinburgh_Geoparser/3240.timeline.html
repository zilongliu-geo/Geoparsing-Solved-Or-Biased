  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Charlestown</span> is a suburb of the City of <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, and the largest town within the City. It is approximately 10 kilometres (6 mi) west-south-west of the central business <span class="loc">district of Newcastle</span>. <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> has the largest business centre within the <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span> city, with a greater turnover than that of the neighbouring Newcastle CBD. The suburb serves as the district's transport hub. Originally granted to the <span class="org">Waratah Coal Company</span>, the area was the site of the company's first shaft, sunk in <span class="date">1873</span>. Officially called <span class="loc">South Waratah</span>, the pit was variously known as <span class="per">Charles</span>' Pit, <span class="loc">Raspberry Gully</span> or The Gully Pit. These names all applied to <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> in its early <span class="date">days</span> and the surviving name seem to have been derived from that of <span class="per">Charles Smith</span>, the company's manager. The first settlers were miners from the pit. The company had the area surveyed on <span class="date">29 April 1876</span>; the first subdivision later became <span class="per">Ida Street</span>, <span class="loc">Pearson Street</span>, <span class="loc">Milson Street</span> and Frederick Streets. <span class="per">Harry Wright</span> bought the first lot when it was auctioned <span class="date">later in 1876</span>.</p><br><br>
