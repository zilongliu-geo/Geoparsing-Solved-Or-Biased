<p><span class="loc">Chatham</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Pittsylvania County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Pittsylvania County</span>. Chatham's population was 1,338 at the 2000 census. It is included in the <span class="loc">Danville</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Chatham</span> is home to Chatham High School, Hargrave Military Academy, and <span class="loc">Chatham Hall</span>, an all-female boarding high school. It is the home to the oldest continually used building in <span class="loc">Pittsylvania County</span>, once an 18th-century tavern, since turned into a house and now occupied by <span class="loc">Chatham Hall</span> faculty. <span class="loc">Chatham</span> is the county seat for <span class="loc">Pittsylvania County</span> and has held that status since 1777. There is a large U.S. Department of Agriculture office to support farmers in the area and a small branch office of the U.S. Forestry Service. The State of <span class="loc">Virginia</span> has built a new state prison at the site of an old work-release camp and this led to infrastructure upgrades in fire and water services to support the increased population. <span class="loc">Chatham</span> did not see any battle action during the Civil War although it is between <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, the capital of the Confederacy, and <span class="loc">Danville</span>, which contained Confederate prisons for captured Union soldiers. On Confederate Memorial Day each year, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy places flowers at the statue of a Confederate soldier which is prominent in the front of the historic <span class="loc">Pittsylvania County</span> <span class="loc">Court House</span>. There is a walking tour of this downtown historic district and a brochure for this is available at the Town Hall, or at the Historical Society building next to Town Hall. There are several bed &amp; breakfast establishments located on Main Street in historic Greek Revival homes.</p>
