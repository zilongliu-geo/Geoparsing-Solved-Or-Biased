  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gamboa</span> is a small town in the <span class="loc">Republic of Panama</span>. It was one of a handful of permanent Canal Zone townships, built to house employees of the <span class="loc">Panama Canal</span> and their dependents. The name <span class="loc">Gamboa</span> is the name of a tree of the quince family. <span class="loc">Gamboa</span> is located on a sharp bend of the <span class="loc">Chagres River</span> at the point which feeds Lake Gatun. Just south of <span class="loc">Gamboa</span>, Lake Gatun and the <span class="loc">Chagres</span> meet the <span class="loc">Culebra Cut</span> (<span class="loc">Gaillard Cut</span>) where the Canal cuts through the <span class="loc">Continental Divide</span>. Thus, though <span class="loc">Gamboa</span> is closer to the Pacific side of <span class="loc">Panama</span>, its watershed is on the Atlantic side. A single lane iron and wood bridge crosses the <span class="loc">Chagres</span> and is the only road access to <span class="loc">Gamboa</span>. This bridge is still in use <span class="date">today</span>. Vehicles waiting to pass over the bridge must wait for a stoplight to enter the bridge, since it is only capable of providing space for one lane of traffic at a time. In <span class="date">December 2010</span> this bridge was the site of massive flooding and huge floating islands passing under the bridge, with trees violently hitting it, which led to the temporary closure of the <span class="loc">Panama Canal</span>.</p><br><br>
