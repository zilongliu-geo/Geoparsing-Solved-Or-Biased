<p>Montevideo /ˌmɒntəˈvɪdi.oʊ/ is a city in <span class="loc">Chippewa County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,383 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Chippewa County</span>. During the 18th century, Europeans established a fur-trading post near the rivers and traded with Native Americans in the area. <span class="loc">Montevideo</span> was platted in 1870, and incorporated as a city in 1908. On the edge of <span class="loc">Montevideo</span>, along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 212, stands the Camp Release State Monument. The <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> River Valley and <span class="loc">Montevideo</span> played an integral part in the <span class="loc">United States</span> - Dakota Conflict of 1862. At this site in the fall of 1862, the Dakota combatants surrendered and released 269 captives to Colonel Henry Sibley. The Camp Release Monument was dedicated on July 4, 1894. In 2004, the city was honored with the presentation of the National Civic League's <span class="loc">All-America City</span> Award, which is given to only ten cities a year. The award is the oldest and most respected community recognition program in the nation and recognizes communities whose citizens work together to identify and tackle community-wide challenges and achieve uncommon results.</p>
