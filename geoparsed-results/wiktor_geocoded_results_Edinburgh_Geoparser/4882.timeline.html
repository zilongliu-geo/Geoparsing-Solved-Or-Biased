In <span class="date">2008</span> it had a population of 715, compared to a population of 960 in <span class="date">1998</span>. The area of the district is 33.4 km2. The large district (second only to <span class="loc">Blue Hill</span>) includes the settlement of Hutt's Gate, with its <span class="per">St Matthew</span>'s church. The district also contains the island's only existing golf course. The district contains <span class="loc">Prosperous Bay Plain</span>, which is where <span class="per">Saint Helena</span> Airport is being constructed.
