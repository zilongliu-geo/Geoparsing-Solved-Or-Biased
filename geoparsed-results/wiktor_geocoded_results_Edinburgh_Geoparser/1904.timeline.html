  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The <span class="loc">City of Lakewood</span> is a Home Rule Municipality which is the most populous municipality in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> is the fifth most populous city in the State of <span class="loc">Colorado</span> and the 172nd most populous city in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city population was 142,980 at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> is west of <span class="loc">Denver</span> and is part of the <span class="org">Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The urban/suburban development of the community known as <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> was begun in <span class="date">1889</span> by <span class="per">Charles Welch</span> and <span class="per">W.A.H. Loveland</span>, who platted a 13-block area along Colfax Avenue west of <span class="loc">Denver</span> in eastern <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>. <span class="per">Loveland</span>, the former president of the <span class="org">Colorado Central Railroad</span>, retired to the new community of <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> after <span class="date">many years</span> of living in Golden. Until <span class="date">1969</span>, the area known as <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> had no municipal government, relying instead on several water districts, several fire districts, and the government of <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>. <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> was a community with policing provided by the <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> Sheriff, several volunteer staffed fire districts, and some neighborhoods without street lights and sidewalks. However, the community had already existed for <span class="date">about 80 years</span>.</p><br><br>
