  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Montgomery</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hampden County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 838 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="per">Montgomery</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1767</span> and was officially incorporated in <span class="date">1780</span>. The town was named after General <span class="per">Richard Montgomery</span>, who died in the Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 15.2 square miles (39 km2), of which 15.1 square miles (39 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (0.86%) is water. <span class="per">Montgomery</span> is bordered by <span class="loc">Southampton</span> to the northeast, <span class="loc">Westfield</span> to the southeast, Russell to the southwest, and <span class="loc">Huntington</span> to the northwest. Its border with the towns of <span class="loc">Huntington</span> and <span class="loc">Southampton</span> make up a portion of the <span class="loc">Hampden-Hampshire county</span> border.
