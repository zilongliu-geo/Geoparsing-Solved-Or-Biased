<p><span class="loc">Mega</span> is a town in southern <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. Located between <span class="loc">Moyale</span> and <span class="loc">Yabelo</span> on the paved highway south to <span class="loc">Kenya</span>, in the Borena Zone of the <span class="loc">Oromia Region</span> (or kilil), this town has a latitude and longitude of 4°01′N 38°15′E with an elevation of 1740 meters above sea level. Named for a nearby mountain, this town is the administrative center of Dire woreda. This town is reported to have telephone service and a post office, as well as at least one primary and one secondary school, but no financial institutions. <span class="loc">Mega</span> came under Ethiopian control in 1897 when Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis built a fort was nearby. In the early part of the twentieth century, it was important as the residence for Sir Arnold Weinholt Hodson, British Consul for Southern <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span> between 1914-1923. The British manned the consulate at least as late as the 1950s. <span class="loc">Mega</span> was captured by the Italians on 25 June 1936, then occupied by a South African Brigade in February 1941 after prolonged fighting with the Italian garrison. During the Italian occupation, <span class="loc">Mega</span> became an important hub of communications for this part of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>, but when David Buxton passed through in the later 1940s after the Italians had been defeated, he found that "there is little traffic in these days, and <span class="loc">Mega</span> has almost reverted to the sleepy remoteness of pre-Italian times."</p>
