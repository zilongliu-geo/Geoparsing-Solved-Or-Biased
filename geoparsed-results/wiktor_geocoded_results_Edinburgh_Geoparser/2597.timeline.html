  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lota</span> is a city and commune located in the center of <span class="loc">Chile</span> on the Gulf of <span class="loc">Arauco</span>, in the <span class="loc">southern Concepción Province</span> of the <span class="loc">Biobío Region</span>, 39 kilometres south of Concepción, and is one of the ten cities(communes) that constitutes the <span class="loc">Concepción metropolitan</span> area. The first Spanish settlement, <span class="loc">Santa Maria de Guadalupe</span>, was founded by the governor Ángel de <span class="loc">Peredo</span> on <span class="date">October 12 1662</span> but it did not survive long amidst the hostilities of the <span class="org">Arauco War</span>. The modern city expanded with the coal mining industry in the mid-nineteenth century. It was established as a town on <span class="date">January 5, 1875</span> and became a city on <span class="date">November 30th 1881</span>. The name <span class="loc">Lota</span> is thought to be derived from the Mapudungun word <span class="loc">Louta</span> meaning small or insignificant settlement. The city's coal mines were nationalized by <span class="per">Salvador Allende</span> due to civil unrest and heavy Socialist support, but privatized again under <span class="per">Augusto Pinochet</span>. The mines were closed in <span class="date">the 1990s</span> after Lota's coal resources were nearly exhausted and cheaper Colombian coal arrived on the market, plunging the residents of <span class="loc">Lota</span> into poverty. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Lota</span> is one of the poorest cities in <span class="loc">Chile</span> and is trying to turn its economy towards tourism. Tourist attractions include guided visits to the coal mine, White Beach, the Park of <span class="loc">Lota</span> (created by the Cousiño family), and the Historical Museum of <span class="loc">Lota</span>. <span class="loc">Lota</span> also has <span class="loc">Chile</span>'s oldest hydroelectric power station, the Chivilingo Hydroelectric Plant, designed by <span class="loc">Thomas Edison</span> and built in <span class="date">1897</span>.</p><br><br>
