<p><span class="loc">Madang</span> (old German name: Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen) is the capital of <span class="loc">Madang Province</span> and is a town with a population of 27,420 (in 2005) on the north coast of <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span>. It was first settled by the Germans in the 19th century. <span class="loc">Madang</span> is the home of Divine Word University. The University accepts local and international students. Russian biologist Nicholai Miklukho-Maklai was probably the first European to visit the area. In 1871 he stayed at <span class="loc">Astrolabe Bay</span> just south of present-day <span class="loc">Madang</span> for 15 months. He had a good relationship with the local communities before leaving, suffering from malaria. In 1884 the German New Guinea Company arrived and tried to establish a base at various locations including at present day <span class="loc">Madang</span> but were continually beaten by malaria. They eventually moved to <span class="loc">Rabaul</span>. The Japanese invaded and captured <span class="loc">Madang</span> without a fight during World War II in 1942. In September 1943, Australian forces launched a sustained campaign to retake the <span class="loc">Finisterre Range</span> and <span class="loc">Madang</span>. The town was captured on April 24, 1944. During the occupation and fighting the town was virtually destroyed and had to be rebuilt afterwards.</p>
