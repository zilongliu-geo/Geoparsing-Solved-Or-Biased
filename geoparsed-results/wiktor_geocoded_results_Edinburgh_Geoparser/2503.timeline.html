It is designated as a major export production centre for the province, and is a port city connected by rail with <span class="loc">Shenyang</span> and <span class="loc">Sinuiju</span>. A significant amount of trade with <span class="loc">North Korea</span> flows through the city. The size of the administrative city (prefecture) is 14,981.4 square kilometres (5,784.4 sq mi). As of <span class="date">2010</span>, the built-up area made of 3 urban districts is 830 square kilometres (320 sq mi) in size and had 865,576 inhabitants. The administrative city contained approximately 2.45 million inhabitants as of the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The <span class="loc">Hushan</span> <span class="loc">Great Wall</span>, the far eastern end of the <span class="loc">Great Wall</span> of <span class="loc">China</span>, is located here.</p><br><br>
