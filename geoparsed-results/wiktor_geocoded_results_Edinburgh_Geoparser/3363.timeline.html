  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> is a hillside town in <span class="loc">Grafton County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,526 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is home to <span class="loc">Cushman</span> and <span class="loc">Strawberry Hill</span> state forests. The eastern half of the town is within the White Mountain National Forest. The Appalachian Trail crosses in the south. The main village of the town, where 972 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> census-designated place (CDP), and is located at the junction of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 302 with <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 142. The town also includes the villages of <span class="per">Maplewood</span> and <span class="per">Pierce</span> Bridge. Granted as <span class="per">Lloyd</span>'s Hills in <span class="date">1774</span> by Colonial Governor <span class="per">John Wentworth</span>, the town was named for <span class="per">James Lloyd</span> of <span class="loc">Boston</span>. It would be the last of the provincial grants in <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. In the aftermath of the Revolutionary War, the original grant could not be found. Lack of documentation would deter settlement until <span class="date">1787</span>, when the first permanent houses were built. Dropping its homage to <span class="per">Lloyd</span>, a Loyalist, the town would be incorporated as <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> on <span class="date">December 27, 1799</span>, the name selected on the <span class="date">last Christmas Day</span> of the century. There were just 33 families, with agriculture the only industry.</p><br><br>
