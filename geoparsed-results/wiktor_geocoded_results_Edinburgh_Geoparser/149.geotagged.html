<p><span class="loc">San Juan</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It is one of the cities that comprises <span class="loc">Metro Manila</span>, the National Capital Region of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It is the smallest city in the country in terms of land area. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 121,430. <span class="loc">San Juan</span> was the site of the first battle of the <span class="loc">Katipunan</span>, the organization which led the 1896 Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire. "<span class="loc">San Juan</span> City" is a contraction of the city's longer, ceremonial name of <span class="loc">San Juan del Monte</span> (English: "<span class="loc">Saint John</span> of the Mountain"). As with numerous other places in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, the city's name combines a patron saint and a toponym; in this case, the place is named for <span class="loc">Saint John</span> the <span class="loc">Baptist</span> and its hilly, relatively high elevation compared to surrounding areas. The city's official name is Dakilang Lungs√≥d ng <span class="loc">San Juan</span> (Tagalog, "Great City of <span class="loc">San Juan</span>"). <span class="loc">San Juan</span> is bounded by <span class="loc">Quezon City</span> on the north and east, <span class="loc">Mandaluyong</span> on the south, and the <span class="loc">City of Manila</span> in the west.</p>
