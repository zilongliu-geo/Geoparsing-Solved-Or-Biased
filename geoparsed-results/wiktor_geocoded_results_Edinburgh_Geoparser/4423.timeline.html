  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Juba /ˈdʒuːbə/ (Arabic: جوبا‎) is the capital and largest city of <span class="org">the Republic of South</span> <span class="loc">Sudan</span>. It also serves as the capital of Central Equatoria, one of the ten states of <span class="loc">South Sudan</span>. The city is situated on the <span class="loc">White Nile</span> and functions as the seat and metropolis of <span class="loc">Juba County</span>. In the 19th century, a trading post and a mission, called <span class="loc">Gondokoro</span>, was located in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Juba</span>. It was the southernmost outpost of the Egyptian garrison, supported by a handful of soldiers, mostly ill due to the malaria and blackwater fever that was dominant in the region. <span class="loc">Gondokoro</span> was also the base of the explorers and campaigners (Sir) <span class="per">Samuel</span> and <span class="per">Florence</span> Baker during their expeditions to what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">South Sudan</span> and northern <span class="loc">Uganda</span> from <span class="date">1863</span> to <span class="date">1865</span>, and from <span class="date">1871</span> to <span class="date">1873</span>. <span class="loc">Juba</span> itself was established in <span class="date">1922</span> as a small town by a number of Greek traders which were mostly supplying the British Army at the time. Although their number never exceeded 2,000 inhabitants, together with a much larger number of the native Bari tribe with whom they had an excellent relationship, the Greeks contributed in what is <span class="date">today</span> visible structures downtown Juba Market area as well as the Greek <span class="date">Quarters</span> (named by the British), a small suburb which <span class="date">today</span> is called Hai Jalaba. Examples of the development by the Greeks are public buildings such as the beautiful stone buildings of Ivory Bank, Notos Lounge, the old <span class="loc">Sudan</span> Airways Building, Paradise Hotel, <span class="org">Nile Commercial Bank and Buffalo Commercial Bank</span>, among others. The building of <span class="loc">Central Bank</span> was also built at a later stage in the <span class="date">mid '40s</span> as well as the famous Juba Hotel in the <span class="date">mid '30s</span>.</p><br><br>
