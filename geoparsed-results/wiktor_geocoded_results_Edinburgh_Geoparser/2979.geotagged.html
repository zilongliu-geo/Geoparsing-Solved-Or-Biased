<p><span class="loc">Wayne County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 30,099. The county seat is <span class="loc">Jesup</span>. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Jesup</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. Seventy years after General James Oglethorpe settled the colony of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and 27 years after that colony became one of the 13 original states, <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> came into being. It was created by an Act of the Legislature in 1803 after the Wilkinson Treaty was signed with the Creek Indians on January 16, 1802, which ceded part of the <span class="loc">Tallassee</span> Country and part of the lands within the forks of the <span class="loc">Oconee</span> and Ocmulgee Rivers to the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As originally laid out, the new county – the 28th <span class="loc">Georgia county</span> – was a long narrow strip of land approximately 100 miles (160 km) in length but with varying measures of width along the way. It was six miles (10 km) as it stood just south of the <span class="loc">Altamaha River</span>, eight miles (13 km) wide near the <span class="loc">Satilla</span> and five miles (8 km) wide at a location about 27 miles (43 km) south of the <span class="loc">Altamaha</span>. All counties organized prior to 1802 were headright counties – no surveys were ever made of those counties. It was found that under the headright system more land was given away than actually existed and this was the case for <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>. Although created in 1803, no valid lottery was done for the county until the Land Lottery Act of 1805. The 1805 Act divided the half million acres (2,000 km²) of <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, formed the <span class="loc">Tallassee</span> Strip, and set the stage for the land lottery that would result in more formal settlement of the area. It is the second date, December 7, 1805, that the county chose to observe as the creation date. The area was not a popular one for lottery draws as the straws were drawn sight unseen and the winner was as likely to draw swampland as he was prime agricultural lots. Being close to the coast and bordered by the <span class="loc">Altamaha River</span>, <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>'s history includes occupation by Spanish missionaries at the time of the settlement of <span class="loc">Saint Augustine</span> as well as short lived French occupation. The flags of <span class="loc">France</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, and the Confederate States of <span class="loc">America</span> all flew over Wayne with little success.</p>
