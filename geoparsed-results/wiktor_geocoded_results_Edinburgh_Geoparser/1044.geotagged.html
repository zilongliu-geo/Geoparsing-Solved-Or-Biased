<p>Marion is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Crittenden County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the seat of its county. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 3,039. The farm communities surrounding Marion are home to a large Amish population. The <span class="loc">Marion-Crittenden County</span> Airport is located west of the city. The city is named for Francis Marion, a brigadier general from <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> in the American Revolutionary War. Marion was founded in 1842 on land donated by Dr. John S. Gilliam. It was incorporated in 1844, and a post office was established in 1846. A railroad line from <span class="loc">Blackford</span> to <span class="loc">Princeton</span> was completed in 1887, and a depot was established at Marion. Originally owned by the Illinois Central Railroad, it has since been abandoned, which has enabled the construction of the Marion Rail Trail, a multi-use recreation trail. A one-room Rosenwald School opened in Marion in 1926 for African-American children. Graduates attended high school in neighboring <span class="loc">Caldwell County</span> until 1936, after which they attended high school in <span class="loc">Princeton</span>. Marion is located near the center of <span class="loc">Crittenden County</span> at 37°19′57″N 88°4′45″W (37.332505, -88.079051). <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 60 and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 641 intersect in the center of town. <span class="loc">US</span> 60 leads northeast 30 miles (48 km) to Morganfield and southwest 45 miles (72 km) to Paducah, while <span class="loc">US</span> 641 leads south 10 miles (16 km) to <span class="loc">Fredonia</span> and 20 miles (32 km) to the Western <span class="loc">Kentucky Parkway</span>.</p>
