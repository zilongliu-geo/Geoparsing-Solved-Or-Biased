  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Franklin</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Howard County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located along the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. Part of a rural area, the population was 95 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. As the eastern terminus of the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail, the community played a major role in the westward expansion of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town of <span class="per">Franklin</span> was founded in <span class="date">1816</span> and named for Founding Father <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>. <span class="per">William Becknell</span>, known as the "Father of the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail" lived on a farm a few miles northwest of <span class="per">Franklin</span>. There was a spring near <span class="per">Becknell</span>'s property, <span class="per">Boone</span> Lick Spring. The spring and its saline water were sufficient to attract people from <span class="per">St. Louis</span> and points east, who came to distill the water for its salt. They came so often that they created a trail, calling it the Boonslick Road. The <span class="loc">Boone</span> refers to <span class="per">Nathan</span> and <span class="per">Daniel</span> <span class="per">Morgan Boone</span>, sons of <span class="loc">Daniel Boone</span>; the brothers first operated the saltlick business. In <span class="date">1821</span>, <span class="per">William Becknell</span> put a notice in the "<span class="loc">Missouri</span> Intelligencer" stating he was creating a party to go "westward, for the purpose of trading for horses and mules and catching wild animals of every description." On <span class="date">September 1, 1821</span>, his party crossed the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River at <span class="org">Arrow</span> Rock and set out along what would become known in <span class="date">a few years</span> the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail.</p><br><br>
