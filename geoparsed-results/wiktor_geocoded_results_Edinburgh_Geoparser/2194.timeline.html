  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mau</span>, <span class="date">now</span> known as Maunath Bhanjan, is an industrial town in <span class="loc">Uttar Pradesh</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>, located nearly 120 km from <span class="loc">Varanasi</span> on the banks of <span class="loc">Tamsa</span> (Choti Saryu). It is a major centre of the textile weavers. It is divided into 4 tehsils, 9 blocks, 596 gram panchayats and 1644 villages. The Tamasa river flows through the city. In <span class="date">the 1960s</span> it was the biggest supplier of a plant called plash. This town is the headquarters of the <span class="loc">Mau district</span>. Many myths are popular regarding the history of <span class="loc">Mau district</span>. The word 'Mau' means 'padaav' or 'chhavani' in Turkish language i.e. barrack. The city was used as barracks by many rulers since long ago. Shershah Suri, <span class="loc">Akbar</span>, Aurangzeb are the prominent rulers who used the city in such a way. There is a mosque, built by Aurangzaib's sister <span class="per">Jahan Aara Beghum</span>, the shahi mosque attached with a number of barracks (can be seen still <span class="date">now</span>) in mohalla keyari tola. It is also believed by the People of <span class="loc">Mau</span> that <span class="date">centuries</span> before lived a man (a natt), a dancer named 'Muhoo Natt Bhajjan', who was cruel in nature. He always use to tease people the entire area therefore, a Holy man (Malik tahir baba, who was the chief of the area) asked him to leave that area, for the sake of his people, to which he replied negatively. Then the malik tahir baba challenged him to wrestle and win. If he wins, Malik tahir baba will leave the area else he himself will. After the wrestle the Malik tahir baba won. He asked the natt to leave the place at once. He agreed and kept his condition to leave. He asked the Malik tahir baba to keep the name of his area on his (Natt's) name. Malik tahir baba agreed and gave the name of his area 'Muhoo Natt Bhajjan'. This named was further modified to 'Maunath Bhanjan'.</p><br><br>
