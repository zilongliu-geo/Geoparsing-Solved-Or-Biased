<p><span class="loc">Thornton</span> (Scots: <span class="loc">Thorntoun</span>) is a village in Fife, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is between <span class="loc">Kirkcaldy</span> and <span class="loc">Glenrothes</span>, and stands between the <span class="loc">River Ore</span> and <span class="loc">Lochty Burn</span>, which are at opposite ends of the main street. The village has a small railway station, which is called <span class="loc">Glenrothes</span> with <span class="loc">Thornton</span>. Although situated at the south end of <span class="loc">Thornton</span>, it also serves the <span class="loc">Glenrothes</span> area. This rail halt was opened in May 1992, restoring a rail service to <span class="loc">Thornton</span> lost when its main line railway station closed in October 1969 as a consequence of the 1963 report by Dr Richard Beeching on the Reshaping of British Railways (the Beeching Report). The village is well served by local buses, operated by Stagecoach in Fife and running between <span class="loc">Kirkcaldy</span> and <span class="loc">Glenrothes</span>. However, express services between those towns bypass <span class="loc">Thornton</span>. During the first part of the 20th century, <span class="loc">Thornton</span> railway station was situated on the <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> to <span class="loc">London</span> main line to the east of the village, at the end of Station Road. To the west, alongside the <span class="loc">Dunfermline</span> line, was built the largest railway marshalling yard in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> during the 1950s. Though much reduced, this yard is still in use for rail freight services.</p>
