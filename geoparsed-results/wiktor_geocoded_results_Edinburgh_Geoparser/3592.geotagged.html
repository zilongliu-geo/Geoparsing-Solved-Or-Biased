<p><span class="loc">Goshen</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Lane County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located at the junction of Oregon Route 58, Oregon Route 99, and Interstate 5. In 1853, there was stagecoach stop at what is now <span class="loc">Goshen</span>, on the stage line that led from <span class="loc">Oregon City</span> to the gold country in <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span>. The <span class="loc">Goshen</span> area was settled in the 1870s. <span class="loc">Goshen</span> post office was established in September 1874, with John Handsaker as first postmaster. In the Bible, <span class="loc">Goshen</span> was the pastoral land in lower <span class="loc">Egypt</span> occupied by the Israelites before the Exodus. An author for the <span class="loc">Lane County</span> Historian wrote that <span class="loc">Goshen</span> was named by John Jacob Hampton, although <span class="loc">Oregon</span>: End of the Trail says that it was named by Elijah Bristow. Bristow saw the area as a "land of promise." The post office was discontinued in 1957, when it became an Independent Rural Station of Eugene. In 1884, <span class="loc">Goshen</span> was a station on the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and <span class="loc">California Railroad</span> (Later the <span class="loc">Siskiyou</span> Line of the Southern Pacific, and today the Central Oregon and Pacific), and the town had a store, blacksmith shop, and a school.</p>
