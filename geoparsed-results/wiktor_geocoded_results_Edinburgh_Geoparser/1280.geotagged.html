<p>Long Beach is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span> in Southern <span class="loc">California</span>, on the Pacific coast of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city is the 36th-largest city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> and the seventh-largest in <span class="loc">California</span>. As of 2010, its population was 462,257. In addition, Long Beach is the second largest city in the Greater Los Angeles Area (after <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>) and a principal city of the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> metropolitan area. The Port of Long Beach is the <span class="loc">United States</span>' second busiest container port and one of the world's largest shipping ports. The city also maintains a large oil industry with wells located both underground and offshore. Manufacturing sectors include those in aircraft, car parts, electronic and audiovisual equipment, and home furnishings. Downtown Long Beach is located approximately 22 miles (35 km) south of Downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, though the two cities border each other for several miles on Long Beach's southwestern portion. Long Beach borders <span class="loc">Orange County</span> on its southeast edge. Indigenous people have lived in coastal Southern <span class="loc">California</span> for over 10,000 years, during which several successive cultures inhabited the present-day area of Long Beach. By the time Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century, the dominant group were the Tongva people. They had at least three major settlements within the present-day city boundaries. Tevaaxa'anga was an inland settlement near the <span class="loc">Los Angeles River</span>, while Ahwaanga and Povuu'nga were coastal villages. Along with other Tongva villages, they were forced to relocate in the mid-19th century due to missionization, political change, and a drastic drop in population from exposure to European diseases.</p>
