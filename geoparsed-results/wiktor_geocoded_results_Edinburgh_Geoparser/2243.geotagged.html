From its origins as a stagecoach stop, it grew to a large suburb with a pedestrian-friendly downtown, free wi-fi, and a population of 74,066. The city borders <span class="loc">Palo Alto</span> and the <span class="loc">San Francisco Bay</span> to the north and <span class="loc">Los Altos</span> and <span class="loc">Moffett Federal Airfield</span> and <span class="loc">Sunnyvale</span> to the south.
