    The original village which eventually became known as Amherst, was established by pioneer settler Josiah Harris  (who relocated to this area about 1818), although the village began as "Plato" in the 1820s, and later was called "Amherstville", and subsequently "North Amherst", until finally just 'Amherst'.

    The village is often said to have had its beginnings as early as 1811, because land which was settled by pioneer Jacob Shupe, about a mile north of the original village site, was eventually (at a much later time) included into the Amherst city-limits.
