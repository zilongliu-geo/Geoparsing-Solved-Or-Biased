  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Canterbury</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windham County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5234 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The area was first settled in the 1680s as <span class="loc">Peagscomsuck</span>, consisting mainly of land north of <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, south of New <span class="loc">Roxbury</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>) and west of the <span class="loc">Quinebaug</span> River, <span class="loc">Peagscomsuck</span> Island and the <span class="loc">Plainfield</span> Settlement. In <span class="date">1703</span> it was officially separated from <span class="loc">Plainfield</span> and named The Town of <span class="loc">Canterbury</span>. In <span class="date">1832</span>, <span class="per">Prudence Crandall</span>, a schoolteacher raised as a <span class="loc">Quaker</span>, stirred controversy when she opened a school for black girls in town. The <span class="org">Connecticut General Assembly</span> passed the "<span class="loc">Black Law</span>" which prohibited the education of black children from out of state, but Crandall persisted in teaching, and was briefly jailed in <span class="date">1832</span>. Mobs forced the closure of the school in <span class="date">1834</span>, and Crandall married the <span class="per">Reverend Calvin Philco</span> that same year and moved to <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> repealed the <span class="loc">Black Law</span> in <span class="date">1838</span>, and later recognized Crandall with a small pension in <span class="date">1886</span>, <span class="date">four years</span> before her death. In <span class="date">1995</span>, the <span class="org">Connecticut General Assembly</span> designated <span class="per">Prudence Crandall</span> as the state's official heroine because she opened the first Academy for young black women. The school still stands in <span class="loc">Canterbury</span>, and currently serves as the <span class="per">Prudence Crandall</span> Museum and is a National Historic Landmark. In <span class="date">2009</span> a life-size bronze statue of <span class="per">Prudence Crandall</span> with one of her African American students was installed in the state capital.</p><br><br>
