  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Bellevue</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,191 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city lies along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River (Lock and Dam No. 12), next to <span class="per">Bellevue</span> State Park. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, along with <span class="loc">Jones</span> and <span class="loc">Linn Counties</span> were established in <span class="date">1837</span> and <span class="per">Bellevue</span> was the named the seat of justice for all three counties. When <span class="loc">Iowa</span> became a territory in <span class="date">1838</span>, the first census was taken and <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> had 881 people. The <span class="org">Bellevue War</span> of <span class="date">1840</span> gave the town an unsavory reputation and discouraged settlement in its aftermath. The population would double within <span class="date">two years</span>. In <span class="date">1838</span> the town of <span class="per">Andrew</span> was designated as the county seat. Between <span class="date">1848</span> and <span class="date">1876</span>, the struggle between <span class="per">Andrew</span> and <span class="per">Bellevue</span> for the county seat continued with the county seat being moved from one town to the other several times. As the county was settled, Maquoketa would become the dominant centrally located town when the railroad reached Maquoketa in <span class="date">1873</span>. The Town of Maquoketa then built a large city hall and offered to lease the building to <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> as a courthouse. The proposition was put to a vote and approved, and since then, Maquoketa has been the county seat.</p><br><br>
