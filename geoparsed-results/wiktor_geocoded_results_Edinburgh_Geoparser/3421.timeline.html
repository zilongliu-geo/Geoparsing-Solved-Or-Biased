Formerly known as <span class="loc">French Guinea</span> (French: Guinée française), the modern country is sometimes referred to as Guinea-Conakry in order to distinguish it from other parts of the wider region of the same name, such as <span class="loc">Guinea-Bissau</span> and <span class="loc">Equatorial Guinea</span>. <span class="loc">Guinea</span> has a population of 10.5 million and an area of 245,860 square kilometres (94,927 sq mi). <span class="loc">Guinea</span> is a republic. The president is directly elected by the people and is head of state and head of government. The unicameral <span class="org">Guinean National Assembly</span> is the legislative body of the country, and its members are also directly elected by the people. The judicial branch is led by the <span class="loc">Guinea</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span>, the highest and final court of appeal in the country. <span class="loc">Guinea</span> is a predominantly Islamic country, with Muslims representing 85 percent of the population. <span class="loc">Guinea</span>'s people belong to twenty-four ethnic groups.
