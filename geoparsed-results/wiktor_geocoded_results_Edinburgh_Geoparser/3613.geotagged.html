<p><span class="loc">Buin</span>, a town on <span class="loc">Bougainville Island</span>, and the capital of the <span class="loc">South Bougainville District</span>, in the Autonomous Region of <span class="loc">Bougainville</span>, in eastern <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span>. The island is in the northern <span class="loc">Solomon</span> Islands Archipelago of the <span class="loc">Melanesia region</span>, in the <span class="loc">South Pacific Ocean</span>. It is a government-established town in the jungle, now inland from the coast, where its sea landing predecessor of the same name was located. The town is in an autonomous region of <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span> established in 2000, and was the former <span class="loc">North Solomons Province</span> (1976-2000). <span class="loc">Buin</span> and <span class="loc">Bougainville Island</span> gained world attention with the 1942 Japanese invasion and subsequent Allied <span class="loc">Bougainville</span> Campaign in World War II. After the war, the present day town of <span class="loc">Buin</span> was established, inland to the north from its original location, which had been a minimal point of sea-landing on the coast. In the late 1960s <span class="loc">Buin</span> became a regional centre of government, commercial, and education activity. After Bougainville Copper Ltd. was established, it came to national prominence as the source of a large proportion of the country's financial base. The town was isolated from contact and commercial activity during the 1990s Bougainville Civil War. In 2000 it became within the Autonomous Region of <span class="loc">Bougainville</span> in <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span>, upon the Autonomous Region's establishment.</p>
