  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Socorro</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Socorro County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> Valley at an elevation of 4,579 feet (1,396 m). In <span class="date">2012</span> the population was 8,906. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Socorro County</span>. <span class="loc">Socorro</span> is located 74 miles (119 km) south of <span class="loc">Albuquerque</span> and 146 miles (235 km) north of <span class="loc">Las Cruces</span>. In <span class="date">June 1598</span>, <span class="per">Juan de Oñate</span> led a group of Spanish settlers through the <span class="per">Jornada del Muerto</span>, an inhospitable patch of desert that ends just south of the present-day <span class="loc">city of Socorro</span>. As the Spaniards emerged from the desert, Piro Indians of the pueblo of <span class="loc">Teypana</span> gave them food and water. Therefore, the Spaniards renamed this pueblo <span class="loc">Socorro</span>, which means "help" or "aid". Later, the name "Socorro" would be applied to the nearby Piro pueblo of Pilabó. Nuestra Señora de <span class="loc">Perpetuo Socorro</span>, the first Catholic mission in the area, was probably established c. <span class="date">1626</span>. <span class="per">Fray Agustín</span> de Vetancurt would later write that around 600 people lived in the area during this period. Mines in the Socorro mountains were opened by <span class="date">1626</span>.</p><br><br>
