  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Chico Sometimes called "<span class="loc">Old Chico</span>" to distinguish it from the nearby Chico Hot springs Resort. Chico is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Park County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population of Chico was 15 as of <span class="date">2010</span>. Chico currently shares a postal ZIP code 59027 with nearby Emigrant. <span class="loc">Old Chico</span> or Chico City was established as a town in <span class="date">1874</span> but had grown into a permanently populated community much earlier, making it one of <span class="loc">Montana</span>'s oldest surviving settlements. It is situated in the mouth of Emigrant Gulch, and sits at the foot of Mt. <span class="loc">Baldy</span>, which has an elevation of 3115 m / 10220 ft. The Chico post office was open from <span class="date">1874</span> until <span class="date">1919</span>. Gold was discovered in the Chico area in <span class="date">1863</span>. Mining in the Curry Mining District was begun in the <span class="date">spring of 1894</span>. During this period, miners working in the area lived in a settlement called <span class="loc">Yellowstone City</span>. Due to harassment by Crow Indians, <span class="loc">Yellowstone City</span> was abandoned by <span class="date">1865</span>. After <span class="loc">Yellowstone City</span>'s demise, a new settlement was built at Chico. The Chico townsite was closer to Emigrant Gulch and the mining activity. Chico's population in <span class="date">1874</span> was 300. Eventually a school, general store and two boarding houses were built at the site. The town never had a saloon. As the threat from the Crow abated, houses were built further up Emigrant Gulch and closer to the mines. The St. Julian Mine was opened in <span class="date">1887</span>. Ore from the St. Julian assayed out at $360 in gold and $40 in silver per ton of ore. A ten stamp mill was built in the late 1890s and a 12 stamp mill in <span class="date">1904</span>. The <span class="date">1904</span> mill also had a Blake Crusher and 6 Frue Venners.</p><br><br>
