  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dundee</span> /ˈdʌndiː/ is a city in <span class="loc">Yamhill County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,162 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The first post office in the area was Ekins, established in <span class="date">1881</span>. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> is named in honor of the birthplace of <span class="per">William Reid</span>, <span class="loc">Dundee</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. <span class="per">Reid</span> came to <span class="loc">Oregon</span> in <span class="date">1874</span> to establish the Oregonian Railway, and made several extensions to the railroad in the western <span class="loc">Willamette Valley</span>. The Ekins post office was closed in <span class="date">1885</span> and a new office opened in <span class="date">1887</span>, named "<span class="loc">Dundee</span> Junction". The name derived from plans to build a bridge across the <span class="loc">Willamette River</span> for the railroad, which would have called for a junction at <span class="loc">Dundee</span> between the west railroad and the new east railroad. The bridge was never built, however, and the post office was renamed "<span class="loc">Dundee</span>" in <span class="date">1897</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.35 square miles (3.50 km2), of which, 1.33 square miles (3.44 km2) is land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) is water.</p><br><br>
