  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="date">Passover</span> traditions spread through market. The hauntingly joyous strains of klezmer music from the Ortner-Roberts Duo filled the <span class="per">Shadyside</span> Giant Eagle Market District <span class="date">yesterday afternoon</span>, guiding Jewish shoppers to an area where they could get all of their <span class="date">Passover</span> questions answered, pick up recipes and a free box of matzo. Volunteers in "Got matzah?" T-shirts handed children bags containing kits to make a colorful matzo covers for the <span class="date">Passover</span> Seder meal, and games such as a Hebrew word search. <span class="per">Allison Grodin</span> of Squirrel Hill brought her four young children because she wanted them to get excited about the upcoming holiday. Her eldest, Harrison, 8, held a paper plate with four small cups containing symbolic foods. "It's a seder plate. I think this is neat," he said, pointing out the haroset -- a sweet mixture of nuts and fruit -- bitter herbs, greens and matzo. Eighteen Jewish organizations partnered with Giant Eagle at the Market Districts in <span class="per">Shadyside</span> and <span class="per">Bethel</span> Park for the third annual <span class="date">Passover</span> in the Aisles. The eight-day holiday begins at sundown <span class="date">April 8</span>. Jewish families will share a ritual meal that tells the story of the ancient Israelites' flight from slavery in <span class="loc">Egypt</span>. One of the most important rules is that, because the Israelites had no time to allow bread to rise, only unleavened bread -- matzo -- may be eaten during <span class="date">Passover</span>. To ensure this, Jews traditionally rid their homes of anything containing yeast or other ingredients that rise when cooked. Beer, pasta and beans are all out. Rabbi <span class="per">Sharyn Henry</span>, associate rabbi at <span class="loc">Rodef Shalom Congregation</span> in <span class="loc">Oakland</span>, fielded a question about whether soy sauce is kosher for <span class="date">Passover</span>. It's not, "because soy sauce has wheat in it," she said. The Reform rabbi stood near an "Ask the Rabbi" sign, along with rabbis from other traditions. Orthodox Rabbi <span class="per">Daniel Wasserman</span> of Shaare Torah Congregation, Squirrel Hill, said that people often stop him in the supermarket to ask questions about what's kosher, especially at <span class="date">Passover</span>. "People get very nervous, and rightly so, because everything is different," he said. While correct observance is important, so is fun, he said. The Seder, which includes games such as hiding a piece of matzo, is intended to interest adults and children alike. "At our seder there are very deep, intellectual discussions, but we also throw marshmallows to represent the plague of hail," he said, referring to one of 10 plagues that the Bible says God brought on the Egyptians. <span class="date">Passover</span> in the Aisles began <span class="date">three years ago</span> as an outreach to Jews who weren't involved with Jewish communal life. But it has other benefits, said <span class="per">Jeff Finkelstein</span>, president and CEO of the United Jewish Federation, which initiated the project. "It shows pride in being Jewish that we do something like this publicly," he said. "And it brings together a wide variety of Jewish organizations. Some of the participants have very different beliefs than others, but they have all come together for this as a community. This is a way of showing that we have more in common than not in common." Rabbi Mordy Rudolph of Chabad-Shadyside belongs to a movement that is highly traditional, but he enjoys working alongside Reform rabbis. "There are very few cities where the entire Jewish community can come together like this," he said. As he spoke, chefs in the Market District kitchen demonstrated <span class="date">Passover</span> recipes. Tammy Berkowitz, owner of <span class="per">Sweet Tammy</span>'s kosher bakery in Squirrel Hill, prepared coconut macaroons, a <span class="date">Passover</span> favorite. Although her bakery also makes a flourless chocolate cake, it closes for the eight-day holiday because she has no way to remove every trace of flour, yeast and other forbidden foods. Her macaroons are dipped in <span class="date">Passover</span> chocolate, which contains no corn products because "corn grows when you cook it," she said. <span class="per">Clarice Horne</span> of <span class="per">Shadyside</span>, has favorite <span class="date">Passover</span> recipes that she has used for <span class="date">decades</span>, including a matzo kugel -- a sweet casserole-like dish that is ordinarily made with noodles. "But you can always try something new," she said as she picked up a free recipe booklet. "It's fun to cook for <span class="date">Passover</span>." Irv Younger, center, of Or L'Simcha, and <span class="per">Joe Jolson</span>, right, of Beth Shalom Congregation, restock free matzo samples as fast as shoppers snapped them up at the Giant Eagle Market District store <span class="date">yesterday</span> in <span class="per">Shadyside</span>.</p><br><br>
