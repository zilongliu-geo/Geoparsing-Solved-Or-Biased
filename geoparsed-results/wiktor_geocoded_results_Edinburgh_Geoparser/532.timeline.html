  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alexandria is a borough in <span class="loc">Huntingdon County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 346 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The <span class="date">year 1744</span> is the first record of <span class="per">John Hart</span>’s “logg”, near where Alexandria is located <span class="date">now</span>. During the land purchase of <span class="date">1755</span> <span class="per">James Sterrat</span> of <span class="loc">Carlisle</span> purchased 400 acres including the sleeping place called <span class="per">John Hart</span>’s log on the <span class="loc">Juniata River</span>, which is <span class="date">now</span> Alexandria. Some time in the <span class="date">years</span> before <span class="date">1785</span> the first mention of a religious group called Hartslog Presbyterian Congregation was formed. A log worship house, Old Hartslog Church, stood upon the hill one mile (1.6 km) north of the present site of the town of Alexandria, where a burial ground was later made. This was a primitive structure but by <span class="date">1787</span> a floor was laid, six large windows set in, a large door constructed, and a pulpit and a communion table made. In <span class="date">1794</span> it was laid off into four sections, and fitted with pews. In <span class="date">1826</span>, the old Hartslog congregation moved to a brick building, referred to by Senator <span class="per">John Scott</span> in his memoirs as the "Brick Church", which seems to have been located near to the site of the present Reformed Church. The old log worship house was taken down the same year, and some of its logs were used in one or two of the dwellings of Alexandria.</p><br><br>
