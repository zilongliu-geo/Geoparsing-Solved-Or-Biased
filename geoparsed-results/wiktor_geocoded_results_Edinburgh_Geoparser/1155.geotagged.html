<p><span class="loc">Ceres</span> is a locality of Geelong, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. As one of the highest points in <span class="loc">Geelong</span>, <span class="loc">Ceres</span> has a lookout which overlooks the city. In the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Ceres</span> had a population of 201 people. The <span class="loc">Ceres</span> area was first settled by squatters in the late 1830s, and the lots of the <span class="loc">Barrabool Parish</span> were advertised in 1839, with the land being sold on 5 February 1840. There was reportedly "plenty of competition" for the <span class="loc">Barrabool</span> Hills lands, and the area became part of "Roslin", owned by David Fisher. The government had not provided for a settlement in the <span class="loc">Barrabool Parish</span>, and Fisher, after selling much of his estate in 1846, advertised a section of the remainder for sale as the new village of <span class="loc">Ceres</span> in March 1850. The town is presumably named after the Roman goddess of agriculture or less likely the dwarf planet. The first business to open in <span class="loc">Ceres</span> was the Wheat Sheaf Inn in September 1850, which became a social centre for much of the <span class="loc">Barrabool district</span>. A second hotel, the <span class="loc">Rising Sun</span>, opened in 1853. The Post Office opened on 14 February 1856. In 1856, the village was reported to have the Seidel Bros. vineyard, a blacksmith's forge and quarrier, a physician, a store, a shoemaker, a post office, a butcher, a surgeon, the two hotels, and a second forge. Coal was first discovered at <span class="loc">Ceres</span> in 1842, and a shaft sunk in 1854, but despite much excitement economical quantities were never found. A meeting at <span class="loc">Ceres</span> on 10 November 1855 agreed to build a cemetery, which subsequently opened as the <span class="loc">Barrabool</span> Hills Cemetery (now Highton Cemetery) in modern <span class="loc">Highton</span>.</p>
