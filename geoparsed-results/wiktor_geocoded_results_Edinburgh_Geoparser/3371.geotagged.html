<p>Berkeley (/ˈbɜːrkliː/ BURK-lee) is a city on the east shore of <span class="loc">San Francisco Bay</span> in <span class="loc">northern Alameda County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It is named after the 18th-century Anglo-Irish bishop and philosopher George Berkeley. It borders the <span class="loc">cities of Oakland and Emeryville</span> to the south and the <span class="loc">city of Albany</span> and unincorporated community of <span class="loc">Kensington</span> to the north. Its eastern border with Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span> generally follows the ridge of the <span class="loc">Berkeley Hills</span>. Its population at the 2010 census was 112,580. Berkeley is the site of the oldest campus in the University of California system – the University of California, Berkeley – of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory which is managed and operated by the university, and the Graduate Theological Union. It is one of the most politically liberal cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The site of today's <span class="loc">City of Berkeley</span> was the territory of the Chochenyo/Huchiun band of the Ohlone people when the first Europeans arrived. Evidence of their existence in the area include pits in rock formations, which they used to grind acorns, and a shellmound, now mostly leveled and covered up, along the shoreline of <span class="loc">San Francisco Bay</span> at the mouth of <span class="loc">Strawberry Creek</span>. Other artifacts were discovered in the 1950s in the downtown area during remodeling of a commercial building, near the upper course of the creek.</p>
