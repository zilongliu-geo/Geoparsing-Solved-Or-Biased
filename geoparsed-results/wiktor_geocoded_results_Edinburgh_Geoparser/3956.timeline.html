  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is an urban community in the <span class="loc">Rocky Mountains</span> within the Municipality of <span class="loc">Crowsnest Pass</span> in southwest <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It was formerly incorporated as a village prior to <span class="date">1979</span> when it amalgamated with four other municipalities to form <span class="loc">Crowsnest Pass</span>. Unlike some of the other communities in <span class="loc">Crowsnest Pass</span>, which relied on a single coal mine, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> benefitted from the proximity of several successful mines and, despite setbacks from fire, strikes, mine accidents and fluctuations in the coal market, persisted as a successful community to the present day. <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> was founded in <span class="date">1905</span> on the flat land above the Bellevue Mine operated by the French-based West Canadian Collieries (WCC). Its post office opened in <span class="date">1907</span>. The naming of the town is credited to <span class="per">Elsie Fleutot</span>, the young daughter of one of WCC’s French principals, <span class="loc">Jules</span> <span class="per">J. Fleutot</span>, after she exclaimed “Quelle belle vue!” (What a beautiful view!). In <span class="date">1909</span> the <span class="loc">Maple Leaf</span> Coal Company commenced operations at the Mohawk Bituminous Mine and constructed the settlement of <span class="loc">Maple Leaf</span> adjacent to <span class="loc">Bellevue</span>. In <span class="date">1913</span> WCC transferred many workers to <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> from its closed Lille operations. WCC displayed a five-ton coal boulder at the <span class="date">1910</span> Dominion Exhibition in <span class="loc">Calgary</span>.</p><br><br>
