<p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> is the third largest city in the state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Greene County</span>. According to the 2010 census data, the population was 159,498, an increase of 5.2% since the 2000 census. It is one of the two principal cities of the <span class="loc">Springfield-Branson Metropolitan</span> Area, which has a population of 537,631 and includes the <span class="loc">counties of Christian</span>, Dallas, <span class="loc">Greene</span>, <span class="loc">Polk</span>, <span class="loc">Webster</span>, <span class="loc">Stone</span> and <span class="loc">Taney</span>. Springfield's nickname is the "<span class="loc">Queen City</span> of the <span class="loc">Ozarks</span>" and is known as the "Birthplace of Route 66". It is also home of several universities including Missouri State University, Drury University, and Evangel University. The territory known as <span class="loc">Missouri</span> was included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Soon after, the Delaware Native Americans received treaty land where Springfieldâ€™s <span class="loc">Sequiota</span> Park and the antique stores of its <span class="loc">Galloway</span> Village stand today. To the west, 500 Kickapoo Native Americans built wickiups on the prairie that still bears their name. <span class="loc">Missouri</span> became a state on August 10, 1821, and in 1833 the legislature designated most of the southern portion a single county. It was named for American Revolutionary War General Nathanael Greene, largely through a campaign by Springfield's founder, John Polk Campbell, to honor a man he admired. A Tennessee homesteader, Campbell announced his claim in 1829. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> was officially founded in 1830 and later incorporated in 1838.</p>
