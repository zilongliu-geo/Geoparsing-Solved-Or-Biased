The population was 1,191 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The name is derived from early land owner <span class="per">Abijah Hammond</span>. The Town of <span class="per">Hammond</span> is in the northwest corner of St. <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>. The Village of <span class="per">Hammond</span> lies approximately centrally within the town. The Town of <span class="per">Hammond</span> was formed in <span class="date">1827</span> when portions of the Town of <span class="loc">Morristown</span> and the Town of <span class="loc">Rossie</span> were combined. Subsequent small alterations in the town lines affected the neighboring Towns of <span class="loc">Rossie</span>, <span class="loc">Macomb</span>, and <span class="loc">Morristown</span>. <span class="per">Alexander Macomb</span> bought land in this area and this was known as the <span class="per">Macomb</span> purchase. Later this land was bought by <span class="per">Abijah Hammond</span>, a <span class="loc">New York</span> Businessman, he in turn sold 28,871 acres (116.84 km2) of land to <span class="loc">David Parish</span>. A land office was opened in <span class="date">1814</span> in <span class="loc">Chippewa Bay</span>, a sub-community of the Town of <span class="per">Hammond</span> <span class="date">today</span>. By an <span class="org">Act of New</span> York State Legislature they passed that <span class="per">Hammond</span> was officially a town, this happened on <span class="date">March 30, 1827</span>. The town was named after <span class="per">Abijah Hammond</span>. <span class="per">Hammond</span> is older than <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and at one point was larger but due to location <span class="per">Hammond</span> lost its population.</p><br><br>
