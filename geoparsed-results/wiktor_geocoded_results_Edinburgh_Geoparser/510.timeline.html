  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Jackson</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Breathitt County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the seat of its county. The population was 2,231 according to the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census. It was the home of the <span class="org">Jackson Academy</span>, which became Lees College. Upon the creation of <span class="loc">Breathitt County</span> in <span class="date">1839</span>, local landowner <span class="per">Simon Cockrell</span> Sr. donated 10 acres (4.0 ha) to serve as its seat of government. The community was originally known as Breathitt, Breathitt Town, or Breathitt <span class="loc">Court House</span> after the county, but upon its incorporation as a city by the state legislature in <span class="date">1843</span>, it was renamed <span class="per">Jackson</span> to honor the recently deceased former president <span class="per">Andrew Jackson</span>. Local feuds led the national press to publish stories about <span class="per">Jackson</span> and "Bloody Breathitt": state troops were dispatched twice in the 1870s and again in <span class="date">1903</span> – after the assassination of a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> commissioner – to restore order. The <span class="org">Kentucky Union Railroad</span> reached the city in <span class="date">1891</span>, and <span class="per">Jackson</span> boomed until the L&amp;N continued the line on to Hazard in <span class="date">1912</span>. A fire on <span class="date">Halloween, 1913</span>, burned down much of the town.</p><br><br>
