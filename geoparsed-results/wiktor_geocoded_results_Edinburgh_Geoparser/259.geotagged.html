<p><span class="loc">San Marcos</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">North County</span> region of <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city's population was 83,781. It is the site of California State University, <span class="loc">San Marcos</span>. The city is bordered by <span class="loc">Escondido</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Encinitas</span> to the southwest, <span class="loc">Carlsbad</span> to the west, and Vista to the northeast. According to historical legends, the San Luis Rey Mission flocks were robbed by a small band of Native Americans in the late 18th century. Fleeing the Spanish troops, the Native Americans escaped to the hills. While pursuing the Native Americans, in 1797 the Spaniards came upon a fertile valley, which was named <span class="loc">Los Vallecitos</span> de <span class="loc">San Marcos</span> (<span class="loc">Little Valleys</span> of <span class="loc">Saint Mark</span>) to honor the day of discovery: April 25, St. Mark’s Day. On April 22, 1840, Governor Juan B. Alvarado granted Rancho Vallecitos de <span class="loc">San Marcos</span> to his relative, Jose María Alvarado. Jose Alvarado was killed at the Pauma Massacre in 1846, and the land was left to his wife; she then sold the land to Lorenzo Soto. In the late 1850s, Soto sold part of his land to Cave Couts, and his family was soon raising livestock. Although Cave Couts owned the land, Major Gustavus French <span class="loc">Merriam</span> from <span class="loc">Topeka</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, made the first permanent settlement. <span class="loc">Merriam</span> homesteaded 160 acres (0.65 km2) in the north Twin Oaks Valley and began wine and honey production.</p>
