<p><span class="loc">White River</span> (Afrikaans: <span class="loc">Witrivier</span>) is a small holiday and farming town situated just north of <span class="loc">Nelspruit</span> in <span class="loc">Mpumalanga</span>, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. The farms in the region produce tropical fruits, vegetables, flowers and timber. After the Boer War the British demarcated land on the <span class="loc">Emanzimhlope</span> River, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Crocodile River</span>. <span class="loc">Emanzimhlope</span> is Swazi for <span class="loc">White Waters</span>. The land was used to demobilise British soldiers and the first manager of the settlement was Tom Lawrence (snr), after whom the longest street in the town is still named. The farming tradition of the community that settled here after the Anglo-Boer War has remained virtually unchanged to this day. Lord Milner's (administrator of the defeated <span class="loc">Transvaal</span>) attache, the aforementioned Tom Lawrence, demarcated land on the '<span class="loc">Emanzimhlope</span>' - a tributary of the <span class="loc">Crocodile River</span> whose name translates from the Swazi as '<span class="loc">White Waters</span>' - to demobilised British Anglo-Boer War soldiers. After a 26 km canal to channel water from the river was built, the new settlers planted trees and established new cultivation methods. The agriculture involves largely the production of tropical fruits, vegetables, flowers and timber and tobacco, and is one of the most fertile in the province.</p>
