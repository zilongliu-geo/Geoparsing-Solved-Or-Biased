<p><span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> (Arabic: بيت لحم‎  Bayt Laḥm ; "House of Meat", Bēt Laḥm; Hebrew: בֵּית לֶחֶם Bēṯ Leḥem, Modern: Bet Leḥem [bet ˈleχem], lit. "House of Bread"; Ancient Greek: Βηθλεέμ [bɛːtʰle.ém]; Latin: <span class="loc">Bethleem</span>) is a Palestinian city located in the central <span class="loc">West Bank</span>, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, about 10 km (6.2 miles) south of <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>. Its population is approximately 25,000 people. It is the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. The economy is primarily tourist-driven. The earliest known mention of the city was in the Amarna correspondence of 1350-1330 BCE during its habitation by the Canaanites. The Hebrew Bible, which says that the <span class="loc">city of Bethlehem</span> was built up as a fortified city by Rehoboam, identifies it as the city David was from and where he was crowned as the king of <span class="loc">Israel</span>. The New Testament identifies <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> as the birthplace of Jesus. <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> was destroyed by the Emperor Hadrian during the second-century Bar Kokhba revolt; its rebuilding was promoted by Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, who commissioned the building of its great Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. The church was badly damaged by the Samaritans, who sacked it during a revolt in 529, but was rebuilt a century later by Emperor Justinian I.</p>
