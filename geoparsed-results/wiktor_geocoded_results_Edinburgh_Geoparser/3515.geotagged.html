<p><span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is a small village about 2 km (1.2 mi) from the town of <span class="loc">Flitwick</span> in <span class="loc">Bedfordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies across <span class="loc">Flitwick</span> Moor from the larger settlement of <span class="loc">Flitwick</span> and is on the opposite side of the <span class="loc">River Flit</span>. It forms part of the <span class="loc">parish of Flitton and Greenfield</span>. The main street (High Street) has junctions with <span class="loc">Pulloxhill</span> road, leading to the village of <span class="loc">Pulloxhill</span>, <span class="loc">School Lane</span>, the site of the old village school. High Street also has a junction with <span class="loc">Mill Lane</span>, which was until the 1960s a cart route to <span class="loc">Ruxox Farm</span>, <span class="loc">Maulden</span> and <span class="loc">Ampthill</span> and now leads to footpaths and bridleways to Maggot Moor, <span class="loc">Flitwick Moor</span>, <span class="loc">Ruxox Farm</span>, <span class="loc">Flitton Moor</span>, and the village of <span class="loc">Flitton</span>. Houses along High Street are a mix of thatched cottages and Bedfordshire brick dwellings, with an assortment of renovated or rebuilt barn buildings in keeping to some extent with earlier farm courtyard structures. Due to closures, there is now only one public house in <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> called The Compasses. Three former pubs, were the Swan Beerhouse on <span class="loc">Mill Lane</span> which closed in 1909, the Nags Head Beerhouse on the High Street which closed in 1913, and the Old Bell Public House which closed more recently in 2007. There was also once a post office and store on <span class="loc">Mill Lane</span>, and the village store on the High Street (formerly Cockroft's), and a village school on <span class="loc">School Lane</span> that was later used as an artists studio by artist and sculptor James Butler (artist). The former beer houses and stores are now private residences. A new village school was built on <span class="loc">Pulloxhill</span> road during the 1960s.</p>
