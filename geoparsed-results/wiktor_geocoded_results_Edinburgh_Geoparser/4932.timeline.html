  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Carter County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 6,265. The county seat is <span class="loc">Van Buren</span>. The county was officially organized on <span class="date">March 10, 1859</span>, and is named after Zimri <span class="per">A. Carter</span>, a pioneer settler who came to <span class="loc">Missouri</span> from <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> in <span class="date">1812</span>. <span class="loc">Carter County</span> is located in the <span class="loc">Ozarks region</span> of southeast <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. When the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> legislature created <span class="loc">Carter County</span> on <span class="date">March 10, 1859</span>, it named the county after Zimri <span class="per">A. Carter</span>. Zimri <span class="per">A. Carter</span> (<span class="date">1794</span>–<span class="date">1870</span>), the man for whom <span class="loc">Carter County</span> was named, was born in <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. In <span class="date">1807</span>, at the age of 13, he came to <span class="loc">Missouri</span> with his parents. The <span class="per">Carter</span> family initially settled in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Warren County</span>. Shortly after his arrival in <span class="loc">Missouri</span> <span class="per">Zimri Carter</span> joined up with a party of traders traveling the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> rivers in flat boats, and was away for <span class="date">a number of years</span>. In his absence his father <span class="per">Benjamin Carter</span> traded a horse and a cow for a large tract of land in what was then <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, about eight miles southeast of where the town of <span class="loc">Van Buren</span> would eventually be established. When <span class="per">Zimri Carter</span> returned from his trading ventures he joined his father in farming their new homestead. (Various sources give dates as early as <span class="date">1812</span> and as late as <span class="date">1820</span> for <span class="per">Zimri Carter</span>’s arrival in the area.) <span class="per">Zimri Carter</span> became one of the most influential and respected men in southeast <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and was instrumental in bringing about the creation of <span class="loc">Carter County</span> and served for a time as county judge of <span class="loc">Carter County</span>. The Carters were soon followed by other families: the <span class="loc">Chilton</span>, <span class="loc">Kenard</span>, <span class="loc">Snider</span> and Kelly families, who, along with the Carters opened up large tracts of wilderness land.</p><br><br>
