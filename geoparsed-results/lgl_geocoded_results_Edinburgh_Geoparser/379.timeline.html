  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Mom livid at unsafe length of child's bus ride. <span class="per">Tina Vehof</span> consoles her youngest son <span class="per">Joshua</span>, 4, as they walk up their rural laneway, his tears contrasting the boundless energy of his three older siblings running up ahead. The four children, bubbling with emotion, have just gotten off their school bus after <span class="date">a long day</span> that started shortly before 7 a.m., when <span class="per">Tina</span> woke them to get dressed for their bus to school some nine hours earlier. "I got them to bed at a good time last night, but this is what happens," <span class="per">Vehof</span> explained. <span class="per">Vehof</span> is livid at the unsafe length of their morning bus ride and frustrated no one in either the busing consortium or the Catholic school board has responded to her concerns. This scene of wound, wired energy and frustration plays itself out almost daily as the kids arrive home from being cooped up on the bus and at school all day. Despite the 40-plus minutes they've just spent on the bus <span class="date">now</span>, the children are picked up for the ride to school between 7:15 and 7:30 a.m. They don't arrive at <span class="loc">Holy Family</span> Catholic <span class="org">French Immersion School</span> until almost 9 a.m., putting their morning bus commute well above the 70-minute maximum time in their school board's transportation policy. "The children can't cope with these times," <span class="per">Tina Vehof</span> said. "I can see they're suffering because of it. They're always tired and their anxiety level is high." <span class="per">Vehof</span> said the <span class="date">March</span> break provided respite from this schedule and that in <span class="date">the few days</span> after school resumed <span class="date">last week</span> she again noticed her children's fatigue and anxiety levels rising. <span class="per">Vehof</span> is upset her complaints to the <span class="loc">London District</span> Catholic School Board and its <span class="org">Southwestern Ontario Student Transportation Services</span> consortium haven't been resolved. She said she has been following the proper complaint procedure, first approaching her children's principal, and then e-mailing a letter to the consortium. Her letter is one of five sent by families whose 11 children are on the route, with drop-offs at <span class="loc">Holy Family</span>, St. Michael's Catholic School and St. Mary's High School. "Children simply cannot tolerate the extended hours on a bus," <span class="per">Vehof</span>'s letter read. "There (have) been numerous incidents of unacceptable behaviour already reported (slashing bus seats, burning shoes on the bus and much more), done by the high school children. "Children are tired, irritable and overall are not able to cope." One of the other letters explained how the route originates in <span class="loc">Tavistock</span> before picking up several students in the vicinity of the 16th <span class="org">Line of East</span> <span class="per">Zorra-Tavistock</span> and <span class="per">Oxford</span> Road 5 -- the Vehofs live in this area -- before heading through Bright and onto <span class="loc">Plattsville</span>. St. Mary's students are dropped off first in <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>, followed by <span class="loc">Holy Family</span> students and lastly St. Michael's pupils. Student Transportation Services general manager <span class="per">Maureen</span> Heath explained in an e-mail <span class="date">Monday</span> she was aware of the concern with this bus route, attributing conditions on the route to the vast geography at play for the schools. She also confirmed an efficiency review led to the elimination of a bus route in the area. "Vast geography in rural areas and program options relative to a student's location are constraints which sometimes make the 70-minute window impossible to achieve," Heath wrote in the e-mail. In a subsequent phone interview, Heath acknowledged many of the students bused to school in the district are rural, but there is still a variance between boards in interpreting what a 'normal' rural bus situation should look like. <span class="per">Vehof</span> refuted any attempt to explain the long bus ride as simply a factor of living in a rural environment. She said and the other families have the right to send their children to a French immersion Catholic school and <span class="loc">Holy Family</span> is the only option. Even if she were to switch her children to St. Michael's for the <span class="org">English Catholic</span> program, they would ride the same bus route and their transportation times would remain the same. Only in switching to the closest English public school -- <span class="org">Hickson Central Public School</span> -- would the bus ride get shorter. Heath said it's possible conditions may improve next school year, as the consortium will be changing bus routes again with the goal of increasing the number of shared routes. "I'm not in a position to make guarantees, but the intent is to go back through our routes -- particularly in areas we're aware of -- with a fresh set of eyes," Heath said.
