  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dinga</span> is a <span class="loc">city of Gujrat</span> District in the <span class="loc">Punjab province</span> of <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>. It lies between the rivers <span class="loc">Jhelum</span> and <span class="loc">Chenab</span>. The main highway that runs from <span class="loc">Lahore</span> to <span class="loc">Rawalpindi</span> is about 27 km northeast of <span class="loc">Dinga</span>. <span class="loc">Dinga</span> is about 100 km from the border that separates <span class="loc">Pakistan</span> and <span class="loc">India</span>, the city is famous in <span class="loc">Pakistan</span> for meethi saunf (sugar-coated aniseeds). <span class="loc">Dinga</span> is an historical town. In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin. He conquered the Shahis in <span class="loc">Kabul</span> in <span class="date">1005</span>, and followed it by the conquests of <span class="loc">Punjab region</span>. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the <span class="loc">Punjab region</span>. The <span class="loc">Punjab region</span> became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of <span class="loc">Punjab region</span>. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the <span class="loc">Sikh</span> invaded and occupied <span class="loc">Gujrat District</span>. During the period of British rule, <span class="loc">Gujrat District</span> increased in population and importance. The actual name of that town was Deen Gha (hub of Islamic education) but with the interval of time during the British empire its name became <span class="loc">Dinga</span>. Many people say that the name of this city called on a Gurjar family, the Dinga family. Nowadays you see Dinga names in other areas like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, <span class="per">Balochistan</span> and <span class="per">Sindh</span> provinces. There is evidence that this town was established in the 16th century, by Choudhry Muqeem Khan. He came from the nearby village of Bhalaisranwala and laid the foundation of a settlement. He started raiding the Dacoits who at the time which were a persistent danger and established both peace and order.</p><br><br>
