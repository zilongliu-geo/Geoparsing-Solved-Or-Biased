<p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the southern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 38,827. The county seat is <span class="loc">Mount Vernon</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Mount Vernon</span>, <span class="loc">IL</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is located in the southern portion known locally as "<span class="loc">Little Egypt</span>". The western border of the county adjoins the Greater St. Louis consolidated metropolitan statistical area, the Metro-East region, and the St. Louis commuter region and market and viewing area. The first settler in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is believed to have been Andrew Moore. In 1810, he settled near the southeast corner of the county, near where the <span class="loc">Goshen</span> Road emerges from the forest of <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> into what is now known as Moore's Prairie. It is interesting that Moore arrived from the <span class="loc">Goshen</span> Settlement, near <span class="loc">Edwardsville</span>. His migration was therefore retrograde, from the west toward the interior of the State. In 1814, Andrew Moore departed with his eight-year-old son for <span class="loc">Jordan</span>'s settlement, a journey from which he never returned. A skull that was believed to have been Moore's was found several years later about two miles from his cabin. <span class="loc">Jordan</span>'s Settlement, also called <span class="loc">Jordan</span>'s Fort, was southeast of modern <span class="loc">Thompsonville</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, about twenty miles south of <span class="loc">Moore</span>'s cabin. This episode occurred during the War of 1812 when many of the Indian tribes were allied with the British.</p>
