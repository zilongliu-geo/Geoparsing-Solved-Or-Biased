  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,183 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It was incorporated in <span class="date">1838</span> from part of <span class="loc">Rowley</span>. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> was originally settled in <span class="date">1639</span> as a part of the town of <span class="loc">Rowley</span> by the <span class="per">Reverend Ezekiel Rogers</span>. The town at the time stretched from the Atlantic coast to the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span>, south of <span class="loc">Newbury</span> and north of <span class="loc">Ipswich</span>. Several farmers, finding suitable meadowlands in the western half of the settlement, began settling along the <span class="per">Penn Brook</span> by the middle of the seventeenth century, creating Rowley's <span class="loc">West Parish</span>. Though not directly involved in <span class="per">King Philip</span>'s War, the village nonetheless did become a victim of Indian raids. The village, which became known as <span class="loc">New Rowley</span>, grew for <span class="date">many years</span>, with small mills and eventually a shoe company opening up in the town. By <span class="date">1838</span>, the town was sufficiently large enough for its own incorporation, and was renamed <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>. Small industry continued, and <span class="date">today</span> the town is mostly residential in nature, a distant suburb of Boston's <span class="loc">North Shore</span>.</p><br><br>
