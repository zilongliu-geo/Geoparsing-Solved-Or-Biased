  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>An outbreak of cholera in <span class="loc">West Africa</span> has resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people, and United Nations (<span class="org">UN</span>) health officials are concerned that inadequate health services in the region could result in many more deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on <span class="date">Thursday</span> that over 31,250 cases of cholera have been reported so far <span class="date">this year</span> in nine West African countries. It has claimed 488 lives at this point. "If we look at <span class="date">this year</span>'s trends, the figures are still going up in many countries," said <span class="per">John Mulangu</span>, a senior regional advisor for the WHO. "If cholera is not brought under control in certain regions, we will soon be talking of... 100,000 cases," he said. "And hospitals and health centres will be overwhelmed. <span class="date">Last year</span> we were not on this scale. The problem is getting worse," <span class="per">Mulangu</span> said. The following West African nations have all been hit by cholera epidemics: <span class="loc">Burkina Faso</span>, <span class="loc">Cote d'Ivoire</span>, <span class="loc">Guinea</span>, <span class="loc">Guinea-Bissau</span>, <span class="loc">Liberia</span>, <span class="loc">Mauritania</span>, <span class="loc">Mali</span>, <span class="loc">Niger</span>, and <span class="loc">Senegal</span>. The WHO issued a statement on <span class="date">Thursday</span> that more countries were at risk. "Outbreaks are likely to spread to Central <span class="loc">Africa</span> - <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>, <span class="loc">Cameroon</span> and <span class="loc">Chad</span> - in the next <span class="date">weeks</span>," it said.</p><br><br>
