<p><span class="loc">San Benito</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cameron County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 24,250 at the 2010 census. On April 3, 2007, <span class="loc">San Benito</span> celebrated the 100th anniversary of its naming. The post office was named "Diaz" from April to May 1907. The San Benito Museum, Freddy Fender Museum and Conjunto Music Museum opened in the same building Nov. 17, 2007. On October 25, 1975, on the television show Hee Haw, Freddy Fender saluted his hometown of <span class="loc">San Benito</span>, population 15,177. <span class="loc">San Benito</span> is part of the Brownsville–Harlingen–Raymondville and the <span class="loc">Matamoros–Brownsville metropolitan</span> areas. <span class="loc">San Benito</span> is known as the "<span class="loc">Resaca City</span>". The <span class="loc">Resaca de los Fresnos</span>, 400-foot (120 m) wide, flows through the city. As indicated by its Spanish name, the resaca was a dry river bed. It is now the main canal of a large irrigation system. <span class="loc">San Benito</span> was at first named "Diaz" in honor of Porfirio Díaz, president of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> at that time. The people in the <span class="loc">San Benito</span> area were predominantly of Mexican ancestry. The Anglo settlers came after the completion of the first irrigation system in 1906. Prior to that time, this region was an arid, mesquite-cactus-brush covered wilderness. Irrigation water touched off the crop production magic in the railroad.</p>
