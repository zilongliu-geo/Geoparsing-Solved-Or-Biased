  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Paris</span> is a town in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Oxford County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,183 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The census-designated place of <span class="loc">South Paris</span> is located within the town. Because the <span class="org">U.S. Post Office</span> refers to the entire town as <span class="loc">South Paris</span>, the town as a whole is commonly referred to as <span class="loc">South Paris</span>. The main exception is the area known as <span class="per">Paris Hill</span>, which is a scenic historic district popular with tourists. It was granted by <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> on <span class="date">June 11, 1771</span> to <span class="per">Captain Joshua Fuller</span> of <span class="loc">Watertown</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and 59 others (or their heirs) for service during the French and Indian Wars. It was the second attempt to repay the soldiers, because their first grant in <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, made on <span class="date">November 24, 1736</span> and called Township Number Four, was deemed invalid because of a prior claim by the heirs of <span class="per">John Mason</span>. The land in <span class="loc">Maine</span> would retain the name Township Number Four. It was first settled near the center of the town in <span class="date">1779</span> by <span class="per">Lemuel Jackson</span>, <span class="per">John Willis</span> and their families. Organized as Number Four Plantation, it was incorporated as <span class="per">Paris</span> on <span class="date">June 20, 1793</span>. At the establishment of <span class="loc">Oxford County</span> in <span class="date">1805</span>, <span class="per">Paris</span> was designated its county seat and developed into a thriving community. It was noted for scenic beauty and excellent pasturage, including some of the state's best livestock and dairy farms. It also had many large apple orchards. The village of <span class="per">Paris Hill</span> was established at an elevation of 820 feet (250 m) above sea level, with views of <span class="loc">Mount Chocorua</span> and <span class="loc">Mount Washington</span> in the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span>. The <span class="per">Paris Hill</span> Historic District, added to <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> in <span class="date">1973</span>, has fine examples of Federal and Greek Revival architecture. The old <span class="loc">Oxford County</span> Jail, built of granite in <span class="date">1822</span>, was given in <span class="date">1902</span> to the <span class="per">Paris Hill</span> Library Association, and is <span class="date">now</span> the <span class="org">Hamlin Memorial Library and Museum</span>.</p><br><br>
