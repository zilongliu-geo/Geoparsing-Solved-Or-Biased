  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 34,400 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, located in the area of historic cotton plantations and culture known as the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> <span class="org">Delta</span>. This area was occupied by indigenous peoples when explored by the French, who established a colony at <span class="loc">Natchez</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, the home of the historic <span class="loc">Natchez</span> people, and later European-American colonists. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in <span class="date">1830</span>, and forced most of the Southeastern tribes to Indian Territory during <span class="date">the following decade</span>. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was founded in <span class="date">1824</span> by <span class="per">William W. Blanton</span>, who filed for land from the <span class="loc">United States</span> government. He was granted section four, township eighteen, range eight west. This plot <span class="date">now</span> constitutes most of downtown <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> became the county seat in <span class="date">1844</span>. The two previous county seats, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and <span class="loc">Princeton</span>, had both caved into the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. The current <span class="loc">city of Greenville</span> is the third in the State to bear the name. The first, located to the south near <span class="loc">Natchez</span>, became defunct soon after the American Revolution as European-American settlement was concentrated to the east.</p><br><br>
