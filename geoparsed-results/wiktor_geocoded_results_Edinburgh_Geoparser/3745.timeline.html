  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The village of <span class="loc">Ayr</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> is a settlement located within the Township of <span class="loc">North Dumfries</span> in the <span class="loc">Regional Municipality of Waterloo</span> in Southwestern <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. <span class="loc">Ayr</span> is located south of <span class="loc">Kitchener</span> and west of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>. In <span class="date">1824</span>, <span class="per">Abel Mudge</span> (son of <span class="per">Elijah Mudge</span> Sr) constructed a sawmill and flour mill at the junction of <span class="loc">Cedar Creek</span> and the <span class="loc">Nith River</span> (building at 14 Northumberland St., <span class="loc">Ayr</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>). This was the first of three distinct settlements, <span class="loc">Jedburgh</span> in the east (<span class="per">Main St</span>.), Nithvale in the west (<span class="per">Piper St</span>.) and <span class="per">Mudge</span>'s Mill in the centre (Stanley/Northumberland Streets) in what is <span class="date">today</span> the Village of <span class="loc">Ayr</span>. <span class="loc">Jedburgh</span> began in <span class="date">1832</span> when <span class="per">John Hall</span>, a young immigrant from <span class="loc">Jedburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, purchased a 75-acre (300,000 m2) parcel of land that included the area <span class="date">now</span> flooded by <span class="loc">Jedburgh</span> Dam. By <span class="date">1850</span> Hall had developed several industries, including a flour mill, sawmill and distillery with water power provided by the damming of <span class="loc">Cedar Creek</span>. At the same time a smaller settlement, Nithvale, was founded to the west of <span class="per">Mudge</span>'s Mill where a small sawmill opened along the <span class="loc">Nith River</span>, its claim on history being that in <span class="date">1837</span> it was a meeting and drilling place for MacKenzie's followers just prior to the Upper <span class="loc">Canada</span> Rebellion.</p><br><br>
