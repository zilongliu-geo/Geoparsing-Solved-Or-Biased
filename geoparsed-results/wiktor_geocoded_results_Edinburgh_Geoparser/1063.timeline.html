  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Portland</span> is a city in <span class="per">Sumner</span> and <span class="per">Robertson</span> counties in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. <span class="loc">Portland</span> also a part of the <span class="loc">Nashville Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area The population was 11,486 in <span class="date">2010</span> according estimates by the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census bureau and in <span class="date">2013</span> the population was 11,933. <span class="loc">Portland</span> is located on the <span class="loc">Highland Rim</span> in extreme northern Middle Tennessee. This region has always been known for excellent agricultural soils, a spectacular wildlife environment and an enjoyable climate. People were originally attracted from the tobacco belt in Virginia and the <span class="loc">Carolina</span> to the <span class="loc">Highland Rim</span> for land speculation and dark tobacco. The <span class="loc">Highland Rim</span> offered ideal climate and soil conditions for growing dark tobacco. This lucrative crop increased the value of the land which benefited land speculators in the area. Eventually these speculators moved on to attempt profits elsewhere. The farmers however, remained. The oldest local settlement in <span class="loc">Portland</span> is <span class="loc">Fountain Head</span> which is located a couple of miles south of <span class="loc">Portland</span>. This settlement was founded <span class="date">1792</span> by the <span class="per">James Gwin</span> family. Within <span class="date">a century</span>, it grew to include a mill, tobacco factory, post office, <span class="loc">Louisville</span> &amp; Nashville railroad depot and a number of local retail stores.</p><br><br>
