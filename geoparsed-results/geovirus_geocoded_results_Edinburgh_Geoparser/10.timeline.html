  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The <span class="loc">United States Department of Agriculture</span> has announced that a "low pathogenic" form of the H5N1 Avian Flu has been found in fecal samples taken from wild Mallard ducks located in <span class="per">Queen Anne</span>'s County in <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and in <span class="loc">Crawford County</span> located in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. Officials stress that the strain is of no risk to humans. Samples from the ducks in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> were taken on <span class="date">August 28</span>. "Testing has ruled out the possibility of this being the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain that has spread through birds in <span class="loc">Asia</span>, <span class="loc">Europe</span> and <span class="loc">Africa</span>. Test results thus far indicate this is low pathogenic avian influenza, which poses no risk to human health. The fecal samples were collected on <span class="date">August 2</span> from resident wild ducks in <span class="per">Queen Anne</span>'s County, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, as part of a research project conducted by <span class="org">Ohio State University</span>. The fecal samples came from mallards that showed no signs of sickness," said the USDA in a statement on its website. Ducks in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> also had shown no signs of being sick.</p><br><br>
