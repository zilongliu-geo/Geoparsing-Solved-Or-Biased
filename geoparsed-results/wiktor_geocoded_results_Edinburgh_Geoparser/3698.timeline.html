The walk is 2.45 miles long and passes All Saints Church, Park Pond, and the cemetery. The small hamlet of <span class="org">Burthorpe Green</span> is attached to Barrow. The playing field in the centre of the village is bordered by 19 poplar trees. On the small road to <span class="loc">Risby</span> is a large steep hill known locally as Bread &amp; <span class="loc">Water Hill</span>. The village has two Public Houses - The Three Horseshoes, and The Weeping Willow. Unfortunately as at <span class="date">September 2015</span> The Weeping Willow is closed.
