<p>Riverside is a residential suburb 4 kilometres north-west of the central business <span class="loc">district of Launceston</span>, Tasmania's second largest city. The <span class="loc">West Tamar Highway</span> runs through the suburb, adjoining Riverside to the West Tamar, which includes small towns: Beaconsfield, George Town and <span class="loc">Beauty Point</span>. Riverside is part of the <span class="loc">West Tamar</span> Council local government area, despite its close proximity to the Launceston CBD. The suburb is now Launceston's largest by population, narrowly ahead of Kings Meadows, nevertheless, it lacks in shopping facilities, with only a small $2 million centre which opened in the 1980s. The Riverside Shopping Centre as it is known, includes: a Woolworths supermarket, a Banjos bakery and a pharmacist. There are several schools (Riverside Primary School, Riverside High School, Launceston Christian School and <span class="loc">St Anthony</span>'s) as well as an Aussie rules football ground named Windsor Park which is home to the Launceston Football Club, a soccer ground which is home to Riverside Olympic, the park also includes a cricket ground for senior players and also a junior ground used mainly by under 12 and under 14 sides, all along the course of the highway. Less than a 1 km further north there is a small complex containing a few shops including Joes IGA supermarket and St David's Church. Over the road is a restaurant, pub and bottle shop, as well as the 3.5 star Best Western Riverside motel.</p>
