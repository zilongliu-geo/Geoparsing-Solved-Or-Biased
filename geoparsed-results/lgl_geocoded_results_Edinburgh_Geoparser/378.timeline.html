  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Mixed local reaction towards <span class="loc">Ontario</span> budget (click for video). <span class="per">Elliot Ferguson</span> photoJim <span class="per">Harrison</span> of the <span class="loc">Woodstock District</span> <span class="loc">Chamber of Commerce</span> says it is likely the proposed harmonized sales tax will cost consumers more money. The local reaction to <span class="date">Thursday</span>'s <span class="loc">Ontario</span> budget speech could best be described as mixed. While local political and business leaders liked aspects of the Liberal budget, there were serious misgivings about the harmonization of the provincial sales tax with the federal GST. The most scathing local indictment of this harmonization came from <span class="loc">Oxford</span> MPP <span class="per">Ernie Hardeman</span>, who characterized this shift as the largest tax increase in the province's history. While <span class="per">Hardeman</span> was supportive of the concept of a harmonization, saying he had no argument against more efficient methods of taxation, he was critical of the Liberal government's approach. "This will be a massive burden on the average citizens of the <span class="loc">Province of Ontario</span>," he said following Finance Minister <span class="per">Dwight Duncan</span>'s budget speech. Because this harmonization will result in the inclusion of goods and services previously exempt from provincial tax, including gasoline and heating fuel, <span class="per">Hardeman</span> said Ontarians would suffer an eight per cent price increase on many staples. The result, he said, would be the generation of an additional $2.3 billion in annual sales tax revenue by <span class="date">2012</span>. "That's the reality of it, and that's all on the backs of average citizens," the Progressive Conservative agriculture critic said. For <span class="per">Jim Harrison</span>, the president of the <span class="loc">Woodstock District</span> <span class="loc">Chamber of Commerce</span>, the harmonized sales tax represented a mixed bag. While harmonization has long been a position of the <span class="loc">Ontario</span> <span class="loc">Chamber of Commerce</span>, <span class="per">Harrison</span> was concerned that adding an eight per cent sales tax to previously exempted goods and services would mean an unwelcome increase to operating costs to <span class="loc">Ontario</span> businesses. "When you add that one key element, it really shakes your opinion of the overall effect," he said. "The increased tax burden on the new items, we'll have to wait and see what happens." <span class="per">Harrison</span> suggested some of the mitigation measures intended by the provincial government to offset this potential burden, including personal income tax reductions and one-time thrice yearly "rebate" cheques, implied the impact of harmonization could be fairly significant. "There's an inherent feeling the blow is bigger than the reform," he said. Like <span class="per">Hardeman, Harrison</span> suggested the provincial government should have looked at reducing its portion of the harmonized sales tax to offer Ontarians something in the range of 10 per cent to 11 per cent. At the same time, <span class="per">Harrison</span> said the Liberal government was wise to delay the institution of the single sales tax until <span class="date">July 2010</span>. "That will give everyone some time to understand the process," he said. While the impact of this new "single, value-added tax" was viewed with some trepidation, local leaders were more impressed with other budget-speech announcements. The promise that garnered the most local praise was the allocation of $32.5 billion in new infrastructure spending, an investment that <span class="per">Duncan</span> estimated would create 300,000 jobs. Even as a member of the Opposition, <span class="per">Hardeman</span> couldn't fault the Liberal government for putting more money into hospitals, roads, schools and affordable housing. "I can't see anything ... but good (coming from the infrastructure investment)," <span class="per">Harrison</span> agreed. "I feel quite positive about that." While cautiously optimistic about the announcement of the infrastructure money, Oxford's municipal leaders had questions about the actual details of the eventual disbursement. Noting that his town had been overlooked by provincial infrastructure funding programs in <span class="date">the past</span>, Tillsonburg Mayor <span class="per">Stephen Molnar</span> said his council would have to ensure "we get fair, equitable and sustainable treatment." " (We) embrace the opportunity for a larger portion of our residents' federal and provincial tax dollars ... to assist in the investment in their own infrastructure," <span class="per">Molnar</span> said. Woodstock Mayor <span class="per">Michael Harding</span> was also cautious in his appraisal of the promised infrastructure money, saying the municipality would likely not receive the details for some time. Like <span class="per">Molnar</span>, <span class="per">Harding</span> hopes the substance of any new infrastructure funding programs would be devoid of any cumbersome provisions. "Hopefully, they will follow very, very quickly and hopefully there isn't a lot of red tape," the mayor said. "There appears to be a lot of negotiation going on in the background on how quickly the money will flow and what those amounts will be. <span class="per">Harding</span>, though, was impressed with the provincial government's promise to provide more than $1 billion for a combination of social housing renovations and new affordable housing projects over <span class="date">the next two years</span>. <span class="per">Harding</span>, an advocate for affordable housing, applauded these "additional supports" for helping the province's most vulnerable. "These are badly needed across the province and in <span class="loc">Oxford</span>," the <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> mayor said. "As are the 4,500 affordable housing units that are coming, according to their math." <span class="per">Hardeman</span>, though, did express concerns about the long-term impact of the overall government spending. While acknowledging the need for spending to stimulate the sluggish economy, he warned the $14.1-billion deficit represented by the <span class="date">2009</span> budget would be the highest in the province's history. Oxford's political and business leaders were also positive about the provincial budget's promise to reduce both personal income and corporate income taxes. Starting in <span class="date">July 2010</span>, Ontarians will receive a 16.5 per cent tax cut on the first $38,848 of taxable income while most businesses will enjoy a corporate tax decrease of 14.3 per cent to 18 per cent. While he approved these tax cuts, <span class="per">Hardeman</span> said his party had advocated a similar policy for <span class="date">the past several years</span> as a tool to encourage additional investment in <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. "It's something our party has been telling them since <span class="date">2003</span>," <span class="per">Hardeman</span> said. "I'm just disappointed it took <span class="date">five years</span> to find that answer." <span class="per">Harrison</span> simply described the tax cuts as "good long-term strategies for growth," saying the benefits wouldn't be fully realized for <span class="date">a few years</span>. <span class="per">Molnar</span>, while supportive of strategic tax cuts, wondered why these measures weren't being introduced a little sooner. Mentioning the promised "rebates," including the one-time $1,000 cheque for eligible <span class="loc">Ontario</span> families, <span class="per">Molnar</span> said these stimulus measures should be implemented in the short term. "If it's about stimulus, that means money in the pocket," he said. "Do it as son as possible. If you're cutting a cheque, cut it <span class="date">now</span>."</p><br><br>
