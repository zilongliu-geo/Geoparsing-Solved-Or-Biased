<p><span class="loc">Taman</span> (Russian: Тамань) is a rural locality (a stanitsa) in <span class="loc">Temryuksky District</span> of Krasnodar Krai, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the coast of the <span class="loc">Taman</span> Bay. Population: 10,027 (2010 Census); 9,297 (2002 Census). <span class="loc">Taman</span> occupies the site of the ancient <span class="loc">cities of Hermonassa and Tmutarakan</span>. From the end of the 15th century until 1783, this was a site of a Turkish fortress. Before the annexation it was a sanjak subordinate to the elayet of <span class="loc">Kaffa</span>. The modern stanitsa was founded by the Zaporozhian Cossacks under Anton Golovaty on August 25, 1792 as the latter's residence and the first garrison of the Black Sea Cossack Host. Until 1849, <span class="loc">Taman</span> was officially considered to be a town, even though it had no local government of its own and was governed from the nearby stanitsa of <span class="loc">Akhtanizovskaya</span>. In 1849, <span class="loc">Taman</span> was re-organized as a stanitsa and established local government of its own. In August 2008, then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a government resolution authorizing the development of a major international cargo port several kilometers south of <span class="loc">Taman</span>. Currently, a fertilizer terminal is under construction there to link with the ammonia pipeline to <span class="loc">Odessa</span> owned by TogliattiAzot.</p>
