<p>Richmond is a far western suburb of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Hawkesbury</span>. It is located at a latitude of 33° 35' 54" South and a longitude of 150°45' 04" east, 19 metres above sea level on the alluvial <span class="loc">Hawkesbury River</span> flats, at the foot of the <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span>. It is about 65 km by road from <span class="loc">Sydney</span>. The Darug people were the native people to the area in 1788. The area was originally explored by British settlers in 1789 and was known by them as '<span class="loc">Richmond Hill</span>'. This name was given by Governor Phillip, in honour of Charles Lennox, the third Duke of Richmond who was Master General of Ordnance in the <span class="loc">Pitt</span> administration. The local area was the third area to have European settlement in <span class="loc">Australia</span> after <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and <span class="loc">Parramatta</span>. The first 22 European settlers came to the area in 1794. They came to farm a total of 30 acres (12 ha) in what is now Pitt Town Bottoms. They needed good farming land to help overcome the desperate need for food in the new colony. By 1799 this region was producing about half the grain produced in the colony.</p>
