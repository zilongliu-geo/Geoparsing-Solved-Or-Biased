  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>City supports Trees for <span class="date">Tomorrow</span> Project. The <span class="loc">City of Paris</span> supports the new Trees for <span class="date">Tomorrow</span> Project in <span class="loc">Paris</span>. Project coordinator <span class="per">David Dick</span> attended <span class="date">Monday</span>’s city council meeting to ask for support for the project. <span class="per">Dick</span> said the project did not need monetary help for the project, but asked for involvement through planting and watering the trees. The goal is to plant 25 to 30 native shade trees, not ornamental trees, on the boulevards and street sides (not backyards) of private yards in the <span class="date">spring of 2009</span>. In addition, <span class="per">Dick</span> hopes have another 50 to 60 trees planted <span class="date">this fall</span> and each fall thereafter. City grounds/maintenance supervisor <span class="per">Teresa Bach</span> jumped at the chance to be a part of the project. Bach is also a Master Gardener, who are also helping with the project. The <span class="org">Edgar County Community Foundation</span> agreed to be the custodians of the funds for the project, and also agreed to kick-start the project by funding the first 25 trees to be planted. <span class="per">Dick</span> was inspired to begin the project by the plaque at Schwartz park that reads “The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit.” “[Trees] provide shade by moderating the radiant energy from the sun, they absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants and give off oxygen in exchange. Who could ask for more?” <span class="per">Dick</span> said during the city council meeting. To keep the project going, donations will be needed from the community. “Every tax deductible dollar will be used directly for the purchase of and planting of trees,” said <span class="per">Dick</span>. Anyone who would like to contribute to the project should send donations to the <span class="org">Edgar County Community Foundation</span> in care of Citizens National Bank in <span class="loc">Paris</span>. Funds should be earmarked for the Trees for <span class="date">Tomorrow</span> Project. Anyone who would like to see if their property qualifies for tree planting is encouraged to contact the city. The <span class="org">Edgar County Community Foundation</span> agreed to be the custodians for funds for the new Trees for <span class="date">Tomorrow</span> (TFT) of <span class="loc">Paris</span>. The foundation is also funding the planting of the first 25 trees. Contributions from the public are necessary to keep the project going. Donations may be sent to the <span class="org">Edgar County Community Foundation</span> in care of Citizens National Bank. Pictured, left to right, are TFT coordinator <span class="per">David Dick</span>, Master Gardener and city grounds/maintenance supervisor <span class="per">Teresa Bach</span>, and foundation board members <span class="loc">Ned</span> <span class="per">Jenison</span> and <span class="per">Maryann</span> <span class="loc">Pearman</span>.
