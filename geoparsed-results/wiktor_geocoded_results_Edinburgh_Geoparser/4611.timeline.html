  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Douglas County</span> is the seventh-most populous of the 64 counties of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 285,465. The county seat is <span class="loc">Castle Rock</span>. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> is part of the <span class="org">Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is located midway between Colorado's two largest cities, <span class="loc">Denver</span> and <span class="loc">Colorado Springs</span>. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> has the highest median household income of any <span class="loc">Colorado county</span> or statistical equivalent. It is ranked ninth nationally in that category, and has the highest of any county or equivalent not in the northeastern <span class="loc">US</span>. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> is lightly wooded, mostly with ponderosa pine, with broken terrain characterized by mesas, foothills and small streams. <span class="loc">Cherry Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Plum Creek</span> rise in <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> and flow north toward <span class="loc">Denver</span> and into the <span class="loc">South Platte River</span>. Both were subject to flash flooding in <span class="date">the past</span>, <span class="loc">Plum Creek</span> being partially responsible for the <span class="loc">Denver</span> flood of <span class="date">1965</span>. <span class="loc">Cherry Creek</span> is <span class="date">now</span> dammed. Most residents commute to workplaces elsewhere in the metropolitan area outside of the county. Suburban development is displacing the ranching economy of the county.</p><br><br>
