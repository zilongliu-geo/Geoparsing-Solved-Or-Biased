<p><span class="loc">Manga</span> is a barrio (neighbourhood or district) of <span class="loc">Montevideo</span>, <span class="loc">Uruguay</span>. <span class="loc">Manga</span> shares borders with <span class="loc">Manga</span> - Toledo Chico to the north and northwest, Villa García - <span class="loc">Manga Rural</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Piedras Blancas</span> to the south and Casavalle to the southwest. The origin of the name "<span class="loc">Manga</span>" is believed it comes from the short name of the word "Mangangá", name which appeared mentioned in 1780, the zone later called "<span class="loc">Manga</span>". According to Benito Tesore, expert in <span class="loc">Manga</span>'s history and its men that subsisted in the zone in the first years of the century. Lot of trenches and strongholds were built, possibly to stop the Portuguese advance (in Artigas' times). Armed with this assumption, it could be why municipal authority gave names as "Trinchera" (Trenches) and "Fortín" (Fort) to two roads of the zone. The first owner of a ranch in <span class="loc">Manga</span> was Esteban Artigas (Son of the captain Juan Antonio Artigas), ceded by The Government of <span class="loc">Spain</span>. In the Register Aldecoa, from 1772-1773, he's figured as living with his six under-age children in The <span class="loc">Manga</span>, then known as "Pago del Arroyo de Sierra" (Zone of the brook of Mountain Range), known by that name because of a neighbour's surname of the zone.</p>
