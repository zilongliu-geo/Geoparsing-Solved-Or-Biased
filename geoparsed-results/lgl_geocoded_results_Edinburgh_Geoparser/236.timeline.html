  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Attempt to recover stolen items results in fatal stabbing . He found the men <span class="date">early Saturday</span> in Independence, but during an ensuing struggle, the 48-year-old <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> man was fatally stabbed in the back. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> prosecutors charged an Independence teenager on <span class="date">Monday</span> with killing Welch and another teen with the stealing that led to <span class="date">Saturday</span>’s fatal confrontation. According to court documents, Welch went to a residence in the 300 block of East Elm Street about <span class="date">1:45 a.m. Saturday</span> and got into a fight with 19-year-old <span class="per">Anthony Gillen</span> of <span class="loc">Kansas City</span>. While they were struggling, 18-year-old <span class="per">Christopher Vasquez</span> allegedly stabbed Welch. <span class="per">Welch</span> and <span class="per">Gillen</span>’s mother, who had accompanied him to the residence, then left in a pickup truck but pulled over near Interstate 435 and 23rd Street and called 911. <span class="per">Gillen</span> and <span class="per">Vasquez</span> were picked up for questioning on <span class="date">Saturday afternoon</span>. <span class="per">Vasquez</span> admitted to police that he and <span class="per">Gillen</span> had stolen property from Welch and that he had stabbed Welch, according to court documents. <span class="per">Gillen</span> told detectives that he was on the ground struggling with Welch when he saw <span class="per">Vasquez</span> approach. Welch then “seemed to lose power and stop fighting.” After Welch and his mother left, <span class="per">Gillen</span> said <span class="per">Vasquez</span> told him that he had stabbed Welch and needed to get rid of the knife. <span class="per">Vasquez</span> later led detectives to where he had hidden the knife and it was recovered, according to the documents. He is charged with second-degree murder and armed criminal action and <span class="per">Gillen</span> is facing a felony stealing charge.</p><br><br>
