  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Makri</span> (Nissos Makri)(Greek: Μάκρη) is a Greek island, one of the Echinades, in the <span class="loc">Ionian Islands</span> group. It is located on the far southeast side of the Gulf of <span class="loc">Makri</span> close to the mouth of the Acheloos river. It is administered by the municipality of <span class="loc">Ithaca</span> and is 24 km (15 mi) east of the island. As of <span class="date">2011</span>, it had no resident population. Strabo, and most modern writers, identify Dulichium, from which Homer reports that <span class="loc">Meges</span>, son of <span class="per">Phyleus</span>, led 40 ships to Troy, with the island of <span class="loc">Makri</span>. The island is roughly 2.5 km (1.6 mi) long and 0.5 km (0.3 mi) at its widest. It has an area of roughly 993,000 acres (401,853 ha) and an estimate coastline of 7,280 m (23,885 ft) in length. Made up of 2 hills linked by an isthmus, there is also a small islet at its southeastern corner. Recently it was put on the market, with the possibility for resort development and consideration for a 5* hotel and luxurious private villas to be built. Its value is unknown but it is hoped that it will reach a similar value to the close by island of <span class="loc">Oxia</span> which was recently sold to Sheikh <span class="per">Hamad bin Khalifa</span> al-Thani, the emir of <span class="loc">Qatar</span>, for €4.9M</p><br><br>
