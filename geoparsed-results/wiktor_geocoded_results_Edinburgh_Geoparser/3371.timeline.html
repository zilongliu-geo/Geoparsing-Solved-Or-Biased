  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Berkeley</span> (/ˈbɜːrkliː/ BURK-lee) is a city on the east shore of <span class="loc">San Francisco Bay</span> in <span class="loc">northern Alameda County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It is named after the 18th-century Anglo-Irish bishop and philosopher <span class="per">George Berkeley</span>. It borders the <span class="loc">cities of Oakland and Emeryville</span> to the south and the <span class="loc">city of Albany</span> and unincorporated community of <span class="loc">Kensington</span> to the north. Its eastern border with Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span> generally follows the ridge of the <span class="loc">Berkeley Hills</span>. Its population at the <span class="date">2010</span> census was 112,580. <span class="per">Berkeley</span> is the site of the oldest campus in the <span class="org">University of California</span> system – the <span class="org">University of California, Berkeley</span> – of the <span class="org">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</span> which is managed and operated by the university, and the Graduate Theological Union. It is one of the most politically liberal cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The site of <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="loc">City of Berkeley</span> was the territory of the Chochenyo/Huchiun band of the Ohlone people when the first Europeans arrived. <span class="org">Evidence</span> of their existence in the area include pits in rock formations, which they used to grind acorns, and a shellmound, <span class="date">now</span> mostly leveled and covered up, along the shoreline of <span class="loc">San Francisco Bay</span> at the mouth of <span class="loc">Strawberry Creek</span>. Other artifacts were discovered in <span class="date">the 1950s</span> in the downtown area during remodeling of a commercial building, near the upper course of the creek.</p><br><br>
