  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Somerset</span> is a city located in <span class="loc">Bexar County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located less than 20 miles south of Downtown <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> and is part of the San Antonioâ€“New <span class="loc">Braunfels metropolitan</span> area. The population was 1,631 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. English speaking European settlers had already arrived in the area by the early 1800s. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> was named for an organized settlement that had been begun in <span class="date">1848</span>, in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Atascosa County</span>, by a group of Baptist families from <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The present site was named <span class="loc">Somerset</span> when the First <span class="org">Townsite Company</span> was formed on the Artesian Belt Railroad right-of-way on <span class="date">May 25, 1909</span>, by <span class="per">A. M. Pyron</span>, <span class="per">Carl Kurz</span>, and <span class="per">Jonas A. Kerr</span>. In <span class="date">1913</span>, while drilling for artesian water, <span class="per">Kurz</span> discovered oil. A boom followed. The <span class="loc">Somerset</span> oilfield extended from <span class="loc">Somerset</span> to below <span class="loc">Pleasanton</span> and was the largest known shallow field in the world at that time. Two oil refineries in the field and a pipeline into <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> handled the high-gravity crude. The town grew rapidly from fifty residents in <span class="date">1925</span> to 700 in <span class="date">1928</span>; it was served by a state bank, a ten-room hotel, and several machine and blacksmith shops. A post office opened there in <span class="date">1920</span>. A nearby lignite coal mine also added to the booming economy of the area.</p><br><br>
