  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Coronado</span>, also known as <span class="loc">Coronado</span> Island (Spanish for "crowned one"), is a resort city located in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, across and around <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego Bay</span> from downtown <span class="loc">San Diego</span>. Its population was 24,697 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 24,100 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is part of the San Diego-Carlsbad, <span class="loc">CA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="per">Coronado</span> lies on the geographic combination of an island and a tombolo connected to the mainland called the <span class="loc">Silver Strand</span>. <span class="per">Coronado</span> is a tied island, connected by a tombolo. In <span class="date">2012</span>, Dr. <span class="per">Stephen Leatherman</span>, Director of <span class="org">the Laboratory for Coastal Research</span>, ranked <span class="per">Coronado</span> Beach as the best beach in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="per">Coronado</span> is Spanish for "the crowned one", and thus it is nicknamed The <span class="loc">Crown City</span>. There have been three ships of the <span class="loc">United States</span> Navy named after the city, including the USS <span class="per">Coronado</span> (LCS-4). The town of <span class="per">Coronado</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">December 11, 1890</span>. The land was purchased by <span class="per">Elisha Spurr</span> <span class="loc">Babcock</span>, along with Hampton L. <span class="per">Story</span> and <span class="per">Jacob</span> Gruendike. Their intention was to create a resort community, and in <span class="date">1886</span> the <span class="org">Coronado Beach Company</span> was organized. By <span class="date">1888</span> they had built the <span class="per">Hotel del Coronado</span> and the city became a major resort destination. They also built a schoolhouse, and formed athletic, boating, and baseball clubs.</p><br><br>
