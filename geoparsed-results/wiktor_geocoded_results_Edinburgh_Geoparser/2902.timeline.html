  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Madison County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 82,916. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Richmond</span>. The county is named for Virginia statesman <span class="per">James Madison</span>, who later became the fourth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Madison County</span> is part of the Richmond-Berea, <span class="org">KY Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which is also included in the Lexington-Fayette-Richmond-Frankfort, <span class="org">KY Combined Statistical Area</span>. It is considered a moist county, meaning that although the county prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages (and is thus a dry county), it contains a city where retail alcohol sales are allowed. Nevertheless, two of Richmond's 19 precincts are dry. Alcohol can also be sold by the drink in <span class="loc">Berea</span> and at <span class="loc">Arlington</span> and The <span class="org">Bull</span> golf clubs. <span class="loc">Madison County</span> is home to <span class="org">Eastern Kentucky University</span>, <span class="org">Berea College</span>, <span class="loc">Boone Tavern</span>, and <span class="loc">Bybee Pottery</span>,(closed <span class="date">February 2011</span>) one of the oldest pottery operations in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. This is also where famous pioneer <span class="loc">Daniel Boone</span> lived and built Fort Boonesborough, <span class="date">now</span> a state historic site. Indian trader <span class="per">John Findley</span>, <span class="loc">Daniel Boone</span>, and four others first came into the area that is <span class="loc">Madison County</span> in <span class="date">1769</span> on a hunting and exploring expedition. The <span class="org">Transylvania Company</span>, led by Judge <span class="per">Richard Henderson</span> of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, purchased 20,000,000 acres of land west of the Appalachians (including present-day <span class="loc">Madison County</span>) from the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> in <span class="date">1774</span>. <span class="loc">Daniel Boone</span> was hired by the company to cut a trail through the <span class="loc">Cumberland Gap</span> and establish a settlement on the <span class="loc">Kentucky River</span>. The settlement at Fort Boonesborough began in <span class="date">April of 1775</span>.</p><br><br>
