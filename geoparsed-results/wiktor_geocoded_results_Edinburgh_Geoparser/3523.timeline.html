  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> (/dʒəˈruːsələm/; Hebrew: יְרוּשָׁלַיִם Yerushaláyim pronounced [jeruˈʃalajim]; Arabic: القُدس‎ al-Quds pronounced [ˈaːɫ ˈquːdsˤ]), located on a plateau in the <span class="loc">Judean Mountains</span> between the Mediterranean and the <span class="loc">Dead Sea</span>, is one of the oldest cities in the world. In the ancient cuneiform <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> was called 'Urusalima' meaning '<span class="loc">City of Peace</span>' during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400BC)  It is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, <span class="per">Christianity</span> and <span class="per">Islam</span>. Israelis and Palestinians both claim <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> as their capital, as <span class="loc">Israel</span> maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of <span class="loc">Palestine</span> ultimately foresees it as its seat of power; however, neither claim is widely recognized internationally. During its long history, <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, attacked 52 times, and captured and recaptured 44 times. Archaeologists have unearthed a 7,000-year-old settlement in northern <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> from the early Chalcolithic period. They describe it as the oldest discovery of its kind in the region. The part of <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> called the <span class="loc">City of David</span> was settled in the 4th millennium BCE. In <span class="date">1538</span>, walls were built around <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> under <span class="loc">Suleiman</span> the Magnificent. <span class="date">Today</span> those walls define the <span class="loc">Old City</span>, which has been traditionally divided into four quarters—known since the early 19th century as the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim <span class="date">Quarters</span>. The <span class="loc">Old City</span> became a World Heritage Site in <span class="date">1981</span>, and is on <span class="org">the List of World Heritage</span> in Danger. Modern <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> has grown far beyond the <span class="loc">Old City</span>'s boundaries.</p><br><br>
