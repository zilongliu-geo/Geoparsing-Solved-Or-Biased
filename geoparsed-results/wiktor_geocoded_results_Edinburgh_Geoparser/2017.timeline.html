  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lawrence</span> is a small town of 474 inhabitants (as per the <span class="date">2001</span> census) in <span class="loc">Otago</span>, in <span class="loc">New</span> <span class="loc">Zealand</span>'s <span class="loc">South Island</span>. It is located on State Highway 8, the main route from <span class="loc">Dunedin</span> to the inland towns of <span class="per">Queenstown</span> and <span class="per">Alexandra</span>. It lies 35 kilometres to the northwest of Milton, 11 kilometres northwest of <span class="loc">Waitahuna</span>, and close to the <span class="loc">Tuapeka River</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Clutha</span>. <span class="per">Lawrence</span>'s main claim to fame is of being the focal point for Otago's 1860s gold rush, after the discovery of the metal at nearby <span class="per">Gabriel</span>'s Gully by <span class="per">Gabriel Read</span>. In mid-1862, it is estimated that twice as many people lived around the banks of the <span class="loc">Tuapeka River</span> as did in <span class="loc">Dunedin</span> itself. Additionally, the tune to <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>'s national anthem was composed in <span class="per">Lawrence</span> by John J. Woods, a <span class="per">Lawrence</span> school teacher. The town was named for Sir <span class="per">Henry Lawrence</span>, hero of the <span class="loc">Lucknow</span> military campaign of <span class="date">1857</span>, and is billed as "The <span class="org">Gateway</span> To Central Otago". In <span class="date">1877</span>, a branch line railway was built from the Main South Line to <span class="per">Lawrence</span>, and the town remained the terminus of the line until an extension was built in <span class="date">1910</span>. Although originally known as the <span class="per">Lawrence Branch</span>, this line ultimately became known as the <span class="loc">Roxburgh</span> Branch. The railway closed in <span class="date">1968</span> and the town's station has subsequently been demolished, but some relics still remain, including the goods shed.</p><br><br>
