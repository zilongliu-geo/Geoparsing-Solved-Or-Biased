    Dazhai (Chinese: 大寨; pinyin: Dàzhài; literally: "great outpost"), formerly romanized as Tachai or Ta-chai, is the name of a community of several hundred farmers in Xiyang County in eastern Shanxi province, chiefly known for Mao Zedong's directive, "Learn from Dazhai in agriculture" (农业学大寨), which set up Dazhai as the model for agricultural production throughout the China during the 1960s and ’70s, amid the Cultural Revolution.
