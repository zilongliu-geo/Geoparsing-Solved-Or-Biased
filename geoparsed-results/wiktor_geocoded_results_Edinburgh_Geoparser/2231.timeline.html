  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Melrose</span> is a small town and civil parish in the Scottish Borders, historically in <span class="loc">Roxburghshire</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">Eildon</span> committee area. The town's name is recorded in its earliest form as Mailros, 'the bare peninsula' (Old Welsh or Brythonic), referring to the original site of the monastery, recorded by the Venerable <span class="loc">Bede</span>, in a bend of the river Tweed. The original monastery at <span class="loc">Melrose</span> is referred to in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle with the name Magilros. In the late Middle Ages, when the monastery had been re-founded in its present position, its name was symbolically represented by the visual pun of a mell (mason's hammer) and a rose (symbolising the <span class="org">Virgin</span> Mary, to whom all Cistercian abbeys were dedicated). <span class="loc">Melrose</span> is the location of <span class="loc">Melrose Abbey</span>, re-founded for the Cistercian order by <span class="per">David I</span> in the early 12th century, one of the most beautiful monastic ruins in <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>. It is the site of the burial of the heart of Scottish king <span class="per">Robert</span> the Bruce. An excavation was led to find a sealed casket, but it was not opened, and it was actually discovered by high school students involved in the dig. The casket was placed in a sealed lead cylinder, and was then re-buried in the abbey back at its proper resting place. The remains of the Abbey are cared for by Historic <span class="loc">Scotland</span> (open all year; entrance charge).</p><br><br>
