  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Newton, also known as <span class="loc">Newton Green</span> to distinguish it from <span class="loc">Nowton</span> near <span class="loc">Bury St Edmunds</span>, and <span class="loc">Old Newton</span> near <span class="loc">Stowmarket</span>, is a small village and civil parish in <span class="loc">Suffolk</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Part of <span class="loc">Babergh district</span>, it is located on the A134 (Assington Road) between <span class="loc">Sudbury</span> and <span class="loc">Colchester</span>, around three miles from the former. Newton was recorded in Domesday as "Niwetuna". Church Road leads north off A134 towards <span class="loc">Newton Hall</span> and All Saints Church (both 1 km from the village centre). Unusually, the village green to the south and west has been converted to a 9-hole common land course in <span class="date">1907</span>. It is one of the oldest golf clubs in <span class="loc">Suffolk</span>. Residents are entitled to membership of the local golf club, though are limited to using the holes on the village green and cannot use the clubhouse. The green is also a wildlife site. The parish contains <span class="loc">Alstrop</span> Wood and part of the Edwardstone Woods SSSI, both of which are classified as ancient woodland. The small hamlet of <span class="loc">Sackers Green</span> is also within the parish. The village previously had a school, but it was closed in <span class="date">1938</span>. The building is <span class="date">today</span> used as the village hall.</p><br><br>
