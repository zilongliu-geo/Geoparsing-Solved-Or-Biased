<p><span class="loc">Kulin</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Eastern Wheatbelt region</span> of Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, approximately 280 km from <span class="loc">Perth</span>. It is the main town in the Shire of <span class="loc">Kulin</span>. The first European known to have visited the <span class="loc">Kulin</span> area was Captain John Septimus Roe, Surveyor General of the Swan <span class="loc">River Colony</span> on his 1848-49 expedition to examine the south coast. He encountered a group of Aborigines 34 miles east of Nalyaring (near <span class="loc">Brookton</span>) who guided the expedition party to several water sources, including the <span class="loc">Kulin</span> Rock soak, before leaving the party at Yeerakine (just south and east of <span class="loc">Kondinin</span>) as this was the limit of their territory. These guides used the name 'Coolin' to describe the area now known as <span class="loc">Kulin</span> Rock. In the early years, settlers occasionally encountered groups of Aborigines hunting possums. Although artifacts such as grinding stones and stone choppers have been found in the district, no signs of permanent occupation were found by early settlers other than the mia-mias built by "Europeanised" Aboriginal shepherds from <span class="loc">Narrogin</span> in the employ of Michael Brown. Michael Brown, a businessman from <span class="loc">Narrogin</span>, took up large pastoral leases in the <span class="loc">Kulin</span>/<span class="loc">Kondinin</span> area including <span class="loc">Kulin Rock</span> and <span class="loc">Gnarming</span> in 1905. These and other leases in the area were terminated in 1909/1910 to allow the government to distribute the land for agricultural purposes.</p>
