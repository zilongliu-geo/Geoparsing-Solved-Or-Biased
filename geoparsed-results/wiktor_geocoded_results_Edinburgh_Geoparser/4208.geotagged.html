<p><span class="loc">Chipata</span>, population 98,416, is the capital of the <span class="loc">Eastern Province</span> of <span class="loc">Zambia</span>. Having a boma, a market, a hospital, a shopping centre and a number of schools, <span class="loc">Chipata</span> is the business and administrative hub that serves the region. The town boasts a four star hotel, a golf course, an airport, a mosque, and even a "welcome arch". The town is the regional head of the <span class="loc">Ngoni</span> of <span class="loc">Zambia</span>. As such, <span class="loc">Ngoni</span> is the primary language, although <span class="loc">Nyanja</span> and English are widely spoken, plus some Indian languages, as a large number of Zambian Indians live in the town. <span class="loc">Chipata</span> is located near the border with <span class="loc">Malawi</span>, and lies on the Great <span class="loc">East Road</span> which connects the capitals <span class="loc">Lilongwe</span> (130 km) and <span class="loc">Lusaka</span> (550 km). The town is a popular access point for the <span class="loc">South Luangwa National Park</span>. <span class="loc">Chipata</span> comes from the <span class="loc">Ngoni</span> word "Chimpata" meaning "large space," in reference to the town situated in a shallow valley between hills. The central neighborhood of <span class="loc">Kapata</span>, the original center of town, comes from the <span class="loc">Ngoni</span> phrase meaning "small space."</p>
