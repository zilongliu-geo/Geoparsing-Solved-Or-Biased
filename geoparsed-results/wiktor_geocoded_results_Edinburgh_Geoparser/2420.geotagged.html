<p>Kamari (Greek: Καμάρι) is a coastal village on the southeastern part of the Aegean island of <span class="loc">Santorini</span>, <span class="loc">Greece</span>, in the Cyclades archipelago with a population of approx. 1800 according to the 2001 census. It is part of the Municipality of <span class="loc">Thira</span> and is situated approximately 8 km away from the island's capital <span class="loc">Fira</span>. Kamari was built by residents of the nearby village of <span class="loc">Episkopi Gonias</span> (Greek: Επισκοπή Γωνιάς, also Μέσα Γωνιά), which was almost flattened by a devastating earthquake that hit <span class="loc">Santorini</span> in July 1956. The village got its name from a small arch (Greek: Καμάρα, <span class="loc">Kamara</span>) that still rises at the south end of its beach and is what remains from an ancient sanctuary dedicated to <span class="loc">Poseidon</span>. Today, it stretches along a beach covered with black pebbles, which is the longest of the island. The beach extends in a northeast to southwest direction from <span class="loc">Monolithos</span> to the feet of the Mesa vouno mountain that rises up to a height of approx. 400m, being <span class="loc">Santorini</span>'s second highest peak. Once an agricultural and fishing village, modern Kamari boasts a thriving tourist industry, offering a wide choice of accommodation, restaurants, cafes, bars and night clubs, plus several water sport activities.</p>
