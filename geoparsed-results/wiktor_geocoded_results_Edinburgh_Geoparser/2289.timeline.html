  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sagar</span> (<span class="loc">Saugor</span>), (Hindi: सागर) is a city in the state of <span class="loc">Madhya Pradesh</span> in central <span class="loc">India</span>. Situated on a spur of the Vindhya Range and 1,758 feet (536 m) above sea-level. The city is around 180 kilometres (110 mi) northeast of state capital, <span class="loc">Bhopal</span>. Its original name '<span class="loc">Saugor</span>' is an amalgamation of two words: sau meaning 100 and gahr meaning forts; there were countless small-forts in this region. With time the name has changed from '<span class="loc">Saugor</span>' to '<span class="loc">Sagar</span>'. <span class="loc">Sagar</span> has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM <span class="per">Narendra Modi</span>'s flagship <span class="org">Smart</span> Cities Mission. The ancient Indian kingdom of Chedi had its capital as "Suktimati", which is located in <span class="loc">Sagar</span> in contemporary times. History of <span class="loc">Sagar District</span> was not known before <span class="date">1022 A.D.</span>, after that all the records are available.Firstly, <span class="loc">Sagar</span> was under the rule of Ahir Rajas and their capital was at "Garhpehra". in <span class="date">1660 A.D.</span> Udenshah founded the present <span class="loc">Sagar</span> Town. <span class="loc">Sagar</span> owes its importance to having been made the capital of the <span class="loc">Maratha</span> <span class="per">governor Govind Pant Bundele</span> who established himself here in <span class="date">1735</span>. By a treaty concluded with the Maratha Peshwa in <span class="date">1818</span>, at the conclusion of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the greater part of the present district was made over to the British. The town became the capital of the <span class="loc">Saugor</span> and <span class="loc">Nerbudda Territories</span>, then attached to the North-Western Provinces. The <span class="loc">Saugor</span> and <span class="loc">Nerbudda Territories</span> later became part of the Central Provinces (afterwards Central Provinces and <span class="loc">Berar</span>) and <span class="loc">Sagar District</span> was added to <span class="loc">Jabalpur Division</span>. During the <span class="org">Revolt</span> of <span class="date">1857</span> the whole district was in the possession of the rebels, except the town and fort, in which the British were shut up for <span class="date">eight months</span>, until relieved by Sir <span class="per">Hugh Rose</span>. The rebels were totally defeated and British rule restored by <span class="date">March 1858</span>.</p><br><br>
