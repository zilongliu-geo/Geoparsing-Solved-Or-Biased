<p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, and determined by the U.S. Census Bureau to include the mean center of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> population in 1910. The population was 137,974 at the 2010 census. The county seat is <span class="loc">Bloomington</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Bloomington</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was formed in 1818 from portions of <span class="loc">Orange County</span>. It was named for James Monroe, fifth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, who was serving at the time the county was organized. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is divided between the basins of the East Fork and West Fork of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>'s <span class="loc">White River</span>. The southern part of the county drains to the East Fork, primarily via <span class="loc">Salt Creek</span> and its tributaries, such as <span class="loc">Clear Creek</span> (known as "<span class="loc">Jordan River</span>" on <span class="loc">Indiana</span> University <span class="loc">Bloomington</span> campus). The northern part drains to the West Fork. Several artificial reservoirs have been constructed by damming the county's creeks. The largest of them is <span class="loc">Lake Monroe</span>, a large reservoir on the <span class="loc">Salt Creek</span> in the south-eastern part of the county, is used both for recreational purposes and to supply the city with drinking water. Until the late 1960s, the main source of water supply was the smaller <span class="loc">Lake Lemon</span> (constructed 1953), in the northeastern part of the county; now it's the backup water source, and is mainly used for recreation.</p>
