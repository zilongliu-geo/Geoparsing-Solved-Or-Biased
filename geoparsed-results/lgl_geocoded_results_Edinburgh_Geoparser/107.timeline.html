  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Taxing cow flatulence? It could happen if emission fees approved. That's what two Republican state lawmakers fear will happen if federal officials move forward with plans to charge fees to farmers for livestock emissions. <span class="loc">Sens</span>. <span class="per">Tim Grendell</span>, from <span class="loc">Chesterland</span>, and <span class="per">Bob Gibbs</span>, from <span class="loc">Lakeville</span>, have introduced a resolution in the Ohio Senate urging quick passage of federal legislation exempting livestock from Clean Air Act fees. The resolution stems from a <span class="date">2007</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> decision that ruled greenhouse gases are considered pollutants under the Clean Air Act. As such, entities with emissions of more than 100 tons per year would have to obtain the proper permits. It would take 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle, 200 hogs or 200 sheep to produce that amount of emissions, <span class="per">Grendell</span> said. The two lawmakers, citing statistics compiled by the American Farm Bureau Federation, said the resulting Clean Air fees on livestock producers would range from $22 a head for hogs to $175 per head for dairy cows. "I believe everyone understood those gases to be industrial gases and not gases produced by livestock," <span class="per">Grendell</span> told reporters <span class="date">Wednesday</span>. "And in fact I would submit that before we should put a tax on gas produced by livestock, we would have to impose a tax on those who use <span class="per">Taco Bell</span>." Their resolution, a symbolic gesture showing the state's stance on the issue, urges the <span class="loc">Environmental Protection Agency</span> not to implement new regulations on livestock producers, nor impose new fees on farmers for animals' emissions. "The Clean Air Act was adopted to regulate and prevent air pollution from smokestack industries," <span class="per">Gibbs</span> later testified before <span class="org">the Senate</span>'s natural resources committee.</p><br><br>
