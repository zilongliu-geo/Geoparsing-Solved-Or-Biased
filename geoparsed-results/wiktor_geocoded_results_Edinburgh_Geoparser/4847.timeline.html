  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Grafton</span> is a ghost town, just south of <span class="loc">Zion National Park</span> in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Said to be the most photographed ghost town in the West, it has been featured as a location in several films, including <span class="date">1929</span>'s In Old Arizona—the first talkie filmed outdoors—and the classic <span class="per">Butch Cassidy</span> and the Sundance Kid. The nearest inhabited town is <span class="loc">Rockville</span>. The site was first settled in <span class="date">December 1859</span> as part of a southern <span class="loc">Utah</span> cotton-growing project ordered by <span class="per">Brigham Young</span> (see <span class="loc">Utah</span>'s Dixie). A group from <span class="org">Virgin</span> led by <span class="per">Nathan Tenney</span> established a new settlement they called Wheeler. Wheeler didn't last long; it was largely destroyed on the <span class="date">night of January 8, 1862</span> by a weeks-long flood of the <span class="loc">Virgin River</span>, part of the Great Flood of <span class="date">1862</span>. The rebuilt town, about a mile upriver, was named New <span class="loc">Grafton</span>, after <span class="loc">Grafton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The town grew quickly in its <span class="date">first few years</span>. There were some 28 families by <span class="date">1864</span>, each farming about an acre (0.4 hectare) of land. The community also dug irrigation canals and planted orchards, some of which still exist. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> was briefly the county seat of <span class="loc">Kane County</span>, from <span class="date">January 1866</span> to <span class="date">January 12</span>, <span class="date">1867</span>, but changes to county boundaries in <span class="date">1882</span> placed it in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>.</p><br><br>
