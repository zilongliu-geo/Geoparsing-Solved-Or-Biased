<p><span class="loc">San Fernando</span> is a city located in the <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> Valley, in the northwestern region of <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city was named for the nearby Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a, and was part of the Mexican land grant of <span class="loc">Rancho</span> Ex-Mission <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>. In 1874 Charles Maclay, <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> founder, bought 56,000 acres (227 km2) of the <span class="loc">Rancho</span>. In 1882, cousins George K. Porter and Benjamin F. Porter of future Porter Ranch each received one-third of the total land. In 1885, Maclay founded the Maclay School of Theology, a Methodist seminary in his newly founded town of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>. After his death it became an affiliate and moved to the campus of the University of Southern California and then the <span class="loc">Claremont School</span> of Theology. While most of the towns in the surrounding <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> Valley agreed to annexation by <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> in the 1910s, eager to tap the bountiful water supply provided by the newly opened <span class="loc">Los Angeles Aqueduct</span>, <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>'s abundant groundwater supplies allowed it to remain a separate city. Even as the <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> Valley transformed itself from an agricultural area to a suburban one in the decades after World War II, <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> retained its independence.</p>
