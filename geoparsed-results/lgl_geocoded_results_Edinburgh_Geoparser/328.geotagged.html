<p>County gets $36k for ‘05 bridge collapse. <span class="loc">Henry County</span> stands to receive about $36,000 in damages for the destruction of Bridge 136 over <span class="loc">Big Creek</span>, which collapsed in 2005 while a semi was attempting to cross it. The case went to a jury last week, with Trans Am Trucking Company, which operated the semi, seeking to pay no damages at all. Announcing the result at the county supervisors’ meeting this morning, County Engineer Bill Belzer said the final award would be about $35,900, plus an unknown amount of interest. It was a considerably smaller amount than the county had hoped for. “I didn’t think we’d get less than $50,000,” Belzer said, “considering the fact that <span class="loc">Washington County</span> had a smaller bridge that they got more money for.”</p>
