<p><span class="loc">Taishi</span> (太子町, Taishi-chō) is a town located in <span class="loc">Ibo District</span>, Hyōgo Prefecture, <span class="loc">Japan</span>. As of 2011, the town has an estimated population of 34,503. The total area is 22.62 km². Originally the <span class="loc">Ibo District</span> was divided into three towns (Ibogawa, Shingū, <span class="loc">Mitsu</span>). In October 2005 the three towns along with the town of <span class="loc">Tatsuno</span> merged into a single city bearing the name of <span class="loc">Tatsuno</span>. The merger left <span class="loc">Taishi</span> as the sole remaining independent town of the <span class="loc">Ibo District</span>. Separate plans have been laid out respectively for the merger <span class="loc">Taishi</span> and <span class="loc">Tatsuno</span>, and the merger of <span class="loc">Taishi</span> and <span class="loc">Himeji</span> into a single municipal district. The city is enveloped to the west by the <span class="loc">city of Tatsuno</span>, and to the east by the <span class="loc">city of Himeji</span>. 1931 - The town of <span class="loc">Ikaruga</span> was incorporated on present grounds of <span class="loc">Taishi</span>. 1951 - The villages (mura) of Sekkai and Ōda were merged with <span class="loc">Ikaruga</span> to form <span class="loc">Taishi</span>. 1955 - The village of Tatsuda was incorporated into <span class="loc">Taishi</span>. Miyamoto Musashi (1584–1645) - Influential nobleman known for both swordplay and penmanship; born in <span class="loc">Taishi</span>; noted in the collection of writings known as the Harimakagami. The fact is possibly apocryphal as many cities lay claim to his birthplace.</p>
