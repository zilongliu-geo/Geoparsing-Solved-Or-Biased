  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Elderslie</span> is a village in the council area and historic <span class="loc">county of Renfrewshire</span> in west central <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. The village is situated midway between the nearby towns of <span class="per">Paisley</span> and <span class="per">Johnstone</span>. <span class="loc">Elderslie</span> is disputed as the birthplace of Sir <span class="per">William Wallace</span>, a knight born around <span class="date">1270</span> who served as a military leader in the Wars of Scottish Independence before being captured and executed. It was presumed that <span class="per">Wallace</span> was the son of <span class="per">Sir Malcolm Wallace of Elderslie</span>. The basis for this was a poem written <span class="date">150 years</span> after the time of <span class="per">Wallace</span> by a minstrel called <span class="per">Blind Harry</span>. Examination of the seal which was sent on a letter to <span class="loc">Lubeck</span> after the battle of <span class="loc">Stirling</span> Bridge named <span class="per">Wallace</span>'s real father as <span class="per">Allan Wallace</span>, a royal tenant living in <span class="loc">Ayrshire</span> at that time. The village was once the home to Stoddard Carpets which made the carpets for the Cunard liners RMS <span class="per">Queen Mary</span>, RMS <span class="per">Queen Elizabeth</span> and <span class="per">RMS</span> <span class="per">Queen Elizabeth</span> 2 which were built by <span class="org">John Brown &amp; Company</span> in their shipyard in <span class="loc">Clydebank</span>. The firm also produced carpets for <span class="per">Queen Elizabeth II</span>'s wedding in <span class="loc">Westminster Abbey</span>, the ocean liner RMS Titanic and for the <span class="org">Concorde</span> aircraft. A remaining example of the work which was carried out here can be seen in the circular carpet which covers the floor of the drawing room in <span class="loc">Culzean Castle</span> designed by <span class="per">Robert Adam</span>.</p><br><br>
