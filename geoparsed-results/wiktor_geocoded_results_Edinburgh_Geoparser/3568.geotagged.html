<p>Anna is a city in <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. Located in Southern <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, the population was 4,442 at the 2010 United States Census, a decline from 5,135 in 2000. The city is known for being tied to its close neighbor <span class="loc">Jonesboro</span>, together known as Anna-Jonesboro. Anna is renowned for the Anna State Mental Hospital or the Choate Mental Health Care Center. Anna was platted on March 3, 1854. The city was incorporated on February 16, 1865. Anna was historically a sundown town, in which African Americans were excluded from living in the town's limits. In 1909, a mob of angry white citizens drove out Anna's black families following the lynching in a nearby town of a black man accused of raping a white woman. According to Historian James Loewen, a common adage in the town was that its name of "Anna" was actually an acronym, standing for "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Anna is located at 37°27′40″N 89°14′20″W. According to the 2010 census, Anna has a total area of 3.519 square miles (9.11 km2), of which 3.5 square miles (9.06 km2) (or 99.46%) is land and 0.019 square miles (0.05 km2) (or 0.54%) is water.</p>
