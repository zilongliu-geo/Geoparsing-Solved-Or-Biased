  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Isidro</span> is a fourth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Davao Oriental</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It has a land area of 220 kmÂ². According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 32,424 people. <span class="loc">San Isidro</span> is one the "gulf towns" of <span class="loc">Davao Oriental</span> whose shorelines stretch along <span class="loc">Davao Gulf</span>. Other gulf towns are <span class="loc">Banaybanay</span>, <span class="loc">Lupon</span> and <span class="loc">Governor Generoso</span>. <span class="loc">San Isidro</span> is politically subdivided into 16 barangays. Seven barangays are along the coastlines while the other nine are in the interior areas. The town of <span class="loc">San Isidro</span> was created by virtue of Republic Act No. 4744 enacted by the Philippine Congress on <span class="date">June 18, 1966</span>. It started operating as a local government unit on <span class="date">January 1968</span>. Its founder and the first mayor was <span class="per">Vicente Yu</span>, Sr. <span class="loc">San Isidro</span> is largely planted with coconut, with much of its agricultural industry focuses on the production of copra. There are currently efforts to further diversify the output of the municipality's coconut-based industry from copra to other value-added coconut products such as coco-oil (which can be used as a fuel additive) and coco-coir. In <span class="date">1992</span>, a Crop Diversification Program of the local government unit (LGU) was implemented with mango as "export winner". In <span class="date">1998</span>, the town commenced its first Mango Festival as an indicator of the prominence of this high yielding fruit. Farmers are also engaged in growing the popular banana (cardava). Despite this, farmers still experience difficulties in increasing their income due to lack of agricultural technology specially those farming in the upland areas.</p><br><br>
