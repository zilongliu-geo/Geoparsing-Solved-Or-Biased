<p>Gore is a town in <span class="loc">western Sequoyah County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Fort Smith</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 977 at the 2010 census, an increase of 15 percent from 850 at the 2000 census. Gore claims to be the "trout capital of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>", with great fishing in Lake Tenkiller, the <span class="loc">Illinois River</span>, and the <span class="loc">Arkansas River</span>. This community began as a small settlement in Indian Territory known as Campbell, named for Dr. W. W. Campbell, who, along with Joe Lynch, operated a ferry across the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River between Campbell and <span class="loc">Webbers Falls</span>. Tahlonteskee, the capital of the Western <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> from 1828–1839, was near here, just two miles to the north of town. In 1829, John Jolly, chief of the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> Nation–West, built a home in this area. The settlement was also known as <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Station or "<span class="loc">Illinois</span> Station, Campbell Post Office." It became a stage stop on the route between <span class="loc">Fort Gibson</span> and <span class="loc">Fort Smith</span>. A post office designation of Campbell was assigned to Dr. Campbell's store in 1888. Also in 1888, the St. Louis, <span class="loc">Iron Mountain</span> and Southern Railway (later the Missouri Pacific Railway) built a rail line through the settlement.</p>
