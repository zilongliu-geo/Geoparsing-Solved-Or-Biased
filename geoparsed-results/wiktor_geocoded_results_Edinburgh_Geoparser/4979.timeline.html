  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Modern Dion or <span class="loc">Dio</span> (Ancient Greek: Δίον, Greek: Δίο, Latin: Dium) is a village located at the foot of <span class="loc">Mount Olympus</span> and in the municipality of Dio-Olympos. It is best known for its great ancient Macedonian sanctuary of <span class="loc">Zeus</span> and city, much of which is visible in the archaeological park and the Archaeological Museum of Dion. The ancient city owes its name to the most important Macedonian sanctuary dedicated to <span class="loc">Zeus</span> (Dios, "of <span class="loc">Zeus</span>"), leader of the gods who dwelt on <span class="loc">Mount Olympus</span>; as recorded by Hesiod's <span class="org">Catalogue of Women</span>, <span class="per">Thyia</span>, daughter of <span class="per">Deucalion</span>, bore <span class="loc">Zeus</span> two sons, <span class="per">Magnes</span> and <span class="per">Makednos</span>, eponym of Macedonians, who dwelt in <span class="loc">Pieria</span> at the foot of <span class="loc">Mount Olympus</span>. Hence from very ancient times, a large altar had been set up for the worship of Olympian Zeus and his daughters, the Muses, in a unique environment characterised by rich vegetation, towering trees, countless springs and a navigable river. For this reason Dion was the "sacred place" of the Ancient Macedonians. It was the place where the kings made splendid sacrifices to celebrate the new year of the Macedonian calendar at <span class="date">the end of September</span>. In the Spring, purification rites of the army and victory feasts were held.</p><br><br>
