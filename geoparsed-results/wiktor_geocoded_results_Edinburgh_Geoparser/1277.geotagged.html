<p><span class="loc">Avondale</span> is a Canadian town located on Newfoundland's <span class="loc">Avalon Peninsula</span> in the province of <span class="loc">Newfoundland and Labrador</span>. The community is situated at the southwestern head of <span class="loc">Conception Bay</span> in Division 1. It is located 59 km (37 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">St. John</span>'s and 72 km (45 mi) northeast of <span class="loc">Placentia</span>. Prior to January 1, 1898 <span class="loc">Avondale</span> was known as Salmon Cove but was renamed to avoid confusion with two other nearby communities of the same name in the Port de Grave and Brigus Districts. The name <span class="loc">Avondale</span> was suggested by the parish priest Rev John Roe because of the resemblance to his native area in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, taking the name from Thomas Moore's poem, "The Meeting of the Waters". Earliest record of settlement per Fishing Room Grants is for John Mahaney in 1773, a census of 1812 reports 12 inhabitants. Settlers to the area were primarily Irish Roman Catholic with a smaller number of Jersey French and English. <span class="loc">Avondale</span> incorporated the communities of Salmon Cove, Gasters, Northern Arm, and Southern Arm. In 1863, the Anglo American Telegraph Company set up a repeater station which was eventually taken over by the Reid Newfoundland Railway Company in the late 1880s when the Newfoundland Railway was constructed through the area and a station was built. In addition to the railway station, it also hosted a post office, a money order office, and one church. It functioned as a lumbering, fishing and farming settlement in what was known as the Harbour Main District. The population dwindled in the early 1900s as men began migrating to the eastern <span class="loc">US</span> (<span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span>) to find work.</p>
