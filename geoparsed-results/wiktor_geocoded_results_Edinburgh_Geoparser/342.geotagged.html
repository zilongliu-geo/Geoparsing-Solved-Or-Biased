<p><span class="loc">Clifton</span> is a hamlet by the <span class="loc">River Cherwell</span> in <span class="loc">Deddington</span> civil parish about 6 miles (10 km) <span class="loc">south of Banbury</span>, <span class="loc">Oxfordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Clifton</span> is on the B4031 road between <span class="loc">Deddington</span> and <span class="loc">Croughton</span>, <span class="loc">Northamptonshire</span>. A dependent chapel of <span class="loc">Deddington parish</span> church still existed in <span class="loc">Clifton</span> in 1523 but seems to have disappeared by the 17th century. A Methodist chapel was built in <span class="loc">Clifton</span> in about 1815. It was a small brick building and has since been demolished. The Methodists replaced it in 1869 with a new brick and stucco chapel with plain lancet windows. It was still in use for worship in the 1950s but was disused by 1983 and is now a private house. A new Church of England chapel of <span class="loc">Saint James</span> the Great was completed in 1853. The <span class="loc">Diocese of Oxford</span> declared the chapel redundant in and sold it for secular commercial use in 1974. <span class="loc">Clifton</span> has a public house, the Duke of Cumberland's Head, that is now a gastropub. The <span class="loc">Clifton</span> dog actor Sykes (born c.2004), is owned by a local animal trainer. He has appeared as "Harvey" in Thinkbox marketing commercials, TV serials, and films. His advertisement for John Smith's Brewery saw him play "Tonto" against Peter Kay.</p>
