<p><span class="loc">Hainan</span> (Chinese: 海南; pinyin:  Hǎinán ; Jyutping: Hoi2 Naam4; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Hái-lâm; literally: "South of the Sea [<span class="loc">Qiongzhou</span> Strait]") is the smallest and southernmost province of the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span> (PRC). The name "Hainan" also refers to <span class="loc">Hainan Island</span> (海南岛, Hǎinán Dǎo), the main island of the province. <span class="loc">Hainan</span> is located in the <span class="loc">South China Sea</span>, separated from Guangdong's <span class="loc">Leizhou</span> Peninsula to the north by the shallow and narrow <span class="loc">Qiongzhou</span> Strait. For 39 years after the PRC's establishment, <span class="loc">Hainan</span> was part of <span class="loc">Guangdong Province</span> until in 1988 when the island became part of the newly created <span class="loc">Hainan Province</span> (海南省, Hǎinán Shěng). The province has an area of 33,920 square kilometers (13,100 sq mi) and is <span class="loc">China</span>'s southernmost province. Although it comprises some two hundred islands scattered among three archipelagos off the southern coast, 32,900 square kilometres (12,700 sq mi) (97%) of its land mass is <span class="loc">Hainan Island</span>, from which the province takes its name. The PRC government claims territories of the province extend to the <span class="loc">southern Spratly Islands</span>, <span class="loc">Paracel Islands</span>, and other disputed marine territory.</p>
