<p><span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is an affluent unincorporated community which is a suburb of <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>. The original village of <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is located in <span class="loc">Howard County</span>, and also includes portions of <span class="loc">Baltimore County</span> and <span class="loc">Carroll County</span>. Thomas Browne, the "Patuxent Ranger" explored westward through Anne Arundel county through <span class="loc">Clarksville</span> and settled in the area in 1702. The Mt. Pleasant Log home was built by the Brown family in the 18th century. A century later in the civil war, confederate general Bradley Tyler Johnson used Mt. Pleasant to store weapons, dispatch messages and hide from Union troops. <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> was founded as a mining town based around its Granite quarries. The B&amp;O railroad ran though the area with a station built in 1835 for granite deliveries. The postal community was named "Davis Tavern" when its first post office opened in 1836. Caleb Davis and Peter Gorman were early B&amp;O contractors. Gorman married Elizabeth Browne of the Brown family, occupied a large farm "Good Fellowship", sold Granite for buildings and built a large granite house in town. The granite house was the birthplace of Arthur Pue Gorman, which was torn down to build a bridge across the <span class="loc">Patapsco</span> in the early 1980s. In 1869, the Jesuit Woodstock College opened on the <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> side of the <span class="loc">Patapsco River</span>. St, Alphonsus Rodriguez church was built on a section of the institute in 1887â€“1968 when it was lost to fire. In 1889, telegraph service was extended to town.</p>
