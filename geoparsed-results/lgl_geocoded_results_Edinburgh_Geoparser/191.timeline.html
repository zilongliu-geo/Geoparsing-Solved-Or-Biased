  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Chiefland man, 19, stabbed in the back. A 19-year-old who tried to avoid a fight with another 19-year-old wound up being stabbed in the back four times. The stabbing victim was taken to the hospital while the man accused of knifing him went to jail. The incident happened at about <span class="date">4:30 a.m. Saturday</span> in the Hardeetown area of <span class="loc">Chiefland</span>. Police Chief <span class="per">Robert Douglas</span> said <span class="per">Stephen Davis</span>, of <span class="loc">Chiefland</span>, had been arguing with <span class="per">Michael Durr</span>, of Trenton. “Witnesses told our officers that <span class="per">Davis</span> tried to walk away, but <span class="per">Durr</span> continued taunting him, and it got physical when <span class="per">Durr</span> hit him (<span class="per">Davis</span>) with a closed fist,” <span class="per">Douglas</span> said. Witnesses said <span class="per">Durr</span> pulled out a knife with a black handle and a four- to five-inch-long blade that he used to stab <span class="per">Davis</span> four times. <span class="per">Davis</span> was taken to a Gainesville hospital for treatment of a punctured lung and other injuries. <span class="per">Durr</span> fled from the scene and reportedly headed to a house outside <span class="loc">Chiefland</span> where he had been living with his girlfriend and their baby, parking the <span class="org">BMW</span> he had been driving in the garage. <span class="loc">Levy County</span> sheriff's Deputy <span class="per">Mark Morgan</span> was dispatched to the home <span class="date">Saturday morning</span> because a fire had been reported there. Sheriff’s spokesman <span class="per">Capt. Evan Sullivan</span> said the State Fire Marshal's Office sent investigators to the scene because local firefighters believed the fire was suspicious. <span class="per">Durr</span> was arrested <span class="date">a short time</span> later and charged with aggravated battery.</p><br><br>
