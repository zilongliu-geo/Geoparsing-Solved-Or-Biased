  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Cornelius</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located in the <span class="loc">Portland</span> metropolitan area, the city's population was 12,147 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city lies along Tualatin Valley Highway between Forest Grove to the west and <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> to the east. <span class="per">Cornelius</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1893</span> and is named for founder <span class="per">Thomas R. Cornelius</span>. In <span class="date">1845</span>, <span class="per">Benjamin Cornelius</span> immigrated to <span class="loc">Oregon</span> with his family, traveling with <span class="per">Joseph Meek</span>. The <span class="per">Cornelius</span> family settled on the Tualatin Plains, near what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">North Plains</span>. The same year, <span class="per">Benjamin</span> Q. <span class="per">Tucker</span> and <span class="per">Solomon</span> <span class="loc">Emerick</span> staked land claims and established farms on the land that would eventually become <span class="per">Cornelius</span>. At that time, the area was called Free Orchards; there was no actual community, but the name referred to the orchards on the 107 acres (0.43 km2) of land. In <span class="date">1871</span>, <span class="per">Benjamin Cornelius</span>'s son Colonel <span class="per">Thomas R. Cornelius</span> learned that <span class="per">Ben Holladay</span> planned to extend the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and <span class="loc">California Railroad</span> right through Free Orchards. <span class="per">Holladay</span> had been told by Forest Grove and <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> that they would not allow the railroad free right-of-way, so Holladay planned to bypass them, and build Free Orchards into a new city that would become the new county seat of <span class="loc">Washington County</span>.</p><br><br>
