  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> is a town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span> at the southern end of the <span class="loc">Grampians</span> National Park, in <span class="org">the Shire of Southern</span> <span class="loc">Grampians</span>. It is approx 283 km west of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> on the Glenelg Highway. The town's population is holding steady but ageing. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> had a population of 461. The Chapwurrung people lived in this region to the south and east of the <span class="loc">Grampians</span> for over <span class="date">4,000 years</span> prior to the arrival of the Europeans. The first pastoralists took up properties here in the late 1830s, and there was <span class="date">a decade</span> of sometimes violent clashes with the Chapwurring. A small European township developed which was initially known as <span class="loc">Mount Sturgeon</span>, the hill behind the town. A Post Office of that name opened on <span class="date">1 July 1852</span> (Dunkeld from <span class="date">1 January 1854</span>); but, as the early settlers were predominantly Scottish, it was renamed <span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> after a Scottish town which was the principal locality of the Caledonian picts in Roman times. At a strategic point south of the <span class="loc">Grampians</span> for road traffic and surrounded by fine wool producing country, <span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> thrived in the mid-19th century. The Robertson's Woolpack Inn was the first building to be erected in <span class="date">1845</span>, followed by five other hotels - the Shamrock and the Western, the Royal Mail, the Collins Railway Hotel and the Family Inn. Road traffic declined with the opening of the railway (<span class="date">1877</span> to <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> and <span class="loc">Ararat</span>, with another short lived line going south to <span class="loc">Penshurst</span>). <span class="per">Louis Buvelot</span>, <span class="per">Eugene von Guerard</span> and <span class="per">Nicholas Chevalier</span> all made paintings of the district, where <span class="loc">Mount Abrupt</span> and <span class="loc">Mount Sturgeon</span> provide an appealing backdrop.</p><br><br>
