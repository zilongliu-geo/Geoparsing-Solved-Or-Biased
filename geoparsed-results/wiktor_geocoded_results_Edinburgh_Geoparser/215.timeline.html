  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Roma</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Starr County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 9,765 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city is located along the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>, across from <span class="loc">Ciudad</span> Miguel Alemán in <span class="loc">Tamaulipas</span>, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The city is also popularly known as Roma-Los Saenz, since the incorporated city also took the area known as <span class="loc">Los Saenz</span>. It serves as a port of entry from <span class="loc">Mexico</span> into the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> via the Roma-Ciudad Miguel Alemán International Bridge. The town center has a number of picturesque historic buildings, <span class="date">now</span> collected in the Roma Historic District. <span class="loc">Roma</span> is a popular birding site in the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> Valley, and a section of the World <span class="org">Birding Center</span> is on <span class="loc">Portsheller</span> Street across from the city hall. The channel of the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> is less than 200 feet wide at <span class="loc">Roma</span>. The bluff adjacent to the town square overlooks the river, and parts of the <span class="loc">Ciudad Miguel Aleman</span> crossing are readily visible. Because of the arresting views, this location is frequently used by television journalists, public officials, and others who visit the region who want an 'on the border' visual.</p><br><br>
