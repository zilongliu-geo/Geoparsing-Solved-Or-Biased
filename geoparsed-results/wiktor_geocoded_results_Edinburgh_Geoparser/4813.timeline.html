  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Middleton</span> is a civil parish in <span class="loc">Milton Keynes</span>, <span class="loc">Buckinghamshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The parish is centred on <span class="loc">Milton Keynes</span> Village, the village that gave its name to the '<span class="loc">New City</span>' of <span class="loc">Milton Keynes</span>, which began to be developed during <span class="date">the late 1960s</span>. The Village also gives its name to the local civil parish, of which <span class="per">Middleton</span> is the more populated district. The village was originally known as Middeltone (11th century); then later as <span class="per">Middelton</span> Kaynes or Caynes (13th century); <span class="loc">Milton Keynes</span> (15th century); and Milton alias <span class="per">Middelton Gaynes</span> (17th century). After the Norman invasion, the de Cahaines family held the manor from <span class="date">1166</span> to the late 13th century as well as others in the country (<span class="loc">Ashton Keynes</span>, <span class="loc">Somerford Keynes</span>, and <span class="loc">Horsted Keynes</span>). During this time the village became known as <span class="per">Middleton de Keynes</span> eventually shortening to <span class="loc">Milton Keynes</span>. The original core village of the district, along <span class="loc">Walton Road</span> and <span class="loc">Broughton Road</span>, has retained its "<span class="loc">Milton Keynes</span>" road signs and has an attractive collection of rural village houses and a thatched pub which dates back to the 13th century. It is <span class="date">now</span> known as "<span class="loc">Milton Keynes</span> Village".</p><br><br>
