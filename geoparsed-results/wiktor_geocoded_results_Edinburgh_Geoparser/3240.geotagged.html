<p><span class="loc">Charlestown</span> is a suburb of the City of <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, and the largest town within the City. It is approximately 10 kilometres (6 mi) west-south-west of the central business <span class="loc">district of Newcastle</span>. <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> has the largest business centre within the <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span> city, with a greater turnover than that of the neighbouring Newcastle CBD. The suburb serves as the district's transport hub. Originally granted to the Waratah Coal Company, the area was the site of the company's first shaft, sunk in 1873. Officially called <span class="loc">South Waratah</span>, the pit was variously known as Charles' Pit, <span class="loc">Raspberry Gully</span> or The Gully Pit. These names all applied to <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> in its early days and the surviving name seem to have been derived from that of Charles Smith, the company's manager. The first settlers were miners from the pit. The company had the area surveyed on 29 April 1876; the first subdivision later became Ida Street, <span class="loc">Pearson Street</span>, <span class="loc">Milson Street</span> and Frederick Streets. Harry Wright bought the first lot when it was auctioned later in 1876.</p>
