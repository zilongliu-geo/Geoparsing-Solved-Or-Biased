<p><span class="loc">Riverton</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Sangamon County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,455 at the 2010 census, up from 3,062 in 2000. It is part of the <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Riverton</span> was founded by John Taylor in 1837. Originally named Judy's Ferry for the ferry crossing the <span class="loc">Sangamon River</span> there. Then <span class="loc">Jamestown</span>, after politician James Shields, the village was successful for about a decade, producing lumber for a planned railroad. When it was discovered that the railroad was badly constructed and unreliable, <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> fell into economic distress and the land on which it sat was sold. The town was sold to Joseph Loose of <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, then again to John D. Keedy, a <span class="loc">Springfield</span> distiller. Land south of <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was purchased and a distillery was put up. Yet again, the properties were lost, first mortgaged to Jacob Bunn, then given as a claim settlement to Parley L. Howlett, another distiller. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was soon renamed Howlett, Shields had fallen from popularity, and a new flour mill and coal mine caused a short-lived boom. Despite their success, most of Howlett was sold to Jacob Bunn to pay off debt. Bunn started selling the lots to the residents, the only owner to do so. After a state requirement was passed preventing communities from being named after people, Howlett was rechristened as <span class="loc">Riverton</span> in the 1870s. In 1876, train robber Jesse James spent a night in <span class="loc">Riverton</span> while en route to a bank heist in <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. Al Capone also reportedly used <span class="loc">Riverton</span> as one of his hideouts.</p>
