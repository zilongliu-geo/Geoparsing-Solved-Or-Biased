<p>Lowell is the westernmost town in <span class="loc">Orleans County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 738 at the 2000 census. Budget - $1,199,600 Principal - Anita Gagner School Board Members - Steven Mason, Chair - Laurie Pion, Member - Kevin Hodgeman, Member Lowell Graded School offers Pre-K - 8. There are 119 students. 56 students from Lowell attend North Country Union High School. Circa 400 million years ago, large and slow moving upheavals formed the serpentine rock and the asbestos fiber which sometimes accompanies serpentine. This serpentine comprises Brown's Ledges at the Lowell-Westfield border. Today, a rare fern species, Adiantum viridimontanum, grows there which can tolerate the high nickel content of serpentine. Serpentine also contains iron, so much so that some rocks can be magnetized. This affects where cell towers can be placed in town. The iron oxide gives the color brown to "Brown's Ledges." The major <span class="loc">Baie Verte</span> fault line runs through Lowell. The Burgess branch of the river follows the fault with serpentine rocks on one side and nonserpentine rocks on the other.</p>
