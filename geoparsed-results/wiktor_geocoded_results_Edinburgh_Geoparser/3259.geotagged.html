<p><span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is a small town founded in 1848 in the <span class="loc">Orange River</span> Sovereignty (as the region was then named). The town situated in a rural farming district, and is the third oldest town in present-day <span class="loc">Free State</span>, (after <span class="loc">Philippolis</span> and <span class="loc">Winburg</span>). From the 1830s onwards, numbers of white settlers from the <span class="loc">Cape Colony</span> crossed the <span class="loc">Orange River</span> and started arriving in the fertile southern part of territory known as the Lower <span class="loc">Caledon</span> Valley, in which the commonage of <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> would later be established. The Lower <span class="loc">Caledon</span> Valley, named after the <span class="loc">Caledon River</span> that runs through it, was at that time occupied by herders and their cattle under the authority of the Basotho king Moshoesoe. In 1845, a treaty was signed between Moeshoe and the British colonial authorities headed by the <span class="loc">Cape Colony</span> governor Sir <span class="loc">Harry Smith</span>. The treaty recognised white occupation in the area, though no boundaries were stipulated. In early <span class="loc">South Africa</span>, European notions of boundaries and private land ownership had no counterparts in African political culture. To the local African chieftains, customary tribute in the form of horses and cattle represented acceptance by the reigning chief of land use under his authority. To both the <span class="loc">Boer</span> and the British settlers, the same form of tribute was believed to constitute purchase and permanent ownership of the land under independent authority.</p>
