<p><span class="loc">Columbus</span> was a borax mining boom town in <span class="loc">Esmeralda County</span>. Its remnants are located on the edge of the <span class="loc">Columbus</span> <span class="loc">Salt Marsh</span>. Settlement came to the <span class="loc">Columbus</span> <span class="loc">Salt Marsh</span> in 1865 with the raising of a quartz mill. <span class="loc">Columbus</span> was the ideal location for a mill, as it was the only stop for several miles with sufficient amounts of water for the operation of a mill. It wasn't until 1871 that borax was discovered near the town's site, and as a result <span class="loc">Columbus</span> increased substantially in its importance. Shortly after the discovery of borax by William Troop four borax companies were actively working the deposits on the marsh. <span class="loc">Columbus</span>' zenith occurred around 1875 when there was around 1,000 people in the town. By that same year many businesses flourished in <span class="loc">Columbus</span> as well as a post office and local newspaper, The Borax Miner. By 1881 borax mining activity had practically ceased and approximately 100 people were left in the community. Shortly thereafter, all mining and milling operations completely ceased. William Caruthers, in his "Loafing Along Death Valley Trails" (Ontario: Death Valley Publishing Co., 1951) says that Francis M. "Borax" Smith discovered the borax at <span class="loc">Columbus Marsh</span>.</p>
