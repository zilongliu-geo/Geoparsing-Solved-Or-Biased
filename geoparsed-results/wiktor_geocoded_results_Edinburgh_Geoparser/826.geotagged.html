<p>Cambridge (Māori: Kemureti) is a town in the <span class="loc">Waipa District</span> of the <span class="loc">Waikato Region</span> of the <span class="loc">North Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. Situated 24 kilometres southeast of <span class="loc">Hamilton</span>, on the banks of the <span class="loc">Waikato River</span>, <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is known as "The Town of Trees &amp; Champions". The town has a population of 19,200, making it the largest town in the <span class="loc">Waipa District</span>, and third largest urban area in the <span class="loc">Waikato</span> (after <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> and <span class="loc">Taupo</span>). Prior to the arrival of Europeans there were a number of pā in the vicinity of what would become Cambridge. In the 1850s missionaries and farmers from <span class="loc">Britain</span> settled in the area and introduced modern farming practices to local Māori, helping them set up two flour mills and importing grinding wheels from <span class="loc">England</span> and <span class="loc">France</span>. During the 1850s wheat was a profitable cash crop but when merchants in <span class="loc">Auckland</span> began purchasing cheaper grain from <span class="loc">Australia</span> the market went into decline. The European town of Cambridge was established when the 3rd Regiment of the <span class="loc">Waikato</span> Militia were settled there in 1864 following the Invasion of the <span class="loc">Waikato</span>. The town was named after Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army at the time.</p>
