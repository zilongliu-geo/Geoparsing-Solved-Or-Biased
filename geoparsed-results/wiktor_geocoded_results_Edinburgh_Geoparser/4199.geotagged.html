<p><span class="loc">Alhambra</span> (/ælˈhæmbrə/ or /ɑːlˈhɑːmbrə/; Spanish: [aˈlambɾa]) is a city located in the western <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Gabriel</span> Valley region of <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, approximately eight miles from the Downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> civic center. It was incorporated on July 11, 1903. As of the 2010 census, the population was 83,089. The city's ZIP codes are 91801 and 91803 (plus 91802 for P.O. boxes). <span class="loc">Alhambra</span>'s roots begin with the San Gabriel Mission, founded on September 8, 1771, and the native people, Tongva, who inhabited the area before the arrival of the Spanish. The land that would later become <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> was part of a 300,000 acre land grant given to Manuel Nieto by the Spanish. In 1820 <span class="loc">Mexico</span> won its independence from the Spanish crown and lands once ruled by them became part of the <span class="loc">Mexican Republic</span>. These lands then transferred into the hands of the <span class="loc">United States</span> following the defeat in the Mexican-American War. A wealthy developer, Benjamin Davis Wilson, married Ramona Yorba, daughter of Bernardo Yorba, who owned the land which would become <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> and with the persuasion of his daughter Ruth named the land developed after a book she was reading. <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> is named after Washington Irving's book Tales of the <span class="loc">Alhambra</span>, that he was inspired to write by his extended visit to the <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> palace in <span class="loc">Granada</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>. <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> was founded as a suburb of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> that remained an unincorporated area during the mid-19th century. The first school in <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> was Ramona Convent Secondary School, built on hillside property donated by the prominent James de Barth Shorb family. Thirteen years before the city was incorporated, several prominent <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Valley families interested in the Catholic education of their daughters established the school in 1890. The city's first public high school, Alhambra High School, was established in 1898, five years before the city's incorporation. On July 11, 1903, the <span class="loc">City of Alhambra</span> was incorporated. The Alhambra Fire Department was established in 1906.</p>
