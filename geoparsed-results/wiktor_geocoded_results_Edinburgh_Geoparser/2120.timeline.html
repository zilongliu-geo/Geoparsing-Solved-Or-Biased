  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hopewell</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Mercer County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 1,922, reflecting a decline of 113 (-5.6%) from the 2,035 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 67 (+3.4%) from the 1,968 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> was incorporated as a borough by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on <span class="date">April 14, 1891</span>, from portions of <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> Township, based on the results of a referendum held on <span class="date">March 21, 1891</span>. Additional portions of <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> Township were annexed in <span class="date">1915</span>, and the borough was reincorporated in <span class="date">1924</span>. The first Colonial influence in <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> was the purchase of a 30,000-acre (120 km2) tract of land by <span class="per">Daniel Coxe</span> a Royal British governor of <span class="loc">West Jersey</span>, in the latter half of the 17th century. All land in <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> can be traced back to this purchase. In <span class="date">1691</span> <span class="per">Coxe</span>, transferred his land to a company called The <span class="loc">West Jersey</span> Society of <span class="loc">England</span>, who intended to sell the land. The society appointed an agent, <span class="per">Thomas Revell</span>, to preside over the land and sell it to prospective buyers. <span class="per">Revell</span> then attracted settlers from <span class="loc">New England</span>, <span class="loc">Long Island</span>, and <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> with questionable incentives, saying that the land was fertile, and tame. However, the families that arrived in <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> only found vast stretches of wilderness. The first settler in <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> Valley was <span class="per">Thomas Tindall</span> who on <span class="date">November 10, 1699</span> bought a 300-acre (1.2 km2) tract of land from The <span class="loc">West Jersey</span> Society of <span class="loc">England</span> through <span class="per">Revell</span>, for "ten pounds per hundred acres". Other early settlers in <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> are said to be the <span class="loc">Stouts</span>, who immigrated from <span class="loc">Holmdel</span> to <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> in <span class="date">1706</span>. Perhaps the first conflict between colonists in <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> was the dispute between <span class="per">Revell</span> and the early inhabitants of <span class="loc">Hopewell</span>, who realized that their deeds were worthless due to Revell’s false claims. Fifty settlers then organized a class action lawsuit against <span class="per">Revell</span> and the <span class="loc">West Jersey</span> Society. The long and arduous trial took place in <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, and eventually ruled against the settlers, who were forced to repurchase their land or relocate. Many settlers weren’t able to repay and moved north into North Jersey and <span class="loc">New York</span>.</p><br><br>
