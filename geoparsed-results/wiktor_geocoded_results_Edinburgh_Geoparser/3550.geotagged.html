<p>Alameda is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Portland</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> that is located on the Alameda Ridge with views of Downtown, the <span class="loc">Willamette River</span>, and the Cascades. Northeast Fremont Street is the neighborhood’s main east-west thoroughfare and NE 33rd, its main north-south thoroughfare, makes up its eastern boundary. The neighborhood is adjacent to <span class="loc">Wilshire</span> Park, a 14.4-acre (58,000 m2) neighborhood park. The community’s side streets wind around the hill, past cottages and expansive Craftsman homes. Alameda is located between the business <span class="loc">districts of Beaumont Village</span> and the <span class="loc">Hollywood District</span>. The Alameda neighborhood was established on the 1859 land claim of William C. Bowering and his wife, Isabelle. The area became known as Gravelly Hill Road for a gravel pit at NE 33rd and Fremont. In 1909, the Alameda Land Company laid out the Alameda Park subdivision that was then annexed to the <span class="loc">city of Portland</span>. The development advertised an extremely broad exclusion in its printed brochure, declaring "no people of undesirable colors and kinds." The name comes from the Spanish word "alamo," meaning a poplar or cottonwood tree. "Alameda" means, precisely, a public walk or promenade lined with poplar trees, and, by extension, a street lined with trees, like the English word "parkway."</p>
