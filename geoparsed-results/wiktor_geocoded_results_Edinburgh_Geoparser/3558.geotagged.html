<p><span class="loc">Falmouth</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Stafford County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Situated on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Rappahannock River</span> at the falls, the community is north of and opposite the <span class="loc">city of Fredericksburg</span>. Recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place (CDP), <span class="loc">Falmouth</span>'s population was 4,274 as of the 2010 census. Founded in 1728 by the same act of the Virginia Assembly that established neighboring <span class="loc">Fredericksburg</span>, <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> was created as a port town on the <span class="loc">Rappahannock</span> to serve inhabitants living north of the river within the vast <span class="loc">Northern Neck</span> holdings of Lord Fairfax. His agent, Robert "King" Carter, promoted the establishment of the town, and the Carter family played a dominant role in the town's development throughout much of the colonial period. Originally located within King George County, <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> became part of <span class="loc">Stafford County</span> when county lines were redrawn in 1776. During the American Civil War, <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> was occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863, and Northern commanders located their headquarters southeast of the town during the <span class="loc">Fredericksburg</span> and <span class="loc">Chancellorsville</span> campaigns. In May 1864, Union wounded and Confederate prisoners from the battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania <span class="loc">Court House</span> were transported through the area to the wharves at <span class="loc">Belle Plain</span> on <span class="loc">Potomac Creek</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Potomac River</span>, located east of <span class="loc">Falmouth</span>.</p>
