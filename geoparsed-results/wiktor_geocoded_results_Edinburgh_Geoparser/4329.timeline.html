  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Nashville</span> (also known as Nashville-on-the-Brazos) was a community on the southeast bank of the <span class="loc">Brazos River</span> in present-day <span class="loc">Milam County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is <span class="date">now</span> a ghost town. The town was surveyed in the <span class="date">fall of 1835</span> with <span class="org">Sterling</span> <span class="per">C. Robertson</span> as its founder. It was named in honor of <span class="loc">Nashville</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="per">Robertson</span>'s birthplace. The town served as the headquarters for <span class="per">Robertson</span>'s Colony. In <span class="date">January 1836</span>, the settlement was attacked by Indians in the area. Two people were killed. This led to the formation of <span class="org">Sterling</span> <span class="per">C. Robertson</span>'s Ranger Company. The rangers constructed Fort Milam at the falls of the <span class="loc">Brazos</span> and a second at the three forks of the <span class="loc">Little River</span>. <span class="loc">Nashville</span> was also designated the seat of justice for Milam municipality in <span class="date">1836</span>. Following the <span class="loc">Texas Revolution</span>, <span class="loc">Nashville</span> was considered by the <span class="loc">Texas</span> Congress as a possible site for the capital of the Republic of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. From <span class="date">1837</span> to <span class="date">1846</span>, the town served as the <span class="loc">Milam County</span> seat. It began to slowly decline after <span class="date">1846</span>, when the state legislature moved the county seat to Cameron. In <span class="date">1868</span>, the arrival of the <span class="loc">Houston</span> and <span class="org">Texas Central Railroad</span> at nearby <span class="loc">Hearne</span> provided the remaining residents with the incentive to move. The town's post office closed that same year.</p><br><br>
