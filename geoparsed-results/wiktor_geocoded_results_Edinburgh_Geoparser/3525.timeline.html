  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> (named for <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>, <span class="loc">Israel</span>), known to Māori as Hiruhārama, is a settlement 66 kilometres (41 mi) up the <span class="loc">Whanganui</span> River from <span class="loc">Whanganui</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. Originally called Patiarero, it was one of the largest settlements on the <span class="loc">Whanganui</span> River in the 1840s, with several hundred Ngāti Hau inhabitants of the iwi Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi. Unlike other <span class="loc">Whanganui</span> River settlements given transliterated place names by Reverend <span class="per">Richard Taylor</span> in the 1850s, <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> is usually referred to using the English version of its name. It grew into several small settlements, including <span class="loc">Roma</span> (<span class="loc">Rome</span>) and Peterehama (<span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>), founded by the remain of <span class="per">Taylor</span>'s congregation after the majority converted to Catholicism when a Roman Catholic mission was built in <span class="date">1854</span>. <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> was the isolated site where, in <span class="date">1892</span>, <span class="per">Suzanne Aubert</span> (better known as <span class="per">Mother Mary Joseph</span>) established the congregation of <span class="org">the Sisters of Compassion</span>. They became a highly respected charitable nursing/religious order. <span class="per">Aubert</span> also established the <span class="org">Jerusalem Foundling Home</span> in <span class="date">1886</span> which housed and cared for abandoned children from around <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. A convent remains on the mission property, as well as the church which replaced the original building destroyed by fire in <span class="date">1888</span>, and <span class="org">Sisters of Compassion</span> still care for them.</p><br><br>
