Shashawna <span class="per">Diane Odell</span>, 27, of the 500 block of <span class="per">Lou Lane</span>, was charged with robbery, tampering with evidence and hindering the apprehension/punishent of a criminal. She was held without bond <span class="date">Monday</span> in the <span class="org">Columbia County Detention Center</span>, according to jail records. Police said her boyfriend <span class="per">Christopher Grier</span>, of the 700 block of <span class="loc">Knox Road</span> in <span class="loc">Harlem</span>, is suspected in the armed robbery <span class="date">Friday</span> of two individuals in their <span class="loc">Grovetown</span> home. At first, police believed <span class="per">Mr. Grier</span> committed the robbery, then kidnapped <span class="per">Ms. Odell</span> and their 7-month-old son and made her drive him to <span class="loc">Monroeville</span>, <span class="loc">Ala</span>. An Amber Alert was issued for <span class="per">Ms. Odell</span> and her son after she called her mother in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C</span>. The mother called police, saying her daughter had been kidnapped, said Investigator <span class="per">Scott Wheatley</span> of the <span class="org">Grovetown Department of Public Safety</span>. Police found <span class="per">Ms. Odell</span> and stopped her in <span class="loc">Newton County</span>, <span class="loc">Ga</span>. After they confirmed that she and the baby were safe, <span class="per">Ms. Odell</span> drove back to <span class="loc">Harlem</span> on <span class="date">Sunday</span>. <span class="loc">Grovetown</span> police then questioned <span class="per">Ms. Odell</span>, who admitted that she willingly drove <span class="per">Mr. Grier</span> to <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. She also told police that she drove the getaway car for <span class="per">Mr. Grier</span> as he conducted the robbery and disposed of the gun he used, <span class="per">Investigator Wheatley</span> said. The gun was recovered on Kings Way in <span class="per">Harlem</span>. <span class="per">Mr. Grier</span> is wanted for the robbery, but the kidnapping warrants have been dropped, <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> sheriff's Capt. <span class="per">Steve Morris</span> said.</p><br><br>
