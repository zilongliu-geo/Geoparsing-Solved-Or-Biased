<p><span class="loc">Newport</span> is a residential suburb of the Moreton Bay Region at the north of the Redcliffe peninsula, approximately 29 kilometres (18 mi) north-northeast of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, the state capital of <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The suburb of <span class="loc">Newport</span> was gazetted as the Place Name Decision Notice (No 21) 2008 in the <span class="loc">Queensland</span> Government Gazette â€“ Natural Resources and Water on August 15, 2008 (2008-08-15), after a submission by the then <span class="loc">Redcliffe City</span> Council to the Queensland Government Department of Natural Resources and Water in October 2006. An earlier, unsuccessful attempt by the council to create the suburb was made in the 1990s. Until 2008, <span class="loc">Newport</span> was made up of two areas - with that east of Albatross &amp; Walkers Creek Canal being <span class="loc">Scarborough</span>, and that on the western side being part of Kippa-Ring. Currently, new land is being cleared and canals being dug out to form the next stage of the suburb to the west of the current established area. The name <span class="loc">Newport</span> comes from the Newport Waterways housing estate that began development in the late 1970s; the artificial canals first filled with water in 1979.</p>
