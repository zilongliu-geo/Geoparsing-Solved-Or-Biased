  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Canada</span> (/ˈkænədə/; French: [ka.na.da]) is a country in the northern part of <span class="loc">North America</span>. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the <span class="loc">Arctic Ocean</span>, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s border with the <span class="loc">United States</span> is the world's longest land border. <span class="loc">Canada</span> is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the <span class="loc">Rocky Mountains</span>; about four-fifths of the country's population of 35 million people live near the southern border. The majority of <span class="loc">Canada</span> has a cold or severely cold <span class="date">winter</span> climate, but southerly areas are warm in <span class="date">summer</span>. The land <span class="date">now</span> called <span class="loc">Canada</span> has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the Atlantic coast, with the first establishment of a region called "<span class="loc">Canada</span>" occurring in <span class="date">1537</span>. As a consequence of various conflicts, the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> gained and lost territories within British <span class="loc">North America</span> until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly geographically comprises <span class="loc">Canada</span> <span class="date">today</span>. Pursuant to the British <span class="loc">North America Act</span>, on <span class="date">July 1, 1867</span>, the colonies of <span class="loc">Canada</span>, <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span>, and <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> joined to form the autonomous federal <span class="loc">Dominion of Canada</span>. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern <span class="loc">Canada</span>. In <span class="date">1931</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> achieved near total independence from the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> with the Statute of <span class="loc">Westminster</span> <span class="date">1931</span>, and full sovereignty was attained when the <span class="loc">Canada</span> Act <span class="date">1982</span> removed the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the British parliament.</p><br><br>
