  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The parish of <span class="loc">Saint James</span> ("<span class="loc">St. James</span>") is an area located in the western central part of the country of <span class="loc">Barbados</span>. Increasingly <span class="loc">St. James</span> is becoming known as the playground of the rich and famous, and a haven for sun-starved tourists. In local colloquium, <span class="loc">St. James</span> was known as the "<span class="loc">Gold Coast</span>", but due to its ongoing popularity it is <span class="date">now</span> referred to as the "Platinum Coast", reflective of the parishes many glitzy beach-front mansions, pristine beaches, luxury hotels and consistently high land prices. Many Barbadians say within the Platinum Coast there are billionaires such as the deceased <span class="per">Sathya Sai Baba</span> and others own property somewhere within a 6-mile stretch of beach on the island. The parish also has great historic significance, as it was here that the first British settlers landed in <span class="date">1625</span>. Under the authority of <span class="per">King James</span>, the British claimed <span class="loc">Barbados</span> upon landing in <span class="loc">St. James</span>' present-day <span class="loc">city of Holetown</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Jamestown</span>, named after the King himself); this settlement turned <span class="loc">Barbados</span> into what would later be known as "<span class="loc">Little England</span>".</p><br><br>
