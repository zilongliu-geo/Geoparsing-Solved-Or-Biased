<p>Developer wants to remake downtown <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> as outlet mall. Craig Kaser of Terremark Partners recently presented downtown property owners with a proposal to occupy empty retail space with the discount versions of upscale chains such as J. Crew and Banana Republic. Earlier, <span class="loc">Kaser</span> helped to transform East Fourth Street into an entertainment and restaurant district. Market analyst Richard Tunstall worked with <span class="loc">Kaser</span> on the outlet plan and says the stores would draw bargain shoppers who don't like the long trips to outlet malls in <span class="loc">Geauga</span> and <span class="loc">Medina</span> counties. But Joe Marinucci of the Downtown Cleveland Alliance says shoppers might need to be offered a break on downtown parking.</p>
