<p>The <span class="loc">City of Thornton</span> is a Home Rule Municipality in Adams and Weld counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, located in the northeast quadrant of the Denver-Aurora-Broomfield, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area. Thornton is 10 miles (16 km) north/northeast of downtown <span class="loc">Denver</span>. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau reported the city's growing population at 118,772 on April 1, 2010, a 44.2% increase from the 2000 Census population of 82,384. Thornton is the sixth most populous city in the state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span> and the 213th most populous city in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Thornton consisted solely of farmland until 1953 when Sam Hoffman purchased a lot off Washington Street about seven miles (11 km) north of <span class="loc">Denver</span>. The town he laid out was the first fully planned community in <span class="loc">Adams County</span>, and the first to offer full municipal services from a single tax levy, including recreation services and free trash pickup. Thornton was named in honor of Former Colorado Governor Dan Thornton. The Thornton Community Association (TCA) was formed in 1954 to help guide the new community's development. By the end of 1955, Thornton had 5,500 residents in over 1,200 homes. The TCA was instrumental in Thornton's 1956 incorporation as a city. Oyer G. Leary was elected the first mayor.</p>
