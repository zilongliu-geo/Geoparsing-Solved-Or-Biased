The area still however has a <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> postcode "L24" In spite of being close to the <span class="loc">City of Liverpool</span>, the village’s tranquil and quiet atmosphere still survives today. The many whitewashed cottages, with country gardens, set against a background of mature trees, present an attractive picture in the spring and summer. The visitor will quickly appreciate why Hale has several times won ‘Best - Kept Village’ awards in the late 1960s and more recently several "Community Pride" and "Little Gem Awards" for several locations in the village. Situated on Grade One agricultural land, Hale s surrounded by several farms and rolling countryside.</p>
