  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hopewell</span> is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 22,591. The <span class="org">Bureau of Economic Analysis</span> combines the <span class="loc">city of Hopewell</span> with <span class="per">Prince George County</span> for statistical purposes. <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> is in the Tri-Cities area of the <span class="loc">Richmond Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area (MSA). The city was founded to take advantage of its site overlooking the <span class="per">James</span> and <span class="per">Appomattox</span> Rivers. <span class="loc">City Point</span>, the oldest part of <span class="loc">Hopewell</span>, was established in <span class="date">1613</span> by <span class="per">Sir Thomas</span> Dale. It was first known as "<span class="loc">Bermuda City</span>," which was changed to <span class="loc">Charles City</span>, lengthened to Charles <span class="loc">City Point</span>, and later abbreviated to <span class="loc">City Point</span>. (At this time, <span class="loc">Bermuda</span>, the Atlantic archipelago, was considered part of the Colony of Virginia and appeared on its maps.) Hopewell/<span class="loc">City Point</span> is the oldest continuously inhabited English settlement in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> no longer being inhabited. "Charles <span class="loc">City Point</span>" was in <span class="loc">Charles City</span> Shire when the first eight shires were established in the Colony of Virginia in <span class="date">1634</span>. <span class="loc">Charles City</span> Shire soon became known as Charles <span class="loc">City County</span> in <span class="date">1637</span>. In <span class="date">1619</span> <span class="per">Samuel Sharpe</span> and <span class="per">Samuel Jordan</span> from <span class="loc">City Point</span>, then named <span class="loc">Charles City</span>, were burgesses at the first meeting of the <span class="org">House of Burgesses</span>.</p><br><br>
