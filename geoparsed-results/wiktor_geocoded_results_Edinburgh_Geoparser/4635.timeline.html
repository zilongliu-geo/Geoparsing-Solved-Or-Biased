  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alliance is a village in central <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Established as a station on a Canadian National (CN) line in <span class="date">1916</span>, Alliance became a village in <span class="date">1918</span>. It is located on Highway 602, approximately 160 km (99 mi) east of <span class="loc">Red Deer</span>. The village is 2 km (1.2 mi) east of Veterans Memorial Highway (Highway 36) and 2.5 km (1.6 mi) north of the <span class="loc">Battle River</span>. Prior to European settlement, the area surrounding <span class="date">the future</span> site of Alliance was, at times, home to First Nations tribes who roamed the plains. The area was also the site of several confrontations between <span class="per">Cree</span> and <span class="per">Blackfoot</span> tribes, giving rise to the name <span class="loc">Battle River</span>. At the time of <span class="org">Canadian Confederation</span> in <span class="date">1867</span>, <span class="loc">Alberta</span> was still owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, and European missionaries spread Christianity through the native tribes. In <span class="date">1904</span>, prior to <span class="loc">Alberta</span> becoming a province, homesteaders arrived in the area to establish ranches. By <span class="date">1910</span>, the area surrounding what is <span class="date">now</span> Alliance was well populated by Europeans, and in <span class="date">January 1916</span>, the Canadian Northern Railway arrived in the young community. The name 'Alliance' was chosen by resident <span class="per">Tom Edwards</span>, who named the community after his home city in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, Alliance, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. Shortly after the community's establishment, regular church services began. The first church service was held in a pool hall, with most of the congregation seated on the pool tables.</p><br><br>
