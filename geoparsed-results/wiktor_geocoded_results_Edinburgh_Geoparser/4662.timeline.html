  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lee</span> (also <span class="loc">Lee Green</span>) is a suburban district of south east <span class="loc">London</span>, within the <span class="loc">London Boroughs</span> of <span class="loc">Lewisham</span> and <span class="loc">Greenwich</span>. It is located west of <span class="loc">Eltham</span> and south east of <span class="loc">Lewisham</span>. Until <span class="date">1889</span> the district was in the <span class="loc">county of Kent</span>. <span class="per">St Margaret</span>'s Church (built <span class="date">1839</span>â€“41, architect: <span class="per">John Brown</span>) is the burial place of three Astronomers Royal: <span class="per">Edmond Halley</span>, <span class="per">Nathaniel Bliss</span> and <span class="per">John Pond</span>. The Manor of <span class="loc">Lee</span> was a historic parish of the <span class="loc">Blackheath</span> hundred and existed up to <span class="date">1900</span> when it was merged with the <span class="loc">parish of Lewisham</span> to create the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Lewisham</span>. While modern <span class="loc">Lee</span> is centred on <span class="loc">Lee</span> railway station and the road of Burnt <span class="loc">Ash Hill</span>, the parish was based around <span class="loc">Lee</span> High Road which <span class="date">today</span> stretches into the town centre of <span class="loc">Lewisham</span>. The River Quaggy formed much of the boundary between the two parishes, though at <span class="loc">Lee</span> Bridge (at the western end of <span class="loc">Lee</span> High Road) it is <span class="date">now</span> almost completely hidden. The <span class="loc">Lee</span> Manor Society have produced a comprehensive history of the area. The Domesday Book describes <span class="loc">Lee</span> as a small area of cultivation set in extensive woodland. The earliest map available (Rocque's of <span class="date">1740</span>) shows a cluster of about a dozen houses around a triangular village green. This hamlet was surrounded by fields. <span class="loc">Lee</span> <span class="loc">Green Farm</span> occupied the south-east quadrant from the 1660s (roughly on the site of the present Leegate shopping centre). The farm was demolished in the 1840s and rebuilt as <span class="loc">Tudor House</span> further east.</p><br><br>
