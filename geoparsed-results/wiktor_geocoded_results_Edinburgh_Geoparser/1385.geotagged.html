<p>Gladstone is a city in <span class="loc">Delta County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. It is also known locally as "Happy Rock", a play on words of Gladstone. First settled in 1877, Gladstone's original name was Minnewasca. The population was 4,973 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highways 2 and 41 run concurrently through the city, connecting with Escanaba, nine miles (14 km) to the south. <span class="loc">US</span> 41 runs north to <span class="loc">Marquette</span> and <span class="loc">US</span> 2 runs east to Manistique. M-35 runs northwest 52 miles (84 km) to <span class="loc">Gwinn</span> and merges with <span class="loc">US</span> 2/<span class="loc">US</span> 41 south to Escanaba. Throughout the early 19th century, the area where Gladstone exists was largely uninhabited other than Ojibwe hunters in the area or the occasional Euro-American trapper or fisherman. Gladstone was first settled in 1859 when the Hamilton Corporation of <span class="loc">Fayette</span>, <span class="loc">MI</span> began using it as a shipping point for selling and transporting of their iron ore. [Gladstone Centennial Book Community (1987). Gladstone Centennial History. Gladstone Centennial Book Community. Pp 12â€“47. ASIN B0010K5HFW] The town was originally named Minnewasca by the Soo Line Railroad, the Ojibwa name meaning "white water." When the name was filed with the county and Secretary of State in <span class="loc">Lansing</span>, Senator W. D. <span class="loc">Washburn</span>, who had an interest in building the railroad, persuaded officials to change the name to <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> in honor of British premier, William Evert Gladstone.</p>
