  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Burke is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Shoshone County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Once a thriving silver, lead and zinc mining community, it is far smaller <span class="date">now</span> than at its height. In <span class="date">2002</span>, about 300 people lived in or nearby in the lengthy and narrow Burke-Canyon, about 300 feet (90 m) in width. In its early <span class="date">years</span>, Burke was home to the Hercules silver mine, the owners of which were implicated in the <span class="loc">Idaho</span> mining wars of <span class="date">1899</span>. Burke was also the location of the <span class="loc">Hecla</span> and Star mines. After <span class="date">years</span> of decline, Burke mining operations finally ceased in <span class="date">1981</span> with the closing of the Star mine; which reopened for a short period in <span class="date">the 1990s</span>. In <span class="date">recent years</span>, <span class="org">Hecla Mining Company</span> has been exploring the potential of exploiting additional resource deposits in the Star mine. As of <span class="date">December 31, 2012</span>, <span class="loc">Hecla</span> invested $7 million in rehabilitation and exploration with published estimates suggesting the potential to recover in excess of 25 million ounces of silver from the site with significant zinc and lead deposits also present. Burke is located about 7 miles (11 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Wallace</span>, at an elevation of 3,700 feet (1,130 m) above sea level. It is accessed from <span class="loc">Wallace</span> on Burke-Canyon Creek Road (State Highway 4).</p><br><br>
