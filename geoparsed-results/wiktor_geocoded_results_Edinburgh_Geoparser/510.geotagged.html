<p>Jackson is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Breathitt County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the seat of its county. The population was 2,231 according to the 2010 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census. It was the home of the Jackson Academy, which became Lees College. Upon the creation of <span class="loc">Breathitt County</span> in 1839, local landowner Simon Cockrell Sr. donated 10 acres (4.0 ha) to serve as its seat of government. The community was originally known as Breathitt, Breathitt Town, or Breathitt <span class="loc">Court House</span> after the county, but upon its incorporation as a city by the state legislature in 1843, it was renamed Jackson to honor the recently deceased former president Andrew Jackson. Local feuds led the national press to publish stories about Jackson and "Bloody Breathitt": state troops were dispatched twice in the 1870s and again in 1903 – after the assassination of a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> commissioner – to restore order. The Kentucky Union Railroad reached the city in 1891, and Jackson boomed until the L&amp;N continued the line on to Hazard in 1912. A fire on Halloween, 1913, burned down much of the town.</p>
