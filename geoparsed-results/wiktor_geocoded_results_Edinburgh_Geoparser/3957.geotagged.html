<p><span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is an unincorporated area of <span class="loc">Nashville</span>, located roughly 13 miles southwest of the downtown area via Interstate 40. It is served by the Metropolitan Government of <span class="loc">Nashville</span> and <span class="loc">Davidson County</span>. In the 1950s, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> was a small community which existed primarily to serve the needs of nearby farms. It was located mostly along the railroad tracks near the <span class="loc">Harpeth River</span>, and had only a few buildings such as a hardware store, post office, and a Masonic lodge hall. The suburbanization was made official when the United States Postal Service changed the designation of the office there from "<span class="loc">Bellview</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>" to a branch of the <span class="loc">Nashville</span> office in the late 1970s. Since the year 2000, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> has grown in population and development in the already established areas along <span class="loc">Old Hickory</span>, and now it is becoming progressively more lit. It also has Boulevard and Hwy 70S, as well as in the more affluent developments off <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> State Highway 100. There are three commercial retail hotspots in the <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> area which are located near the Highway 70/I-40 interchange, at the intersection of Highway 70 and <span class="loc">Old Hickory</span> Boulevard; and near the intersection of Old Harding Pike and Highway 100.</p>
