  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Perth</span> /ˈpɜːrθ/ is a town in <span class="loc">Eastern Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Tay River</span>, 83 kilometres (52 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">Ottawa</span>, and is the seat of <span class="loc">Lanark County</span>. The town was established as a military settlement in <span class="date">1816</span>, shortly after the War of <span class="date">1812</span>. Many of the first settlers were military veterans on half pay, while others were military veterans from <span class="loc">France</span>, <span class="loc">Germany</span>, <span class="loc">Poland</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span> or <span class="loc">Ireland</span> who were offered land in return for their service. The Rev. <span class="per">William Bell</span>, who arrived in <span class="date">June 1817</span>, noted in his diaries that the settlement was more European than the Scottish settlement described to him. A wave of Scottish and Irish immigrants quickly followed. Many of the Scottish immigrants were stonemasons; their work can be seen in many area buildings and in the locks of the <span class="loc">Rideau Canal</span>. The first secretary/stores-keeper (and eventually postmaster and superintendent) of the settlement was <span class="per">Daniel Daverne</span>, brought up from <span class="date">the Quarter</span> Masters General Department in <span class="loc">Kingston</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span> to assume these positions. <span class="loc">Perth</span> is home to <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s oldest pioneer burial ground, St. Paul's United Church Cemetery, formerly The <span class="loc">Old Methodist Burying Ground</span>. This cemetery is at the south-east end of the Last Duel Park on <span class="per">Robinson Street</span>. The <span class="per">Craig Street</span> Cemetery, sometimes referred to as the "<span class="loc">Old Burying Grounds</span>" also contains many historic graves and saw use from <span class="date">1820</span>–<span class="date">1873</span>.</p><br><br>
