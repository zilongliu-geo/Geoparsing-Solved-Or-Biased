  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Redmond</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Deschutes County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Incorporated on <span class="date">July 6, 1910</span>, the city is on the eastern side of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>'s <span class="org">Cascade</span> Range, in the <span class="loc">High Desert</span> in Central <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. From <span class="per">Redmond</span> there is access to recreational opportunities, including mountain biking, fishing, hiking, camping, rock climbing, white-water rafting, skiing, and golf. <span class="per">Redmond</span> is a full-service municipality and one of the fastest-growing industrial and residential communities in <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. <span class="per">Redmond</span> had a population of 26,215 in <span class="date">2010</span>, and the population continues to grow at a rate of about 8 percent each year. The city encompasses 15.5 square miles (40 km2) and is on a plateau, at an elevation of 3,077 feet (938 m). <span class="per">Redmond</span> is 15 miles (24 km) north of <span class="loc">Bend—the county</span> seat of <span class="loc">Deschutes</span> County—144 miles (232 km) from <span class="loc">Portland</span>, 129 miles (208 km) from Salem—the capital of Oregon—and 126 miles (203 km) from Eugene. <span class="per">Redmond</span> was named after <span class="per">Frank T. Redmond</span>, who settled in the area in <span class="date">1905</span>. It was platted in <span class="date">1906</span> by a company which would become part of Central <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Irrigation District building a canal. Electrification and the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trunk Railway reached <span class="per">Redmond</span> in <span class="date">1911</span>. The rail link opened markets for farmers and merchants. By <span class="date">1930</span>, the town had grown to 1,000 and by <span class="date">1940</span> had nearly doubled. In <span class="date">the 1940s</span>, <span class="per">Redmond</span> was a <span class="org">U.S. Army Air</span> base and commercial air service was established at <span class="per">Roberts Field</span> after World War II. In <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, 60s, 70s, and most of <span class="date">the 80s</span>, the population remained relatively static, growing slowly around a small commercial/retail center and manufacturing industry. However, during <span class="date">the 1990s</span>, the population began to grow along with most of <span class="loc">Deschutes County</span>. Between <span class="date">2000</span> and <span class="date">2006</span>, <span class="per">Redmond</span>'s population grew 74.3%, making it among <span class="loc">Oregon</span>'s fastest-growing cities each year. This growth continued through <span class="date">2006</span>, increasing the population to 23,500. Its growth is fueled by employment and a lower cost of living.</p><br><br>
