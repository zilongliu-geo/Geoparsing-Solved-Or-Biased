  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Voznesenka</span> (Russian: Вознесенка) is a small unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Kenai Peninsula Borough</span>, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located on the <span class="loc">Kenai Peninsula</span>, about 25 miles east of Homer, <span class="loc">Voznesenka</span> is one of several villages founded by Russian Old Believers in the <span class="loc">Fox River</span> area. The village was founded in <span class="date">1985</span> by residents who decided to leave <span class="loc">Nikolaevsk</span> and begin new settlements in the <span class="loc">Kachemak Bay</span> area. The name in Russian means Ascension (вознестись, voznestis' - to ascend) referring to the holiday of The Ascension. The village is situated on a bluff over <span class="loc">Kachemak Bay</span>, and is the end of the maintained road system on the western <span class="loc">Kenai Peninsula</span>. A switchback trail leads about 1,000 feet (300 m) down to the beach; it can be traveled by foot or 4-wheel drive vehicle except at the highest tides to reach the neighboring village of Kachemak Selo. There are more than 40 families living in <span class="loc">Voznesenka</span>. Although unincorporated, the community has a mayor, a community council, and a water-utility board. There is also a community church and a public school in the village. Emergency services are provided by <span class="org">Kachemak Emergency Services Area Fire</span> and EMS. The community is accessible by gravel road, the paved access road from Homer ending where the village begins. In <span class="date">2009</span> the Mile 17 fire threatened the village.</p><br><br>
