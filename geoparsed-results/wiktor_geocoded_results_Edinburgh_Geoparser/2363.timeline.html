  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ola</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Gem County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located approximately 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Emmett. <span class="loc">Ola</span> was established as a post office <span class="date">July 22, 1882</span>, by <span class="per">Carroll Baird</span>. It serves the Upper Squaw Creek Valley. The first post office in this area was "Upper <span class="loc">Squaw Creek</span>", established in <span class="date">September 1875</span>, by <span class="per">Carroll Baird</span>. <span class="per">Baird</span> homesteaded along <span class="loc">Squaw Creek</span>, less than half a mile west of the present-day site of <span class="loc">Ola</span>. Nellie Ireton Mills writes that the <span class="loc">Bairds</span> built their cabin where the old Indian trail crosses the creek. The trail was also used by miners and others taking the short cut to, or from, <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and the <span class="loc">Boise Basin</span>. Prior to the <span class="date">1875</span> post office, the mail was delivered by pack horse and snowshoes along the <span class="loc">Brownlee</span> Trail from <span class="loc">Horseshoe Bend</span> (<span class="loc">Boise County</span>) to Warren (<span class="loc">Idaho County</span>). <span class="date">Six weeks</span> after the post office was established, <span class="loc">Bairds</span>' bachelor neighbor to the north, <span class="per">Fred Hoffman</span>, was appointed postmaster, a position he held until the post office closed <span class="date">the end of January</span> <span class="date">1877</span>, when mail was sent to <span class="org">Cascade</span> (<span class="loc">Valley County</span>). Mills writes that first wedding in the community was between <span class="per">Fred Hoffman</span> (aka <span class="per">Huffman</span>) and school teacher <span class="per">Ella Drake</span> on <span class="date">March 6, 1879</span>.</p><br><br>
