<p><span class="loc">Bosa</span> is a town and comune in the <span class="loc">province of Oristano</span> (until May 2005 it was in the <span class="loc">province of Nuoro</span>), part of the <span class="loc">Sardinia region</span> of <span class="loc">Italy</span>. <span class="loc">Bosa</span> is situated about two-thirds of the way up the west coast of <span class="loc">Sardinia</span>, on a small hill, about 3 kilometres (2 miles) inland on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Temo</span> River. The town has maintained a population of around 8,000 people for a significant amount of time, but has an urban character that has differentiated it from other locations in <span class="loc">Sardinia</span>. Agriculture and fishing play an important part in the city economy, thanks to the river valley near the coast surrounded by hills and highland plateaus. The area was inhabited since prehistorical times, as attested by the presence of several domus de janas and nuraghe. It was probably founded by the Phoenicians, although little is known about the original settlement. Under the Romans it was a municipium. The present town of <span class="loc">Bosa</span> was founded in 1112 by the <span class="loc">Malaspina</span>, 2½ km (1½ miles) from the site of the ancient town (Bosa or Calmedia) In the early Middle Ages, as part of the Giudicato of <span class="loc">Logudoro</span>, it was a provincial capital. After the construction of the <span class="loc">Malaspina</span> Castle, the population gradually moved from the seaside to the hills.</p>
