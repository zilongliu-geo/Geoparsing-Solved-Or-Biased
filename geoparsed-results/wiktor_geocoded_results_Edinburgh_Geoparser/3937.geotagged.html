<p><span class="loc">Woodville</span> is a village and civil parish 1.5 miles east of <span class="loc">Swadlincote</span> in <span class="loc">South Derbyshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The centre of the village, known as the Tollgate, is a busy traffic island on the A511. <span class="loc">Woodville</span> forms part of the border with <span class="loc">Leicestershire</span>. Formerly known as Wooden Box, named after the wooden toll booth on the toll road between <span class="loc">Ashby de la Zouch</span> and Burton-upon-Trent. The area around the roundabout, which is the modern equivalent of the toll booth, is still known as 'Tollgate'. The name <span class="loc">Woodville</span> first appeared in a leaflet issued when the foundation stone of the Church of England parish church of <span class="loc">Saint Stephen</span> was laid on 7 November 1845. <span class="loc">St. Stephen</span>'s is a Norman revival building designed by H.I. Stevens and completed in 1846. The <span class="loc">Woodville</span> area is rich in industrial heritage with a wide variety of industries such as potteries, crate-making, pipe works, breweries, rope-making and railways all having had a presence in the area which is now either totally gone or extremely diminished. One of the most famous <span class="loc">Woodville</span> potteries was Bretby Art Pottery founded in 1882 by Henry Tooth and William Ault.</p>
