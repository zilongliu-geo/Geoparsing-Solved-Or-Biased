<p><span class="loc">Roma</span> (also referred to as <span class="loc">Romakloster</span>) is a locality (Swedish tätort) situated in <span class="loc">Gotland Municipality</span>, <span class="loc">Gotland County</span>, <span class="loc">Sweden</span> with 913 inhabitants in 2010. <span class="loc">Roma</span> Abbey, a ruined medieval monastery and crown estate manor, lies in <span class="loc">Roma</span>. In 1995 the locality known as <span class="loc">Roma</span> was divided by Statistics <span class="loc">Sweden</span> into a part with the tentative name of "<span class="loc">Roma</span> kyrkby" or "Lövsta" (pop. 277) and the remaining part that retained the name "<span class="loc">Roma</span>" (pop. 913), but is using "Romakloster" as the postal address. Some confusion is caused by the fact that Lövsta/<span class="loc">Roma</span> kyrkby has been referred to as "<span class="loc">Roma</span>" in the statistical figures since 2000. <span class="loc">Roma</span> got a railway connection to <span class="loc">Visby</span> in 1878 and was from 1902 the island's main railway hub as a junction for its two main railways. Both lines used the Swedish three-foot narrow gauge (891 mm). The railways were closed in 1953 and 1960 respectively. In 2015, however, the heritage railway Gotlands Hesselby Jernväg was extended to <span class="loc">Roma</span>, which thus regained access to rail traffic.</p>
