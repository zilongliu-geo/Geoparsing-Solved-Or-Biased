  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Charleston</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Penobscot County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Bangor Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 1,409 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Charleston</span> includes the village of <span class="loc">West Charleston</span> and is home to the <span class="org">Higgins Classical Institute</span>, a Christian school. <span class="loc">Charleston</span> was first settled as early as <span class="date">1795</span> by <span class="per">Charles Vaughan</span>. The land was granted on <span class="date">July 14, 1802</span>, by the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> to <span class="per">John Lowell</span>. Known as T2 R5 NWP, or Township 2, Range 4, North of the Waldo Patent, it was incorporated on <span class="date">February 16, 1811</span>, as New <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>, to distinguish it from <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, when that state included the <span class="loc">province of Maine</span>. But in <span class="date">1820</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span> achieved statehood, so any confusion between the two ceased. Consequently, in <span class="date">1827</span> the name was shortened to <span class="loc">Charleston</span>. Sawmills were established to operate by water power at the streams. But <span class="loc">Charleston</span> was primarily an agricultural town. Its large farms were noted for raising horses and cattle. In <span class="date">1837</span>, the <span class="org">Higgins Classical Institute</span> was founded. By <span class="date">1870</span>, the community had a population of 1,191. Between <span class="date">1901</span> and <span class="date">1930</span>, the <span class="org">Bangor Railway &amp; Electric Company</span> operated trolleys on an electric railway between <span class="loc">Bangor</span> and <span class="loc">Charleston</span>.</p><br><br>
