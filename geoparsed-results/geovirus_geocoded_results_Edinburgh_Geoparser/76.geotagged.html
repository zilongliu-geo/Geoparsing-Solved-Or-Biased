<p>A Midland, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span> newspaper office was shut down briefly due a suspicious letter with white powder. When the envelope was opened at the Midland Daily News offices around 17:00 GMT Tuesday, the presence of powder aroused alarm the envelope might contain the deadly disease anthrax. The news office, along with restaurants and businesses near the downtown newspaper were quarantined as a safety precaution shortly after authorities were alerted. On-site tests found no evidence of anthrax, and the letter has been sent to <span class="loc">Lansing</span> for additional tests. Around 20:30 GMT, the office was reopened and all quarantines were lifted. A mail-sorting machine is being tested, and has been removed from the local post office for further tests. The envelope did contain a return address, according to local news station WNEM-TV 5. The editor's office was closed Tuesday night, and sealed off as a crime scene.</p>
