<p><span class="loc">Baicheng</span> (Chinese: 白城; pinyin: Báichéng; literally: "<span class="loc">White City</span>") is a prefecture-level city in the northwestern part of <span class="loc">Jilin province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, bordering <span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span> to the north and west and Heilongjiang to the east and northeast. At the 2010 census, 2,033,058 people resided within its administrative area of 25,683 km2 (9,916 sq mi). The area around present day <span class="loc">Baicheng</span> was a nomadic area which was inhabited by several nomad tribes in Northeast <span class="loc">China</span> as early as the Late Neolithic Age, including the Eastern Hu, the Xianbei, the <span class="loc">Fuyu</span>, and the Khitans once inhabited the area. During the <span class="loc">Liao Dynasty</span>, <span class="loc">Baicheng</span> was the political center of four emperors, including Emperor Shengzong, Emperor Xingzong, Emperor Daozong, and Emperor Tianzuo, as the seat of the local government was located at Chengsijiazi Ancient fort in today's <span class="loc">Taobei District</span>. As Qing Government forsook the settlement of Han Chinese in the 19th century, no farming was allowed until 1902. In 1904 <span class="loc">Baicheng</span> became a county going by the name of <span class="loc">Jing</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> (靖安). In 1914 <span class="loc">Jing</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> County was renamed <span class="loc">Tao</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> (洮南). By 1938 it was finally renamed <span class="loc">Baicheng</span>, which in Chinese means white town. The name's origin is the Mongolian name of the city Chaghanhot, which also means "white town". <span class="loc">Baicheng</span> used to belong to Nenjiang and Heilongjiang province, under the jurisdiction of the former provincial capital <span class="loc">Qiqihar</span>. In 1954, with the <span class="loc">Heilongjiang Province</span> merged with <span class="loc">Songjiang Province</span>, <span class="loc">Baicheng</span> was incorporated into <span class="loc">Jilin Province</span>.</p>
