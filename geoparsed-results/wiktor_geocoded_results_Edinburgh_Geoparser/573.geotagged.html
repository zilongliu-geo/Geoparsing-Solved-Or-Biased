<p>Milton is a town in <span class="loc">Chittenden County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 10,352 at the 2010 census. According to local legend, the town was named for the English poet John Milton, but the name most likely originated from William FitzWilliam, 4th Earl FitzWilliam, who held the title Viscount Milton. The town is the 7th most populous municipality in the state of <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, after <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">Essex</span>, <span class="loc">South Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">Colchester</span>, <span class="loc">Bennington</span>, and <span class="loc">Brattleboro</span>. Milton has a municipal building, school system, library, police force, fire department, rescue squad, several churches, and both civic and social organizations. The town is home to the warehouse for Gardener's Supply and a manufacturing facility for Husky Injection Molding Systems. Auto racing oval Catamount Stadium was located in Milton and many drivers, including Kevin Lepage, raced here during their racing careers. Milton was a filming location for some of the scenes in the Farrelly brothers movie Me, Myself &amp; Irene starring Jim Carrey and Ren√©e Zellweger. Milton was chartered by Governor Benning Wentworth of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> on June 8, 1763. In February 1782, the town was first settled by William Irish, Leonard Owen, Amos Mansfield, Absalom Taylor, and Thomas Dewey. There were approximately 300 settlers living in Milton by 1795. It was necessary to build a new meeting place, as meeting in private homes would no longer suffice. The Town House was built in 1849. In 1878, it was destroyed by a fire. Early settlers in Milton made most of their income from lumber and potash until 1840 when dairy became popular and butter and cheese were sold. Eventually, milk was also shipped to <span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span>.</p>
