<p><span class="loc">Kettering</span> is a coastal town on the D'Entrecasteaux Channel (37 km south of <span class="loc">Hobart</span>) opposite <span class="loc">Bruny Island</span>, <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Kettering</span> had a population of 984. The area was first explored by Bruni D'Entrecasteaux in 1792 and was settled in the early 19th century by timber cutters, whalers and sealers. Life was hard and the people who lived in the area rarely settled for long preferring the life in <span class="loc">Hobart</span> Town to the whaling stations and logging camps. It was just north of <span class="loc">Kettering</span> in Oyster Cove that the last Tasmanian Aboriginal settlement was established in 1847. Aborigines from all over <span class="loc">Van Diemen's Land</span> had been rounded up some years earlier and isolated on <span class="loc">Flinders Island</span>. In 1847 the remnants, now only 44 people, were taken to a reserve at Oyster Cove. By 1855 there were only 16 people left and by 1869 only Truganini remained. She died in 1876 but it was not until 1976 that her ashes were thrown to the winds on the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Little Oyster Cove Post Office opened on 19 October 1868 and was renamed <span class="loc">Kettering</span> in 1892.</p>
