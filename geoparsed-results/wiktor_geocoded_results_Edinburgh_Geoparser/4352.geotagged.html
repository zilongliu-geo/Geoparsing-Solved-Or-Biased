<p>Davis is a city in <span class="loc">Garvin</span> and <span class="loc">Murray</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. The population was 2,683 at the 2010 census. Davis is named after Samuel H. Davis, who moved to <span class="loc">Washita</span> in what was then Indian Territory in 1887. Davis owned a dry goods store, which was four miles south of the current town of Davis. Davis submitted a petition for a <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> depot to be built near his store, and the petition was accepted. In 1890, he also successfully petitioned for a post office to be built. The post office was supposed to be named after Nelson Chigley a Chickasaw Indian who owned the land on which the town was to be built. Chigley was already an Indian Territory name, so it was named after Davis. The town was established on November 16, 1898. It is located twenty-three miles north of <span class="loc">Ardmore</span> and twenty-three miles south of <span class="loc">Pauls Valley</span>. By 1900, Davis had fifty-seven businesses, two banks, ten doctors, three dentists, and three lawyers. Cotton farming was a common occupation in Davis, which was in one of the best cotton producing sections in <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>.</p>
