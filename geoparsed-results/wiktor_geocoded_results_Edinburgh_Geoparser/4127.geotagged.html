<p>McLean is a town in <span class="loc">Gray County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Pampa</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 778 according to the 2010 census. McLean is located at 35°14′2″N 100°36′0″W (35.233836, -100.600055). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.1 km2), all of it land. In 1901, Alfred Rowe, an English rancher who later perished in the sinking of the Titanic, donated land near a railroad cattle loading stop for the establishment of a town site. The <span class="loc">Choctaw</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> and Texas Railroad Company constructed a water well and a switch and section house there. The town was named for Judge William P. McLean (1836–1925) of the Texas Legislature and Railroad Commission. The town grew rapidly. By 1904 McLean had three general stores, a bank, two wagonyards and livery stables, a lumberyard, and a newspaper, the McLean News. A windmill pumped water from a well drilled in the middle of Main Street, and citizens hauled the water in barrels and buckets. The town was incorporated in 1909 with C. S. Rice as mayor and became a center for agriculture.</p>
