  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hanover</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">York County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, 19 miles (31 km) southwest of <span class="loc">York</span> and 54 miles (87 km) north-northwest of <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and is 5 miles (8.0 km) north of the Mason-Dixon line. The town is situated in a productive agricultural region. The population was 15,289 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The borough is served by the 717 area code and the Zip Codes of 17331-34. <span class="loc">Hanover</span> is named after the German <span class="loc">city of Hannover</span>. In <span class="date">1727</span>, <span class="per">John Digges</span>, an Irish nobleman of <span class="per">Prince George</span>'s County, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, obtained a grant of 10,000 acres (40 km2) of land where <span class="loc">Hanover</span> is <span class="date">now</span> located from <span class="per">Charles Calvert</span>, the fourth <span class="per">Lord Baltimore</span>. The area was called <span class="per">Digges</span> Choice, and in <span class="date">1730</span>, a group of Catholics started the settlement that became known as the <span class="loc">Conewego</span> Settlement. Settlers from both <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> began moving into the area in the 1730s. At this time, the northern border of <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and the southern border of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> did not agree with each other, and the area that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Hanover</span> was in the disputed area claimed by both states. This led to numerous disputes about property ownership from the 1730s until <span class="date">1760</span>. The dispute was settled when <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> hired British experts <span class="per">Charles Mason</span> and <span class="per">Jeremiah Dixon</span> to survey what became known as the Masonâ€“Dixon Line. This line was surveyed between <span class="date">1763</span> and <span class="date">1767</span>, and put an end to <span class="date">decades</span> of disputes over rights and ownership.</p><br><br>
