<p><span class="loc">Benton County</span> is a county located in the south-central portion of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Washington</span>. As of the 2010 census, its population was 175,177. The county seat is Prosser, and its largest city is <span class="loc">Kennewick</span>. The <span class="loc">Columbia River</span> demarcates the north, south, and east boundaries of the county. <span class="loc">Benton County</span> was created from what were then larger versions of <span class="loc">Klickitat County</span> and <span class="loc">Yakima County</span> on 8 March 1905. and was named after <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senator from <span class="loc">Missouri</span> (1821-1851) and later <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Representative (1853-1855) Thomas Hart Benton. <span class="loc">Columbia River</span> - Surrounds and forms the county's boundary on three sides. Barge trafficking is possible upriver to anchorage sites in northern <span class="loc">Richland</span>, the upstream extent of <span class="loc">Lake Wallula</span> which forms behind McNary Dam. <span class="loc">Yakima River</span> - Bisects the county from west to east, emptying into the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span> at <span class="loc">Richland</span>. As a water source, the <span class="loc">Yakima</span> is the lifesource for agriculture in the <span class="loc">Yakima</span> Valley. A shallow river, the <span class="loc">Yakima</span> is suitably navigable only for small, personal watercraft. Historically, the <span class="loc">Yakima River</span> supported some of the most bountiful migratory fish populations in the entire <span class="loc">Columbia Basin</span>, and many of those legendary salmon runs are now rebounding after decades of demise. <span class="loc">Amon</span> Creek is the most notable tributary of the <span class="loc">Yakima River</span> in <span class="loc">Benton County</span>, emptying into the mainstem river near its estuary in <span class="loc">Richland</span>.</p>
