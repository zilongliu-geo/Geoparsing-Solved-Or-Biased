It is located in <span class="loc">Hennepin County</span> on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Minnesota River</span>, above its confluence with the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. <span class="loc">Bloomington</span> lies 10 miles (16 km) south of <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span>. The city's population is 86,314, according to the <span class="date">2014</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census estimates.
