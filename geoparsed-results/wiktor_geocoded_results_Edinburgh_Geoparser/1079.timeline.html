  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Franklin</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 641 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the Logan, <span class="loc">Utah-Idaho Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Founded by Mormon pioneers led by Thomas S. Smart on <span class="date">April 14, 1860</span> in what was then Washington Territory. The town received its name after <span class="per">Franklin Richards</span>, an <span class="org">Apostle for The Church</span> of <span class="per">Jesus Christ</span> of Latter-day Saints. <span class="per">Franklin</span> is the first permanent European settlement in present-day <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. However, the town's founders believed the townsite was in Utah Territory. Its political status remained ambiguous until an <span class="date">1872</span> survey determined the townsite was in <span class="loc">Idaho</span> Territory about 1-mile (1.6 km) north of the Utah Territory border [1]. <span class="per">Franklin</span> is the location of a portion of the filming of the movie Napoleon Dynamite. The chicken farm scenes of the movie were filmed on Ritewood Egg Farms property, and the supervisor's character is loosely based on <span class="per">Marlow Woodward</span>, a late <span class="per">Franklin</span> resident and one of the farm's founders. <span class="per">Franklin</span> is located at 42°0′58″N 111°48′11″W (42.016039, -111.803101). at an elevation of 4,501 feet (1,372 m) above sea level.</p><br><br>
