<p><span class="loc">Wayne County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 122,623. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Goldsboro</span> and it is home to Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Goldsboro</span>, <span class="loc">NC</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. Prior to 1730, Native Americans were the only known occupants of the territory now known as <span class="loc">Wayne county</span>. Settlers trickled into the territory, but there was no general movement of immigration until after 1750. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> was established on November 2, 1779 from the western part of <span class="loc">Dobbs County</span>. It was named for "Mad Anthony" Wayne, a general in the American Revolutionary War. The act, establishing the County, provided the first court should be held at the home of Josiah Sasser at which time the justices were to decide on a place for all subsequent courts until a courthouse could be erected. By 1782 the commissioners were named. In 1787 an act was passed establishing <span class="loc">Waynesborough</span> on the west side of the <span class="loc">Neuse River</span> on the land of Doctor Andrew Bass where the courthouse now stands.</p>
