  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Middleton</span> is a small village in the <span class="loc">North Warwickshire district</span> of the <span class="loc">county of Warwickshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The population of the civil parish at the <span class="date">2011</span> census was 630. At the time of the Domesday Book Middleton was under a Norman Overlord <span class="per">Hugh de Grandmesnil</span> who had several holdings in <span class="loc">Warwickshire</span>. When he died it passed to the Marmions of <span class="loc">Tamworth</span>. In <span class="date">1291</span> the estate was divided into three and <span class="loc">Middleton</span> was held by the de Frevilles. In the mid 15th century Sir <span class="per">Richard Bingham</span> married <span class="per">Margaret Freville</span> of <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span>. There is a brass memorial to <span class="per">Sir Richard</span> in the Parish Church. When <span class="per">Margaret</span> died in <span class="date">1493</span> she left the estate to her grandson (by her first marriage) <span class="per">Sir Henry Willughby</span>. Ornithologist <span class="per">Francis Willughby</span> was born there in <span class="date">1635</span>. It stayed in the family until <span class="date">1924</span>. By <span class="date">the late 1970s</span> <span class="loc">Middleton Hall</span> and the surrounding estate came under the ownership of the Amey Roadstone Construction (ARC) for sand and gravel extraction. The Hall and its outbuildings, with some remains dating back to the Norman period, was in serious danger of being lost. It was saved by the establishment of the <span class="loc">Middleton Hall</span> <span class="org">Trust</span> in <span class="date">1980</span>, a group of volunteers who are restoring the Hall with the help of local authorities and national bodies. ARC have assisted in this by renting at a low rate the Hall and surroundings to the <span class="org">Trust</span>, and by restoring a Tudor period stable block as a craft centre.</p><br><br>
