<p>Raleigh (/ˈrɑːli/; RAH-lee) is the capital of the state of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> as well as the seat of <span class="loc">Wake County</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the second most populous city in <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, after Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the "<span class="loc">City of Oaks</span>" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 142.8 square miles (370 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population to be 439,896 as of July 1, 2014. It is also one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The <span class="loc">city of Raleigh</span> is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day <span class="loc">Dare County</span>. Raleigh is home to <span class="loc">North Carolina State</span> University and is part of the <span class="loc">Research Triangle</span> area, together with <span class="loc">Durham</span> (home of Duke University) and <span class="loc">Chapel Hill</span> (home of the University of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> at <span class="loc">Chapel Hill</span>). The "Triangle" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the <span class="loc">Research Triangle</span> Park, located in <span class="loc">Durham</span> &amp; Wake Counties partway between the three cities and their universities. The <span class="loc">Research Triangle</span> region encompasses the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013.
