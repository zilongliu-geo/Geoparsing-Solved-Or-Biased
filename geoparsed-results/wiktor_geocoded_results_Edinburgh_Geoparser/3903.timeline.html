  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hol</span> is a municipality in <span class="loc">Buskerud county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. The area of <span class="loc">Hol</span> was separated from the municipality of Ål in <span class="date">1877</span> to become a separate municipality. In <span class="date">1937</span> a part of neighboring <span class="loc">Uvdal</span> with 220 inhabitants was moved to <span class="loc">Hol</span> municipality. The area of <span class="loc">Dagali</span> was transferred from <span class="loc">Uvdal</span> to <span class="loc">Hol</span> in <span class="date">1944</span>. In <span class="date">1962</span> <span class="loc">Uvdal</span> was reunited with <span class="loc">Nore</span> to form the new municipality of <span class="loc">Nore</span> og <span class="loc">Uvdal</span>. The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old <span class="loc">Hol</span> farm (Old Norse: Hóll), since the first church was built here. The name is identical with the word hóll, which means "round (and isolated) hill". <span class="loc">Hol</span> is bordered to the north by Lærdal, to the north and east by Ål, to the south by <span class="loc">Nore</span> og <span class="loc">Uvdal</span>, and to the west by <span class="loc">Eidfjord</span>, <span class="loc">Ulvik</span> and <span class="loc">Aurland</span>. <span class="loc">Hol</span> is a mountainous area, where over 90% of the area is at an altitude exceeding 900 meters above sea level. The Hallingskarvet mountain range is the highest point in the municipality, at 1933 meters above sea level. The <span class="loc">Usta</span> or Usteåne River flows northeast from Lake Ustevatn traveling down the Ustedalen valley. The <span class="loc">Hallingdalselva</span> River is formed by the confluence of the <span class="loc">Usta</span> River and the <span class="loc">Holselva</span> River from Lake Strandavatnet.</p><br><br>
