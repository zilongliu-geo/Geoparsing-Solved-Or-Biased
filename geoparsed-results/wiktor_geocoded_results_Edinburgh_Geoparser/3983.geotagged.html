<p>Malabo /məˈlɑːboʊ/ is the capital of <span class="loc">Equatorial Guinea</span> and the <span class="loc">province of Bioko Norte</span>. It is located on the north coast of the island of <span class="loc">Bioko</span>, formerly known as Bubis, by its autochthonous inhabitants, as Etulá and as Fernando Poo by the Europeans. The city has a population of approximately 187,302 inhabitants. The official languages of the city, as well as across the country, are Spanish (main language and practically the only one used), French and Portuguese. <span class="loc">Malabo</span> is the oldest city in <span class="loc">Equatorial Guinea</span>. Many buildings within the city are built in the style of colonial architecture from the times of Spanish rule, coexisting with modern buildings built since independence. The downtown streets, with a square design, reveal the ancient conception of modern city with pedestrian areas at all. The city also offers numerous green areas and leisure. This phenomenon causes a feeling of architecture attenuated by the low height of buildings in a combination of architectural Westernization and Africanism. <span class="loc">Oyala</span> is a planned city currently under construction, designed to replace <span class="loc">Malabo</span> as the capital. In 1844, when Queen Elizabeth II ruled after the regency of her mother <span class="loc">Maria Cristina</span> and Baldomero Espartero, in an attempt to modernize <span class="loc">Spain</span> and rescuing its heritage, <span class="loc">Spain</span> let him know the <span class="loc">UK</span> its desire to be of regain control of the colony and thus the island. It took another decade to implement this direct control. The capital already had more dynamic and Protestant religious missions were very successful. Both factors helped to change the attitude of <span class="loc">Spain</span>, in addition to internal reasons already alluded.</p>
