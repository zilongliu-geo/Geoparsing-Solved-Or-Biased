  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fullerton</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Whitehall Township</span>, <span class="loc">Lehigh County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Fullerton</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Allentown</span>, in the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley region of the state. The population of <span class="loc">Fullerton</span> was 14,925 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Originally known as <span class="loc">Ferndale</span>, the town was located on tracts of land originally settled by <span class="per">Giles Windsor</span> (<span class="date">1767</span>), <span class="per">Stephen Snyder</span> (<span class="date">1786</span>) and <span class="per">Jacob Yundt</span> (<span class="date">1826</span>). In <span class="date">1895</span>, the town was renamed "Fullerton" in honor of local businessman <span class="per">James W. Fuller Jr.</span>, who had purchased the railroad car wheel factory of <span class="org">Frederick &amp; Company</span> in <span class="date">1865</span> and operated it as <span class="org">McKee, Fuller &amp; Co.</span> and later the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Car, Wheel &amp; Axle Works. Fuller laid out the hamlet in <span class="date">1870</span>, and by <span class="date">1883</span> it was a thriving company-town with a population in excess of 1,500 men and their families. When the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley cement industry exploded in <span class="date">the early 1900s</span>, Fuller's company prospered by providing machinery to the mills in the region, and the town supplied the workforce for both his factories, and the numerous mills and quarries operating in the immediate area.</p><br><br>
