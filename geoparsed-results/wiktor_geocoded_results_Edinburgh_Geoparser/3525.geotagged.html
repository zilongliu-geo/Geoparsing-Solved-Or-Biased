<p><span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> (named for <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>, <span class="loc">Israel</span>), known to Māori as Hiruhārama, is a settlement 66 kilometres (41 mi) up the <span class="loc">Whanganui</span> River from <span class="loc">Whanganui</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. Originally called Patiarero, it was one of the largest settlements on the <span class="loc">Whanganui</span> River in the 1840s, with several hundred Ngāti Hau inhabitants of the iwi Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi. Unlike other <span class="loc">Whanganui</span> River settlements given transliterated place names by Reverend Richard Taylor in the 1850s, <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> is usually referred to using the English version of its name. It grew into several small settlements, including <span class="loc">Roma</span> (<span class="loc">Rome</span>) and Peterehama (<span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>), founded by the remain of Taylor's congregation after the majority converted to Catholicism when a Roman Catholic mission was built in 1854. <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> was the isolated site where, in 1892, Suzanne Aubert (better known as Mother Mary Joseph) established the congregation of the Sisters of Compassion. They became a highly respected charitable nursing/religious order. Aubert also established the Jerusalem Foundling Home in 1886 which housed and cared for abandoned children from around <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. A convent remains on the mission property, as well as the church which replaced the original building destroyed by fire in 1888, and Sisters of Compassion still care for them.</p>
