  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is a Canadian town and the county seat of <span class="loc">Kings County</span>, <span class="loc">Prince Edward Island</span>. As of <span class="date">2011</span>, the population was 693. This area of eastern <span class="loc">Prince Edward Island</span> traces its history of human settlement to the Mi'kmaq Nation which inhabited the area. These people were referred to as "Epegoitnag" and for them, the region was an Acadian forest wilderness containing wild game, as well as fruit, berries and wild nuts for gathering, as well as plentiful marine resources in the nearby rivers and <span class="loc">Northumberland Strait</span>. The land in this area was called "Samkook" which translates to 'the land of the sandy shore'. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> lies opposite <span class="loc">Brudenell Point</span>, which divides the <span class="loc">Brudenell</span> River to the north from the <span class="loc">Montague River</span> to the south. <span class="loc">Brudenell Point</span> was the location of the first permanent Acadian settlement on what the French called Ile-Saint-Jean. Here, entrepreneur <span class="per">Jean Pierre Roma</span> landed in <span class="date">1732</span> with approximately 100 settlers to begin a commercial settlement to grow food and catch fish for provisioning the French military garrison at Fortress of <span class="loc">Louisbourg</span> on Ile-Royale (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Cape Breton Island</span>). French settlers called the area Trois-Rivieres (<span class="loc">Three Rivers</span>). The British burned the village in <span class="date">1745</span>, the same time they took control of Port-la-Joye.</p><br><br>
