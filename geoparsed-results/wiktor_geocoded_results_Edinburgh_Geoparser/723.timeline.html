  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sacramento</span> (/ˌsækrəˈmɛntoʊ/; Spanish: [sakɾaˈmento]) is the capital city of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span> and the seat of government of <span class="loc">Sacramento County</span>. It is at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Sacramento River</span> and the <span class="loc">American River</span> in the northern portion of California's expansive Central Valley. Its estimated <span class="date">2014</span> population of 485,199 made it the sixth-largest city in <span class="loc">California</span>. <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> is the cultural and economic core of the <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> metropolitan area, which includes seven counties with a <span class="date">2010</span> population of 2,414,783. <span class="loc">Its metropolitan</span> area is the fourth largest in <span class="loc">California</span> after the Greater <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the <span class="loc">San Diego</span> metropolitan area, and is the 27th largest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>.
