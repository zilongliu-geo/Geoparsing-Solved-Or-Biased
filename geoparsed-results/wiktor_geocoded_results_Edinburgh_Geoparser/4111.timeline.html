  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 39,451. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Prestonsburg. The county, founded in <span class="date">1800</span>, is named for Colonel <span class="per">John Floyd</span> (<span class="date">1750</span>â€“<span class="date">1783</span>). On <span class="date">December 13, 1799</span>, the <span class="org">Kentucky General Assembly</span> passed legislation to form <span class="loc">Floyd County</span> as the 40th <span class="loc">county of Kentucky</span>. The county was made from parts of <span class="loc">Fleming</span>, <span class="loc">Montgomery</span>, and <span class="loc">Mason County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The legislation became effective on <span class="date">June 1, 1800</span>. The county was named for <span class="per">James John Floyd</span>, a pioneer surveyor who helped lay out the <span class="loc">city of Louisville</span>. The county seat was Preston's Station, later renamed Prestonsburg. The first court house burned down on <span class="date">April 8, 1808</span>, destroying all the early records, so the earliest records of government activity do not date prior to <span class="date">1808</span>. Prestonsburg was used as a Confederate stronghold during the Civil War and two battles took place nearby, the Battle of <span class="loc">Ivy Mountain</span> on <span class="date">November 8, 1861</span> and the Battle of <span class="loc">Middle Creek</span> on <span class="date">January 10, 1862</span>. Both were Union victories. In <span class="date">1958</span>, the county was the site of one of the deadliest bus accidents in <span class="loc">U.S.</span> history.</p><br><br>
