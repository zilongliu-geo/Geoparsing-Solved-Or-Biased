  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Durham</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Strafford County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 14,638 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Durham</span> is home to the <span class="org">University</span> of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. The primary settlement in town, where 10,345 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined by the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> as the <span class="loc">Durham</span> census-designated place (CDP) and includes the densely populated portion of the town centered on the intersection of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 108 and Main Street and including the university which dominates the town. Situated beside <span class="loc">Great Bay</span> at the mouth of the Oyster River, <span class="loc">Durham</span> was originally called Oyster River Plantation. It was settled in <span class="date">1635</span> by pioneers who traveled up the <span class="loc">Piscataqua</span> River and across <span class="loc">Little Bay</span> to settle at the falls of the Oyster River. At the time, the land that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> belonged to <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>; not until <span class="date">1692</span> did the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> colony finally gain full and permanent independence from its southern neighbor. Most of the coastal area was divided among four townships, and for its first century, <span class="loc">Durham</span> was part of <span class="loc">Dover</span>. The village location was ideal for its fresh water, natural meadows for livestock, and the transportation opportunities afforded by the waterways leading to the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>. The land along the river was quickly settled, and nearby dense forests provided the timber necessary to construct homes as well as boats. Oyster River Plantation took the form of a small agricultural village, and the first generation of residents worked to clear and shape the land for planting.</p><br><br>
