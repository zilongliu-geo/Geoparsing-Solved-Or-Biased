When grading was done for the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> and <span class="loc">Richmond</span> Air-Line Railway in 1870 and a small depot was built in the community, it was given the name "Wright's Station", because the nearest resident was William Wright. <span class="loc">Lowell</span> is governed by a mayor and a five-member city council. It is run by a full-time City Administrator. <span class="loc">Lowell</span> operates its own Police Department. Fire protection is provided by the Lowell Volunteer Fire Department (Station 17).</p>
