<p><span class="loc">Medford</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Grant County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 996. <span class="loc">Medford</span> was founded by Hobart Johnstone Whitley, a land developer, banker, farmer and <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> Railroad executive. The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture states only that the town name was for <span class="loc">Medford</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, which it says was the home town of a railroad official. Before the opening of the Cherokee Outlet to non-Indian settlement on September 16, 1893, the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Nebraska Railway (later the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> and Pacific Railroad) built a line from southern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> that passed through the future <span class="loc">Medford</span> townsite in a north-south direction. A post office was established October 31, 1893. The townsfolk voted to incorporate on March 10, 1894. In 1897 the Gulf Railroad (later the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway) built a line that passed through <span class="loc">Medford</span> from northwest to southeast. Located in a wheat-growing region, <span class="loc">Medford</span> served as an agricultural trade center with a flour mill and several grain elevators. By 1909 the local economy supported three banks and three weekly newspapers.</p>
