In <span class="date">1988</span> the modern church suffered a devastating fire in which all of the church's silver melted. The fire turned out to be arson.

In <span class="date">1863</span> while extending the churchyard a treasure of silver was found consisting of 98 coins from the 11th century, half of them of German origin. Furthermore in <span class="date">1989</span> archaeologists discovered a pagan burial ground from the times of <span class="org">Viking</span> occupation. The burial included the well-preserved skeleton of a woman from the <span class="loc">Faroe Islands</span> in a grave 150 cm long. The grave also included three beads of amber, a blue glass bead, and a knife.</p><br><br>
