<p><span class="loc">Tianshui</span> (Chinese: 天水) is the second-largest city in <span class="loc">Gansu Province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>. Its population is approximately 3.5 million. Qin, whose House of <span class="loc">Ying</span> were the founding dynasty of the Chinese empire, developed from Quanqiu (present-day <span class="loc">Lixian</span>) to the south. After the invasions of the <span class="loc">Rong</span> which unseated the Western <span class="loc">Zhou</span>, Qin recovered the territory of <span class="loc">Tianshui</span> from the nomads. It became an important region of their duchy and, later, kingdom. Characteristically Qin tombs have been excavated at Fangmatan nearby, including one 2200-year-old map of Qin's <span class="loc">Gui County</span>. Under the Qin Empire, the area was part of Longxi Commandery but the Emperor Wu of the <span class="loc">Han</span> separated the region as the Tianshui Commandery as part of his expansion towards the <span class="loc">Tarim Basin</span>. The general Li Guang came from the city. The <span class="loc">Han</span> conquests and explorations eventually resulted in the development of the Northern Silk Road: <span class="loc">Tianshui</span> formed its junction with the <span class="loc">Wei River</span>, after which it followed the road past Mount Long to <span class="loc">Chang</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> (present-day <span class="loc">Xi</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span>). Nearby are the Maijishan Grottoes, filled with thousands of Buddhist sculptures representing figures such as Buddha and the original male form of <span class="loc">Guanyin</span>, produced between the <span class="loc">Wei</span> and Song dynasties by monks travelling along the road and by local Buddhists.</p>
