<p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Sagadahoc County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,042 at the 2010 census. Home to Reid State Park, the town is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Located on an island accessible by car from the mainland, <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> includes the villages of <span class="loc">Five Islands</span>, <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>, <span class="loc">Bay Point</span>, <span class="loc">Marrtown</span>, <span class="loc">West Georgetown</span> and <span class="loc">Robinhood</span>. It is a popular tourist destination. Abenaki Indians called the island Erascohegan, meaning "good spear-fishing." John Parker, a fisherman from <span class="loc">Bedfordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, purchased it in 1649 from Chief Mowhotiwormet, commonly known as Chief Robinhood, for a hogshead of rum and some pumpkins. Parker built the first permanent homestead on what eventually became known as Parker's Island. The <span class="loc">Kennebec River</span> valley was attacked and burned in 1676 during King Philip's War, then again in 1689 at the outset of King William's War, and was not resettled until after the 1713 Treaty of <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>. The town of Newtown-on-Arrowsic was rebuilt in 1714 on the southern end of <span class="loc">Arrowsic Island</span>, which was incorporated in 1716 by the Massachusetts General Court as Georgetown-on-Arrowsic, named for Fort <span class="loc">St. George</span>. The town's boundaries were extended to encompass Parker's Island, <span class="loc">Woolwich</span>, <span class="loc">Phippsburg</span> and Bath (which included <span class="loc">West Bath</span>). Abandoned during Dummer's War and beleaguered during the French and Indian Wars, the region resettled slowly in the 1750s until peace was assured with the 1759 Fall of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>.</p>
