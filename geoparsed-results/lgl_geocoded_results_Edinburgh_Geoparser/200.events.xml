    Considering volunteers have pulled more than 500,000 pounds of trash from the river and its tributaries since the first cleanup in 1997, that’s a lot of empties.

  <event start="2022-01-17T00:00:00Z" title="participate in today">
    Woehrle believes the ratio of empties to other trash will remain the same when as many as 850 volunteers from Camden and Charlton counties in Georgia and Nassau and Baker counties in Florida participate in today’s cleanup.

    Charlton County manager Steve Nance said he doesn’t understand why people dump household furnishings in the river, because the county picks up those items at no extra charge on trash collection days.
