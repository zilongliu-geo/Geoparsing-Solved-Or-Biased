  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Penza</span> (Russian: Пенза; IPA: [ˈpʲɛnzə]) is a city and the administrative center of <span class="loc">Penza Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Sura River</span>, 625 kilometers (388 mi) southeast of <span class="loc">Moscow</span>. Population: 517,311 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census); 518,025 (<span class="date">2002</span> Census); 542,612 (<span class="date">1989</span> Census). <span class="loc">Penza</span> was founded as a Russian frontier fortress-city, and to <span class="date">this day</span>, remnants of the Lomovskaya sentry line built in <span class="date">1640</span> have been preserved at the western edge of the city, and remains of earth ramparts dating from the mid-16th century are preserved in the city center. Until <span class="date">1663</span>, <span class="loc">Penza</span> was a wooden stockade with only a small settlement. Then in <span class="date">May 1663</span>, the architect Yuri Kontransky arrived in <span class="loc">Penza</span> on the Tsar's orders to direct the construction of a fortress city, as part of a wider fortress building program to protect <span class="loc">Russia</span> from attacks by Crimean Tatars. The initial construction consisted of a wooden Kremlin, a village, and <span class="date">quarters</span> for the nobility, small tradesmen, and merchants. In <span class="date">1774</span>, the insurgent army led by <span class="per">Yemelyan Pugachev</span> occupied <span class="loc">Penza</span> after the citizens of the city welcomed the rebellious Cossacks. The first stone houses started to appear after <span class="date">1801</span>, and by <span class="date">1809</span> Penza's population had grown to more than 13,000 people.</p><br><br>
