<p>Duncan is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Stephens County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 23,431 at the 2010 census. The <span class="loc">Chisholm</span> Trail passed to the east of Duncan prior to the town's founding. An estimated 9,800,000 Longhorn cattle were herded up the trail between <span class="loc">Texas</span> and <span class="loc">Abilene</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> during its existence. After learning that an extension of the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> and Pacific Railroad was being built from <span class="loc">Kansas</span> to <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">Scotsman</span> William Duncan brought his wife, parents, and other relatives and created a trading post situated at the intersection of the north-south <span class="loc">Chisholm</span> Trail and the east-west military passage between Fort Arbuckle and Fort Sill. The first train arrived on June 27, 1892; that date is considered the official birthdate of the town. Many of the city's first buildings were woodframe, but were replaced by sandstone and brick structures after natural disasters destroyed them. Four fires in 1901 burned down several buildings. Centrally located in <span class="loc">Stephens County</span>, Duncan became the county seat after <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> achieved statehood in 1907. As a compromise between residents of the northern and southern parts of the county, the county courthouse was located in the middle of Duncan's Main Street, half of it in the northern part of the city and county and half in the southern. Main Street made a wide circle around it on both ends.</p>
