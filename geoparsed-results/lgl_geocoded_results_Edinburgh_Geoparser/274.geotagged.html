<p>Peace message resounds in downtown . Mark Facchin and Jessica Wilkie sit in bed in a store window at Kingsmills department store in downtown <span class="loc">London</span> on the 40th anniversary of the John Lennon-Yoko Ono bed-in yesterday. (MORRIS LAMONT/Sun Media) Walter Nowobranec, out for a daily walk with his two terriers, said the Lennon-Ono message still resonates today. "We need peace not just amongst nations but among people. It's not a terrible thing to smile. It's not a terrible thing to open a door for somebody . . . people have to get together and appreciate each other."</p>
