  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lexington</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Davidson County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a population of 18,931. It is located in central <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, 20 miles (32 km) south of Winston-Salem. Major highways include I-85, I-85B, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 29, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 70, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 52 (soon to be I-285) and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 64. <span class="loc">Lexington</span> is part of the Piedmont Triad region of the state. <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Thomasville</span>, and the rural areas surrounding them are slowly developing as residential bedroom communities for nearby cities such as Winston-Salem, <span class="loc">Greensboro</span> and <span class="loc">High Point</span>. The <span class="loc">Lexington</span> area was at least sparsely settled by Europeans in <span class="date">1775</span>. The settlers named their community in honor of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, the site of the first skirmish of the American Revolutionary War. <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1828</span>. Silver Hill Mine, located a few miles south of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, opened in <span class="date">1838</span>, and was the first operating silver mine in the country. The oldest surviving house in <span class="loc">Lexington</span> is The Homestead, built by <span class="per">Dr. William Rainey Holt</span> (<span class="date">1798</span>âˆ’<span class="date">1868</span>), a physician born in what is <span class="date">today</span> <span class="loc">Alamance County</span>. The Homestead has windows, sidelights and other Palladian details characteristic of the pattern books of architect <span class="per">Asher Benjamin</span>. The home's owner was a <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>-trained physician who practiced medicine after relocating to <span class="loc">Davidson County</span>. An ardent secessionist, <span class="per">Dr. Holt</span> had three sons killed during military service for the Confederacy in the Civil War. His home was occupied by Union Army soldiers.</p><br><br>
