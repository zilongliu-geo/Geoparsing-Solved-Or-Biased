<p><span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Albany County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The population was 33,656 at the 2010 census. The town is south of <span class="loc">Albany</span>. <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> includes the following hamlets: <span class="loc">Delmar</span>, <span class="loc">Elsmere</span>, <span class="loc">Slingerlands</span>, <span class="loc">Glenmont</span>, <span class="loc">Selkirk</span>, <span class="loc">South</span> and <span class="loc">North Bethlehem</span>. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 9W passes through the town. The town is named after the biblical <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>. When Henry Hudson sailed up the river that would eventually bear his name, he is thought to have landed at what is now the town of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>. The spot where he is presumed to have landed is commemorated at the town's Henry Hudson Park. The town was established on March 12, 1793 from the town of <span class="loc">Watervliet</span>. In 1832, part of the town was used to form the town of <span class="loc">New Scotland</span>. The town's earliest growth took place in <span class="loc">Normansville</span> named for its location along the <span class="loc">Normans Kill</span>, a creek, which forms the town's border with <span class="loc">Albany</span>. <span class="loc">Normansville</span> still exists today, though it is unnoticed by most living in <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> since it is accessible only by one downhill road (which has no outlet). In the mid-19th century the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> and Hudson railroad initiated service into the hamlet then called <span class="loc">Adamsville</span>, renaming the hamlet <span class="loc">Delmar</span>. <span class="loc">Delmar</span> has become the most populous hamlet and its <span class="loc">Delaware</span> Avenue is the site of the present day town hall, police station, justice court, and public library, as well as numerous businesses. The railroad discontinued passenger service in the 1960s and its tracks started being removed in the year 2000 with the last of the track removed in 2005. The town has continued to grow, and is today considered to be an affluent suburb of the <span class="loc">city of Albany</span>.</p>
