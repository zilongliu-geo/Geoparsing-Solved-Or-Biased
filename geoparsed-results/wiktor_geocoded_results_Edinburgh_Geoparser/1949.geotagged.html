<p><span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a city in, and the county seat of, <span class="loc">Lafayette County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Founded in 1837, it was named after the British university <span class="loc">city of Oxford</span> in hopes of having the state university located there, which it did successfully attract. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">US</span> Census, the population is 18,916; the Census Bureau estimates the city's 2013 population at 20,865. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is the home of the University of Mississippi, founded in 1848, also commonly known as "<span class="loc">Ole Miss</span>". <span class="loc">Oxford</span> has been named by <span class="loc">USA</span> Today as one of the top six college towns in the nation. It is included in The Best 100 Small Towns in <span class="loc">America</span>. <span class="loc">Lafayette County</span> consistently leads the state rankings in the lowest unemployment rate per quarter. <span class="loc">Oxford City</span> Schools are ranked as "Star" schools, the highest ranking available, and <span class="loc">Lafayette County</span> school systems are consistently ranked as "5-star" systems. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> and <span class="loc">Lafayette County</span> were formed from lands ceded by the <span class="loc">Chickasaw</span> in the treaty of <span class="loc">Pontotoc Creek</span> in 1832. The county was organized in 1836, and in 1837 three pioneers—John Martin, John Chisom, and John Craig—purchased land from <span class="loc">Hoka</span>, a female <span class="loc">Chickasaw</span> landowner, as a site for the town. They named it <span class="loc">Oxford</span>, intending to promote it as a center of learning in the Old Southwest. In 1841, the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> legislature selected <span class="loc">Oxford</span> as the site of the state university, which opened in 1848.</p>
