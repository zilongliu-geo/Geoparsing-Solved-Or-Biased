  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dayton is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Lyon County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,964 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Dayton is at the western end of the Twenty-Six Mile Desert at a bend in the <span class="loc">Carson River</span>. Immigrants stopping there for water would consider whether to follow the river south or continue west, giving the location its first name, <span class="loc">Ponderers Rest</span>. In <span class="date">1849</span>, <span class="per">Abner Blackburn</span>, while heading for <span class="loc">California</span>, discovered a gold nugget in nearby <span class="loc">Gold Creek</span>, one of the tributaries of the <span class="loc">Carson River</span>. By <span class="date">1850</span>, placer miners settled at the mouth of Gold Ca単on, working sand bars deposited over the millennia along the path of the creek. At first the settlement was just called Gold Ca単on or Gold Ca単on Flat. Throughout the 1850s, Dayton served as the commercial hub for miners working in the canyon. In <span class="date">1857</span> many Chinese miners came to the area to avoid mining taxes directed at the Chinese in <span class="loc">California</span>. With the <span class="date">1859</span> discovery of the Comstock Lode, newly founded <span class="loc">Gold Hill</span> and <span class="loc">Virginia City</span>, six miles to the north, assumed prominence and most miners headed up the ca単on. By <span class="date">1860</span> the town was primarily occupied by Chinese miners and it was called "<span class="loc">China</span> Town" in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census of <span class="date">that year</span>. However, soon people began to realize there was more profit in providing milling, goods, and services to the miners and thus came or returned to the area.</p><br><br>
