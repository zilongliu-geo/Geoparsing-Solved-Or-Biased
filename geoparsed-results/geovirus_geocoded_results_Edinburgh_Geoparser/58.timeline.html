  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>An HIV-positive man was sentenced to <span class="date">35 years</span> in prison <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, <span class="date">one day</span> after being convicted of harassment of a public servant for spitting into the eye and open mouth of a <span class="loc">Dallas</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> police officer in <span class="date">May 2006</span>. <span class="org">The United States Centers for Disease Control</span> and Prevention says that no one has ever contracted HIV from saliva, and a gay-rights and AIDS advocacy group called the sentence excessive. A <span class="loc">Dallas County</span> jury concluded that <span class="per">Willie Campbell</span>'s act of spitting on policeman <span class="per">Dan Waller</span> in <span class="date">2006</span> constituted the use of his saliva as a deadly weapon. The incident occurred while <span class="per">Campbell</span>, 42, was resisting arrest while being taken into custody for public intoxication. Prosecutors said that <span class="per">Campbell</span> yelled that he was innocent during the trial, and claimed a police officer was lying. <span class="per">Campbell</span>'s lawyer <span class="per">Russell Heinrichs</span> said that because he had a history of convictions including similarly attacking two other police officers, biting inmates, and other offenses, he was indicted under a habitual offender statute. The statute increased his minimum sentence to <span class="date">25 years</span> in prison. Because the jury ruled that <span class="per">Campbell</span>'s saliva was used as a deadly weapon, he will not be eligible for parole until completing at least half his sentence.</p><br><br>
