  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Riverton</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Sangamon County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,455 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 3,062 in <span class="date">2000</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Riverton</span> was founded by <span class="per">John Taylor</span> in <span class="date">1837</span>. Originally named Judy's Ferry for the ferry crossing the <span class="loc">Sangamon River</span> there. Then <span class="loc">Jamestown</span>, after politician <span class="per">James Shields</span>, the village was successful for about <span class="date">a decade</span>, producing lumber for a planned railroad. When it was discovered that the railroad was badly constructed and unreliable, <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> fell into economic distress and the land on which it sat was sold. The town was sold to Joseph Loose of <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, then again to <span class="per">John D. Keedy</span>, a <span class="loc">Springfield</span> distiller. Land south of <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was purchased and a distillery was put up. Yet again, the properties were lost, first mortgaged to Jacob Bunn, then given as a claim settlement to Parley <span class="per">L. Howlett</span>, another distiller. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was soon renamed <span class="per">Howlett</span>, Shields had fallen from popularity, and a new flour mill and coal mine caused a short-lived boom. Despite their success, most of <span class="per">Howlett</span> was sold to Jacob Bunn to pay off debt. Bunn started selling the lots to the residents, the only owner to do so. After a state requirement was passed preventing communities from being named after people, <span class="per">Howlett</span> was rechristened as <span class="loc">Riverton</span> in the 1870s. In <span class="date">1876</span>, train robber <span class="per">Jesse James</span> spent a night in <span class="loc">Riverton</span> while en route to a bank heist in <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. <span class="per">Al Capone</span> also reportedly used <span class="loc">Riverton</span> as one of his hideouts.</p><br><br>
