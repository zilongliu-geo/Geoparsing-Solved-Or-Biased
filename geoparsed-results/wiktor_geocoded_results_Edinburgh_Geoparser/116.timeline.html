  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Richmond</span> is a Canadian village. Founded in <span class="date">1818</span>, it spans the Jock River, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Rideau River</span>. Like many communities in <span class="loc">eastern Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Richmond</span> houses several unique populations. Some residents have historic and economic roots in the immediate area. <span class="loc">Richmond</span> operates as a small core to its residents. To others, the village serves as a bedroom community for the larger urban area of <span class="loc">Ottawa</span>. <span class="loc">Richmond</span>'s amalgamation with the <span class="loc">city of Ottawa</span> in <span class="date">2001</span> has had mixed results. A significant impact on democratic representation, as well as threats to local values and determination are some of the major concerns. <span class="loc">Richmond</span> is 15 km from <span class="loc">North Gower</span>, 32 km from <span class="loc">Carleton</span> Place, 36 km from Downtown Ottawa, 41 km from <span class="loc">Smiths Falls</span> and 45 km from <span class="loc">Perth</span>. Its population at the <span class="loc">Canada</span> <span class="date">2006</span> Census was 3,301. After the War of <span class="date">1812</span>, loyal settlers were sought for <span class="loc">Upper Canada</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Ontario</span>). The United Empire Loyalists, who, after the American Revolution, had helped to settle areas further south and west in <span class="loc">Upper Canada</span> were being regarded with increasing suspicion. Instead, disbanded soldiers were the most immediate loyal settlers for this new era of development.</p><br><br>
