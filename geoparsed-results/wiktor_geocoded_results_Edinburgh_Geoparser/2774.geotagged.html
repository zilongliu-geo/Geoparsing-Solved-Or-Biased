<p><span class="loc">Jamaica</span> (/dʒəˈmeɪkə/) is an island country situated in the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span>, consisting of the third-largest island of the <span class="loc">Greater Antilles</span>. The island, 10,990 square kilometres (4,240 sq mi) in area, lies about 145 kilometres (90 mi) south of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, and 191 kilometres (119 mi) west of <span class="loc">Hispaniola</span>, the island containing the nation-states of <span class="loc">Haiti</span> and the <span class="loc">Dominican Republic</span>. <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean. Previously inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Taíno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. Named Santiago, it remained a possession of <span class="loc">Spain</span> until 1655, when <span class="loc">England</span> (later <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>) conquered the island and renamed it <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>. Under British rule, <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> became a leading sugar exporter, with its plantation economy highly dependent on slaves imported from <span class="loc">Africa</span>, followed later by Chinese and Indian indentured labour. All slaves were fully emancipated in 1838, with independence from the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> achieved on 6 August 1962. With 2.8 million people, <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> is the third most populous Anglophone country in <span class="loc">the Americas</span> (after the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Canada</span>), and the fourth most populous country in the Caribbean. Kingston is the country's capital and largest city, with a population of 937,700. Jamaicans are of predominately African descent, with significant European, Chinese, Indian, and mixed-race minorities. Due to a high rate of emigration since the 1960s, <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> has a large diaspora around the world, particularly in <span class="loc">Canada</span>, the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, and the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p>
