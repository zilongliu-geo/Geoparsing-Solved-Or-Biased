  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Princeton</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Caldwell County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the seat of its county. The population was 6,329 during the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census. Princeton is home to several notable attractions such as <span class="org">Adsmore Museum</span>, Champion-Shepherdson House (home of the Princeton Art Guild), University of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> Research and Education Center Botanical Garden, Capitol Cinemas, the Annual Black Patch Festival, and Newsom's Aged <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> Ham. The community at the head of <span class="loc">Eddy Creek</span> was first called Eddy Grove for the creek's source at a large whirling spring. 1,700 acres (690 ha) of surrounding land was granted to the Virginian <span class="per">William Prince</span> for his service during the American Revolution. He settled there in what was then <span class="loc">Livingston County</span> in <span class="date">1799</span> and erected <span class="loc">Shandy Hall</span>, a brick home and tavern. Prince's heirs and another local landowner named <span class="per">Thomas Frazier</span> granted 40 acres (16 ha) around Eddy Grove and <span class="loc">Prince's Place</span> towards the establishment of a new town in <span class="date">1817</span>, provided the courthouse of the newly formed <span class="loc">Caldwell County</span> was relocated there from <span class="loc">Eddyville</span>. The county court accepted the proposal in <span class="date">July</span> and named the new community <span class="loc">Princetown</span>, which shortened to <span class="loc">Princeton</span> by the time of the Eddy Grove.</p><br><br>
