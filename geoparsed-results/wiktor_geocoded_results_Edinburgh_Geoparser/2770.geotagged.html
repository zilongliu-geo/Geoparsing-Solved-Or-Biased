<p><span class="loc">Atlanta</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Phelps County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 131 at the 2010 Census. During World War II the town was neighbored by Camp <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, which housed more than 3,000 Nazi German prisoners of war over three years. The camp was said to house more prisoners during the war than the town had in its entire existence. <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> was laid out in 1883 when the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Burlington</span> &amp; Quincy Railroad was extended to that point. It was likely named after <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. In the first part of the 20th century <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> was home to several amenities for neighboring farmers. They included a grocery store, post office, cafe, and a tourist shop for drivers on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 6, as well as corn and grain elevators and two gas stations. Chataqua groups entertained at the town hall, with annual events such as the Atlanta Institute, which was an annual fair. There were also free outdoor "picture shows", and the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> Industry Day Picnic. The <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> schoolhouse had eight grades. At the beginning of WWII, there was one street about two blocks long, with only a few business buildings drooping and dwindling along its edges.</p>
