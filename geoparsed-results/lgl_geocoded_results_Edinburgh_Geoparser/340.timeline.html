  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Doctor returns to <span class="loc">Newark</span> after practicing in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. BY ABBEY ROY Advocate Reporter <span class="date">March 30, 2009</span> <span class="loc">NEWARK</span> -- After spending <span class="date">a year</span> on the other side of the equator, practicing at a rural <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> hospital with a total of nine beds, <span class="per">Jackie Underwood</span> is thrilled to return home to Licking Memorial Hospital. "It makes you appreciate here," <span class="per">Underwood</span> said. "It makes you appreciate the <span class="loc">United States</span>' private medicine." Underwood, a family practitioner at Licking Memorial from <span class="date">1982</span>-<span class="date">2006</span> and afterward in <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> and <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, left in <span class="date">January 2007</span> to practice in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> after researching a brochure she'd received in the mail about the country. The experience was one she is grateful for, and she hopes to return to <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> as a tourist someday to explore the parts of it she missed this time around. Still, certain things <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>'s culture took some getting used to, she said -- primarily, the country's national health care system. "People have to wait <span class="date">a long time</span> for things," <span class="per">Underwood</span> said, citing examples such as tests or referrals. "Things we take for granted here aren't taken for granted there." In <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, she was one of six "GPs" -- general practitioners -- at the Queen Street Practice. The people in the town where she worked, <span class="loc">Wairoa</span>, were very friendly and mostly <span class="loc">Maori</span>, an indigenous group similar in culture, history and language to American Indians, <span class="per">Underwood</span> said. Although the town was "very blue-collar," she said, the citizens were kind and appreciated the care they received -- even if it was just a bit at a time. "With the national health care ... people came in for one problem and one problem only," <span class="per">Underwood</span> said. Additional maladies were required to be scheduled for different appointments. Although she had only 10 vacation <span class="date">days</span> during her time in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, <span class="loc">Underwood</span> was able to accomplish a goal she had set for herself: scuba diving off the coast. When she returns as a tourist, she also hopes to tour the northernmost point of the country's <span class="loc">North Island</span> and the southernmost point of <span class="loc">South Island</span>, she said. In the meantime, she's content to be back at Licking Memorial, practicing with her old partner and enjoying facilities she said are better than any she's worked at. "We have really good quality here," she said. "There's a big focus here on quality."</p><br><br>
