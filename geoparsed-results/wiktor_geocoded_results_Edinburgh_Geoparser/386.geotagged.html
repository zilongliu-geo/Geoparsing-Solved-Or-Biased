<p>Lincoln (/ˈlɪŋkən/) is a cathedral city and the county town of <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span>, within the East Midlands of <span class="loc">England</span>. The non-metropolitan <span class="loc">district of Lincoln</span> has a 2012 population of 94,600. The 2011 census gave the entire urban area of Lincoln (which includes <span class="loc">North Hykeham</span> and <span class="loc">Waddington</span>) a population of 130,200. Lincoln developed from the Roman town of Lindum Colonia, which developed from an Iron Age settlement. Lincoln's major landmarks are <span class="loc">Lincoln</span> Cathedral, a fine example of English Gothic architecture, and Lincoln Castle, an 11th-century Norman castle. The city is also home to the University of Lincoln and Bishop Grosseteste University. Lincoln is situated in a gap in the Lincoln Cliff 141 miles (227 kilometres) north of <span class="loc">London</span>, at an elevation of 20.4 metres (66.9 feet) above sea level by the <span class="loc">River Witham</span>, stretching up to 75 metres (246.1 feet) above sea level in the uphill area around the cathedral. The earliest origins of Lincoln can be traced to the remains of an Iron Age settlement of round wooden dwellings (which were discovered by archaeologists in 1972) that have been dated to the 1st century BC. This settlement was built by a deep pool (the modern Brayford Pool) in the <span class="loc">River Witham</span> at the foot of a large hill (on which the <span class="loc">Normans</span> later built <span class="loc">Lincoln</span> Cathedral and Lincoln Castle).</p>
