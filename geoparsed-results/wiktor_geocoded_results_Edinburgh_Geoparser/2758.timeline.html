  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Phoenix is a ghost town in the Boundary Country of British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, 11 km east of Greenwood. Once called the “highest city in <span class="loc">Canada</span>” by its citizens (1,412 metres / 4,633 feet above sea level) it was a booming copper mining community from the late 1890s until <span class="date">1919</span>. In its heyday it was home to 1,000 citizens and had an opera house, twenty hotels, a brewery and its own city hall. Phoenix’s magistrate, Judge <span class="per">Willie Williams</span>, who served there from <span class="date">1897</span> until <span class="date">1913</span>, became famous for his booming declaration, “I am the highest judge, in the highest court, in the highest city in Canada.” In <span class="date">1911</span>, Phoenix’s hockey team won the provincial championship and asked for the right to compete for the Stanley Cup, but it was too late to qualify. The Granby Consolidated Mining, <span class="per">Smelting</span> and <span class="per">Power</span> <span class="org">Company, Limited</span> operated the Phoenix Mine, a copper mine that produced 13,678,901 tons of ore before operations ceased on <span class="date">June 14, 1919</span>. Copper was discovered at Phoenix in <span class="date">1891</span>, credited to American prospector named <span class="per">Bob Denzler</span>. His discovery became the first of many claims and a settlement called Greenwood Camp was built, but it was not until <span class="date">1895</span> that the full riches of the area were realized and the boom really began. The log cabins of Greenwood Camp were replaced by frame houses and brick homes. Then, in <span class="date">1896</span>, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Great Northern Railway arrived. By then, with the exception of the one at <span class="loc">Rossland</span>, the output of the mines was exceeding the combined output of every other copper mine in British <span class="org">Columbia</span>. The town got its own newspaper, the Phoenix Pioneer, in <span class="date">1896</span> and on <span class="date">October 1, 1898</span>, Greenwood Camp was renamed Phoenix when the first post office opened. By <span class="date">the early 1900s</span>, Phoenix was a thriving community with electricity and telephone services, a hospital, banquet hall, ballroom, opera house and its own stage line. There was no lack of fine meals or accommodation: on the <span class="date">Christmas Day</span> menu at the Brooklyn Hotel in <span class="date">1911</span> the variety of delicacies included Russian caviar, Green Turtle soup and English plum pudding with brandy sauce.</p><br><br>
