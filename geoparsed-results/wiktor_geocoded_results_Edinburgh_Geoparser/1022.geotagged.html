<p><span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is a suburban community on the outskirts of <span class="loc">Chicago metropolitan</span> area, located 51 miles (82 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Chicago</span> in the center of <span class="loc">McHenry County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">McHenry County</span>. The population was 24,770 at the 2010 census. The city is the home to a historic turn-of-the-century town square, including the Woodstock Opera House and Old <span class="loc">McHenry County</span> Courthouse. The city was named one of the nation's Dozen Distinctive Destinations in 2007 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. <span class="loc">Centerville</span>, as <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> was originally called, was chosen as the county seat on September 4, 1843, due to its location at the geographic center of <span class="loc">McHenry County</span>. Early area settler Alvin Judd developed a plat for the town, incorporating a two-acre public square, near which a 2-story frame courthouse and jail were constructed the following year by George C. Dean and Daniel <span class="loc">Blair</span>. In 1845, resident Joel Johnson's recommendation to give <span class="loc">Centerville</span> a more original name was met, and thereafter the town was known as <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> (after Johnson's hometown of <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>). However, the town was listed as "Center" on the 1850 Federal Census. In 1852, <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> was incorporated as a village with Judd as President. In response to a burgeoning population following the Civil War, <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> was incorporated as a city in 1873. John S. Wheat was elected as <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>'s first mayor. A vital artery for the growing town was the train line, which allowed for a substantial industrial presence early in the town's history.</p>
