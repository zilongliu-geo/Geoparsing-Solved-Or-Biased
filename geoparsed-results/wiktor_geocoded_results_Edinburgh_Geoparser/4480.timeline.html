  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kosti</span> (Bulgarian: Кости, stressed on the last syllable, formerly Greek: Κωστί - <span class="loc">Kosti</span>) is a village in southeastern <span class="loc">Bulgaria</span>, part of <span class="loc">Tsarevo Municipality</span>, <span class="loc">Burgas Province</span>. It is located on the banks of the <span class="loc">Veleka River</span> in the <span class="loc">Strandzha</span> mountains not far from the Turkish border, 20-25 kilometres south of <span class="loc">Tsarevo</span> and 91 km southeast of <span class="loc">Burgas</span>. As of <span class="date">June 2008</span>, it has a population of 320[1] and the mayor is Iliya Yazov. The village lies within <span class="loc">Strandzha</span> Nature Park. Traces of ancient metallurgical activity have been discovered in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Kosti</span>, as well as a big necropolis and several independent mounds of Thracian origin. The modern village was first mentioned in an Ottoman tax register of <span class="date">1498</span>, according to which Kosti's population consisted of 22 Christian families. It also featured in a 17th-century tax register, and during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829 it was described as a Greek village (see Greeks in <span class="loc">Bulgaria</span>). Statistics of <span class="date">1898</span> count 185 Greek and 25 Bulgarian houses, whereas 1897 data only notes 300 Greek houses. <span class="loc">Kosti</span> was one of the Greek villages of inland <span class="loc">Strandzha</span>, culturally and linguistically very distant from then-Greek-inhabited nearby coastal towns like <span class="loc">Tsarevo</span> (Vassiliko) and <span class="loc">Ahtopol</span>. The local houses differ significantly from the typical village houses of <span class="loc">Strandzha</span> and the town houses of the coast. The houses in <span class="loc">Kosti</span> typically have two stories of crude stone, with the top floor cased with thick oak boards. They feature an unusually large fireplace on the top floor and the reported lack of any windows (which were later added by the Bulgarians who settled), as the only light to enter the room would come from a small opening in the ceiling called okno. The population was mainly engaged in agriculture, cattle breeding and logging (wood was in demand by the Ahtopol shipyard).</p><br><br>
