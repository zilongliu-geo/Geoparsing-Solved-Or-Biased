  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Adrian</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Malheur County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, near the confluence of the <span class="loc">Snake River</span> and the <span class="loc">Owyhee River</span>. The population was 177 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, ORâ€“ID <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. In <span class="date">1913</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Short Line Railroad built a branch into this part of <span class="loc">Malheur County</span>. There was a post office called <span class="loc">Riverview</span> on the east side of the <span class="loc">Snake River</span> and because the railroad did not want a station of the same name on the west side, the name <span class="per">Adrian</span> was suggested by <span class="per">Reuben McCreary</span>, who platted the townsite. The name was chosen to honor his birthplace, <span class="per">Adrian</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. Riverview post office was established in <span class="date">1911</span>, but moved across the river in <span class="date">1915</span> and the name changed to Adrian in <span class="date">1919</span>. It was previously thought that the city was named for <span class="per">James Adrian</span>, a sheep rancher, but he did not arrive in the area until <span class="date">1916</span>. <span class="per">Adrian</span> is located on the Southern Alternate route of the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trail, a longer route that eliminated the need to cross the <span class="loc">Snake River</span>.</p><br><br>
