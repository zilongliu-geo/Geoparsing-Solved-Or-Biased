<p><span class="loc">Lebanon</span> establishes embassy in <span class="loc">Syria</span>. A Lebanese parliamentarian praised the opening of his county's first-ever embassy in <span class="loc">Syria</span> on Monday but warned that much remained to be done to improve bilateral relations between the two countries. In addition, he said a number of agreements that have been previously signed between <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> and <span class="loc">Syria</span> that should be revised or even annulled as the two countries embark on a new era of diplomatic relations, particularly the Lebanon-Syria Treaty of Brotherhood, Cooperation and Coordination Agreement. That 1991 agreement effectively legalized the presence of Syrian troops in <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> and suggested the two countries closely coordinate their foreign policies to reflect "the shared destiny and interests of the two countries." <span class="loc">Syria</span> first sent its troops into <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> in the 1970s while the country was engulfed in civil war.</p>
