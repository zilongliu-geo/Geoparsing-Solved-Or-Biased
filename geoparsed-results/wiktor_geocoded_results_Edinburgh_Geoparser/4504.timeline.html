  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Tok /ˈtoʊk/ is a census-designated place (CDP) in Southeast <span class="loc">Fairbanks Census Area</span>, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,258 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Tok</span> lies on a large, flat alluvial plain of the <span class="loc">Tanana</span> Valley between the <span class="loc">Tanana River</span> and the <span class="loc">Alaska Range</span> at an important junction of the <span class="loc">Alaska</span> Highway with the Glenn Highway. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 132.3 square miles (343 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Tok</span> has a dry-winter continental subarctic climate (Köppen Dwc). There have been Athabascan Indian settlements in the region of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Tok</span> for <span class="date">many centuries</span>. The town at the present location of <span class="loc">Tok</span> began in <span class="date">1942</span> as an <span class="org">Alaska Road Commission</span> camp used for construction and maintenance of the <span class="loc">Alaska</span> Highway. So much money was spent in the camp's construction and maintenance that it earned the nickname "Million Dollar Camp" from those working on the highway. In <span class="date">1947</span> the first school opened, and in <span class="date">1958</span> a larger school was built to accommodate the many newcomers. In <span class="date">1995</span> a new school was opened to provide for the larger community. A <span class="org">U.S. Customs Office</span> was located in <span class="loc">Tok</span> between <span class="date">1947</span> and <span class="date">1971</span>, when it was moved to the Canadian border.</p><br><br>
