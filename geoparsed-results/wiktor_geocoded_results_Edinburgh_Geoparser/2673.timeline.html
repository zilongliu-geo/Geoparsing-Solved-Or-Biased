  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Brunswick</span> /ˈbrʌnzwɪk/ is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Glynn County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As the major urban and economic center of the state's lower southeast, it is the second-largest urban area on the <span class="loc">Georgia</span> coast after Savannah and contains the Brunswick Old Town Historic District. British colonists settled the peninsula in <span class="date">1738</span> as a buffer to Spanish <span class="loc">Florida</span>. It came under provincial control in <span class="date">1771</span> and was founded as <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> after the German duchy of Brunswick–Lüneburg, the ancestral home of the <span class="org">House of Hanover</span>. It was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1856</span>. Throughout its history, <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> has served as an important port city: in World War II, it served as a strategic military location with an operational base for escort blimps and a shipbuilding facility for the <span class="org">U.S. Maritime Commission</span>. <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> supports a progressive economy largely based on tourism and logistics with a metropolitan GDP of $3.9 billion. The Port of <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> handles approximately 10 percent of all <span class="loc">U.S.</span> ro-ro trade—third in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> behind the ports of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and <span class="loc">Newark</span>. The headquarters of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is located 5 mi (8 km) north of the central business district of the city and is adjacent to Brunswick–Golden Isles Airport, which provides commercial air service to the area. In the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census, the population of the city proper was 15,383; the urban area, 51,024; and the metropolitan area, 112,370.</p><br><br>
