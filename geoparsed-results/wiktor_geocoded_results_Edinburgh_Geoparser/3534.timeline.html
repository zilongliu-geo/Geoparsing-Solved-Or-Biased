  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wilmington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1665</span> and was officially incorporated in <span class="date">1730</span>, from parts of <span class="loc">Woburn</span>, <span class="loc">Reading</span>, and <span class="loc">Billerica</span>. The first settler is believed to have been Will Butter, <span class="per">Richard Harnden</span> or <span class="per">Abraham Jaquith</span>. Butter was brought to <span class="loc">Woburn</span> as an indentured captive. Once he attained his freedom, he fled to the opposite side of a large swamp, in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>. <span class="per">Harnden</span> settled in <span class="loc">Reading</span>, in an area that is <span class="date">now</span> part of <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>. <span class="per">Jaquith</span> settled in an area of <span class="loc">Billerica</span> that became part of <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> in <span class="date">1737</span>. Minutemen from <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> responded to the alarm on <span class="date">April 19, 1775</span> and fought at Merriam's Corner in <span class="org">Concord</span>. The <span class="loc">Middlesex Canal</span> passed through <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>. Chartered in <span class="date">1792</span>, opened in <span class="date">1803</span>, it provided freight and passenger transport between the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span> and <span class="loc">Boston</span>. One important cargo on the canal was hops. From the middle of the 18th century until the early 19th century, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> was the acknowledged leader in hop production in <span class="loc">North America</span>. <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span> in particular was famous for its hop yards, and <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> was the first place where the culture grew to a fever pitch.</p><br><br>
