<p><span class="loc">Grantham</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Lockyer</span> Valley region of <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The town is located 100 kilometres (62 mi) west of the state capital, <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>. At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Grantham</span> and the surrounding area had a population of 492. The area was first settled in 1841, by George Mocatta. In 1866 a railway siding from the main Toowoomba line was opened which assisted in the development of a small settlement. It wasn't until the mid-1879s that a railway station was built. A butter factory was established in 1907. The building was replaced in 1926 by a brick building which operated until 1971. Grantham Post Office opened on 1 January 1890 (a receiving office had been open from 1876). On 10 January 2011, <span class="loc">Grantham</span> was severely damaged in a huge flash flood. Twelve people lost their lives and a large number of houses and other buildings were destroyed. Following the floods, <span class="loc">Grantham</span> received visits by politicians including Queensland Premier Anna Bligh on numerous occasions. <span class="loc">Australia</span>'s Governor-General Quentin Bryce also visited the town. In May 2011, it was announced that the town would be moved to higher ground to prevent future damaging floods. A 935-acre site was purchased so that landholders could be provided a voluntary swap of equivalent-sized blocks. The new site is situated on a hill overlooking <span class="loc">Grantham</span> and has permission from the state government to bypass the normal development approval process. Resident of nearby <span class="loc">Murphys Creek</span>, Postmans Ridge, Withcott and Helidon have been included in the fast-tracked plan.</p>
