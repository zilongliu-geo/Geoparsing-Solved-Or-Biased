<p><span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in rural <span class="loc">Hernando County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The estimated population was 98,621 in 2010 by the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> belongs to Florida's Nature Coast and is in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area. <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> is a working class area located north of <span class="loc">Tampa</span>, FL. <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> first appeared on <span class="loc">Hernando County</span> Maps in the mid-1800s along what is today Fort Dade Avenue just north of the community of <span class="loc">Wiscon</span>. The modern <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> was founded in 1967 as a planned community, which was developed by the Deltona Corporation and the Mackle Brothers who built the community. The plans for the community are actually identical to the community of <span class="loc">Deltona</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>. The Mackle Brothers sold many of the properties and land in the area through intense advertising. It appeared on maps of <span class="loc">Florida</span> as early as 1856. It has since become a sprawling semi-city in its own right, though it is an unincorporated area. The main entrance to the original development is marked by the <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> waterfall on <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> Drive and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 19 (Commercial Way). Its location has Hernando Beach to the west, <span class="loc">Brooksville</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span> to the east, and <span class="loc">Tampa</span> to the south via the Suncoast Parkway, <span class="loc">US</span> 41, and I-75.</p>
