  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jauja</span> (Shawsha Wanka Quechua: Shawsha or Shausha, formerly in Spanish Xauxa, with pronunciation of "x" as "sh") is a city and capital of <span class="loc">Jauja Province</span> in <span class="loc">Peru</span>. It is situated in the fertile <span class="loc">Mantaro</span> Valley, 45 kilometres (28 mi) to the northwest of <span class="loc">Huancayo</span> (the capital of <span class="loc">Junín Region</span>), at an altitude of 3,400 metres (11,200 ft). Its population according to the <span class="date">2007</span> census was 16,424. <span class="loc">Jauja</span>, which flourished for <span class="date">a short time</span>, was once the capital of Spanish <span class="loc">Peru</span>, prior to the founding of <span class="loc">Lima</span> as the new capital. Its name is referenced in the popular Spanish expression país de <span class="loc">Jauja</span>, which literally means "country of <span class="loc">Jauja</span>", but is used figuratively to mean a “never never land" or a "land of milk and honey”. The town, with a laid back ambiance and salubrious climate, has narrow streets with houses painted blue. <span class="per">Laguna de Paca</span> lake is close to the city. An important Xauxa town was located in the vicinity before the Incas. During the <span class="loc">Inca</span> civilization, the town of "Hatun Xauxa" was established. <span class="date">Today</span> the ruins of this settlement can be seen on a hill, approximately 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) southeast of the town. Oral tradition mentions that the <span class="loc">Inca</span> ordered the mutilation of men's and women's hands in <span class="loc">Jauja</span> and that this occurred in the <span class="per">Pampa de Maquinhuayo</span>, 5 miles (8.0 km) south of present-day <span class="loc">Jauja</span>.</p><br><br>
