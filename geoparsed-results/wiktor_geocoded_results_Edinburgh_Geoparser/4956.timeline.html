  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Hot Springs is a ghost town in <span class="loc">King County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Properly Green River Hot Springs, the town was first settled under the name <span class="loc">Kendon</span> by the Northern Pacific Railway in <span class="date">1886</span>. Hot Springs was at one time home to a large sanatorium built around the natural hot springs in the area, and by <span class="date">1907</span>–<span class="date">1908</span> had a population of 225 with two doctors. The sanatorium was reported to have been an impressive facility, having nice suites, bowling alleys and pool tables. The area was also home to <span class="per">Harvey Dean</span>'s mill (which gave the nearby town of <span class="loc">Lester</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span> its original name). By <span class="date">1913</span>–14 the town's population had dropped to 65, with no businesses mentioned. <span class="org">Evidence</span> points to the fact that sometime before <span class="date">1913</span>–14 the sanatorium had burned down. By <span class="date">1918</span>, the town had virtually vanished, only being listed as a "Discontinued Post Office." Hot Springs is located east of <span class="loc">Enumclaw</span> and just west of <span class="loc">Lester</span>, along the <span class="loc">Green River</span> and BNSF Railway line. Its elevation is <span class="date">1512</span> feet (460m) above sea level.</p><br><br>
