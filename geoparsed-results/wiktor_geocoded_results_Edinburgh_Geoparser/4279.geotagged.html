<p><span class="loc">Bagdad</span> is a small town 37 kilometres (23 mi) <span class="loc">north of Hobart</span>, <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>. It is in the Southern Midlands Council. In the days of the horse and buggy, <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> was an important rest area and horse-changing place for those continuing their journey up <span class="loc">Constitution Hill</span>. It is now an area of orchards and small mixed farms and a commuter settlement. The town was named by the explorer Hugh Germain, a private in the Royal Marines. He was said to carry two books in his saddlebags while travelling: the Bible and the <span class="loc">Arabian</span> Nights, which he used as inspiration when he named places. Bagdad Post Office opened on 1 December 1878. A railway line connected the town with <span class="loc">Hobart</span> from 1891 until 1947. In April 2003, during the early part of the <span class="loc">Iraq</span> war, the town's website was bombarded by confused internet users from around the world trying to contact Iraqis. The 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 996 persons in <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> on census night. Of these, 51.7% were male and 48.3% were female. The majority of residents (86.9%) are of Australian birth, with another 2.6% from <span class="loc">England</span>.</p>
