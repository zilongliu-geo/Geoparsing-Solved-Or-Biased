  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Ceres</span> is a locality of <span class="per">Geelong, Victoria</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. As one of the highest points in <span class="loc">Geelong</span>, <span class="loc">Ceres</span> has a lookout which overlooks the city. In the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Ceres</span> had a population of 201 people. The <span class="loc">Ceres</span> area was first settled by squatters in the late 1830s, and the lots of the <span class="loc">Barrabool Parish</span> were advertised in <span class="date">1839</span>, with the land being sold on <span class="date">5 February 1840</span>. There was reportedly "plenty of competition" for the <span class="loc">Barrabool</span> Hills lands, and the area became part of "Roslin", owned by <span class="per">David Fisher</span>. The government had not provided for a settlement in the <span class="loc">Barrabool Parish</span>, and Fisher, after selling much of his estate in <span class="date">1846</span>, advertised a section of the remainder for sale as the new village of <span class="loc">Ceres</span> in <span class="date">March 1850</span>. The town is presumably named after the Roman goddess of agriculture or less likely the dwarf planet. The first business to open in <span class="loc">Ceres</span> was the Wheat Sheaf Inn in <span class="date">September 1850</span>, which became a social centre for much of the <span class="loc">Barrabool district</span>. A second hotel, the <span class="loc">Rising Sun</span>, opened in <span class="date">1853</span>. The Post Office opened on <span class="date">14 February 1856</span>. In <span class="date">1856</span>, the village was reported to have the <span class="org">Seidel Bros</span>. vineyard, a blacksmith's forge and quarrier, a physician, a store, a shoemaker, a post office, a butcher, a surgeon, the two hotels, and a second forge. Coal was first discovered at <span class="loc">Ceres</span> in <span class="date">1842</span>, and a shaft sunk in <span class="date">1854</span>, but despite much excitement economical quantities were never found. A meeting at <span class="loc">Ceres</span> on <span class="date">10 November 1855</span> agreed to build a cemetery, which subsequently opened as the <span class="loc">Barrabool</span> Hills Cemetery (<span class="date">now</span> Highton Cemetery) in modern <span class="loc">Highton</span>.</p><br><br>
