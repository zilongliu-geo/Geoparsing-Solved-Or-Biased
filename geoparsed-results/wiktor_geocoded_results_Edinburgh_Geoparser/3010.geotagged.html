<p><span class="loc">Roseville</span> is a suburb on the Upper <span class="loc">North Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) north-west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district. It is within the local government areas of Ku-ring-gai and <span class="loc">Willoughby</span>. <span class="loc">Roseville</span> Chase is a separate suburb to the east. William Henry was one of Ku-ring-gai's first European settlers, who used the area for farming. There were a few fruit orchards and market gardens in the area. Other significant settlers were David Mathew, who owned a property called <span class="loc">Clanville</span>, and Richard Archbold, who was granted an area of 600 acres (2.4 km2) adjacent to <span class="loc">Clanville</span>. Archbold later acquired <span class="loc">Clanville</span> and set up an orchard on the property. Archbold's son-in-law had a stone cottage called <span class="loc">Rose Villa</span>, which was later demolished to make way for the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> railway line. <span class="loc">Roseville</span> eventually derived its name from <span class="loc">Rose Villa</span>. Roseville Post Office opened on 8 July 1901. <span class="loc">Roseville</span> East Post Office opened on 1 December 1937. Babbage Road was named for Eden Herschel Babbage (a grandson of Charles Babbage), a retired banker who lived in "Rawhiti" on Clanville Road. Dubbed the "Father of <span class="loc">Roseville</span>", he was largely responsible for developing <span class="loc">Roseville Park</span>, <span class="loc">Davidson Park</span> and <span class="loc">Roseville</span> Chase. His brother-in-law, Francis Robert Burton, donated the large pavilion in <span class="loc">Roseville</span> Park, following the death in 1913 of brother William Burton, of "Woodlands" on Bancroft Avenue.</p>
