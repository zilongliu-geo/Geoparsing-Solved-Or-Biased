  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>It has been confirmed that eight thoroughbred race horses at <span class="loc">Randwick</span> racecourse in <span class="loc">Sydney</span> have been infected with equine influenza. <span class="loc">Randwick</span> has been locked down, and is expected to remain so for <span class="date">up to two months</span>. It is expected that the virulent flu will affect the majority of the 700 horses stabled at <span class="loc">Randwick</span>. NSW Minister for Primary Industries said the facility would be quarantined until <span class="date">30 days</span> after the last sign of the flu. The cases are the first infections of race horses, despite infecting dozens of recreational horses across NSW and <span class="loc">Queensland</span>. The flu is highly contagious but cannot be transmitted to humans. The national racing shutdown was costing the industry tens of millions of dollars every day. Chief Executive of Racing NSW, <span class="per">Peter V</span>'Landys said while racing had been disrupted since a ban on horse movements <span class="date">last weekend</span> <span class="date">today</span> was a "grim, black day" for the racing industry in NSW. Racing is expected to resume in all Australian states except NSW and <span class="loc">Queensland</span> on <span class="date">the weekend</span>. While Sydney's spring racing carnival has been canceled, Melbourne's is expected to kick off <span class="date">this weekend</span> with the Caufield Cup. The cup will be ran with special precautions in place to attempt to keep the state free of the virus. Contact between the general public and those working with the horses will be banned and <span class="loc">Sydney</span>-based jockeys Darren <span class="per">Beadman</span> and <span class="per">Hugh</span> Bowman and a number of interstate trainers including <span class="per">Bart Cummings</span> are not allowed to take part. Federal Minister for Agriculture, <span class="per">Peter McGauran</span> said the spring carnival in <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> will remain "largely intact" despite losing some of the biggest names in Australian racing.</p><br><br>
