  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Houston (h ästen HOO-sten) is a village in the council area of <span class="loc">Renfrewshire</span> and the larger historic county of the same name in the west central Lowlands of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. Houston lies within the <span class="loc">Gryffe</span> Valley 6 miles (10 km) north-west of Paisley and is the largest settlement in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Houston and Killellan</span>, which covers the neighbouring village of <span class="loc">Crosslee</span> and a number of smaller settlements in the villages' rural hinterland. Built around a 16th-century castle and parish church dedicated to <span class="loc">Saint Peter</span>, which gave the area its former name of Kilpeter ("Cille Pheadair" in Scottish Gaelic), the present old village of Houston dates back to the 18th century and was designated a conservation area in <span class="date">1968</span>. A larger area of modern residential settlement has grown up around the village mainly in the mid-to late 20th century, at parts of the village such as at <span class="per">Craigends</span> and <span class="per">Brierie</span> Hills. These additions to the village have expanded its population considerably, changing its character chiefly to a dormitory settlement for nearby <span class="per">Glasgow</span> and <span class="per">Paisley</span>. Houston was originally known as Kilpeter. In the mid 12th century, the fee of Kilpeter was granted by <span class="loc">Baldwin</span> of <span class="loc">Biggar</span>, Sheriff of <span class="loc">Lanark</span>, to Hugh of <span class="loc">Pettinain</span>. From Hugh, the lands eventually became known as Houston (meaning "Hugh's tun or manor").</p><br><br>
