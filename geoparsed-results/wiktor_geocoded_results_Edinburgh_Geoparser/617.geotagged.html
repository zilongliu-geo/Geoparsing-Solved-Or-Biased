<p><span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> is a barrio (neighbourhood or district) of <span class="loc">Montevideo</span>, <span class="loc">Uruguay</span> and part of the Capurro / <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> composite barrio, with Artigas Boulevard separating the two. <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> shares borders with <span class="loc">Capurro</span> to the north west, <span class="loc">Prado</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Reducto</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Aguada</span> and the Port of <span class="loc">Montevideo</span> (which belongs to the <span class="loc">Ciudad Vieja</span>) to the south, and it borders the Bay of <span class="loc">Montevideo</span> to the south west. The south part of <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> has also been known as <span class="loc">Arroyo Seco</span> (dry stream) from as early as 1756. The name is still used today, though there are no precise limits that describe this area. Though there had been a few villas in this area before the 1840s, among which the residence of Joaquín Suárez, it was Francisco Farías who started auctioning building lots of the area in 1842. At the time, <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> was famous for offering a most scenic view of the bay and the city, hence its name. In 1869 the first train station was inaugurayed in the area, but in 1873 the Estación Central <span class="loc">General Artigas</span> in <span class="loc">Aguada</span> took its place.</p>
