  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Wal-Mart shooting threat dubious. <span class="loc">COLUMBUS</span> -- A text message about a potential gang initiation at a Wal-Mart is being disseminated electronically, but the <span class="loc">Columbus Police Department</span> has issued a press release stating the threat is “unsubstantiated.” The message warns recipients to not go to Wal-Mart because of a possible shooting as part of a gang initiation. The message does not specify a particular Wal-Mart. A local police department press release states the “<span class="loc">Columbus Police Department</span> received reports of a possible gang initiation shooting at Wal-Mart. “These reports are being investigated, and at this time the allegations are unsubstantiated,” the release states. “Wal-Mart has been made aware of the reports and have prior knowledge from the Wal-Mart home office. ”“Information was obtained via text messages and does not appear to be credible at this time,” according to the release. The same text message has been received in many areas of the country and in each case has been deemed a hoax:</p><br><br>
