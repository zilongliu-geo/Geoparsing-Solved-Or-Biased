  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Zhoushan</span> ; formerly transliterated as <span class="loc">Chusan</span>, is a prefecture-level city in <span class="loc">northeastern Zhejiang province</span> of Eastern <span class="loc">China</span>. One of the two prefecture-level cities of the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span> consisting solely of islands (the other is <span class="loc">Sansha</span> in <span class="loc">Hainan</span>, however its territory is in dispute), it lies across the mouth of the <span class="loc">Hangzhou</span> Bay, and is separated from the mainland by a narrow body of water. On <span class="date">8 July 2011</span> the central government approved <span class="loc">Zhoushan</span> as <span class="org">Zhoushan Archipelago New Area</span>, a state-level new area. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, its population was 1,121,261 whom 842,989 lived in the built-up area made of <span class="loc">Dinghai</span> and <span class="loc">Putuo</span> counties. The archipelago was inhabited <span class="date">6,000 years ago</span> during the Neolithic by people of the Hemudu culture. During the Spring and <span class="date">Autumn</span> period, <span class="loc">Zhoushan</span> was called <span class="loc">Yongdong</span> (甬东), referring to its location east of the <span class="loc">Yong</span> River, and belonged to the State of <span class="loc">Yue</span>. The fishermen and sailors who inhabited the islands often engaged in piracy and became recruits for uprisings against the central authorities. At the time of the Eastern <span class="loc">Jin</span> dynasty, <span class="loc">Zhoushan</span> Islands served as the base for Sun En's rebellion. Sun En, an adherent of the Taoist sect Way of the Five <span class="org">Pecks of Rice</span>, launched his rebellion around the <span class="date">year 400</span> and was defeated by <span class="loc">Jin</span> forces in 402. In 863, the Japanese Buddhist monk <span class="loc">Hui</span>'e (慧锷; Egaku) and a Putuoshan local Zhang-shi (张氏) placed a statue of <span class="loc">Guanyin</span> at <span class="loc">Chaoyin</span> Cave (潮音洞) that would later become a popular tourist and pilgrim destination. During the Ming dynasty, especially between the <span class="date">years</span> <span class="date">1530</span> and <span class="date">1560</span>, Japanese and Chinese pirates used <span class="loc">Zhoushan</span> as one of their principal bases from which they launched attacks as far as <span class="loc">Nanjing</span>; "the whole Chinese coast from northern <span class="loc">Shandong</span> to western Guangdong was ravaged to a distance of sixty miles inland."</p><br><br>
