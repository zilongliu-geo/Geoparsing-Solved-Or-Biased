<p><span class="loc">Yablonovka</span> (Russian: Яблоновка) is a rural locality (a selo) in <span class="loc">Rovensky District</span> of <span class="loc">Saratov Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located about 50 kilometers (31 mi) south of the <span class="loc">city of Engels</span> on the left bank of the <span class="loc">Volga River</span>. It was founded by <span class="loc">Volga</span> Germans in 1767 and until 1941 was known as <span class="loc">Lauwe</span>; other German names for the settlement were <span class="loc">Laube</span> and Schönfeld. It was founded on August 19, 1767 by the colonial agency LeRoy and Pictet and 169 Lutheran immigrants from <span class="loc">Germany</span>, following Catherine the Great's manifesto of July 22, 1763, which guaranteed settlers in the Russian Empire free transport and monetary support in reaching their new colonies, free choice of settlement location, freedom of trade, freedom from taxation for thirty years, interest-free loans for ten years, freedom of religion, freedom from conscription in perpetuity, and freedom of return to their homelands, but at their own expense. The settlement was named <span class="loc">Lauwe</span> after the first elder of the village. Its original demarcation consisted of 4,455 desiatinas. The first forty-seven settler families came from <span class="loc">Bavaria</span> (<span class="loc">Nuremberg</span>), <span class="loc">Baden</span>, <span class="loc">Hesse</span> (Darmstadt and Neu-Isenburg), the Palatinate, the <span class="loc">Rhineland</span>, <span class="loc">Saxony</span>, and <span class="loc">Brandenburg</span>. It was one of the ten colonies established by LeRoy and Pictet south of <span class="loc">Saratov</span> on the "meadow" (eastern) side of the <span class="loc">Volga</span> and along its eastern tributary, the Terlyk. In later years, it was also known under the German names of <span class="loc">Laube</span> and Schönfeld.</p>
