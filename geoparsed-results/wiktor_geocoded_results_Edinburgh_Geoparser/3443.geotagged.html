<p>Sterling is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Kenai Peninsula Borough</span>, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the 2000 census the population was 4,705. Sterling is located at 60°31′47″N 150°47′52″W (60.529635, -150.797887). Sterling is 29 km (18 mi) east of <span class="loc">Kenai</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 79.4 square miles (206 km2), of which, 77.3 square miles (200 km2) of it is land and 2.1 square miles (5.4 km2) of it (2.62%) is water. The town now known as Sterling was originally called <span class="loc">Naptowne</span> when it was first opened for settlement in 1947.[1] However, the area—which had a few homesteaders by then—acquired a post office in 1954 which was given the designation of Sterling after the Sterling Highway that served the area. An archaeological site, containing prehistoric <span class="loc">Dena</span>'ina house pits, has been discovered near Sterling, showing that the area was inhabited in prehistoric times. The main industries around Sterling today are support for tourism and sport fishing and hunting.</p>
