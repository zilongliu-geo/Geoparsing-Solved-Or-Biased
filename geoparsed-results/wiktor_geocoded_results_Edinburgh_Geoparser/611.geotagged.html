The name of the town originates from the word "Oniushi", meaning "a forested area" in the Ainu language. In the Japanese language the name of the town is written as 森, meaning forest. The suffix "町", denoting town status in <span class="loc">Japan</span>, is pronounced as -chō in every municipality of <span class="loc">Hokkaido</span> with the exception of <span class="loc">Mori</span>, where it is read as -machi. <span class="loc">Mori</span> sits on the eastern coast of the <span class="loc">Oshima</span> Peninsula and overlooks <span class="loc">Uchiura</span> Bay (30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter). The bay, also known as <span class="loc">Funka</span> Bay, is rich in squid and is the site of scallop aquaculture, both a mainstay of the town economy.</p>
