<p><span class="loc">Woodville</span> is a community in <span class="loc">Kawartha Lakes</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is located west of Lindsay. Population is approx. 650. Known in the late 19th century as Irish Corners, the name of the town was changed to <span class="loc">Woodville</span> after the completion of the post office under postmaster John Morrison. In 1871 the <span class="loc">Toronto</span> and Nipissing Railway was built though the flourishing settlement and in 1878 <span class="loc">Woodville</span> became a police village. <span class="loc">Woodville</span> had a town hall, lock-up, grist-mill, two foundries, a cheese factory, planing mill and sash and door factory, a number of dry goods stores, mechanics' shops, and three hotels. It also had its own brick school house, with two teachers, and two churches â€“ one Presbyterian, the other Methodist. Today, the cheese factory, rail station, gristmill, mechanics shops, and hotels have all been shut down. <span class="loc">Woodville</span> now is home to a grocery store, three restaurants, two variety stores, a post office, one gas station, a bank, a curling rink and arena, two baseball diamonds and a newer school, first built in 1923.</p>
