<p>Pope John Paul II left Rome's Gemelli hospital today, having been treated for throat spasms brought on by flu. The 84-year-old Pontiff had been in hospital for 10 days. <span class="loc">Vatican</span> spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said that the Pope had been "cured" from the breathing difficulties, which lead to his hospitalization. Navarro-Valls also said that the Pontiff had undergone a number of tests, including a CAT scan, which had ruled out any new illnesses. The <span class="loc">Vatican</span> reports that the Pope has recovered his voice and that he will make his regular appearance for crowds in St. Peter's Square. The <span class="loc">Vatican</span> is also being quiet regarding speculation as to the Pope's successor, the BBC reports. The Pope's last appearance was from his hospital window on Sunday (6th February).</p>
