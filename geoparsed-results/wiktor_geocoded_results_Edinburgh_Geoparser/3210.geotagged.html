<p>Warren is a town in <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,751 at the 2010 census. It includes the villages of <span class="loc">East Warren</span>, <span class="loc">Warren</span> and <span class="loc">South Warren</span>, the latter home to the <span class="loc">Maine</span> State Prison and minimum security Bolduc Correctional Facility. Part of the Waldo Patent, it was called the <span class="loc">Upper Town</span> of St. Georges Plantation. It was first settled by Scots-Irish settlers from <span class="loc">Londonderry</span> in 1736 under the auspices of Brigadier-General Samuel Waldo, its proprietor. Development was hindered, however, by the ongoing French and Indian Wars. In 1753, a blockhouse was built and placed under the command of Captain Thomas Kilpatrick, known by terrified Indians as "Tom-kill-the-devil." War raged across <span class="loc">Maine</span> between 1754–1758, and local settlers took refuge in the blockhouse or at another in <span class="loc">Cushing</span>. Hostilities ended in 1759 with the Fall of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. On November 7, 1776, <span class="loc">Upper Town</span> of St. Georges Plantation was incorporated as a town, named after Joseph Warren, a Revolutionary War hero. Hay was the principal crop. Shipbuilding was an important industry, and between 1770–1850, 224 vessels were built, varying from 53 to 1,127 tons. Warren had quarries to extract granite and limestone. Falls on the St. <span class="loc">George River</span> provided water power, with the first sawmill built in 1785. Woolens were manufactured at the Georges River Mills, and snowshoes at the Warren Shoe Factory. The <span class="loc">Knox</span> and Lincoln Railroad opened on November 6, 1871.</p>
