  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Anos</span> is a French commune in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department in the <span class="loc">Aquitaine region</span> of southwestern <span class="loc">France</span>. The inhabitants of the commune are known as Anosiens or Anosiennes Anos is located some 15 km north-east of <span class="loc">Pau</span> and 10 km south-east of <span class="loc">Auriac</span>. Access to the commune is by road D39 from <span class="loc">Morlaas</span> in the south passing north through the commune and the village and continuing north to join the D834 just north of <span class="loc">Astis</span>. Several other country roads also pass through the commune. The <span class="loc">Lau</span> river forms the western border of the commune with the eastern shore of the Lake of Saint-Amour (also called the Lake of <span class="loc">Anos</span>) forming the part just west of the village. The <span class="loc">Lau</span> flows north to join the <span class="loc">Luy de France</span> which also forms the eastern border of the commune. The commune name in Béarnais is Anòs (according to the classical norm of Occitan). Brigitte Jobbé-Duval indicates that <span class="loc">Anos</span> could be of Gallic origin being the name of the property owner <span class="loc">Andus</span> plus the suffix -ossu with a proposed meaning of "Domain of <span class="loc">Andus</span>". The name <span class="loc">Anos</span> was mentioned in <span class="date">1243</span> in the Titles of <span class="loc">Ossau</span> and in the Cassini map in <span class="date">1750</span>).</p><br><br>
