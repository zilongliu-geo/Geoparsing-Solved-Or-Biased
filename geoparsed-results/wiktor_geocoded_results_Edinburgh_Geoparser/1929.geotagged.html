<p>Thornton, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, originally called Texas Siding, is a townsite founded in 1917 and exists today as a township of <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. Thornton was named in honor of William Ezra Thornton, who had been prominent in the establishment of the townsite, and who also was for a time Thornton's Postmaster. Thornton once thrived as "an enterprising center of commerce." Thornton is now primarily a rural community and is home to a potato warehouse and the original Thornton Merc convenience store. Thornton's original store was "The Country Store" which was owned by William Ezra Thornton &amp; ran by William &amp; his wife, Wilhemina Hansas Lyman Thornton. At one time, Thornton "boasted of two fine general mercantile stores". Thornton's store was owned in the early 1900s by George Marler. A competing store in Thornton was owned by C. L. Galbraith. In 1971 the Thornton Merc, which had replaced the two prior mercantile stores was operated by Mrs. Geraldine Evans. As of 2010 it is still in operation, and "Marler" can still be seen faintly painted on the north side. Descendants of the Marler family still own property in Thornton.</p>
