  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lena</span> (also called <span class="loc">Willingham</span>) is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Hampton County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, just east of <span class="loc">Estill</span>. <span class="loc">Lena</span> is located at latitude 32.7535025ºN and longitude 81.2151029ºW, at an altitude of 108 feet (33 m). <span class="loc">Lena</span>'s history has largely been intertwined with the Southern Railroad (<span class="date">today</span>'s Norfolk Southern). From <span class="date">1899</span> until <span class="date">the 1980s</span>, Southern operated a line through <span class="loc">Lena</span> and nearby <span class="loc">Allendale</span>, <span class="loc">Tarboro</span>, and <span class="loc">Furman</span>. Called the "Southern Columbia to Savannah Route", the rail also ran through <span class="loc">Barnwell</span> and <span class="loc">Blackville</span> to the North. Its primary purpose for Southern was to increase north/south passenger/freight traffic by feeding into ACL (Atlantic Coast Line) at <span class="loc">Hardeeville</span> for passage south to <span class="loc">Florida</span> or north to <span class="loc">Charleston</span> and other points. The rail line was built to compete with another North/South rail line operated nearby by Seaboard <span class="loc">Air Line</span> (also called the <span class="org">Florida Central &amp; Peninsular</span>, later Seaboard Coast Line, and presently CSX) which ran a different course through <span class="loc">Denmark</span>, <span class="loc">Fairfax</span>, <span class="loc">Estill</span>, <span class="loc">Garnett</span> (parallel to <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 321) and then into <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. Between <span class="date">1963</span> and <span class="date">1970</span>, Southern abandoned its tracks between <span class="loc">Furman</span> and <span class="loc">Hardeeville</span> leaving <span class="loc">Furman</span> as the ending station from <span class="loc">Columbia</span>. Finally, in <span class="date">the early 1980s</span>, Southern abandoned its tracks south of <span class="loc">Blackville</span>, ending rail service to <span class="loc">Barnwell</span>, <span class="loc">Allendale</span>, <span class="loc">Lena</span>, and <span class="loc">Furman</span>. However, by <span class="date">the 1970s</span>, any rail service to <span class="loc">Furman</span> (through <span class="loc">Lena</span>) would have been a rare event.</p><br><br>
