<p><span class="loc">Monterey</span> is a suburb in southern <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> 15 km south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district and is part of the <span class="loc">St George</span> area. <span class="loc">Monterey</span> is in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Rockdale</span>. <span class="loc">Monterey</span> sits on the western shores of <span class="loc">Botany Bay</span>. Lady Robinsons Beach and Cook Park run along the eastern border. <span class="loc">Scarborough</span> Park, which features a pond, runs along the western border. The suburb is mostly residential with a small group of shops on Chuter Avenue, near the intersection of <span class="loc">Scarborough</span> Street. The 1987 Music Video for Mental As Anything's single "He's just no good for you" was filmed in <span class="loc">Scarborough Street</span>, <span class="loc">Monterey</span>. <span class="loc">Monterey</span> was originally part of Brighton-Le-Sands and <span class="loc">Ramsgate</span>. As the area developed, street names with a Californian influence were selected such as <span class="loc">Hollywood</span>, <span class="loc">Monterey</span>, <span class="loc">Pasadena</span> and <span class="loc">Culver</span>. A small group of shops were built on Chuter Avenue, near <span class="loc">Monterey</span> Street. When the post office opened here it was known as the <span class="loc">Monterey</span> post office. Rockdale Council wanted to create a new suburb, although not everyone agreed with this name as some thought it was too American, especially with some of the street names already in the area. Since most people were in favour, <span class="loc">Monterey</span> was officially declared a suburb in 1972.</p>
