  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> (<span class="date">2011</span> population 126,748) is a city located in Southern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> at the confluence of the Grand and <span class="org">Speed</span> rivers in the <span class="loc">Regional Municipality of Waterloo</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is an amalgamation of the <span class="loc">City of Galt</span>, the towns of <span class="per">Preston</span> and <span class="per">Hespeler</span>, and the hamlet of <span class="per">Blair</span>. <span class="loc">Galt</span> covers the largest portion of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, making up the southern half of the city. <span class="per">Preston</span> and <span class="per">Blair</span> are located on the western side of the city, while <span class="per">Hespeler</span> is in the most northeasterly section of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> began as a composite city in <span class="date">1973</span>, when the <span class="loc">City of Galt</span>, Towns of <span class="per">Preston</span> and <span class="per">Hespeler</span>, and the hamlet of <span class="per">Blair</span> were amalgamated. There was considerable resistance among the local population to this "shotgun marriage" arranged by the provincial government and a healthy sense of rivalry had always governed relations among the three communities. Even <span class="date">today</span>, though many residents will tell the outside world that they call Cambridge home, they will often identify themselves to each other as citizens of <span class="loc">Galt</span> or <span class="per">Preston</span> or <span class="per">Hespeler</span>. Each unique centre has its own history that is well documented in the <span class="loc">Cambridge City</span> Archives.</p><br><br>
