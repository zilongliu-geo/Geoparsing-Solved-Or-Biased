There have been schools in one form or another on the present school grounds since 1868. The first school in <span class="loc">Formosa</span> was a log structure, erected in 1854. It doubled as a temporary church in the early days of the community for the visiting Jesuit missionaries. It was on the northwest corner of lot 30, Concession A, Carrick Township. With the growth of the community, a large stone school was completed in 1868, on land donated by local businessman F.X. Messner. He also donated land and a 2 1⁄2-story convent building in 1872, hoping to establish <span class="loc">Formosa</span> as a headquarters for the School Sisters of <span class="loc">Notre Dame</span>. This was situated on the northeast hill of the valley, near the church. A smaller one-story stone school was also constructed nearby.</p>
