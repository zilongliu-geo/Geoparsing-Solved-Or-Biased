  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Roca</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Lancaster County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the Lincoln, <span class="loc">Nebraska Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 220 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Roca</span> is located at 40°39′26″N 96°39′38″W (40.657101, -96.660619). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.14 square miles (0.36 km2), all of it land. The population of <span class="loc">Roca</span> in <span class="date">1890</span> was 190, the highest it has been before the present day. The post office was established <span class="date">September 22, 1894</span>. When the town was platted in <span class="date">1876</span>, the citizens wished to choose a name, which would suggest the chief industry in the area, stone quarrying. <span class="loc">Roca</span> is the Spanish word for stone. In <span class="date">1857</span> <span class="per">John</span> and <span class="per">Margaret</span> Prey, adult sons, <span class="per">John</span> W., Thomas, and William, and teenage children, <span class="per">David</span> and <span class="per">Rebecca</span>, came from <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> to preempt land near the proposed town called "Olathe." There were high hopes for <span class="date">the future</span> of the area, which was designated as "<span class="loc">Clay County</span>." However, not many people ventured this far onto the prairie. While there were no major confrontations with Indians, there were several scares, which caused some settlers to leave and not return. Indians took <span class="per">Rebecca</span> Prey, but they released her when her father and brothers appeared.</p><br><br>
