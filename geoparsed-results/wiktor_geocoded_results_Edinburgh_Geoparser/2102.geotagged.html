<p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 51,407. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Dandridge. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Morristown</span>, <span class="loc">TN</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the Knoxville-Morristown-Sevierville, TN Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was established on June 11, 1792, by William Blount, Governor of the Southwest Territory. It had been a part of <span class="loc">Caswell County</span> during the State of Franklin period (1784â€“1789). <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat, Dandridge, was settled in 1783. On the eve of the Civil War, <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, like most other counties in mountainous <span class="loc">East Tennessee</span>, was opposed to secession. In Tennessee's Ordinance of Secession referendum on June 8, 1861, <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> voters rejected secession by a margin of 1,987 to 603. A railroad bridge at <span class="loc">Strawberry Plains</span> was among those targeted by the <span class="loc">East Tennessee</span> bridge-burning conspiracy in November 1861. This led to internal conflict in the area throughout the war, with men from the county enlisting in both of the rival armies. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>'s current mayor is Alan Palmieri. The county has 21 commissioners, two from each of the ten districts, with <span class="loc">White Pine</span> electing three.</p>
