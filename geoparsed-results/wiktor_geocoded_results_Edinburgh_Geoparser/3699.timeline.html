  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Palau</span> (/pəˈlaʊ/, historically <span class="loc">Belau</span> or Pelew), officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Palau</span> (Palauan: <span class="loc">Beluu er a Belau</span>), is an island country located in the western <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. The country's population of around 21,000 is spread across 250 islands, which form the western chain of the <span class="loc">Caroline Islands</span> in <span class="loc">Micronesia</span>. The most populous of these is <span class="loc">Koror</span>. The capital Ngerulmud is located on the nearby island of <span class="loc">Babeldaob</span>, in Melekeok State. <span class="loc">Palau</span> shares maritime boundaries with <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>, the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, and the Federated States of <span class="loc">Micronesia</span>. The country was originally settled <span class="date">approximately 3,000 years ago</span> by migrants from the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> and sustained a Negrito population until around <span class="date">900 years ago</span>. The islands were first explored by Europeans in the 16th century, and were made part of the Spanish <span class="loc">East Indies</span> in <span class="date">1574</span>. Following <span class="loc">Spain</span>'s defeat in the Spanish–American War in <span class="date">1898</span>, the islands were sold to <span class="org">Imperial</span> <span class="loc">Germany</span> in <span class="date">1899</span> under the terms of the German–Spanish Treaty, where they were administered as part of German <span class="loc">New Guinea</span>. The <span class="org">Imperial</span> Japanese Navy conquered <span class="loc">Palau</span> during World War I, and the islands were later made a part of the Japanese-ruled South Pacific Mandate by the <span class="org">League of Nations</span>. During World War II, skirmishes, including the <span class="per">major Battle</span> of Peleliu, were fought between American and Japanese troops as part of the Mariana and <span class="loc">Palau Islands</span> campaign. Along with other Pacific Islands, <span class="loc">Palau</span> was made a part of the <span class="loc">United States</span>-governed Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in <span class="date">1947</span>. Having voted against joining the Federated States of <span class="loc">Micronesia</span> in <span class="date">1979</span>, the islands gained full sovereignty in <span class="date">1994</span> under a <span class="org">Compact of Free Association</span> with the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p><br><br>
