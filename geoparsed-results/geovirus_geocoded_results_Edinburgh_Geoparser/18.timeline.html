  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>35,000 chickens at Witford <span class="loc">Lodge Farm</span> at <span class="loc">Norfolk</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> are to be culled after some chickens found dead tested positive for bird flu. Further tests are being carried out to establish which strain of the virus it was, but preliminary results suggest it is not the H5N1 strain, but is instead the H7N7 strain. The birds are being culled as a precautionary measure. The H7N7 strain can be transmitted to humans, but not as easily or as lethally as the H5N1 strain. Previous outbreaks of the H7N7 strain include one from <span class="date">2003</span> in the <span class="loc">Netherlands</span>, which infected more than 80 people and led to the death of one vet. So far the only positive test for H5N1 in the <span class="loc">UK</span> has been a dead swan found in Fife.</p><br><br>
