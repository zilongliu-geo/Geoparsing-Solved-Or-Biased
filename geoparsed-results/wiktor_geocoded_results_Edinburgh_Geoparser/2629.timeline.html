  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alexandra is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Yavapai County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. The ghost town was settled during the frontier <span class="date">days</span> of <span class="date">1875</span> as a mining camp until abandoned in <span class="date">1896</span>. Alexandra is ten miles east of <span class="loc">Mayer</span>. Alexandra was founded by E.G. Peck, the owner of the Peck Mine, a famous mining company at the time, <span class="per">T.M. Alexander</span>, <span class="per">William Cole</span> and a man named C.C. Bean. <span class="date">One day</span> in <span class="date">June 1875</span> while walking through the <span class="loc">Bradshaw Mountains</span>, Peck noticed a peculiar rock partly underground. After examination, the rock proved to be pure silver and the first of Alexandra was founded. The town is located in Peck Canyon and was named Alexandra after <span class="per">Mrs. T.M. Alexander</span>, a founder and the first lady to be at the town. A long mountain road separated the town from <span class="loc">Mayer</span>. The silver ore produced from the mine was taken via pack train through Bradshaws to <span class="loc">Aztlan</span> Mill, thirty miles away. This became troublesome so eventually Peck built his own mill at Alexandra in <span class="date">1877</span>. <span class="date">A year later</span> a post office was established. The town boomed and grew to seventy-five to 100 buildings. General stores, saloons, boarding houses, livery stables, a blacksmith and a brewery all existed there. Alexandra was lively until litigation problems began and by <span class="date">1879</span> the town was mostly uninhabited and remained so for <span class="date">years</span>. The post office closed in <span class="date">1896</span> but in <span class="date">1903</span>, a new mine shaft was founded at Peck Mine. This did not save the town though, apparently Alexandra never thrived again and became a ghost.</p><br><br>
