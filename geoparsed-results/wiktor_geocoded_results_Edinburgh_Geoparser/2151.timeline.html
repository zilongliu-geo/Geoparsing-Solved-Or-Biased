  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Tolland County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 26,543 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">October 1702</span> from the Town of <span class="loc">Windham</span>, in <span class="loc">Hartford County</span>. When <span class="loc">Windham County</span> was formed on <span class="date">12 May 1726</span>, <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> then became part of that county. <span class="date">A century later</span>, at a town meeting on <span class="date">3 April 1826</span>, selectmen voted to ask the General Assembly to annex <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> to <span class="loc">Tolland County</span>. That occurred <span class="date">the following year</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> contains the community of <span class="loc">Storrs</span>, which is home to the main campus of the <span class="org">University of Connecticut</span> and the associated <span class="org">Connecticut Repertory Theatre</span>. The first silk mill in the <span class="loc">United States</span> was constructed in <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> and financed by pilgrim descendent, <span class="per">William Fisk</span>. The town, along with neighboring <span class="loc">Willimantic</span>, played an important role in the manufacture of thread and other textiles. Though nothing remains of the mill (<span class="date">now</span> on display at the Henry <span class="loc">Ford Museum</span> in <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>), <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> has held onto several other historic landmarks. A fully intact gristmill, dating to <span class="date">1835</span>, the Gurleyville Gristmill is the only one of its kind in <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. Built on the <span class="loc">Fenton River</span>, this stone grist mill remains intact with the original equipment. There are tours available <span class="date">May</span> through <span class="date">October</span>. The adjacent miller's house is the birthplace of former CT <span class="per">governor Wilbur</span> L. Cross. More recent yet rare nonetheless, the Mansfield Drive-in, a drive-in movie theater, and Lucky Strike Lanes, a duckpin bowling alley, are among the last of their breed in the nation.</p><br><br>
