<p><span class="loc">Washington</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, within the <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="loc">PA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area in the southwestern part of the state. The population was 13,663 at the 2010 census. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, <span class="loc">Washington</span> has a total area of 3.3 square miles (8.5 km2), all land. Delaware Indian chief Tangooqua, commonly known as "Catfish", had a camp on a branch of <span class="loc">Chartiers Creek</span>, in what is now part of the <span class="loc">city of Washington</span>. The French labeled the area "Wissameking", meaning "catfish place", as early as 1757. The area of <span class="loc">Washington</span> was settled by many immigrants from <span class="loc">Scotland</span> and the north of <span class="loc">Ireland</span> along with settlers from eastern and central parts of colonial Virginia. It was first settled by colonists around 1768. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed an act on March 28, 1781, erecting the <span class="loc">County of Washington</span> and naming "Catfish Camp" as the place for holding the first election. This was the first county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> to be named in honor of General <span class="loc">George Washington</span>. David Hoge laid out a plan of lots immediately after the legislature's action. His original plot carried the name "Bassett, alias Dandridge Town," but before the plot was recorded, lines were drawn through "Bassett, alias Dandridge Town" with ink, and the word "Washington" was written above. There have long been rumors among locals that the town was named “Washington” because <span class="loc">George Washington</span> spent the night in the region once. This is not true however; <span class="loc">Washington</span> had never been to the area.</p>
