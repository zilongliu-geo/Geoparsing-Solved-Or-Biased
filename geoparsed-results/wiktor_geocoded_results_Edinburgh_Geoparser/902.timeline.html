Several Spanish missions were established near the site in an effort to Christianize the Indian tribes living in the area, but these projects were abandoned by the mid-1750s. The mission buildings soon fell into ruin, and by the end of the 19th century little trace of them remained. The town of <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> was formally established in <span class="date">1843</span> or <span class="date">1844</span>, when <span class="per">Jesse</span> and <span class="per">Peter</span> Mercer built cabins on the <span class="loc">San Gabriel River</span>. <span class="per">Peter Mercer</span> was killed by Indians on <span class="date">June 17, 1844</span>, and was buried in Locklin Cemetery at <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span>, not far from where he was killed. The area on the <span class="loc">San Gabriel River</span> where he was killed is still called Mercer's Bluff. The community was granted a post office in <span class="date">1850</span>. By the mid-1880s <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> had a steam gristmill-cotton gin, a church, two schools, and 130 residents.

The number of residents fell to 200 by <span class="date">the early 1940s</span>, and to seventy-five by <span class="date">the late 1950s</span>. <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> served as the center of a common-school district until <span class="date">1960</span>, when the school was consolidated with the nearby and academically well respected <span class="org">Thorndale Independent School District</span>. The <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> post office was discontinued in <span class="date">the late 1960s</span>.
