  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wilmington</span> is a village between <span class="loc">Axminster</span> and <span class="loc">Honiton</span> in <span class="loc">East Devon</span> on the A35 road. The village is <span class="date">now</span> in the <span class="loc">parish of Widworthy</span> although this is a recent change. Prior to 1989 houses on the north side of the A35 were in <span class="loc">Offwell Parish</span> and only those on the south side were in <span class="loc">Widworthy</span>. St Cuthberts Church dates from the 14th century and nearby <span class="loc">Castle Hill</span> is of historical interest. From the 15th century onwards <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> sat astride the main <span class="loc">Exeter</span> to <span class="loc">London</span> road. It became the <span class="loc">Honiton</span> to <span class="loc">Axminster</span> Turnpike in <span class="date">1765</span> but the importance of this route diminished when the <span class="loc">Upottery</span> to <span class="loc">Ilminster</span> turnpike opened in <span class="date">1807</span> which led to a steady improvement in coaching facilities in the early 19th century on what is <span class="date">now</span> the A30/A303 route over the <span class="loc">Blackdown</span> Hills from <span class="loc">Honiton</span> to <span class="loc">Ilminster</span>. In <span class="date">1805</span> the village street rang to the clatter of horses hooves as messengers raced through with news of the Battle of <span class="loc">Trafalgar</span>. In <span class="date">2005</span> this historic event was marked by the unveiling of this plaque on the White Hart Inn. The plaque records details of the messengers and remembers local men who fought at the Battle.</p><br><br>
