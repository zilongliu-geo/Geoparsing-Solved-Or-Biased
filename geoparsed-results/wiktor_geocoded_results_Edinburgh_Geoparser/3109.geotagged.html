<p><span class="loc">Santa Paula</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ventura County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Situated amidst the orchards of the fertile <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> River Valley, the city advertises itself to tourists as the "Citrus Capital of the World." <span class="loc">Santa Paula</span> was one of the early centers of <span class="loc">California</span>'s petroleum industry. The Union Oil Company Building, the founding headquarters of the Union Oil Company of <span class="loc">California</span> in 1890, now houses the California Oil Museum. The population was 29,321 at the 2010 census, up from 28,598 at the 2000 census. The area of what today is <span class="loc">Santa Paula</span> was originally inhabited by the Chumash, a Native American people. In 1769, the Spanish Portola expedition, first Europeans to see inland areas of <span class="loc">California</span>, came down the <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> River Valley from the previous night's encampment near <span class="loc">Fillmore</span> and camped in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Santa Paula</span> on August 12, near one of the creeks coming into the valley from the north (probably <span class="loc">Santa Paula Creek</span>). Fray Juan Crespi, a Franciscan missionary travelling with the expedition, had previously named the valley Ca√±ada de <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span>. He noted that the party traveled about 9 to 10 miles (14 to 16 km) that day and camped near a large native village, which he named <span class="loc">San</span> Pedro Amoliano. The site of the expedition's arrival has been designated <span class="loc">California</span> Historical Landmark No. 727.</p>
