  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gulu</span> is a city in Northern <span class="loc">Uganda</span>. It is the commercial and administrative centre of <span class="loc">Gulu District</span>. The coordinates of <span class="loc">Gulu</span> Municipality are: 2°46'54.0"N 32°17'57.0"E. The distance from <span class="loc">Gulu</span> to <span class="loc">Kampala</span>, <span class="loc">Uganda</span>'s capital and largest city, is approximately 340 kilometres (210 mi) by road. The town is served by <span class="loc">Gulu</span> Airport and a railway line. During British colonial rule in the 18th and 19th <span class="date">centuries</span>, northern <span class="loc">Uganda</span> was less developed than the rest of the country. The people were conscripted into the army and the police, as a source for the security. Many were sent to fight in the First World War and in the Second World War. <span class="loc">Uganda</span> gained independence in <span class="date">1962</span>, but this did not improve the situation for the people in the north. Several rebel groups were formed by <span class="date">the end of 1986</span>. However, these rebel groups were ex soldiers, i.e., the UNLA from the government prior to Museveni. By <span class="date">1987</span> most of these rebels had joined Museveni's force. Then came another rebel group led by <span class="per">Alice</span> "<span class="per">Lakwena</span>" <span class="loc">Auma</span> from <span class="date">1988</span> to <span class="date">1989</span>. The Lord's Resistance Army sprang up in <span class="date">the 1990s</span> after <span class="per">Alice Lakwena</span> left <span class="loc">Uganda</span> and went to <span class="loc">Kenya</span>. The LRA became increasing violent in <span class="loc">Gulu</span> and the surrounding communities. The UPDF government army has equally been accused of brutality against the civilian population.</p><br><br>
