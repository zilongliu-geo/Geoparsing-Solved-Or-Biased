  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Santiago</span> (/ˌsæntiˈɑːɡoʊ/; Spanish pronunciation: [sanˈtjaɣo]), also known as <span class="per">Santiago</span> de <span class="loc">Chile</span> [sanˈtjaɣo ðe ˈtʃile], is the capital and largest <span class="loc">city of Chile</span>. It is also the center of its largest conurbation. <span class="per">Santiago</span> is located in the country's central valley, at an elevation of 520 m (1,706 ft) above mean sea level. Founded in <span class="date">1541</span>, <span class="per">Santiago</span> has been the capital <span class="loc">city of Chile</span> since colonial times. The city has a downtown core of 19th century neoclassical architecture and winding side-streets, dotted by art deco, neo-gothic, and other styles. <span class="per">Santiago</span>'s cityscape is shaped by several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing <span class="loc">Mapocho</span> River, lined by parks such as Parque Forestal. The <span class="loc">Andes Mountains</span> can be seen from most points in the city. These mountains contribute to a considerable smog problem, particularly during <span class="date">winter</span>. The city outskirts are surrounded by vineyards and <span class="per">Santiago</span> is within a few hours of both the mountains and the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. <span class="per">Santiago</span>'s steady economic growth over <span class="date">the past few decades</span> has transformed it into a modern metropolis. The city is <span class="date">now</span> home to a growing theater and restaurant scene, extensive suburban development, dozens of shopping centers, and a rising skyline, including the tallest building in Latin <span class="loc">America</span>, the Gran Torre <span class="per">Santiago</span>. It includes several major universities, and has developed a modern transportation infrastructure, including a free flow toll-based, partly underground urban freeway system and the <span class="per">Metro de Santiago</span>, <span class="loc">South America</span>'s most extensive subway system. <span class="per">Santiago</span> is the cultural, political and financial center of <span class="loc">Chile</span> and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational corporations. The Chilean executive and judicial powers are located in <span class="per">Santiago</span>, but Congress meets in nearby Valparaíso.</p><br><br>
