<p>Auburn is a suburb in western <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Auburn is located 19 kilometres west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district and is the administrative centre of the local government area of Auburn Council. Auburn prides itself as one of the most multicultural communities in <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The traditionally Anglo-Celtic European population has slowly been replaced by a high percentage of immigrants from Turkish, Lebanese and Vietnamese backgrounds. The suburb was named after Oliver Goldsmith's poem The Deserted Village, which describes 'Auburn' in <span class="loc">England</span> as the loveliest village of the plain. The Auburn area was once used by Aboriginal people as a market place for the exchange of goods, a site for ritual battles and a 'Law Place' for ceremonies. The area was located on the border between the Darug inland group and the Eora/Dharawal coastal group. The <span class="loc">Wangal</span> and Wategoro, sub-groups or clans, are the groups most often recognised as the original inhabitants of the Auburn/<span class="loc">Homebush</span> Bay region. Bennelong, one of the most famous Aboriginies of the time, was a member of <span class="loc">Wangal</span>, as was his wife, Barangaroo. Pemulwuy, who organised tribes to resist the white settlement of the <span class="loc">Sydney region</span> from 1790 to 1802 was also a member of the <span class="loc">Wangal</span>.</p>
