  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Lexington County</span> smoking ban push reignited. Supporters of a smoking ban for <span class="loc">Lexington County</span> settled <span class="date">Tuesday</span> on a deal that is less than desired but is designed to end a stalemate. The plan would snuff smoking in restaurants and bars, except on outdoor decks and patios and inside private clubs that were open as of <span class="date">Jan. 1 this year</span>. Restrictions in stores, offices and other places would remain at the owner’s discretion. “It’s the best we can get right <span class="date">now</span>,” council chairman <span class="per">Debbie Summers</span> said. The plan quickly won approval from a <span class="org">County Council</span> committee, setting the stage for ending a conflict that has persisted since fall. The nine-member council can take it up as soon as <span class="date">April 14</span>. Some supporters say the proposal is the last attempt to break the standoff. “If this doesn’t make it, the deal is dead,” <span class="per">Councilman Bill Banning</span> said. But he expects narrow approval <span class="date">next month</span>. Allowing smoking decks and patios is “creating miniature leper colonies,” Councilman <span class="per">Todd Cullum</span> said. All nearby communities with a ban allow that except for the town of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>. <span class="per">Mayor Randy Halfacre</span> said he will seek to permit smoking decks and patios in his community if the new county plan for unincorporated areas is put into place. But town leaders will stick with their ban on smoking inside any workplace, he said. The new plan for county restrictions is “a big step” even though it is less than some advocates want, <span class="per">Halfacre</span> said. The plan received a mixed reaction from one spokesman for the bar and restaurant industry. Bars and restaurants can live with a uniform ban, <span class="per">Tom Sponseller</span> said. “If it’s a level playing field, everyone gets treated the same, and there’s no harm,” he said. But he is concerned the exemption for private clubs could become either a loophole or a restriction so tight that it also bars smoking in country clubs and sites that nonprofit clubs operate for members.</p><br><br>
