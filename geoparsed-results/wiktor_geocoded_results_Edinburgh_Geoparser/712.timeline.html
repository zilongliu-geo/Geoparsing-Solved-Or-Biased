  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Weston</span> is a village and civil parish in the English <span class="loc">county of Suffolk</span> located approximately 2 miles (3 km) south of <span class="loc">Beccles</span> in the <span class="loc">District of Waveney</span>. The parish lies either side of the A145 and is crossed by the <span class="loc">Ipswich</span> to <span class="loc">Lowestoft</span> railway line. Neighbouring villages include <span class="loc">Ellough</span>, <span class="per">Ringsfield</span>, <span class="loc">Willingham</span> <span class="per">St Mary</span> and <span class="per">Shadingfield</span>. The village is largely dispersed with a mid-2005 population estimate for the parish of 230, measured at 257 in the <span class="date">2011</span> Census. The village has few services and a joint parish council covers both <span class="per">Ringsfield</span> and <span class="per">Weston</span>. The village once had a school, on King's Lane, and a public house, the <span class="per">Duke of Marlborough</span> on the main A145. Both are <span class="date">now</span> closed and the major centre of population in the parish is to the west where it borders <span class="loc">Ringsfield Corner</span>. The parish church is medieval in origin and dedicated to <span class="per">St Peter</span>. It has a primarily Norman core and is a Grade I listed building. The parish was combined with that of All Saints Church, <span class="loc">Ellough</span> in <span class="date">the 1970s</span>. The village is named in the Domesday book as Westuna and formed part of the William the Conqueror's estate, with land also being held by Roger <span class="per">Bigot, Hugh</span> de <span class="loc">Montfort</span> and <span class="per">Geoffrey de Mandeville</span>. The village, which formed part of the Hundred of <span class="loc">Wangford</span>, had a population of around 30 families and paid around 2 geld in taxation.</p><br><br>
