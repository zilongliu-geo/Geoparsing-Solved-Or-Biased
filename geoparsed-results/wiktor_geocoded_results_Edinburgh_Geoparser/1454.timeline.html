  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Rochester</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Strafford County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 29,752. The city includes the villages of <span class="loc">East Rochester</span> and <span class="loc">Gonic</span>. <span class="per">Rochester</span> is home to Skyhaven Airport and the annual <span class="per">Rochester</span> Fair. <span class="per">Rochester</span> was once inhabited by Abenaki Indians of the Pennacook tribe. They fished, hunted and farmed, moving locations when their agriculture exhausted the soil for growing pumpkins, squash, beans and maize. <span class="loc">Gonic</span> was called Squanamagonic, meaning "the water of the clay place hill." The town was one of four granted by Colonial Governor <span class="per">Samuel Shute</span> of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> during his brief term. Incorporated in <span class="date">1722</span>, it was named for his close friend, <span class="per">Laurence Hyde</span>, <span class="per">Earl of Rochester</span> and brother-in-law to King <span class="per">James II</span>. As was customary, tall white pine trees were reserved for use as masts by the Royal Navy. But hostility with the Abenaki delayed settlement until <span class="date">1728</span>, although attacks would continue until <span class="date">1748</span>. Early dwellings clustered together for protection, beginning near <span class="loc">Haven Hill</span>. Due to warfare or disease, after <span class="date">1749</span> Native American numbers dwindled, although many descendants remain in or around <span class="per">Rochester</span> communities. The community at that time included <span class="loc">Farmington</span>, which would be incorporated in <span class="date">1798</span>, and Milton, in <span class="date">1802</span>.</p><br><br>
