  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Pedro</span> (/sanˈpidɾo/) is a community within the city of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. Formerly a separate city, it consolidated with <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> in <span class="date">1909</span>. The Port of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, a major international seaport, is partially located within <span class="loc">San Pedro</span>. The district has grown from being dominated by the fishing industry to become primarily a working class community within the city of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. The site, at the southern end of the <span class="loc">Palos Verdes Peninsula</span>, on the west side of <span class="loc">San Pedro Bay</span>, was used by Spanish ships starting in the 1540s. The peninsula, including all of <span class="loc">San Pedro</span>, was the homeland of the Tongva-Gabrieleño Native American people for <span class="date">thousands of years</span>. In other areas of the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> Basin archeological sites date back 8,000–<span class="date">15,000 years</span>. The Tongva believe they have been here since the beginning of time. Once called the "lords of the ocean," due to their mastery of oceangoing canoes (Ti'ats), many Tongva villages covered the coastline. The Tongva lived in a virtual paradise, until colonization. Their first contact with Europeans in <span class="date">1542</span> with João Cabrilho (<span class="per">Juan Cabrillo</span>), the Portuguese explorer who also was the first to write of them. <span class="per">Chowigna</span> and <span class="per">Suangna</span> were two Tongva settlements of many in the peninsula area, which was also a departure point for their rancherias on the <span class="loc">Channel Islands</span>. Legend has it that the Native Americans blessed the land of <span class="loc">Palos Verdes</span>, making it the most beautiful place on Earth. The Tongva called the <span class="loc">San Pedro</span> area "Chaaw".</p><br><br>
