<p><span class="loc">Dera</span> is a town in southeastern <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. Located in the Arsi Zone of the <span class="loc">Oromia Region</span>, this town has a latitude and longitude of 08°20′N 39°19′E. It is the administrative center of Dodotana Sire woreda. By the late 1960s, <span class="loc">Dera</span> was provided with electricity from a dam on the <span class="loc">Awash River</span>. In October 1969, Emperor Haile Selassie inaugurated a water supply system for the town built at a cost of <span class="loc">Birr</span> 170,000. The system drew water from the Awash II dam 10 kilometers away. A weekly market is held on Mondays, where grain and livestock can be bought and sold. According to the Oromia Regional government, this town is currently supplied with electricity 24 hours a day, and has telephone service. Construction on the 99 kilometer road between <span class="loc">Chole</span> and <span class="loc">Dera</span> was completed and opened for traffic 15 August 2009, at a cost of over 146 million <span class="loc">Birr</span>. The Ethiopian Roads Authority reported that the new road would reduce the distance between the two towns by ahalf. On 17 May 1974, an official in <span class="loc">Dera</span> had a dispute with local farmers regarding land 7 kilometers away. The official returned with some city men and two police, and a fight with the locals ensued, in which two of the farmers and one of the police were killed. The local police at <span class="loc">Asella</span> wanted to occupy the site of the fight and place the inhabitants under military rule. The Governor General of <span class="loc">Arsi Province</span> refused to allow them to do this, but was himself soon arrested and removed.</p>
