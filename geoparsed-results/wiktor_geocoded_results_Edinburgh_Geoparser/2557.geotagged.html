<p>The <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> (Tamil: வட மாகாணம் Vaṭakku Mākāṇam; Sinhalese: උතුරු පළාත Uturu Paḷāta) is one of the nine provinces of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>, the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> established provincial councils. Between 1988 and 2006 the province was temporarily merged with the <span class="loc">Eastern Province</span> to form the <span class="loc">North Eastern Province</span>. The capital of the province is <span class="loc">Jaffna</span>. The majority of the Sri Lankan Civil War was played out and had its roots in this province. Parts of present-day <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> were part of the pre-colonial Jaffna kingdom. Other parts were ruled by Vanniar Chieftains who paid tribute to the Jaffna kingdom. The province then came under Portuguese, Dutch and British control. In 1815 the British gained control of the entire island of <span class="loc">Ceylon</span>. They divided the island into three ethnic based administrative structures: Low Country Sinhalese, Kandyan Sinhalese and Tamil. The <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> was part of the Tamil administration. In 1833, in accordance with the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, the ethnic based administrative structures were unified into a single administration divided into five geographic provinces. The <span class="loc">districts of Jaffna</span>, <span class="loc">Mannar</span>, Nuvarakalaviya (present day <span class="loc">Anuradhapura District</span>) and <span class="loc">Vanni</span> formed the new <span class="loc">Northern Province</span>. Nuvarakalaviya was transferred to the newly created <span class="loc">North Central Province</span> in 1873.</p>
