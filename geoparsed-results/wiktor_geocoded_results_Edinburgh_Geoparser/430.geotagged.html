<p><span class="loc">La Paz</span> was a short-lived, early gold mining town along the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> in La <span class="loc">Paz County</span> on the western border of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. It was the location of the <span class="loc">La Paz</span> Incident in 1863, the westernmost confrontation of the American Civil War. The town was settled in 1862 in New <span class="loc">Mexico</span> Territory, before the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Territory was officially declared a <span class="loc">United States</span> territory by President <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span>. Today it is a deserted ghost town. In 1983, long after the town was deserted, the name was adopted by the newly formed <span class="loc">Arizona county</span> of <span class="loc">La Paz</span>. <span class="loc">La Paz</span> is Spanish for "peace"; the town was presumably named after another earlier town named <span class="loc">La Paz</span>, such as <span class="loc">La Paz</span>, <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>, or <span class="loc">La Paz</span>, <span class="loc">Baja California Sur</span>. Mountain man Pauline Weaver discovered gold in the vicinity in January 1862, starting the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> gold rush. <span class="loc">La Paz</span> grew up in the spring of 1862 along the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> to serve the miners washing placer gold in the <span class="loc">La Paz</span> Mining District. This district produced about 50,000 troy ounces of gold per year in 1863 and 1864. <span class="loc">La Paz</span> had a population of 1,500 and was a stage stop between <span class="loc">Fort Whipple</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span> and <span class="loc">San Bernardino</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The town was the county seat of <span class="loc">Yuma County</span> from 1864 to 1870, and as the largest town in the territory in 1863 was considered for the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> territorial capital.</p>
