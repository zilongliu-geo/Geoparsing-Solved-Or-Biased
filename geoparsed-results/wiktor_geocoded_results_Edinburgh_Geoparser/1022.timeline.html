  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is a suburban community on the outskirts of <span class="loc">Chicago metropolitan</span> area, located 51 miles (82 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Chicago</span> in the center of <span class="loc">McHenry County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">McHenry County</span>. The population was 24,770 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city is the home to a historic turn-of-the-century town square, including the <span class="org">Woodstock Opera House and Old</span> <span class="loc">McHenry County</span> Courthouse. The city was named one of the nation's Dozen Distinctive Destinations in <span class="date">2007</span> by the <span class="org">National Trust for Historic Preservation</span>. <span class="loc">Centerville</span>, as <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> was originally called, was chosen as the county seat on <span class="date">September 4, 1843</span>, due to its location at the geographic center of <span class="loc">McHenry County</span>. Early area settler <span class="per">Alvin Judd</span> developed a plat for the town, incorporating a two-acre public square, near which a 2-story frame courthouse and jail were constructed <span class="date">the following year</span> by George C. <span class="per">Dean</span> and <span class="per">Daniel</span> <span class="loc">Blair</span>. In <span class="date">1845</span>, resident <span class="per">Joel Johnson</span>'s recommendation to give <span class="loc">Centerville</span> a more original name was met, and thereafter the town was known as <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> (after <span class="per">Johnson</span>'s hometown of <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>). However, the town was listed as "Center" on the <span class="date">1850</span> Federal Census. In <span class="date">1852</span>, <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> was incorporated as a village with <span class="per">Judd</span> as President. In response to a burgeoning population following the Civil War, <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1873</span>. John S. Wheat was elected as <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>'s first mayor. A vital artery for the growing town was the train line, which allowed for a substantial industrial presence early in the town's history.</p><br><br>
