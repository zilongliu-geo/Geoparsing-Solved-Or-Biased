<p><span class="loc">Randa</span> is a town in central <span class="loc">Djibouti</span> in the largest region, that of <span class="loc">Tadjoura</span>, it is the capital of the <span class="loc">Randa District</span>. The settlement lies in a small valley, north of the Day Forest National Park in the <span class="loc">Goda</span> Mountains. It lies at the junction of two solely domestic roads, the N11 and N12. It is within 10 miles (16 km) of the national park. Randa's altitude gives the settlement and the surrounding area a milder climate than the <span class="loc">Djibouti City</span> coastal area, where the weather is typically hotter. A river runs through the town. Often dry, the watercourse divides <span class="loc">Randa</span> in half. The surrounding mountains to the west are high and jagged, lengthening journeys in that direction. <span class="loc">Randa</span> has a semi-arid climate, with generally warm winters and hot summers. Despite its location in the tropics, due to the high altitude, the town seldom experiences either hot or cold weather. The settlement has relatively high average precipitation for the region, twice that of <span class="loc">Tadjourah city</span> for example. Average monthly temperatures in Randa range from 14°C in the months of December and January to 34.7°C in June.</p>
