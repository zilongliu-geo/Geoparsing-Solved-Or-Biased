  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>County lifts burn ban. The burn ban issued for <span class="loc">Walker County</span> on <span class="date">Jan. 18</span> was lifted <span class="date">Monday</span> following a conference between <span class="org">Huntsville Fire</span> Chief <span class="per">Tom Grisham</span> and <span class="loc">Walker County</span> Judge <span class="per">Danny Pierce</span>. With the discontinuation of the burn ban, all <span class="loc">Walker County</span> residents will <span class="date">now</span> be allowed to conduct outdoor burns. Those residents living within <span class="loc">Huntsville city</span> limits, however, will be required to obtain an updated burning permit from the fire department. “<span class="per">Grisham</span> and <span class="per">Pierce</span> met <span class="date">today</span> and lifted the burn ban on county, so anybody in the county is allowed to burn,” said Jason <span class="date">January</span> with the <span class="org">Huntsville Fire Department</span>. “On the 14-day outlook, it shows us being out of immediate fire danger, and while different parts of the county have received different amounts of rain, we’ve dropped an average of two hazard classes as an entire county.” Residents of <span class="loc">Huntsville</span> will be able to pick up a burning permit — which is mandatory for city residents who plan to burn — at either of the city’s fire stations, <span class="date">January</span> said. “While the burn ban has been lifted, people who live in the city will still need to come by <span class="org">Huntsville Fire</span> Station 1 or 2 to obtain a new burning permit,” he said. “This is necessary because all burning permits expire once a burn ban has been enacted.” <span class="date">January</span> said the burning permits, which are free to the public, will allow the permit holders to burn for <span class="date">60 days</span>. While the permits will negate any legal concerns for residents, <span class="date">January</span> said the community is still encouraged to keep in contact with the local fire department to stay aware of any future burn bans. “Even though we received some rain over <span class="date">the last week</span>, we can’t predict conditions for the area in <span class="date">the next few weeks</span>,” he said. “Based on how much rain we receive in <span class="date">the next few weeks</span>, the burn ban could go back into effect.” According to <span class="date">January</span>, 190 of approximately 250 counties in the state are still under burn bans, but the change in soil saturation seen in <span class="loc">Walker County</span> has allowed the local ban to be lifted. “Though we have lifted our burn ban for the time being, we still want to make sure everybody is being really careful,” he said. “We’re thankful we’re able to do this <span class="date">now</span>, primarily because it allows us to clear out a lot of debris, trash and wood that has piled up since <span class="date">January</span>. “Still, we want people to exercise caution as we’re probably going to have some controlled burns get out of control, even with this amount of rain.” <span class="loc">Walker County</span> residents are also asked to be considerate of their neighbors while burning, as certain items to be burned may produce high amounts of smoke. “We have a definite concern with the amount of wetness in things that might be burned,” <span class="date">January</span> said. “Things like sticks, brush and leaves are all wet right <span class="date">now</span>, and when people try to light those things on fire, they’re going to create a lot of smoke. “We just want everyone to think about their neighbors whenever they’re burning.”</p><br><br>
