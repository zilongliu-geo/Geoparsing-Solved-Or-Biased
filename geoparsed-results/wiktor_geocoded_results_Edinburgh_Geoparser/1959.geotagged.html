The legislature ordered the area around his plantation to be the seat of <span class="loc">Granville County</span>. The city was not incorporated until 1816. [1] The first Masonic orphanage for children in the <span class="loc">United States</span> was built in <span class="loc">Oxford</span>. It was originally established as St. John's College in 1858. The college floundered however. In 1872 the community suggested that the property be used to educate the less fortunate. In December 1873 the first residents were admitted to the Oxford Orphans Asylum, which is today known as the Masonic Home for Children. [2] In 1851 James H. Horner established Horner Military Academy, which served many young men from <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, Virginia, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> and other states. Many of the students went on to become leaders in the <span class="loc">United States</span> government, such as James Crawford Biggs, Solicitor General under President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the inception of the <span class="loc">New Deal</span>.</p>
