<p>Warren is a town in <span class="loc">Bristol County</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 10,611 at the 2010 census. Warren was the site of the Indian village of Sowams on the peninsula called Pokanoket (the near parts now called Mount Hope Neck), and was first explored by Europeans Edward Winslow and Stephen Hopkins in 1621. By the next year, <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span> had established a trading post at Sowams. In 1623, Winslow and John Hampden saved the life of Wampanoag Sachem Massasoit with medicine, gaining an important native ally. In 1636, Roger Williams was banished from <span class="loc">Salem</span> and fled to Sowams, where he was sheltered by <span class="loc">Massasoit</span> until he settled at Providence, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. Permanent English settlement began east of the Indian village. In 1653, <span class="loc">Massasoit</span> and his oldest son sold to certain <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span> settlers what is now Warren and parts of <span class="loc">Barrington</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, <span class="loc">Swansea</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, and <span class="loc">Rehoboth</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. After the death of <span class="loc">Massasoit</span>, relations became strained between the Indians and the settlers, leading to King Philip's War in 1675. The English settlement at Sowams was destroyed during the war but was rebuilt.</p>
