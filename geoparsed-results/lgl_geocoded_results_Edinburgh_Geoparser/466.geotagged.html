<p>Garden waste collection charge set to double. The cost of recycling green waste is set to double, affecting more than 10,000 residents. Previously residents could rent a 240 litre bin for a year from when they signed up and pay no extra for collection, or buy 110 litre green sacks for £1 each, plus postage. But from Wednesday every resident signing up to the fortnightly green waste collection scheme or renewing their agreement will have to pay the increased price. The cost of the sacks is also rising to £1.40 each. David Lawton, from the Teddington Society’s environment group, called the rise “insensitive.
