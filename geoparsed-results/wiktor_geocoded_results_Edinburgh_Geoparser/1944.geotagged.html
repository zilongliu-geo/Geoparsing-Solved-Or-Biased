<p><span class="loc">Karimabad</span> (Urdu: كريم آباد‎) is the capital of <span class="loc">Hunza</span> Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan, northern <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>. <span class="loc">Karimabad</span> is also known as <span class="loc">Baltit</span> or <span class="loc">Hunza</span>. It is named after Prince Karim Aga Khan, the spiritual head of Shia Ismaili Nizari community. The Guardian ranked it as one of the five "Best Tourist Sites" in <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>. Both <span class="loc">Baldit</span> Fort and Karimabad village received the World Award of Tourism in 2000 when <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, <span class="loc">India</span> and <span class="loc">Britain</span> and other countries competed. Karimabad town, located on the west bank of the <span class="loc">Hunza River</span>, is in the <span class="loc">Northern Areas</span> of the Pakistani-administered part of the Kashmir region, in a valley which is at 8,200 feet (2,500 m) elevation. The town is made up of stone walled steep sloping large terraces. The town was a caravan halting place for people who were traveling through the <span class="loc">Hindu Kush</span> mountains to the <span class="loc">Vale of Kashmir</span>. It is set amidst snow clad mountain peaks of <span class="loc">Rakaposhi</span> (altitude of about 25,000 feet (7,600 m)), and glaciers like the Ulter Nala as a backdrop, and deep gorges. Access is by hill road from <span class="loc">Gilgit</span>.</p>
