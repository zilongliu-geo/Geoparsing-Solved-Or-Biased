<p><span class="loc">Washington</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">City of Sunderland</span>, in <span class="loc">Tyne and Wear</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, and part of historic <span class="loc">County Durham</span>. <span class="loc">Washington</span> is located geographically at an equal distance from the centres of <span class="loc">Newcastle</span>, <span class="loc">Durham</span> and <span class="loc">Sunderland</span>, hence it has close ties to all three cities. <span class="loc">Washington</span> was designated a new town in 1964; it expanded dramatically, by the creation of new villages and the absorption of areas of Chester-le-Street, to house overspill population from surrounding cities. At the 2011 census, its urban subdivision (which contains the neighboring settlement of <span class="loc">New Herrington</span>) had a population of 67,085. In 2001 the population of <span class="loc">Washington</span> itself was 55,454, compared with 55,196 a decade later, which is a decrease of 258 people. The population decrease is a characteristic shared with the nearby <span class="loc">city of Sunderland</span> as well as some areas in the Metropolitan <span class="loc">borough of Gateshead</span>. Early references appear around 1096 in Old English as Wasindone. The etymological origin is disputed and there are several proposed theories for how the name "Washington" came about. Early interpretations included Wasindone (people of the hill by the stream, 1096), or Wassyngtona (settlement of Wassa's people, 1183).</p>
