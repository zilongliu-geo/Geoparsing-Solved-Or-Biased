<p><span class="loc">Ely</span> (/ˈiːli/, EE-lie) is the largest city and county seat of White <span class="loc">Pine County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Ely</span> was founded as a stagecoach station along the <span class="loc">Pony Express</span> and Central Overland Route. Ely's mining boom came later than the other towns along <span class="loc">US</span> 50, with the discovery of copper in 1906. Though the railroads connecting the First Transcontinental Railroad to the mines in Austin and Eureka have long been removed, the railroad to <span class="loc">Ely</span> is preserved as a heritage railway by the <span class="loc">Nevada</span> Northern Railway and known as the Ghost Train of Old <span class="loc">Ely</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 4,255. <span class="loc">Ely</span> was founded as a stagecoach station along the <span class="loc">Pony Express</span> and Central Overland Route. Ely's mining boom came later than the other towns along <span class="loc">US</span> 50, with the discovery of copper in 1906. This made <span class="loc">Ely</span> a mining town, suffering through the boom-and-bust cycles so common in the West. Originally, <span class="loc">Ely</span> was home to a number of copper mining companies, Kennecott being the most famous. With a crash in the copper market in the mid-1970s, Kennecott shut down and copper mining disappeared (temporarily).</p>
