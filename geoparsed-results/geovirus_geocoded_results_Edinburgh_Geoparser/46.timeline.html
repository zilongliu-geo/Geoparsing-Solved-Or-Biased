  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Six students in <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span> tested positive for the H1N1 influenza virus. This occurrence is part of a rise in A(H1N1) and malaria during <span class="date">recent weeks</span> in two provinces, as was the confirmation of twenty cases of malaria in <span class="loc">Zambales</span>. Officials from the <span class="org">Department of Health</span> say that they are not surprised, as A(H1N1) cases began to appear at about the same time <span class="date">last year</span>, coinciding with the onset of the local flu season. Other health officials believe that the rise is due to the onset of the rainy season. The department noted that all prior cases in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> have been "mild" and patients fully recovered. In the current case, five of those affected have recovered, while one still shows slight symptoms. "If we look at the pattern for <span class="date">this month</span>, it was also the same time <span class="date">last year</span> when cases of A(H1N1) started increasing," says <span class="per">Dr. Lyndon Lee Suy</span>, "As it is, it is flu season already." The <span class="org">Department of Health</span> believes that the appearance of the virus should not cause distress; however, <span class="per">Suy</span> warns that a new strain could appear. The <span class="loc">Philippines</span> reported their first case of A(H1N1) in <span class="date">May 2009</span> in a ten-year-old child from the <span class="loc">United States</span>. According to the World Health Organization, 214 countries and territories have confirmed cases of A(H1N1), with a total of more than 18,311 deaths. As of <span class="date">June 2009</span>, around 129 cases have been reported in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>.</p><br><br>
