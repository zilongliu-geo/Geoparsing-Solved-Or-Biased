<p><span class="loc">Hastings</span> is a city in Dakota and Washington counties, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, near the confluence of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">Vermillion</span>, and St. Croix Rivers. Its population was 22,172 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Dakota County</span>, which contains most of it as well as a small part extending into <span class="loc">Washington County</span>. It is named for the first elected governor of the state of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, Henry Hastings Sibley. The advantages of Hastings's location that led to its original growth are that it is well-drained, provides a good riverboat port, and is close to a hydropower resource at the falls of the <span class="loc">Vermillion River</span>. Other sites closer to the river confluence are either too swampy (<span class="loc">Dakota County</span>) or too hilly (<span class="loc">Washington County</span> and <span class="loc">Pierce County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>). <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 61 and Minnesota State Highways 55 and 316 are three of the main routes in <span class="loc">Hastings</span>. The area around <span class="loc">Hastings</span> was first settled by a military detachment sent from Fort Snelling to guard a blocked shipment of supplies in the winter of 1820. A Lieutenant William G. Oliver camped in an area that would come to be known as Oliver's Grove, and in 1833 a trading post was opened there. After the Treaty of <span class="loc">Mendota</span> of 1851 opened the area for white settlement, Oliver's Grove was surveyed and incorporated as a city in 1857, a year before Minnesota's admission to the union. That same year <span class="loc">Hastings</span> was named the county seat of <span class="loc">Dakota County</span>. The name "Hastings" was drawn out of a hat from suggestions placed in it by several of the original founders.</p>
