  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The number of horses confirmed to be infected with Equine Influenza in <span class="loc">Australia</span> has risen to 47, all in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>. So far none of those confirmed infected have been thoroughbred race horses. The NSW government has confirmed infections at the federal government's quarantine facility at <span class="loc">Eastern Creek</span> and Centennial Park in <span class="loc">Sydney</span>; at <span class="loc">Cattai</span> and <span class="loc">Wilberforce</span> in North-Western Sydney; and in <span class="loc">Moonbi</span>, <span class="loc">Parkes</span>, <span class="loc">Berry</span> and <span class="loc">Wyong</span> in regional NSW. It is also feared that the outbreak may have spread to <span class="loc">Warwick</span> in <span class="loc">Queensland</span> where three horses from NSW showed flu-like symptoms during an equestrian event. Initial samples were tested in a laboratory in <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> revealing the three animals had been carrying the flu. Further testing will be conducted on samples from the horses in Victoria, although results are not expected until <span class="date">later this week</span>. All 300 horses at the event have been quarantined. There are also three suspected cases of the virus infecting thoroughbreds at <span class="loc">Randwick</span> racecourse in <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, if the horses test positive to the flu they will be the first thoroughbreds to be infected with the virus. The Federal Agriculture Minister, <span class="per">Peter McGauran</span> told <span class="org">ABC</span> Radio this morning that while the source of the outbreak was not known, it is likely that the outbreak may have been caused by an equestrian event held in <span class="loc">Maitland</span> on the <span class="date">18th and 19th of August</span>. "Everyone's been assuming it was the Centennial Park horses that travelled and infected horses in different parts of regional NSW," he said. "It would appear at this stage that almost all, if not every horse affected has passed through a <span class="loc">Maitland</span> horse event on <span class="date">the weekend</span> of the 18th and 19th, or come in contact with a <span class="loc">Maitland</span> horse."</p><br><br>
