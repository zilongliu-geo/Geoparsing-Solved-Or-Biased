  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Beaufort</span> is a town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located on the Western Highway midway between <span class="loc">Ararat</span> and <span class="loc">Ballarat</span>, in the <span class="loc">Pyrenees</span> Shire local government area. It is 387 metres (1,270 ft) above sea level. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="per">Beaufort</span> had a population of 1,004. The town takes its name either from Rear-Admiral <span class="per">Francis Beaufort</span> or a Welsh village in <span class="loc">Monmouthshire</span>. The area was once occupied by the Wadawurrung Aborigines who called the area 'Peerick' or 'Yarram-yarram'. <span class="per">Thomas Mitchell</span> passed through the district on his expedition of <span class="date">1836</span>. Early settlers in the area were the <span class="org">Kirkland Brothers</span> and a <span class="per">Mr. Hamilton</span>; the latter took up <span class="loc">Trawalla</span> Station in <span class="date">1838</span>. The station was taken over by Adolphus Goldsmith in <span class="date">1841</span> and he developed the property into a rich grazing enterprise. <span class="loc">Lake Goldsmith</span> was named after him. Gold was discovered in <span class="date">1852</span>, with another gold rush from <span class="date">1854</span> at nearby <span class="loc">Fiery Creek</span>. The <span class="loc">Fiery Creek</span> diggings supported four townships, <span class="per">Beaufort</span>, Yam Holes Creek, <span class="loc">View Point</span> and <span class="loc">Southern Cross</span>, during the 1850s. The population on the fields reportedly reached approximately 100,000 people at its height in the late 1850s and produced 450,000 ounces of gold over a two-year period, <span class="date">1855</span>â€“<span class="date">1856</span>.</p><br><br>
