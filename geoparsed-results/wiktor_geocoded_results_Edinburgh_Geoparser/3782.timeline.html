  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Elgin</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,711 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The community is named after the <span class="per">Lady Elgin</span>, a ship lost on Lake Michigan. The city is known for the <span class="org">Elgin Opera House</span>, originally dedicated in <span class="date">1912</span>. Hunters, trappers, and people of all ethnic groups. They called them "half breeds Back them" came to <span class="loc">Elgin</span> from over Tollgate. Very rarely did they make the treacherous travels from <span class="loc">LaGrande</span>. Because it was "120 miles away" by river through the valley. Which back then was covered in thick forest. <span class="per">Elgin</span> was the gathering place for trappers and hunters to replenish their supplies. This is how <span class="per">Elgin</span> became the "<span class="per">Elgin</span> Huskies". Many came across the mountain by sled dog. From the <span class="loc">Walla Walla</span> area and the <span class="loc">Wallowa</span>'s. <span class="per">Mr. Mckinnis</span> was the first to bring his family here he brought cattle from <span class="loc">Illinois</span> and settled right on what was the outskirts of <span class="per">Elgin</span>. Built one of the first homes. Even though his home is not set in the history in <span class="per">Elgin</span> there is a letter from his wife's sister to his wife proof of this fact. <span class="per">Mr. McKinnis</span> build the mills from <span class="per">Elgin</span> to Lagrande and also owned all the century farms in the valley passing them down to his kin in death. He also worked in the First Bank in <span class="per">Elgin</span> before they moved to Lagrande. <span class="per">Mr. McKinnis</span> dated building this home here in <span class="date">1864</span>. Making <span class="per">Elgin</span>'s existence somewhat of a mystery. Although we can safely say "The Lady Of The Lake" is older than she seems.</p><br><br>
