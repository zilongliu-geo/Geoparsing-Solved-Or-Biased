    In 1956, residents and business owners in Dillon were notified that they would need to sell their property and move out, because Denver Water was about to begin construction on a dam just downstream from the town, and the resulting reservoir (which would help supply water to Front Range communities) was going to flood Dillon and the surrounding valley.

  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="was set aside for the current townsite, which is now">
    About a mile to the north, some land on a hillside was set aside for the current townsite, which is now situated on the shoreline of Dillon Reservoir.
