<p>Traffic plan in the works for Olympic oval. Richmond Winterfest Weekend attracted 47,000 people to the Richmond Olympic Oval and has, in part, prompted staff to plot a traffic plan for future events. Winterfest and last December’s opening ceremony brought a crush of people—and vehicles—to the city’s riverfront venue. In her report to council, events development manager Ann Phelps noted experience at both events are being drawn upon to produce a traffic and transportation plan for future events. The oval hosted Winterfest Weekend on Feb. 14 and 15. It was the third annual event organized by the city, attracting 350 volunteers and costing $668,000—$90,000 came from city coffers, the rest from sponsors. This year’s headliners were rock band Brandon Paris Band and illusionist Julianna Chen.</p>
