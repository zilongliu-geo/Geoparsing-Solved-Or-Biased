<p><span class="loc">Thornton</span> is a village and civil parish on the <span class="loc">River Great Ouse</span> about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) north-east of <span class="loc">Buckingham</span> in the <span class="loc">Aylesbury Vale</span> <span class="loc">district of Buckinghamshire</span>. The toponym is derived from the Old English for "thorn tree by a farm". The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as Ternitone. The earliest record of the Church of England Church of <span class="loc">Saint Michael</span> and All Angels dates from 1219. The present building is 14th-century, but was dramatically restored between 1770 and 1800 and largely rebuilt by the Gothic Revival architect John Tarring in 1850. The restorers retained a number of mediaeval features, including the 14th-century belltower, chancel arch and clerestory and 15th century clerestory windows. The Tudor Revival Thornton House was also built to John Tarring's designs in 1850. It incorporates parts of a mediaeval house that was modernised in the 18th century. <span class="loc">Thornton College</span>, an independent day and boarding school for girls, occupies the former <span class="loc">Manor House</span>. The school educates girls aged 4 - 16 and has a nursery for boys and girls aged 2Â½ to 4. Since the Sisters of Jesus and Mary (a Roman Catholic religious order), purchased the site in 1917, there have been a significant number of new developments at the school, most recently an award winning Science and Junior Classroom wing (AVDC Outstanding Design Award). The school now has over 370 pupils.</p>
