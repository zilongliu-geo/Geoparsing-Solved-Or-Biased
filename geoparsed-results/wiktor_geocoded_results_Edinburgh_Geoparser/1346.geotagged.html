<p><span class="loc">Lake County</span> is one of the 64 counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 7,310. The county seat and the only municipality in the county is <span class="loc">Leadville</span>. The highest natural point in <span class="loc">Colorado</span> and the entire <span class="loc">Rocky Mountains</span> is the summit of <span class="loc">Mount Elbert</span> in <span class="loc">Lake County</span> at 14,440 feet (4401.2 meters) elevation. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> was one of the original 17 counties created by the <span class="loc">Colorado</span> legislature on November 1, 1861. As originally defined, <span class="loc">Lake County</span> included a large portion of western <span class="loc">Colorado</span> to the south and west of its present boundaries. The county was named for <span class="loc">Twin Lakes</span>. Placer gold was found at <span class="loc">Colorado</span> Gulch in 1863 as part of the <span class="loc">Colorado</span> Gold Rush. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> slowly lost territory over the succeeding decades, losing land in its southeast to <span class="loc">Saguache County</span> in 1866 and <span class="loc">Hinsdale County</span> in 1874; in its southwest to La <span class="loc">Plata County</span> in 1874 and <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Juan County</span> in 1876, and in its west to <span class="loc">Ouray</span> and <span class="loc">Gunnison</span> counties in 1877. With its many reductions in size, <span class="loc">Lake County</span>'s designated county seat also changed multiple times within just a few years, residing successively in <span class="loc">Oro City</span> (from 1861), Lourette (from 1863), Dayton (from 1866), and Granite (from 1868).</p>
