<p><span class="loc">Nogales</span> is a city in the mountainous western region of the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Veracruz</span>. It serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of <span class="loc">Nogales</span>. It is situated at 18°49′N 97°10′W, at an altitude of 1280 m. In the 2005 INEGI Census, the city reported a total population of 21113. The name "Nogales" is the Spanish for walnut trees. This part of the future state of <span class="loc">Veracruz</span> was brought under Aztec sway in or around 1450 under Emperor Moctezuma Ilhuicamina. Following the Spanish conquest of <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, the area was awarded to the conquistador Ojeda el Tuerto. <span class="loc">Ojeda</span> introduced sugar cane into the area, and the <span class="loc">San</span> Juan Bautista Nogales sugar mill – one of the earliest, if not the very first on the American continent – was later established there. In 1627, Rodrigo de Vivero y Aberrucia, owner of the sugar mill at the time, was named the First Count of the Valley of <span class="loc">Orizaba</span> by Philip III of <span class="loc">Spain</span>. On 27 October 1812, during the War of Independence, the sugar mill was taken by surprise by General José María Morelos, who used it as a staging post for his attack on the royalist forces in <span class="loc">Orizaba</span> the next day.</p>
