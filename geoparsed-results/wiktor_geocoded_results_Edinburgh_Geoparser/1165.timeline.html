  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Colombia</span> (/kəˈlʌmbiə/ kə-LUM-biə or /kəˈlɒmbiə/ kə-LOM-biə; Spanish: [koˈlombja]), officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Colombia</span> (Spanish:  República de <span class="loc">Colombia</span> ), is a country situated in the northwest of <span class="loc">South America</span>, bordered to the northwest by <span class="loc">Panama</span>; to the east by <span class="loc">Venezuela</span> and <span class="loc">Brazil</span>; to the south by <span class="loc">Ecuador</span> and <span class="loc">Peru</span>; and it shares maritime limits with <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span>, <span class="loc">Nicaragua</span>, <span class="loc">Honduras</span>, <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>, <span class="loc">Dominican Republic</span> and <span class="loc">Haiti</span>. It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments. The territory of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Colombia</span> was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples including the Muisca, <span class="loc">Quimbaya</span>, and <span class="loc">Tairona</span>. The Spanish arrived in <span class="date">1499</span> and initiated a period of conquest and colonization ultimately creating the Viceroyalty of <span class="loc">New Granada</span>, with its capital at Bogotá. Independence from <span class="loc">Spain</span> was won in <span class="date">1819</span>, but by <span class="date">1830</span> "Gran <span class="loc">Colombia</span>" had collapsed with the secession of <span class="loc">Venezuela</span> and <span class="loc">Ecuador</span>. What is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Colombia</span> and <span class="loc">Panama</span> emerged as the Republic of <span class="loc">New Granada</span>. The new nation experimented with federalism as the <span class="org">Granadine Confederation</span> (<span class="date">1858</span>), and then the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">Colombia</span> (<span class="date">1863</span>), before the <span class="loc">Republic of Colombia</span> was finally declared in <span class="date">1886</span>. <span class="loc">Panama</span> seceded in <span class="date">1903</span>.</p><br><br>
