Concord is known as the 'Parklands Suburb' of the Inner West. Concord West is a separate suburb, to the north-west. Concord takes its name from Concord, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in the <span class="loc">USA</span>, which was the site of the Battle of Concord, one of the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1778). Some historians believe the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> suburb was named Concord to encourage a peaceful attitude between soldiers and settlers. The first land grants in the area were made in 1793. The original Concord Council was established in 1883. Concord Council amalgamated with Drummoyne Council in 2000 after 117 years of self governance to form the City of <span class="loc">Canada Bay</span>. It is also the name of the surrounding parish.
