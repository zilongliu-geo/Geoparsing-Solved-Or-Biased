<p>Dunkeld (Scots: Dunkell, from Scottish Gaelic: Dùn Chailleann, "fort of the Caledonians") is a small town in <span class="loc">Perth</span> and <span class="loc">Kinross</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is about 15 miles north of <span class="loc">Perth</span> on the eastern side of what is now the A9 road into the <span class="loc">Scottish Highlands</span>, and on the opposite (north) side of the <span class="loc">River Tay</span> from the village of Birnam. Dunkeld and Birnam share a railway station, (<span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> and <span class="loc">Birnam</span> railway station) on the Highland Main Line. Population 1,170 (2004). On the western side of the A9 is The Hermitage, a National Trust for <span class="loc">Scotland</span> site. <span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> Cathedral is on the north bank of the <span class="loc">River Tay</span>. The name Dùn Chailleann means Fort of the Caledonii or of the Caledonians. The 'fort' is presumably that on <span class="loc">King's Seat</span>, slightly north of the town (NO 009 440). Both these place-names imply an early importance for the area of the later town and bishop's seat, stretching back into the Iron Age. Dunkeld (Duncalden and variants in early documents) is said to have been 'founded' or 'built' by Caustantín son of Fergus, king of the Picts (d. 820). This founding likely referred to one of an ecclesiastical nature on a site already of secular importance. Probably originally constructed as a simple group of wattle huts, the monastery - or at least its church - was rebuilt in the 9th century by Kenneth I of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> (reigned 843–858). Caustantín of the Picts brought <span class="loc">Scotland</span>'s share of the relics of <span class="loc">Columba</span> from <span class="loc">Iona</span> to <span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> at the same time others were taken to <span class="loc">Kells</span> in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, to protect them from <span class="loc">Viking</span> raids. Dunkeld became the prime bishopric in eastern <span class="loc">Scotland</span> until supplanted in importance by <span class="loc">St Andrews</span> since the 10th century.</p>
