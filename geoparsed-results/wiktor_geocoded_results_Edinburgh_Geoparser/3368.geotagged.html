The languages spoken on <span class="loc">Buton</span> include Wolio, Cia-Cia, various dialects of <span class="loc">Muna</span>, Tukang Besi, Kumbewaha, <span class="loc">Lasalimu</span>, <span class="loc">Kamaru</span>, <span class="loc">Pancana</span>, <span class="loc">Busoa</span>, <span class="loc">Taloki</span>, <span class="loc">Kulisusu</span> and <span class="loc">Kioko</span>.
