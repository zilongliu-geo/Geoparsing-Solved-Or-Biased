<p><span class="loc">Hanover</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Plymouth County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,879 at the 2010 census. The area of <span class="loc">Hanover</span> was first settled by English settlers in 1649 when William Barstow, a farmer, built a bridge along the <span class="loc">North River</span> at what is now Washington Street. The land was the westernmost portion of the town of <span class="loc">Scituate</span>, and it would officially separate and be incorporated as a town June 14, 1727. The name "Hanover" is probably a tribute to King George I, the first Hanoverian King of Great Britain. (While George I died on June 11, 1727, the reports would not have reached the colonies until after the town's incorporation.) Hanover's early industry revolved around farming, small mills and a shipbuilding area along the <span class="loc">North River</span>. Later industries would include tack factories and shoe factories along the smaller waterways in the town. The town was the site of the invention of the first tack-making machine, and making tacks and fireworks were among the industries of the later 19th century for <span class="loc">Hanover</span>. Today, <span class="loc">Hanover</span> is mostly residential. The Hanover Mall and other shops are located near the intersection of Routes 3 and 53. In 2008 Hanover American Legion Post 149 baseball team won the state title. In the Summer of 2012 - <span class="loc">Hanover</span> became home to the New England Football League (NEFL)'s newest expansion, Semi-Professional Football Team - The South Shore Chiefs. Home games are played at Hanover High School.</p>
