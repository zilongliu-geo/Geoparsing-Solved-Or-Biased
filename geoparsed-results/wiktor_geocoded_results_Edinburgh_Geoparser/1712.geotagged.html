<p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is a town in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Sussex County</span>, <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. According to the 2010 census, the population of the town is 6,422, an increase of 38.3% over the previous decade. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Lewes</span>, sited on the <span class="loc">Delaware Bay</span>, was designated as the first county seat. It was the first colony in <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, founded by the Dutch in 1631, and it remained the only significant European settlement in the region for some time. When English colonists <span class="loc">William Penn</span> organized the three southern counties of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, which are now <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, <span class="loc">Lewes</span> was the natural choice for the location of the <span class="loc">Sussex County</span>'s Seat of Justice. <span class="loc">Sussex County</span> was not well defined until after 1760, following resolution of a dispute between <span class="loc">William Penn</span>'s family and Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore after intervention from the Crown. This dispute over borders had delayed discussion over the location of a county seat. Earlier Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore had argued that the county ended with <span class="loc">Lewes</span>, while Penn's sons stated it continued into <span class="loc">Fenwick Island</span>, which it now does. The Masonâ€“Dixon line was surveyed as part the agreement between the <span class="loc">Penns</span> and Lord Baltimore, and it has since defined the western and southern border of the county. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>, located more centrally in the county, was later designated as its seat for court.</p>
