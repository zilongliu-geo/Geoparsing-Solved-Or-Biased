  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Santos</span> (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈsɐ̃tus], Saints) is a municipality in the São Paulo state of <span class="loc">Brazil</span>, founded in <span class="date">1546</span> by the Portuguese nobleman <span class="per">Brás Cubas</span>. It is partially located on the island of São Vicente, which harbors both the <span class="loc">city of Santos</span> and the <span class="loc">city of São Vicente</span>, and partially on the mainland. It is the main city in the metropolitan region of Baixada Santista. The population is 433,966 (<span class="date">2015</span> est.) in an area of 280.67 km². The city is also home to the Coffee Museum, where coffee prices were once negotiated. There is also a football memorial, dedicated to the city's greatest players, which includes Pelé, who played for <span class="per">Santos Futebol</span> Clube. Its beachfront garden, 5,335 m (5,834 yd) in length, figures in the Guinness <span class="org">Book of Records</span> as the largest beachfront garden in the world. The exportation of coffee from the Port of <span class="per">Santos</span> gave rise to the city and mostly accounted for the wealth of the city at the turn of the 20th century. Exportation and importation through its port have made it the modern city one finds <span class="date">today</span> and turned it into the indispensable outlet for the production of the powerhouse that is São Paulo State. Adorning the landscape of the port city are the canals that are over <span class="date">a hundred years</span> old. In <span class="date">1899</span>, <span class="per">Santos</span> was the point of entry for the bubonic plague into <span class="loc">Brazil</span>. In <span class="date">1924</span>, it became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="per">Santos</span>.</p><br><br>
