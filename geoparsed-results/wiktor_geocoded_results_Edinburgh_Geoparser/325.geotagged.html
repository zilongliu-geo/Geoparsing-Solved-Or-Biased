In the great book Bale is recorded by the name ‘’Bathele’’ and it is said to be in the ownership of the King. The main tenant was Harold holding his land from Count Alan. The Bale Oak was a large oak tree which once stood in the village. The tree measured 36 feet in circumference, was over 500 years old and, reportedly, featured branches over 70 feet long. One man who was aboard the RMS Titanic when it hit the iceberg and sank was born in the village. Edward Rowe was born in Bale in 1882.
