<p><span class="loc">El Alto</span> (Spanish for The Heights) is the second-largest city in <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>, located adjacent to <span class="loc">La Paz</span> in Pedro Domingo <span class="loc">Murillo Province</span> on the Altiplano highlands. <span class="loc">El Alto</span> is today one of <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>'s fastest-growing urban centers, with a population of 974,754 in 2011. <span class="loc">El Alto</span> is the highest major metropolis in the world, with an average elevation of 4,150 m (13,615 ft). The El Alto-La <span class="loc">Paz metropolitan</span> area, formed by the cities of <span class="loc">El Alto</span>, <span class="loc">La Paz</span>, and <span class="loc">Viacha</span>, constitutes the most populous urban area of <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>, with a population of 2.3 million inhabitants (greater than the metropolitan area of the country's largest city of <span class="loc">Santa Cruz de la Sierra</span>). The dry and inclement plain above <span class="loc">La Paz</span> was uninhabited until 1903, when the newly built railways from <span class="loc">Lake Titicaca</span> and <span class="loc">Arica</span> reached the rim of the canyon, where the <span class="loc">La Paz</span> terminus, railyards and depots were built along with a settlement of railway workers (a spur line down into the canyon opened in 1905). In 1925 the airfield was built as base for the new air force, which attracted additional settlement. In 1939 <span class="loc">El Alto</span>'s first elementary school opened. <span class="loc">El Alto</span> started to grow tremendously in the 1950s, when the settlement was connected to <span class="loc">La Paz</span>' water supply (before that all water had to be transported from <span class="loc">La Paz</span> in tanker vehicles) and building land in the canyon became more and more short and expensive. In an administrative reform on March 6, 1985 the district of <span class="loc">El Alto</span> and surroundings was politically separated from the City of <span class="loc">La Paz</span> (this date is officially referred to and celebrated as the city's "founding day"). In 1987 <span class="loc">El Alto</span> was formally incorporated as a city. In 1994, the city became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="loc">El Alto</span>.</p>
