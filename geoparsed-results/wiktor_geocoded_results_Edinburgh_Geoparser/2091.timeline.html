  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 741,096. It is the most populous county in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> and is more than twice as large as the second most populous, <span class="per">Fayette</span>. The county was formed in <span class="date">1780</span> and named for future President <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span>, who was Governor of Virginia at the time. In <span class="date">2003</span>, its government merged with that of its largest city and county seat, <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, forming a new entity, the Louisville/<span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> Metro Government (official long form) or Louisville Metro (official short form). The new government generally avoids any self-reference including the name "<span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>" and has even renamed the <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> Courthouse as "Metro Hall". <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is the anchor of the <span class="loc">Louisville-Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">KY-IN Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was organized in <span class="date">1780</span> and one of the first three counties formed out of the original <span class="loc">Kentucky County</span>, which was still part of Virginia at the time (the other two being <span class="per">Fayette</span> and <span class="per">Lincoln</span>). The county is named for <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span>, who was governor of Virginia at the time.</p><br><br>
