<p><span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a small town of around 2,100 people serving the farming community of <span class="loc">North Canterbury</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Waimakariri District</span> and is a linear town, approximately 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) long. Originally, it was served by the Oxford Branch railway, and had two stations, <span class="loc">East Oxford</span> and <span class="loc">West Oxford</span>. The line closed in 1959 and was dismantled. Some railway signs and the remnants of railway platforms can still be seen along Oxford Road on the way to <span class="loc">Rangiora</span>. It was originally a logging town: trees were felled from forests in the area, and hauled by beast to <span class="loc">Christchurch</span>. A mural depicting life from that era is painted on the side wall of the butchers shop. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> has won awards for the most beautiful village and the most beautiful toilet. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is located at the inland edge of the <span class="loc">Canterbury Plains</span>, approximately 50 km northwest of <span class="loc">Christchurch</span>. The township is about 30 km from <span class="loc">Rangiora</span> to the East, and the townships of <span class="loc">Sheffield</span> and <span class="loc">Darfield</span> to the west. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> can be reached from <span class="loc">Christchurch</span> by means of Tram Road, which has the longest straight section of road in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>.</p>
