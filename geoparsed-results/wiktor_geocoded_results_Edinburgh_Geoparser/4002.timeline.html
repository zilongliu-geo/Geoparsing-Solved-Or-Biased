  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Oviedo</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Seminole County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the population was 33,342, reflecting an increase of 7,026 (26.7%) from the 26,316 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. In the late 1870s, individuals living a couple miles south of <span class="loc">Lake Jesup</span> needed an easily accessible post office in the <span class="loc">Florida</span> back country. <span class="per">Andrew Aulin</span>, an early settler and shop-owner, decided to file paperwork for a post office; in his first site location report he needed a unique name, one that no other post office in <span class="loc">Florida</span> had. <span class="per">Aulin</span> liked having a Spanish name, "to go with the Spanish name of the state," and decided to name his post office location <span class="loc">Oviedo</span> after the <span class="loc">city of Oviedo</span> in northern <span class="loc">Spain</span> (the capital city of the Principality of <span class="loc">Asturias</span>) and the <span class="org">University of Oviedo</span>. Some say he visited the <span class="org">University</span>, others say he just liked the sound, most agree he likely pronounced it "Oh-vee-Ay-Doh" rather than the Americanized way of "Oh-VEE-doh."</p><br><br>
