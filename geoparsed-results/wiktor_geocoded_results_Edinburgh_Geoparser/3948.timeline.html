  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The town of <span class="loc">Kaza</span>, <span class="loc">Kaze</span> or <span class="loc">Kaja</span> is the subdivisional headquarters of the remote <span class="loc">Spiti Valley</span> in the <span class="loc">Lahaul</span> and <span class="loc">Spiti district</span> of the state of <span class="loc">Himachal Pradesh</span> in the Western <span class="loc">Himalayas</span> of <span class="loc">India</span>. <span class="loc">Spiti</span>, which is a part of the <span class="loc">Lahaul</span> and <span class="loc">Spiti</span> <span class="loc">district of Himachal</span>, is a high altitude or cold desert having close similarities to the neighbouring <span class="loc">Tibet</span> and <span class="loc">Ladakh</span> regions in terms of terrain, climate and the Buddhist culture. <span class="loc">Kaza</span>, situated along the <span class="loc">Spiti River</span> river at an elevation of 3,650 metres (11,980 ft) above mean sea level, is the largest township and commercial center of the valley . The town is divided into the old, as <span class="loc">Kaza</span> <span class="loc">Khas</span> and new as <span class="loc">Kaza</span> Soma sections. The new town contains the administrative buildings. The <span class="loc">Tangyud</span> (Tang-rGyud) <span class="loc">Gompa</span> dates to the early 14th century and is built like a fortified castle with massive slanted mud walls and battlements with vertical red ochre and white vertical stripes. It is on the edge of a deep canyon and overlooking the town of <span class="loc">Kaza</span>, 4 km from the town. Approaching it from the south one sees Kyu-ling (Skyid-gling), the stately palace of the <span class="loc">Nono</span> (king) on the other side of the river.</p><br><br>
