  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Johnson</span> and <span class="loc">Miami</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, and part of the <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> Metropolitan Area. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 5,437. In <span class="date">1856</span>, <span class="per">James B. Hovey</span> named the community after a town near Mobile, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. “Being somewhat enthusiastic in my estimation of its future, it having all advantages of timber and water, and on a line that must be traveled between <span class="per">Olathe</span> and <span class="per">Paola</span>, I concluded to myself, as there was no one else to conclude with, that this was a good place for a town.” – <span class="per">J.B. Hovey</span>, <span class="date">1857</span>  The town was incorporated in <span class="date">1857</span>, and <span class="per">Hovey</span> then served as the town’s first postmaster. Also <span class="date">that year</span>, <span class="per">Hovey</span> built the first building in town, the <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> Hotel. The two-story structure, also known as the “Old Traveler’s Rest” was located on the highest elevation in town. In <span class="date">January 1859</span> <span class="per">Celia Ann Dayton</span>, a doctor in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, became the first woman doctor in the state of <span class="loc">Kansas</span> by moving to <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span>. She arrived with her adopted son <span class="per">Hiram Eugene</span>, also a doctor, and her husband <span class="per">Amos</span> arrived <span class="date">a few months later</span>. <span class="per">Hiram</span> was killed in <span class="date">January 1862</span> during the American Civil War after being discovered as a spy for the <span class="org">Union</span>. Also in <span class="date">1862</span>, <span class="per">Celia</span> divorced her husband, which was very uncommon for the time period. <span class="per">Celia</span> frequently aided black refugees, and is reported to have been part of the underground railroad. In the <span class="date">fall of 1862</span>, <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> avoided Quantrill's Raiders entering the town when a farmer talked to them on their way. He calmly convinced them there were soldiers in town, when there were not. This deterred them from continuing. However, <span class="date">a year later</span> in <span class="date">1863</span>, the Quantrill Raiders did march on <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span>, looting businesses in town and stealing from local farmers. At least one citizen was killed.</p><br><br>
