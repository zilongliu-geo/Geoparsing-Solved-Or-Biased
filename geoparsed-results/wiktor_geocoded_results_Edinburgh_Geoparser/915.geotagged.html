<p>Hampton is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Carter County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located a few miles southeast of Elizabethton and northeast of <span class="loc">Roan Mountain</span>, <span class="loc">Hampton</span> is surrounded on all sides by the <span class="loc">Unaka Mountains</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Johnson City</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the "Tri-Cities" region. Hampton was established in the late 1860s by Elijah Simerly, a state legislator and president of the <span class="loc">East Tennessee</span> and Western <span class="loc">North Carolina Railroad</span>. He named the community for his wife, Mary Hampton. <span class="loc">Simerly</span> built an elaborate, Italianate-style house which still stands at the corner of Main Street and 1st Avenue, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house is now known as the "Butler Mansion" after a later owner, Ralph Butler. The Laurel Fork Railway served a mill in Hampton. Hampton lies in a broad valley concentrated around the <span class="loc">Doe River</span> and its junction with two of its tributaries, namely the <span class="loc">Little Doe River</span>, which enters the area from the southwest, and Laurel Fork, which enters the area from the east. This valley is surrounded by <span class="loc">Jenkins Mountain</span> on the west, the <span class="loc">Iron Mountains</span> on the north, <span class="loc">Pond Mountain</span> to the east, and <span class="loc">Cedar Mountain</span> to the south. Just southeast of Hampton, the <span class="loc">Doe River</span> emerges from the <span class="loc">Doe River Gorge</span>, a narrow valley between <span class="loc">Cedar Mountain</span> and <span class="loc">Fork Mountain</span>.</p>
