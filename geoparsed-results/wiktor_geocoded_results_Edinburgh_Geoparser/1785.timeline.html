  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county along the <span class="loc">Gulf of Mexico</span> in the <span class="loc">Florida</span> panhandle of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Florida</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 11,549, making it the third-least populous county in <span class="loc">Florida</span>. The county seat is <span class="loc">Apalachicola</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>. The county includes several large preserved areas and rivers and has been home to commercial timber and fishing industry. More recently it has become popular for tourism and retirement. It includes several rivers, state parks, and islands. The entire coast line of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> was inhabited by Native Americans for <span class="date">about 12,000 years</span>. Life along the coast was good since seafood was abundant. They traded with the Native Americans in <span class="loc">Tallahassee</span> for clay and other items not available on the coast. One style of pottery first found in <span class="loc">Carrabelle</span> is named Carrabelle Punctuated. A clay pot was made and, while still damp, the potter would take a small stick of a similar object and press the end of the stick into the clay numerous times until the entire pot was covered with small indentations. It was then placed into a shallow pit, covered with small tree branches, and fired. The result was a decorated water resistant pot.</p><br><br>
