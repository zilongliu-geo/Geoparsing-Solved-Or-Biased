  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Darlington</span> is a market town in <span class="loc">County Durham</span>, in the North East of <span class="loc">England</span> and is also part of the Tees Valley region. It is the major settlement in the unitary authority and <span class="loc">borough of Darlington</span>, with a resident population of 106,000 in <span class="date">2011</span>. The town lies on the small <span class="loc">River Skerne</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">River Tees</span>, not far from the main river. The town owes much of its development to the influence of local Quaker families during the Victorian era, and it is famous as the terminus of the world's first passenger railway. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> railway station is a stop on the East Coast Main Line. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is currently represented at the <span class="loc">UK</span> Parliament by Jenny Chapman MP. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> started life as an Anglo-Saxon settlement. The name <span class="loc">Darlington</span> derives from the Anglo-Saxon Dearthington, which seemingly meant 'the settlement of Deornoth's people' but by Norman times the name had changed to Derlinton. During the 17th and 18th <span class="date">centuries</span> the town was generally known by the name of Darnton. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> has a historic market area in the town centre. Built in <span class="date">1183</span>, the Grade I listed St Cuthbert's Church is one of the most important early English churches in the north of <span class="loc">England</span>. However the oldest church in the town happens to be that of St Andrew's Church built around <span class="date">1125</span> and presides in the <span class="loc">Haughton</span> area of <span class="loc">Darlington</span>.</p><br><br>
