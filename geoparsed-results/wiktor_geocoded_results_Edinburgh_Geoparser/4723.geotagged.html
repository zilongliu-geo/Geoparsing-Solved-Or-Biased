<p><span class="loc">Ziarat</span> (Urdu: زیارت‎) is the capital of <span class="loc">Ziarat District</span>, <span class="loc">Balochistan Province</span>, <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>. It is a holiday resort, and was the summer residence of the chief commissioner of Balochistan and a sanatorium for European troops. It is 8,850 feet above sea level and is located about 125 km from <span class="loc">Quetta</span>. The surrounding hills are wooded and picturesque. The <span class="loc">Khilafat</span> Hills include Ziarat's highest peak, with an altitude of 11,400 feet (3,475 m). Most tourists visit in the summer. Near Ziarat is a juniper forest, which features the species Juniperus macropoda. <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>’s largest juniper forest is located in this reserve. The ecosystem is of inestimable value for biodiversity conservation. It is also of great ecological significance, providing local, regional, and global benefits. The biosphere reserve is home to the largest area of juniper forest (Juniperus excelsa) in <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>, covering about 110,000 hectares. It is believed that the forest is the second largest of its kind in the world. The juniper species found there are of global significance because of their advanced age and slow growth rate. In fact, the junipers of <span class="loc">Ziarat</span> are among the oldest living trees in the world. Although no dendrological study has yet been conducted, according to one estimate, the age of a mature tree in <span class="loc">Ziarat</span> can exceed 1,500 years. Local people refer to the trees as "living fossils". Their remarkable longevity allows research on past weather conditions in the region, making the species of particular significance for studies on climate change and ecology.</p>
