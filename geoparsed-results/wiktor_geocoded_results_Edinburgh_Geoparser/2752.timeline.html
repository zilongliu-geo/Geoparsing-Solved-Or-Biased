  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ireland</span> (/ˈaɪərlənd/; Irish: Éire [ˈeːɾʲə]; Ulster-Scots: Airlann [ˈɑːrlən]) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from <span class="loc">Great Britain</span> to its east by the <span class="loc">North Channel</span>, the <span class="loc">Irish Sea</span>, and St George's Channel. <span class="loc">Ireland</span> is the second-largest island of the <span class="loc">British Isles</span>, the third-largest in <span class="loc">Europe</span>, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. Politically, <span class="loc">Ireland</span> is divided between the <span class="loc">Republic of Ireland</span> (officially named <span class="loc">Ireland</span>), which covers five-sixths of the island, and <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>, which is part of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, in the northeast of the island. In <span class="date">2011</span> the population of <span class="loc">Ireland</span> was about 6.4 million, ranking it the second-most populous island in <span class="loc">Europe</span> after <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>. Just under 4.6 million live in the <span class="loc">Republic of Ireland</span> and just over 1.8 million live in <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>. The island's geography comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. The island has lush vegetation, a product of its mild but changeable climate which avoids extremes in temperature. Thick woodlands covered the island until the Middle Ages. As of <span class="date">2013</span>, the amount of land that is wooded in <span class="loc">Ireland</span> is about 11% of the total, compared with a European average of 35%. There are 26 extant mammal species native to <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. The Irish climate is very moderated and classified as oceanic. As a result, winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area. However, summers are cooler than those in Continental <span class="loc">Europe</span>. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.</p><br><br>
