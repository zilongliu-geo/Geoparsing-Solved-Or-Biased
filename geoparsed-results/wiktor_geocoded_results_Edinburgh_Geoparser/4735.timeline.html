  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Exeter</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Fillmore County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 591 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In <span class="date">1870</span>, <span class="per">Dr. Horace Greeley Smith</span> and his wife filed a homestead claim at the site of present-day <span class="loc">Exeter</span>. In an earlier scouting trip, Smith had determined that the site would lie near the line of the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and <span class="loc">Missouri River Railroad</span> as it extended itself westward. In the <span class="date">fall of 1871</span>, the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and <span class="loc">Missouri</span> was completed through <span class="loc">Fillmore County</span>. To promote settlement along its line, the railroad established towns at intervals. Towns were named alphabetically as the railroad ran westward from Lincoln, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. In eastern <span class="loc">Fillmore County</span>, a town was established on land donated by Smith and by <span class="per">James Dolan</span>. One of the families that had settled in the area had come from <span class="loc">Exeter</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, and it was proposed that the town be given that name. It was adopted, as being in keeping with the alphabetical sequence: <span class="loc">Crete</span>, <span class="loc">Dorchester</span>, <span class="loc">Exeter</span>, <span class="loc">Fairmont</span>, <span class="loc">Grafton</span>, <span class="loc">Harvard</span>, <span class="loc">Inland</span>, <span class="loc">Juniata</span>, <span class="loc">Kenesaw</span>, and <span class="loc">Lowell</span>. The railroad advertised the availability of free government land in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, bringing settlers from the eastern <span class="loc">United States</span>, and Czech, German, English, Irish, and Scandinavian immigrants. The town's growth was initially slow, but hastened in the late 1870s. In <span class="date">1878</span>, two large grain elevators were built and a number of businesses opened; the town's first newspaper, the Enterprise, was established in <span class="date">that year</span>. In <span class="date">1879</span>, the town was incorporated; by that time, it had sixteen businesses.</p><br><br>
