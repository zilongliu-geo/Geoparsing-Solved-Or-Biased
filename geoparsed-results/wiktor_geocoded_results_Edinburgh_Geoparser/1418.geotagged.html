<p><span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and the location of Frontier Community College. The population was 5,421 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is most famous for being the hometown of the Shelton Brothers Gang, notorious bootleggers who fought it out with the <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> based Birger Gang to control criminal activities in Southern <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. During the first half of the 20th century gang leaders Carl, Earl and Bernie Shelton made <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> a household name. Based on testimony of Charlie Birger himself, the Shelton Brothers were convicted for a 1925 unsolved mail carrier robbery of $15,000 and were sentenced to 25 years. They were released a few years later. Birger dominated bootlegging in Southern <span class="loc">Illinois</span> until he himself was hanged in <span class="loc">Benton</span>. for the murder of West City Mayor Joe Adams in 1928. After serving their time, the Shelton brothers built a new criminal empire. Based out of East St Louis, one of the most prosperous cities of its day, they controlled all vice from <span class="loc">Peoria</span> and southward. They met their demise at the hands of the Chicago mob and an insider Charles "Blackie" <span class="loc">Harris</span>. A land dispute led to <span class="loc">Blackie</span> joining forces with the Mob to kill off members of the Shelton gang. His most notable victim was Carl Shelton, the leader. He was ambushed several miles south east of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, shot from his Jeep. Bernie was killed at his Peoria roadhouse. Earl moved to <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span> and became a successful land speculator.</p>
