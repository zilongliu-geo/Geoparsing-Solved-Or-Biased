<p><span class="loc">Falmouth</span> is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Pendleton County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,169 according to the 2010 census. It lies at the confluence of the South and Main forks of the <span class="loc">Licking River</span> and is home to Kincaid Regional Theatre. <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> is located at 38°40′26″N 84°20′3″W (38.673860, -84.334213). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.3 square miles (3.4 km2), all land. Possibly settled as early as 1780, <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> was laid out by John Waller (1758-1823) and formally established by the state assembly in 1793. Waller named the new settlement after his native <span class="loc">Falmouth</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. It was incorporated as a city in 1856. The town is perhaps best remembered for natural disasters that have devastated the town over the last half of the 20th Century. In 1964, the <span class="loc">Licking River</span> reached 47 feet (19 feet above flood stage) and left much of the town under water. On April 23, 1968 a tornado leveled many homes in the town. On March 2, 1997, a major flood on the <span class="loc">Licking River</span> again left the town crippled. The river reached 52 feet (24 feet above flood stage) and left 80% of the town under several feet of water. Many homes and business were damaged and five residents were killed.</p>
