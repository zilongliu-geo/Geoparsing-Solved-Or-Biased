<p><span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> is a small settlement in the <span class="loc">Masvingo Province</span> of <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>. It is located about 58 km north of <span class="loc">Masvingo</span> on the Masvingo-Gweru railway line. The settlement started in 1911 as a railway station. It is sometimes administered under the <span class="loc">Gutu</span> - <span class="loc">Chartsworth District</span> Council. The village was first called <span class="loc">Makori</span>, then Makowries and in 1919 renamed <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span>. The naming was mainly done by the developers who were mostly white, which is why there is no obvious trace of the original name meanings. They did not speak the local languages and they tried to modify the local place names so they could spell them. The local name, <span class="loc">Makaure</span>, is still locally used and is the name of the township and a local primary school. It comes from being the name of the local hill, which sits in the middle of the township to the south, and the more affluent low density residential to the north. The main industry around is farming. All other activities at <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> are there mainly to support farming. The soil in the area is not good enough for growing crops but is more suitable for cattle ranching. Well-paid employees get less than US$40 per month.</p>
