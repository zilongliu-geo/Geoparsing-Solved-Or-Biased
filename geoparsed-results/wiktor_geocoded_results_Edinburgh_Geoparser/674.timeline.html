  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Castro</span> is a city and commune in the Chilean island of Chiloé Island. <span class="per">Castro</span> is the capital of the <span class="loc">Chiloé Province</span> in the <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Lagos Region</span>. The city is located on <span class="per">Estero de Castro</span> on the eastern coast of central Chiloé Island. <span class="per">Castro</span> is <span class="loc">Chile</span>'s third oldest city in continued existence. <span class="per">Rodrigo de Quiroga</span> as the temporary governor of <span class="loc">Chile</span> in <span class="date">1567</span> launched a campaign led by his son in-law Captain <span class="per">Martín Ruiz de Gamboa</span> to conquer Chiloé Island, establishing the <span class="loc">city of Castro</span> there, and pacifying its inhabitants, the Cuncos. From its founding on <span class="date">12 February 1576</span> until <span class="date">1767</span> <span class="per">Castro</span> was the administrative centre of Chiloé Island. In <span class="date">1594</span> <span class="per">Castro</span> had 8.000 inhabitants most of whom were farmers. Up to the mid of the 17th century the town was looted by Dutch pirates several times. In <span class="date">1767</span>, during the time of the Bourbon Reforms that sought to modernize the Spanish Empire, Chiloé was separated from the <span class="per">General Captaincy of Chile</span> to which it had previously belonged and made a direct subject of the Viceroyalty of <span class="loc">Peru</span>. To ease the communications with <span class="loc">Lima</span> the capital of the archipelago was moved from <span class="loc">Castro</span> to <span class="loc">Ancud</span> in the same year. Even after the incorporation of Chiloé of into the Republic of <span class="loc">Chile</span> <span class="loc">Ancud</span> remained the capital of the archipelago. <span class="per">Castro</span> was destroyed by an earthquake in <span class="date">1837</span> and had only 1.243 inhabitants in <span class="date">1907</span>. After the inauguration of the railway line to <span class="loc">Ancud</span> in <span class="date">1912</span> the town developed better. Many buildings, e.g. railway station, town hall and many of the wooden palafitos houses, were destroyed or damaged by the earthquake and the tsunami of <span class="date">1960</span>. In <span class="date">1960</span>, <span class="per">Castro</span> had 7.000 inhabitants. Only in <span class="date">1982</span> did <span class="per">Castro</span> regain its role as capital in Chiloé Archipelago.</p><br><br>
