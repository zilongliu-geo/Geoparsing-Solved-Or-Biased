<p><span class="loc">Savannah</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hardin County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Hardin County</span> and had a population of 6,917 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Savannah</span> hosted the NAIA college football national championship game from 1996-2007, and is home to several places of historical significance, including the Cherry Family Mansion and apparently the resting place of the "22nd official(ly) Certified Mainstreet Community" in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The city's original name was Rudd's Ferry, named for James Rudd, an early settler who established a ferry at the site in the early 1820s. Rudd's Ferry was later purchased by a wealthy landowner, David Robinson. The town was renamed "<span class="loc">Savannah</span>" after <span class="loc">Savannah</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, the hometown of Rudd's wife, Elizabeth. <span class="loc">Hardin County</span> was the site of the 1862 Battle of <span class="loc">Shiloh</span> (also known as the "Battle of <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> Landing") during the Civil War. This battleground site is just south of the town of <span class="loc">Savannah</span>. Union General Ulysses S. Grant commandeered the Cherry Mansion just off the town square for use as a headquarters during the battle.</p>
