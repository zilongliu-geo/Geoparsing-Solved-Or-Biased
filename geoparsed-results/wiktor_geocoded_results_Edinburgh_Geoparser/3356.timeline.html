  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ide</span> /ˈiːd/ is a village in <span class="loc">Devon</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> situated less than a mile to the southwest of <span class="loc">Exeter</span>. The village church (rebuilt in <span class="date">1834</span>) is dedicated to the German Saint Ida of <span class="loc">Herzfeld</span>. The village is home to two pubs: the Poacher's <span class="per">Arms</span> and <span class="per">Huntsman</span> Inn. A long ford crosses a lane on the edge of the village. Above <span class="loc">Ide</span> on a hilltop at SX8888 is the site of a Roman fortlet or signal station. The majority of the village is separated from suburban <span class="loc">Exeter</span> by the A30 dual carriageway. Whilst it was controversial at the time of construction, the road has effectively enabled <span class="loc">Ide</span> to maintain an independent identity. However, the parish boundaries extend a short distance over the A30 and several notable buildings within the parish, including <span class="loc">Ide House</span> and the <span class="loc">Twisted Oak</span> pub, are located on the <span class="loc">Exeter</span> side. <span class="loc">Ide</span> Halt railway station on the <span class="per">G.W.R. Teign</span> Valley Line opened in <span class="date">1903</span> and closed to passengers on <span class="date">9 June 1958</span>. The site of the station was re-developed as St Ida's Close and no trace <span class="date">now</span> remains.
