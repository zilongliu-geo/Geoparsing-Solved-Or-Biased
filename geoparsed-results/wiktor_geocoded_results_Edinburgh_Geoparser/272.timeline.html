Europeans entered the region for business, founding fur trading posts during the 1820s; these trading posts operated until the mid-1830s. The first "settlers" of this region were the Arikara Indians, but they would later be joined by others. The first group of Euro-American settlers to reach the area that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Brown County</span> was a party of four people, three horses, two mules, fifteen cattle, and two wagons. This group of settlers was later joined by another group the following spring, and eventually more settlers migrated toward this general area, currently known as <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>. This town was established on <span class="date">June 15, 1879</span>. The town was settled in <span class="date">1880</span>, and incorporated in <span class="date">1882</span>.</p><br><br>
