  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Weatherizing homes to create thousands of jobs - if stimulus works. "We want them to go through <span class="loc">Ohio</span> as deeply and as widely as possible," said <span class="per">Phil Cole</span> of the <span class="org">Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies</span>. The state expects to receive $267 million to insulate, seal and otherwise improve home energy efficiency for thousands of low-income Ohioans over <span class="date">the next three years</span>. <span class="per">Cole</span> said the government spent less than that on weatherization programs for all 50 states <span class="date">last year</span>. "What we're being asked to do has never been done before," said <span class="per">Cole</span>, who speaks for the anti-poverty organizations that will do most of the work. "There's no pattern to follow." But there is an ideal path, which supporters describe in one-thing-leads-to-another terms: Agencies hire weatherization workers or contract with small businesses, creating jobs. They also buy trucks, insulation supplies, furnaces and water heaters, boosting the local economy. Residents' utility costs drop by an average of 30 percent, saving money and energy. Heating subsidies for the poor cost taxpayers less, and families spend the extra cash. "This thing has so many opportunities for mischief and mismanagement," said <span class="per">Leslie Paige</span>, spokeswoman for <span class="org">Citizens Against Government Waste</span>, a taxpayer watchdog organization based in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span> "It's very vulnerable to fraud." She said the pot is too large and the ramp-up time too short for small community-action agencies to manage. "You're taking a sleepy little program and you're going to ram $5 billion at it, and on top of that you're going to say it has to be spent as quickly as possible," <span class="per">Paige</span> said. "It's a recipe for disaster." Some also question whether the program really can put more than 87,000 Americans to work, as President <span class="per">Barack Obama</span> asserts. No one expects it to be easy, said <span class="per">Bill Graves</span> of the <span class="org">Ohio Department of Development</span>. <span class="loc">Ohio</span> received about $30 million in federal money for weatherization in <span class="date">2008</span>, so the stimulus money represents an increase of almost 800 percent. "What are my worries? I wouldn't say worries; I'd say optimistic concerns," he said. "This is a lot of money. It's a monumental task." <span class="per">Pat Williams</span> says she's ready. As manager of the weatherization program at <span class="org">Impact Community Action Agency</span> in <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, she could soon oversee a threefold increase in production. On a sunny, warm-for-March day <span class="date">last week</span>, <span class="per">Williams</span> had three crews of three working on drafty city homes. "I'll have three more crews in <span class="date">the next few weeks</span>," she said. "When the stimulus hits, I plan to go to 16 to 20. This is going to make a tremendous difference in people's lives." <span class="per">Williams</span> also is excited about the agency's ability to offer jobs with health insurance. She wants to hire as many people as possible, but <span class="org">Impact</span> Executive Director <span class="per">Bo Chilton</span> said the community-action agency doesn't want to create more positions than it can maintain. "We'd hate to take on 30 new staff and then lay them off in <span class="date">two years</span>," he said. "So we'll probably be using contractors, too." Whether to create jobs or hire businesses can be a thorny issue for community-action agencies, most of whose missions include employment training. "They're both legitimate business models," said <span class="per">Dave Rinebolt</span>, executive director of <span class="org">Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy</span>, an umbrella group for energy-assistance groups. "We anticipate plenty of jobs either way." <span class="per">Sean Babylon</span> is thrilled to have one. The 32-year-old recently moved back to <span class="loc">Columbus</span> from <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> and badly wanted to return to <span class="org">Impact</span>, where he had worked in weatherization before. He was surprised to learn that the agency could add employees. "It's a big weight off my shoulders," <span class="per">Babylon</span> said. "I wake up and think, 'Wow. I have a job <span class="date">now</span>.'" Home weatherization as a public program has its roots in <span class="loc">New England</span> during the energy crisis of <span class="date">the 1970s</span>, said <span class="per">Rinebolt</span>, who first worked in <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. He watched support wither during <span class="date">the next two decades</span> and eventually lost his job to budget cuts. The coming boom is an about-face like nothing he has ever seen. About 7,000 low-income Ohio homes usually are weatherized each year at a maximum per-unit cost of about $3,900. With the stimulus money, the program could reach 26,000 homes <span class="date">a year</span> at up to $6,500 each.</p><br><br>
