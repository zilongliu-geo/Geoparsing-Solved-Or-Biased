  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Trinidad</span> is a Home Rule Municipality that is the county seat and the most populous <span class="loc">city of Las</span> <span class="loc">Animas County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 9,096 as of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up slightly from 9,078 in <span class="date">2000</span>. The estimate as of <span class="date">2012</span> was 8,771. <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> lies 21 miles (33 kilometers) <span class="loc">north of Raton</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and 195 miles (305 km) south of <span class="loc">Denver</span>. <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> was first explored by Spanish and Mexican traders, who liked its proximity to the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail. It was founded after coal was discovered in the region, in <span class="date">1862</span>; this led to an influx of immigrants, eager to capitalize on this important natural resource. By the late 1860s, the town had about 1,200 residents.  <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> was officially incorporated in <span class="date">1876</span>, just <span class="date">a few months</span> before <span class="loc">Colorado</span> became a state.  An important milestone for the town occurred in <span class="date">1878</span>, when the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Railway reached <span class="loc">Trinidad</span>, making it easier for goods to be shipped from distant locations.  In the 1880s, <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> became home to a number of well-known people, including <span class="per">Bat Masterson</span>, who briefly served as the town's marshal in <span class="date">1882</span>.  By <span class="date">1900</span>, the population of <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> had grown to 7,500. It was <span class="date">now</span> home to two English-language newspapers, and one that was published in Spanish.</p><br><br>
