  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Sharon is a town in <span class="loc">Hillsborough County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 352 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is home to the <span class="org">Sharon Arts School of Art and Craft</span>, part of the <span class="org">Sharon Arts Center</span>. It was first settled in <span class="date">1738</span> as part of Peterborough Slip, an area which until <span class="date">1768</span> included Temple. In <span class="date">1777</span>, it petitioned to become part of <span class="loc">Peterborough</span>, but was denied. It was called Sliptown until <span class="date">1791</span>, when it was incorporated as Sharon. It took its name from Sharon, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, from which many settlers originated. The topography is uneven and, in parts, mountainous. In <span class="date">1823</span>, the population was 400. By <span class="date">1859</span>, when the population was 229, the town had three sawmills. The principal occupation, however, was farming. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 15.6 square miles (40.4 km2), all of it land. Sharon is drained by several branches of the <span class="loc">Contoocook River</span>, which rise near the southeast corner of the town. <span class="loc">Temple Mountain</span> forms the eastern boundary of Sharon for several miles. Holt Peak on <span class="loc">Temple Mountain</span>, at 2,045 feet (623 m) above sea level, is the highest point in Sharon.</p><br><br>
