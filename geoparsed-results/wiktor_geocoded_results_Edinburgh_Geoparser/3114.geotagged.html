<p><span class="loc">Camden</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,850 at the 2010 census. The population of the town more than triples during the summer months, due to tourists and summer residents. <span class="loc">Camden</span> is a famous summer colony in the <span class="loc">Mid-Coast region</span> of <span class="loc">Maine</span>. Similar to Bar Harbor, <span class="loc">Nantucket</span> and <span class="loc">North Haven</span>, <span class="loc">Camden</span> is well known for its summer community of wealthy Northeasterners, mostly from <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>. Penobscot Abenaki Indians called the area Megunticook, meaning "great swells of the sea", a reference to the silhouette of the <span class="loc">Camden</span> Hills (more visibly seen on a bright night). Part of the Waldo Patent, it remained wilderness until after the French and Indian War. It was first settled about 1771â€“1772 by James Richards, who built a home at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Megunticook River</span>. Others soon followed, some making modest attempts to farm the broken and often mountainous terrain. The first home in the area was the Conway House, a Cape Cod style home built in 1770. In 1962, it was purchased and renovated into a history museum.</p>
