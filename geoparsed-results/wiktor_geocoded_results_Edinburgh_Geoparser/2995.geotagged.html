<p><span class="loc">Worcester</span> (/ˈwʊstər/ WUUS-tər) is a city and the county town of <span class="loc">Worcestershire</span> in the <span class="loc">West Midlands</span> of <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Worcester</span> is situated some 17 miles (27 km) southwest of the southern suburbs of <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> and 23 miles (37 km) north of <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> and has an approximate population of 100,000 people. The <span class="loc">River Severn</span> flanks the western side of the city centre, overlooked by the 12th-century <span class="loc">Worcester</span> Cathedral. The site of the final battle of the Civil War, <span class="loc">Worcester</span> was where Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army defeated King Charles II's Cavaliers, cementing the English Interregnum, the eleven-year period during which <span class="loc">England</span> and <span class="loc">Wales</span> became a republic. <span class="loc">Worcester</span> was the home of Royal <span class="loc">Worcester</span> Porcelain and, for much of his life, the composer Sir Edward Elgar. It houses the Lea &amp; Perrins factory where the traditional <span class="loc">Worcestershire</span> Sauce is made and is home to one of the <span class="loc">UK</span>'s fastest-growing universities, the University of Worcester. The trade route past <span class="loc">Worcester</span> which later formed part of the Roman <span class="loc">Ryknild</span> Street dates to Neolithic times. The position commanded a ford over the <span class="loc">River Severn</span> (the river was tidal past <span class="loc">Worcester</span> prior to public works projects in the 1840s) and was fortified by the Britons around 400 BC. It would have been on the northern border of the Dobunni and probably subject to the larger communities of the Malvern hillforts. The Roman settlement at the site passes unmentioned by Ptolemy's Geography, the Antonine Itinerary and the Register of Dignitaries but would have grown up on the road opened between Glevum (<span class="loc">Gloucester</span>) and Viroconium (<span class="loc">Wroxeter</span>) in the AD 40s and 50s. It may have been the "Vertis" mentioned in the 7th-century Ravenna Cosmography. Using charcoal from the <span class="loc">Forest of Dean</span>, the Romans operated pottery kilns and ironworks at the site and may have built a small fort.</p>
