<p><span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Oxford County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,110 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is home to the Oxford Plains Speedway, the annual <span class="loc">Oxford County</span> Fair, and Oxford Casino. The town includes the village of <span class="loc">Welchville</span>. The land was part of Shepardsfield Plantation (also called Bog Brook Plantation), granted on March 8, 1777 by the Massachusetts General Court to Alexander Shepard, Jr. of <span class="loc">Newton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. On March 6, 1792, the plantation was incorporated as <span class="loc">Hebron</span>, with <span class="loc">Oxford</span> its southwesterly portion. First settled in 1794, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was set off and incorporated on February 27, 1829. It annexed land from <span class="loc">Otisfield</span> in 1830, and <span class="loc">Paris</span> in 1838. The town was named after <span class="loc">Oxford</span>, in <span class="loc">England</span>. Farmers grew mostly hay, and the town became noted for cattle. Mills were established at 2 water power sites; these developed in the 19th-century into principal villages within the town, especially after the arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway in the 1850s. <span class="loc">Welchville</span> was located on the <span class="loc">Little Androscoggin River</span>, where the woolen textile mill of the Harper Manufacturing Company was established. At the outlet of <span class="loc">Thompson Lake</span> was <span class="loc">Oxford</span> village, first called Craigie's Mill for the sawmill and gristmill built by Andrew Craigie, a Boston apothecary and land speculator. This was also the site of a grisly murder that, to this day, goes unsolved. Here were erected a barrel stave mill, a shovel handle factory, and the woolen textile mills of the Robinson Manufacturing Company. The railroad brought seasonal tourists to <span class="loc">Thompson Lake</span>, where inns and hotels opened. Today, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a recreational area with fine architecture remaining from its prosperous mill town past. The Congregational Church, built in 1842â€“1843, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
