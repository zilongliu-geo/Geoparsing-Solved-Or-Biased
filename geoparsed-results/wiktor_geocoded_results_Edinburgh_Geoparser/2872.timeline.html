  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Burbank</span> is a town in <span class="loc">western Osage County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 141 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, a 9 percent decrease from 155 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="per">Burbank</span> was founded in <span class="date">1903</span> on the <span class="loc">Osage Indian Reservation</span>. The founder was Anthony "Gabe" <span class="org">Carlton</span>, a mixed-blood <span class="loc">Osage</span> and a Chouteau family descendant, who owned the townsite and named it after the artist <span class="per">Elbridge Ayer Burbank</span> (<span class="date">1858</span>-<span class="date">1949</span>) who spent his life painting the Indians of over 125 tribes. <span class="per">Burbank</span> had about 200 residents and an economy based on farming and ranching until <span class="date">May 1920</span> when <span class="per">E.W. Marland</span> discovered petroleum northeast of the town. <span class="per">Burbank</span> became a boom town, and other towns in the area such as Whizbang sprang up overnight to exploit the rich petroleum resources. The <span class="per">Burbank</span> field was mostly located in <span class="loc">Osage County</span> but extended into <span class="loc">Kay County</span>. The <span class="per">Burbank</span> field extended over an area about 20 miles (32 km) long and 10 miles (16 km) wide. <span class="per">Burbank</span> quickly grew into a town of 3,000 people. Several major petroleum companies participated in the exploitation of the <span class="loc">Burbank</span> Field. Leases of oil land were obtained from the Osage Indians, usually by auction under the "Million Dollar Elm" tree in Pawhuska, the county seat and capital of the Osage Indians. <span class="per">Colonel Ellsworth Walters</span> was the auctioner and more than a million dollars was often bid for the mineral rights to 160 acre (65 ha) tracts in the <span class="loc">Burbank</span> Field. Rich and famous oilmen such as <span class="per">Marland, Frank</span> <span class="loc">Phillips, L. E</span>. <span class="per">Phillips</span>, <span class="per">Waite Phillips</span>, and <span class="per">William G. Skelly</span> stood in the shade of the Elm tree and bid in the auctions. Oil production in the <span class="per">Burbank</span> field expanded from 134,408 barrels in <span class="date">1920</span> to a peak production of 26,206,741 barrels in <span class="date">1923</span>. Production dropped by one-half in <span class="date">1926</span> and by <span class="date">1930</span> the boom period was over. <span class="per">Burbank</span>â€™s population dropped to 372 in <span class="date">1930</span>. The value of the 160 million barrels the <span class="per">Burbank</span> field produced during its heyday was almost 286 million dollars.</p><br><br>
