<p>Woodlands (Chinese: 兀兰新镇, <span class="loc">Tamil</span>: ஊட்லண்ட்ஸ்), officially Woodlands Town, is an urban planning area and residential town located in the North Region of <span class="loc">Singapore</span>. It connects <span class="loc">Singapore</span> with <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>'s southernmost city, Johor Bahru, via the Johor-Singapore Causeway. The area consisting of modern-day Woodlands Town first witnessed the opening of the Johor-Singapore Causeway in 1923. Early Woodlands consisted of villages and squatters where residents made their living mostly as small-time shopkeepers and vegetable farmers in the Marsiling area, while rubber plantations and poultry farms dot the landscape in <span class="loc">Jalan</span> <span class="loc">Ulu</span> <span class="loc">Sembawang</span> where modern-day Admiralty is located. The first HDB flats were built from 1972 in the northern part of <span class="loc">Marsiling</span>, and the Woodlands Bus interchange located at Woodlands Centre Road was built in 1980. Development of Woodlands began in 1981. This compromises of the building of HDB flats in the Neighbourhood 1, which was completed in 1985; well after the Marsiling Estate. The Neighbourhood 8 were completed in 1987, together with the Neighbourhood 3 in 1989. Because of the saturation of HDB flats, the numbering system added 'A', 'B' and 'C'. Blocks 6xx in Admiralty begun to be completed in 1996, together with the 7xx in 1997. Expansion into Innova began in 1998 and was completed in 2002, which consists of block 5xx. Expansion into the Woodlands East began in 1999 and completed in 2004.</p>
