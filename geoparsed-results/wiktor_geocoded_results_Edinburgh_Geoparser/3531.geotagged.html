<p>Wilmington (<span class="loc">Lenape</span>: Paxahakink, Pakehakink) is the largest city in the state of <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, built on the site of <span class="loc">Fort Christina</span>, the first Swedish settlement in <span class="loc">North America</span>. It is located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Christina River</span> and Brandywine Creek, near where the Christina flows into the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River. It is the county seat of New <span class="loc">Castle County</span> and one of the major cities in the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> Valley metropolitan area. Wilmington was named by Proprietor Thomas Penn after his friend Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington, who was prime minister in the reign of George II of <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>. According to the 2010 census, the population of the city is 70,851, a decrease of 2.4% from 2000. Wilmington is built on the site of <span class="loc">Fort Christina</span>, the first Swedish settlement in <span class="loc">North America</span>. The area now known as Wilmington was settled by the <span class="loc">Lenape</span> (or <span class="loc">Delaware</span> Indian) band led by Sachem (Chief) Mattahorn just before Henry Hudson sailed up the Len-api Hanna ("People Like <span class="loc">Me River</span>", present <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River) in 1609. The area was called "Maax-waas Unk" or "<span class="loc">Bear Place</span>" after the Maax-waas Hanna (<span class="loc">Bear River</span>) that flowed by (present <span class="loc">Christina River</span>). It was called the <span class="loc">Bear River</span> because it flowed west to the "Bear People", who are now known as the People of <span class="loc">Conestoga</span> or the Susquehannocks.</p>
