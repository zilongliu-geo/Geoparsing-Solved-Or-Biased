  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The 20th annual World AIDS Day was <span class="date">December 1, 2007</span>. The theme selected by the World AIDS Campaign is "Stop AIDS: Keep the Promise" as it will be through <span class="date">2010</span>. The day was marked by thousands of events around the world. "It is <span class="date">now</span> time for bold leadership at all levels in order to turn the tide of HIV," said Felicita Hikuam, Global Programmes Manager, World AIDS Campaign. An estimated 33.2 million people around the world—one in every 200—are living with HIV, and approximately 6,800 people are infected with HIV and 5,700 people die of AIDS-related illnesses every day. "The trend is encouraging but still for every person receiving treatment four others are newly infected," said <span class="per">Nelson Mandela</span>, speaking at a concert in <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span>, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. "If we are to stop the Aids epidemic from expanding, we need to break the cycle of new HIV infections. All of us working together with government, communities and civil society can make the difference that is needed," he continued. As many as 50,000 people attended the concert in <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span>, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>, which was telecast around the world. It was organized by <span class="per">Nelson Mandela</span>'s 46664 AIDS campaign and featured performances by artists such as <span class="per">Peter Gabriel</span>, Ludacris, Razorlight, the Goo Goo Dolls and <span class="per">Annie Lennox</span>. At a fundraiser in the town of <span class="loc">Midrand</span>, in the province <span class="loc">Gauteng</span>, near <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span> on <span class="date">Friday</span>, singer <span class="per">Annie Lennox</span> had strong words for the South African government's AIDS policies. "AIDS, as Madiba [<span class="per">Mandela</span>] has said, is a human rights issue and should be treated as such in order to avoid this genocide that is affecting millions and millions of people around the world," said <span class="per">Lennox</span> in a speech. <span class="per">Lennox</span> has previously been critical of the South African government's position on suggesting some AIDS medications were toxic. "It is unacceptable that treatment has not been made available to those who need it most," said <span class="per">Lennox</span>. The rock band Queen, which lost its lead singer <span class="per">Freddie Mercury</span> to AIDS, released a new song entitled, Say It's Not True, to coincide with World Aids Day. It has been made available as a free download from the band's website. "By making the song available for free, we hope to help <span class="per">Nelson Mandela</span> with his campaign to get across the message that no-one is safe from infection," said Queen drummer <span class="per">Roger Taylor</span>. "We have to be aware, we have to protect ourselves and those we love." In <span class="loc">China</span>, people distributed AIDS prevention brochures in the streets and promoted safe sex in cities like <span class="per">Beijing</span> and <span class="per">Shanghai</span>. In <span class="loc">Changsha</span>, official warning signs were put on hotel bedstands. The government announced on <span class="date">Friday</span> an allocation of CNY860 million for AIDS prevention and control. According to official reports, there are estimated to be 700,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in <span class="loc">China</span>. Also in <span class="loc">China</span>, the Miss World <span class="date">2007</span> was in <span class="loc">Sanya</span> on World AIDS Day. The pageant presented a special tribute to the fight against AIDS, with a televised speech from former South African President <span class="per">Nelson Mandela</span>, along with traditional dancers from <span class="loc">South Africa</span> who joined the contestants in a special song. <span class="date">Friday</span>, United States President <span class="per">George W. Bush</span> urged the United States Congress to double the <span class="date">2003</span> Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to US$30 billion over <span class="date">the next five years</span>. "Above all, we rededicate ourselves to a great purpose: We will turn the tide against HIV/AIDS—once and for all," he said. "I'm pleased to announce that Laura and I will travel to sub-Saharan <span class="loc">Africa</span> <span class="date">early next year</span>," <span class="per">Bush</span> said. Sub-Saharan <span class="loc">Africa</span> suffered nearly three-quarters of AIDS-related deaths during <span class="date">2006</span> and is home to two-thirds of those living with HIV/AIDS.</p><br><br>
