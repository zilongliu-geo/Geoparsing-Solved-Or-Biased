<p>Concord /ˈkɒŋ.kərd/ is the capital city of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Merrimack County</span>. As of the 2010 census, its population was 42,695. Concord includes the villages of <span class="loc">Penacook</span>, <span class="loc">East Concord</span>, and <span class="loc">West Concord</span>. The city is home to the University of New Hampshire School of Law, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>'s only law school; St. Paul's School, a private preparatory school; NHTI, a two-year community college; and the Granite State Symphony Orchestra. The area that would become Concord was originally settled thousands of years ago by Abenaki Native Americans called the <span class="loc">Pennacook</span>. The tribe fished for migrating salmon, sturgeon, and alewives with nets strung across the rapids of the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span>. The stream was also the transportation route for their birch bark canoes, which could travel from <span class="loc">Lake Winnipesaukee</span> to the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>. The broad sweep of the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span> valley floodplain provided good soil for farming beans, gourds, pumpkins, melons and maize. On January 17, 1725, the Province of <span class="loc">Massachusetts Bay</span>, which then claimed territories west of the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span>, granted the Concord area as the Plantation of <span class="loc">Penacook</span>. It was settled between 1725 and 1727 by Captain Ebenezer Eastman and others from <span class="loc">Haverhill</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. On February 9, 1734, the town was incorporated as <span class="loc">Rumford</span>, from which Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count <span class="loc">Rumford</span> would take his title. It was renamed Concord in 1765 by Governor Benning Wentworth following a bitter boundary dispute between <span class="loc">Rumford</span> and the town of Bow; the city name was meant to reflect the new concord, or harmony, between the disputant towns. Citizens displaced by the resulting border adjustment were given land elsewhere as compensation. In 1779, New <span class="loc">Pennacook</span> Plantation was granted to Timothy Walker, Jr. and his associates at what would be incorporated in 1800 as <span class="loc">Rumford</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, the site of <span class="loc">Pennacook</span> Falls.</p>
