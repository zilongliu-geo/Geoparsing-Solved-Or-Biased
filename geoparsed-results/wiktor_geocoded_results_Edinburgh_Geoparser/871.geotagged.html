<p><span class="loc">Dublin</span> is a city located in southwestern <span class="loc">Erath County</span> in Central Texas. The population was 3,654 at the time of the 2010 census. The town is the former home of the world's oldest Dr Pepper bottling plant (see <span class="loc">Dublin</span> Dr Pepper). The plant was for many years the only <span class="loc">U.S.</span> source for Dr Pepper made with real cane sugar (from <span class="loc">Texas</span>-based Imperial Sugar), instead of less expensive high fructose corn syrup. Contractual requirements limit the plant's distribution range to a 40-mile radius of <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, an area encompassing <span class="loc">Stephenville</span>, <span class="loc">Tolar</span>, <span class="loc">Comanche</span> and <span class="loc">Hico</span>. <span class="loc">Dublin</span> was the southern terminus of the <span class="loc">Wichita</span> Falls and Southern Railroad, one of the properties of Frank Kell, Joseph A. Kemp, and later Orville Bullington of <span class="loc">Wichita</span> Falls. The line was abandoned in 1954. <span class="loc">Dublin</span> was the boyhood home of legendary golfer Ben Hogan, who was born on August 13, 1912, at the hospital in nearby <span class="loc">Stephenville</span>. Hogan lived in <span class="loc">Dublin</span> until 1921, when he and his family relocated to <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span>. American jurist and 1924 Texas Republican gubernatorial nominee George C. Butte married and resided in <span class="loc">Dublin</span> for several years and is interred there at Live Oak Cemetery.</p>
