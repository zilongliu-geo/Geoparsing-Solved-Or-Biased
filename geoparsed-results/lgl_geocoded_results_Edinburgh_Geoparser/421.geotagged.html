<p>Major Mich. utilities seek double-digit rate boosts. David Eggert Associated Press March 23, 2009 From Lansing State Journal Lansing Board of Water &amp; Light's commissioners may vote on a 2.5 percent rate increase at their meeting at 5:30 p.m. Thursday. It will be held at the BWL boardroom, 1232 Haco Drive. Last spring, the BWL's electric and water customers began paying 7 percent more. Steam customers had a 6 percent increase. - Lansing State Journal Detroit Edison and Consumers Energy distribute power to nearly 90 percent of Michigan's electric customers. The companies are seeking rate increases. Consumers Energy said its average residential power customer pays $89 a month. The bill would rise to $99, an 11 percent increase, under the company's proposal. Edison said a residential customer using 500 kilowatt hours a month pays $63. The bill would increase to about $70, an 11 percent increase, under the company's plan. Under a new state law, Consumers Energy could automatically implement its rate hike - or a lesser rate hike - in May if state regulators do not rule by then. Edison could do the same in July. Customers could get refunds, however, if the Michigan Public Service Commission later decides the increases are too high. Both utilities say they will make a decision on how to proceed as they get closer to the dates they can raise rates on their own - six months after a proposal is submitted. "I think it is crummy in this time of hardship," said Bonnie Banks, 61, a retired court recorder who splits her time between Ann Arbor and Oscoda and is a power customer of both Consumers Energy and Edison. "Because of the economy and all the layoffs and our high unemployment rate, it seems like there would be an even larger hardship for people."</p>
