  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gol Gol</span> is a small town in the far western region of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> in the Wentworth Shire. It is situated on the banks of the <span class="loc">Murray River</span>, in the <span class="loc">Sunraysia region</span>. Increasingly, <span class="loc">Gol Gol</span> operates as a suburb of <span class="loc">Mildura</span>, being only 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from this regional centre. In <span class="date">the ten years</span> to <span class="date">2006</span> the population of <span class="loc">Gol Gol</span> increased from 619 to 663, an average annual increase of 0.71%. On <span class="date">17 March 1836</span>, the surveyor <span class="per">Thomas Livingston Mitchell</span> set out on an expedition from <span class="loc">Boree</span> Station (west of <span class="org">Orange</span>) with 25 men, 2 boats, a train of bullock carts and a herd of at least 100 cattle, which were to be used for food when wild animals were scarce. On his arrival at the site of <span class="date">the future</span> village the local Aboriginals informed <span class="per">Mitchell</span> that the area next to the <span class="loc">Murray River</span> was called <span class="loc">Gol Gol</span> (meaning meeting place). <span class="per">Mitchell</span> generally used Aboriginal names when marking his maps as he felt that a map was more useful if settlers could ask the local inhabitants for help. When <span class="per">Mitchell</span> returned to his base camp on the <span class="date">4 June 1836</span> he passed on the name of <span class="loc">Gol Gol</span> to his superiors.</p><br><br>
