<p>Easton is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">South Kesteven district</span> of <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is situated almost 2 miles (3.2 km) north from <span class="loc">Colsterworth</span>, and 1 mile (1.6 km) east from the A1 road. The village has no church, but is part of the North and <span class="loc">South Stoke</span> with <span class="loc">Easton Parish</span>, which contains the church of St Andrew and St Mary at <span class="loc">Stoke Rochford</span>, situated just inside Easton civil parish. The A1 within the parish was straightened when converted to a dual-carriageway in 1960. The village is still largely the same size as it was at the time of the Domesday Book. Sir Henry Cholmeley bought the manor in 1592; his direct descendant Sir Montague Cholmeley rebuilt the village in the early 19th century. <span class="loc">Easton Hall</span> was built by Sir Henry Cholmeley, partly rebuilt in 1805, and enlarged in the Victorian period. It was damaged while being used by the army during the Second World War, and was pulled down in 1951. The 12 acres of gardens were abandoned in 1951 but a major renovation project began in 2001. The Cholmeley family still live in the village and are responsible for the 2005 renovation of the hall's gardens.</p>
