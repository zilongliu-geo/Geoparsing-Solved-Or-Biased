  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Yulin</span> (Chinese: 榆林; pinyin: Yúlín) is a prefecture-level city in the <span class="loc">Shanbei region</span> of <span class="loc">Shaanxi province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>, bordering <span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Shanxi</span> to the east, and Ningxia to the west. It has an administrative area of 43,578 km2 (16,826 sq mi) and a population of 3,380,000. <span class="loc">Yulin</span> is the northernmost prefecture-level <span class="loc">city of Shaanxi</span>, and borders <span class="loc">Ordos City</span> (<span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span>) to the north, <span class="loc">Xinzhou</span> and Lüliang (Shanxi) to the east, <span class="loc">Yan</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> to the south, and <span class="loc">Wuzhong</span> (Ningxia) to the west. To the north and northwest of the city lies the <span class="loc">Ordos Desert</span>, though the countryside is very green due to the many small shrubs which have been planted to slow the process of desertification. The city is based in a valley which extends north-south, which rises to a very large vantage point to the north east, where a spectacular view of the west and northwest is seen. Lake Hongjiannao lies on the border of <span class="loc">Yulin</span> and <span class="loc">Ordos City</span>, <span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span> (39°06′N, 109°53′E). It is <span class="loc">China</span>'s largest "desert freshwater lake". The lake is relatively recent, formed around <span class="date">1929</span> due to increased rainfall in the early 20th century; before, the basin was a wetland. The lake is supplied by four rivers, but there is no outflow. When its surface area was about 60 km2 (23 sq mi), its maximum depth was 10.5 m (34 ft) and the average depth 8.2 m (27 ft). However, the lake has been shrinking sharply over <span class="date">the past decade</span>, to 32 km2 (12 sq mi) at the present. The shrinking has been attributed to reservoir construction, mining, and agricultural irrigation.</p><br><br>
