According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 9,687 people. The town was first known as Nagparitan, the early inhabitants were called Mumburi and known as a wild and fierce people who prevented the Christianized natives from settling in the vicinity. When the Spaniards came to the area, the people staged a revolt, captured the priest and mutilated his body. Because of this incident, the Spaniards change the name of Nagparitan, meaning prohibit, to <span class="loc">Nagpartian</span> which means the place of slaughter. In 1903, <span class="loc">Nagpartian</span> was then fused with the Municipality of <span class="loc">Bangui</span> because of the unstable condition due to low collection of government taxes. On February 28, 1914, by virtue of a legislative act, <span class="loc">Nagpartian</span> was renamed Burgos in honor of one of the three martyred priest, Fr, Jose Burgos. Seńor <span class="loc">Juan Ignacio</span> was the first Presidente Municipal of the town.</p>
