<p><span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> is a town in the Western Cape, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It is located near <span class="loc">South Africa</span>'s south coast, on the N2 highway, 274 km east of Cape Town (about half way between Cape Town and <span class="loc">Knysna</span>). <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> is just east of the <span class="loc">Overberg region</span>, and some consider it the beginning of the Garden Route. <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> is part of the Hessequa Local Municipality. Fourie House on <span class="loc">Fourie</span> Street is the oldest house in <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span>. In 1716, Louis Fourie obtained grazing rights from Governor van der Stel and he settled alongside the <span class="loc">Duivenhoks River</span>. This is where he later constructed the <span class="loc">Doornboom</span> Homestead - registered in 1728 - and the <span class="loc">Doornboom</span> Farm was established. The area was initially part of the greater <span class="loc">Riversdale district</span> until the <span class="loc">Riversdale</span> Dutch Reformed church council in 1855 bought a portion of the farm <span class="loc">Doornboom</span> on which to lay out the town when a new Dutch Reformed congregation was created for the farmers between <span class="loc">Swellendam</span> and <span class="loc">Riversdale</span>. The town grew around the church and it was named in honour of the German town, <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span>, because of the Heidelberg catechism that was practiced in the church.</p>
