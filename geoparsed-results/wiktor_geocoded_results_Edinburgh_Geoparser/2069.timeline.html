  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lexington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">McLean County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,060 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. There are two theories regarding the etymology of the city name. One says it was named for the Battle of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, where <span class="per">General Gridley</span>'s father fought. and the other that it was named for the home town of <span class="per">James Brown</span>, the town's co-founder. <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was laid out on <span class="date">4 January 1836</span> by Asahel <span class="per">Gridley</span> (<span class="date">1810</span>â€“<span class="date">1881</span>) and <span class="per">James Brown</span> (c. <span class="date">1802</span>- ?). <span class="per">Gridley</span> was a lawyer and banker from <span class="loc">Bloomington</span> who would eventually become the richest man in <span class="loc">McLean County</span>; Brown was born in <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, and <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, seems to have been his only attempt at founding a town. Its founding was part of a great real estate boom that swept across the nation. Within <span class="date">a few months</span> of the founding of the town seven other new towns were laid out in <span class="loc">McLean County</span>: <span class="org">Concord</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Danvers</span>), Hudson, <span class="loc">Le Roy</span>, <span class="loc">Livingston</span>, Lytleville, Mt. Hope and Wilksborough. In common with other towns founded during the <span class="date">1836</span> boom, and unlike many later towns, <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was designed around a central public square with streets running true north-south and east-west. In the case of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, the original town consisted of 36 blocks, each containing six lots. Like most of the towns of the <span class="date">1836</span> era the town was built along the line that divided woodland from prairie; the southeast corner of the town was just within the limits of timber. Like most <span class="loc">Mackinaw River</span> towns, <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was laid out on higher ground some distance from the river itself.</p><br><br>
