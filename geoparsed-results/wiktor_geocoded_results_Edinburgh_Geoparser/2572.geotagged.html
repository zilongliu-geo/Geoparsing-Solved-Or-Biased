<p>Hammond is a town in St. <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,191 at the 2010 census. The name is derived from early land owner Abijah Hammond. The Town of Hammond is in the northwest corner of St. <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>. The Village of Hammond lies approximately centrally within the town. The Town of Hammond was formed in 1827 when portions of the Town of <span class="loc">Morristown</span> and the Town of <span class="loc">Rossie</span> were combined. Subsequent small alterations in the town lines affected the neighboring Towns of <span class="loc">Rossie</span>, <span class="loc">Macomb</span>, and <span class="loc">Morristown</span>. Alexander Macomb bought land in this area and this was known as the Macomb purchase. Later this land was bought by Abijah Hammond, a <span class="loc">New York</span> Businessman, he in turn sold 28,871 acres (116.84 km2) of land to <span class="loc">David Parish</span>. A land office was opened in 1814 in <span class="loc">Chippewa Bay</span>, a sub-community of the Town of Hammond today. By an Act of New York State Legislature they passed that Hammond was officially a town, this happened on March 30, 1827. The town was named after Abijah Hammond. Hammond is older than <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and at one point was larger but due to location Hammond lost its population.</p>
