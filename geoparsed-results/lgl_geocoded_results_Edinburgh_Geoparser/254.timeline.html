  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Lebanon</span> schedules spring clean-up. Residents again have a chance to clean up yards, nooks, under kitchen sinks and medicine cabinets. <span class="date">Days</span> have been designated to discard leaves, limbs and other yard debris; to dispose of unneeded over-the-counter and prescription medicines and to set out trash too bulky to be left at curbside on a regular trash collection day. Yard cleanup <span class="date">days</span> are <span class="date">April 6-9</span> and <span class="date">April 13-17</span>, <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> Street Superintendent <span class="per">Larry Lee</span> said. “This is not,” <span class="per">Lee</span> said, “an invitation for somebody to cut down a tree.” Leaves should be raked to curbside and separated from tree limbs, he said. A “household haz-mat” disposal day sponsored by the <span class="org">Boone County Solid Waste District Management Board</span> will be 9 a.m. to <span class="date">2 p.m. May 16</span>, the board decided at a recent quarterly meeting. <span class="date">A haz-mat day</span> will be scheduled <span class="date">this fall</span> in <span class="loc">Zionsville</span>, Waste District Director <span class="per">Dave Lamm</span> said. <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>’s semi-annual heavy trash disposal day is 7 a.m. to <span class="date">4 p.m. April 24-25</span> at the street department, <span class="date">1301</span> Lafayette Ave., <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>. <span class="loc">Only city</span> residents may participate, <span class="per">Lee</span> said. Only household items will be accepted. That excludes railroad ties, fences, construction debris, tires, oil-based paint and hazardous materials. There’s no cost, <span class="per">Lee</span> said. Ray’s Trash, which has the city’s trash collection contract, and Gabriel Metals, a <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> recycling company, will again help with the clean-up, <span class="per">Lee</span> said. Ray’s will provide Dumpsters and containers for bulk metal, <span class="per">Lee</span> said. Gabriel Metals will haul away appliances, including refrigerators, air conditioners and water heaters, at no cost. The only condition is that compressors be removed from refrigerators.</p><br><br>
