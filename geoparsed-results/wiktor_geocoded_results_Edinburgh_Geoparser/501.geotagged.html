<p>Miramar is a small seaside village near the towns of <span class="loc">Gulpilhares</span> and <span class="loc">Arcozelo</span>, in the municipality of <span class="loc">Vila Nova de Gaia</span>, in the subregion of Greater <span class="loc">Porto</span>, <span class="loc">Portugal</span> (Grande <span class="loc">Porto</span>). It is an upmarket residential area south of the river <span class="loc">Douro</span>, most known for its beach – Praia de Miramar (Miramar Beach) – and the small chapel called Senhor da <span class="loc">Pedra</span> (Lord of the Rock), which forms the central attraction of a yearly festival. This chapel is also featured in the film clip "<span class="loc">San Simon</span>", directed by Richard Tomes with music by the Pikoul Sisters. Indeed, Miramar is home to a number of artists and intellectuals, including Marina Pikoul, David Wyn Lloyd, <span class="loc">Lars</span> Wessman and Diane <span class="loc">Braz</span>, amongst others. There are many large houses and mansions in Miramar, as well as in the nearby <span class="loc">Praia da Aguda</span> and <span class="loc">Praia da Granja</span>. Along the beach there are several cafés ("esplanadas"). Despite its pleasant location, Miramar is not an international tourist destination. However, during the warm summer months, many Portuguese from the surrounding areas of <span class="loc">Porto</span>, <span class="loc">Gaia</span> and <span class="loc">Espinho</span> spend their days at the beach of Miramar, and also at neighbouring beaches of the <span class="loc">Costa Verde</span>.</p>
