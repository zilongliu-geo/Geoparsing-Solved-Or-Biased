  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Claremont</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Sullivan County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,355 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Before colonial settlement, the Upper Connecticut River Valley was home to the <span class="per">Pennacook</span> and <span class="per">Western</span> Abenaki (Sokoki) peoples, later merging with members of other Algonquin tribes displaced by the wars and famines that accompanied the European settling of the region. The Hunter Archeological Site, located near the bridge connecting <span class="loc">Claremont</span> with <span class="loc">Ascutney</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, is a significant prehistoric Native American site that includes seven levels of occupational evidence, including evidence of at least three longhouses. The oldest dates recorded from evidence gathered during excavations in <span class="date">1967</span> were to AD <span class="date">1300</span>. The city was named after <span class="loc">Claremont</span>, the country mansion of <span class="per">Thomas Pelham-Holles</span>, <span class="per">Earl of Clare</span>. On <span class="date">October 26, 1764</span>, Colonial Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span> granted the township to <span class="per">Josiah Willard</span>, <span class="per">Samuel Ashley</span> and 67 others. Although first settled in <span class="date">1762</span> by <span class="per">Moses Spafford</span> and <span class="per">David Lynde</span>, many of the proprietors arrived in <span class="date">1767</span>, with a large number from <span class="loc">Farmington</span>, <span class="loc">Hebron</span> and <span class="loc">Colchester</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. The undulating surface of rich, gravelly loam made agriculture an early occupation. <span class="per">Spafford</span> was deeded land from <span class="per">Col. Samuel Ashley</span>, who was given a charter to establish a ferry across the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> in <span class="date">1784</span>, the location of which is still known as <span class="per">Ashley</span>'s Ferry landing. <span class="per">Spafford</span> was also the first man to marry in <span class="loc">Claremont</span>, and his son, <span class="per">Elijah</span>, was the first white child to be born in the town.</p><br><br>
