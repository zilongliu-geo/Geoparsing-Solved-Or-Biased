  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Dalton</span> is a civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Rotherham</span> in <span class="loc">South Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="per">Dalton</span> is situated 162 miles (260.7 km) north from <span class="loc">London</span> and is 2 miles (3.2 km) north-east from the centre of <span class="loc">Rotherham</span> town centre. The population of the parish as taken at the <span class="date">2011</span> Census was 10,292. The parish includes the communities of <span class="loc">Brecks</span>, <span class="loc">Dalton Brook</span>, <span class="per">Dalton</span> <span class="per">Foljambe</span>, <span class="loc">Dalton Magna</span>, <span class="loc">Dalton Parva</span>, <span class="loc">Flanderwell</span>, <span class="loc">Sunnyside</span> and Woodlaithes. The civil parish name of “<span class="per">Dalton</span>” means valley farmstead and takes its name from the valley of the <span class="per">Dalton Brook</span> located nearby. There are two entries for <span class="per">Dalton</span> in the Domesday Book reflecting the two settlements with in the parish. The two main settlements in <span class="per">Dalton</span> were the hamlets of <span class="loc">Dalton Magna</span> and <span class="loc">Dalton Parva</span>. A third settlement, <span class="per">Dalton Brook</span>, grew up along the <span class="loc">Rotherham</span> - Doncaster Road due to the need of extra houses for the ever expanding population. The Church, known as the Holy Trinity Church, located in <span class="loc">Dalton Parva</span> was erected in <span class="date">1848</span> and completed in <span class="date">1849</span> by <span class="per">G. S. Foljambe</span>. At first the Holy Trinity Church was only permitted to complete the Baptism procedure. However in <span class="date">1850</span> it gained licenses to do both marriages and burials. Initially the land was owned by <span class="per">William de Percy</span> (Governor of <span class="loc">York</span> in <span class="date">1067</span>) and <span class="per">William de Warrene</span> (who was related to <span class="per">William</span> the Conqueror and the builder of <span class="loc">Conisbrough</span> Castle) before it was taken over by the parish council. The Parish Council is involved in the provision of allotment gardens, recreation areas, lettings of halls, environmental improvements, provision of cash grants to local organisations and the consideration of local planning matters. It also makes representations to Local Government, National Government, Police, Health Service, Passenger Transport Authority and other organisations on matters which are of concern to the local population.</p><br><br>
