<p><span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> is a historic unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> is located about 20 miles south of Antelope, and 10 miles east of <span class="loc">Ashwood</span>. The area was first known as "<span class="loc">Axehandle</span>", and later as "Kilts". <span class="loc">Axehandle</span> was located at 44.7506839°N 120.6511421°W﻿ / 44.7506839; -120.6511421﻿ (<span class="loc">Axehandle</span>). It was about a quarter mile south of <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>. The locale of <span class="loc">Axehandle</span> was named for <span class="loc">Axehandle</span> Spring, which was given its name in the late 19th century by some wood haulers from Antelope who found a broken axehandle near a watering hole while working to bring wood from the <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span>. The "<span class="loc">Axehandle</span>" moniker came to comprise the area of several ranches. <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> is located at 44.7542950°N 120.6511423°W﻿ / 44.7542950; -120.6511423﻿ (<span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>). The name was coined by Joe Brannon for a brawl ("donnybrook", named for the <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> Fair, which took place in <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>, <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>) among some Irish sheepherders during the homestead era. At one time <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span> had a school. Jesse Kilts homesteaded in the area, and when a post office was established on September 15, 1914, it was named for Mr. Kilts, whose wife, Ruth, was the first postmaster. Kilts post office closed on June 29, 1940. According to <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Geographic Names, Kilts was considered a newcomer in the area, and longtime residents have always called the locale "<span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>" instead of "Kilts". Modern atlases show the locale as "<span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>". The location of Kilts post office moved many times, as was common in the pioneer era. According to author Ralph Friedman, as of 1993 only one of the private homes in which the post office was located was still standing, all the rest having been burned or torn down. Kilts, which is the only one of the three locations not marked as a "historical" populated place by the USGS, is shown as currently being located at 44.7387402°N 120.5955845°W﻿ / 44.7387402; -120.5955845﻿ (Kilts), about 4 miles east of <span class="loc">Donnybrook</span>.</p>
