  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Union County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 19,109. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Maynardville. <span class="loc">Union County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Knoxville</span>, <span class="loc">TN</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Union County</span> was formed in <span class="date">1850</span> from portions of <span class="loc">Grainger</span>, <span class="loc">Claiborne</span>, <span class="loc">Campbell</span>, <span class="loc">Anderson</span> and <span class="loc">Knox</span> counties. There are at least two theories on the source of its name. The name may commemorate the "union" of sections of five counties, or it may reflect <span class="loc">East Tennessee</span>'s support for the preservation of the <span class="org">Union</span> in the <span class="date">years</span> before the Civil War. The county seat was originally named "Liberty," but renamed "Maynardville" in honor of attorney and congressman, <span class="per">Horace Maynard</span>, who had defended the county in a court case that sought to block its formation. In <span class="date">the 1930s</span>, the damming of the <span class="loc">Clinch River</span> by <span class="loc">Norris</span> Dam to form <span class="loc">Norris Lake</span> inundated a large part of the county, including the community of Loyston, and displaced many residents. With assistance from the National Park Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) developed Big Ridge State Park as a demonstration park on the shore of the lake in <span class="loc">Union County</span>. The park's recreational facilities opened in <span class="date">May 1934</span>.</p><br><br>
