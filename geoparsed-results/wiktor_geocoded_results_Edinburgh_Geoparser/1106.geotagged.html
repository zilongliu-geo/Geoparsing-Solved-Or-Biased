The first business in <span class="loc">Chester</span> was a general store that opened in 1830 along with a castor oil press established by R. B. Servant, who furnished farmers with seed and growing methods to later buy the beans they produced for oil extraction. This was a flourishing business until the petroleum industry made it obsolete.

Content Walker, the bride and Amzi Andrews, the groom held their wedding in a 16 feet square log cabin.</p>
