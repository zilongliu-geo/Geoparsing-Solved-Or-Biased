  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Gang threat just a hoax. <span class="loc">Willis</span> said police had received reports from several states about the text message and many people locally had received it. He added they have been backwards-tracing the trail of the message. The message was being sent out locally, with people receiving it and then forwarding it to others. <span class="loc">Willis</span> said the local connection splits past a certain number of text messages, with some coming from the Knoxville area and others coming from around <span class="loc">Chattanooga</span>. <span class="loc">McMinn County</span> Sheriff <span class="per">Steve Frisbie</span>, who received several calls about the text message and e-mail, said some members of his staff actually received the message on their phone. They looked it up on the Internet and saw several sites that stated it was a hoax.</p><br><br>
