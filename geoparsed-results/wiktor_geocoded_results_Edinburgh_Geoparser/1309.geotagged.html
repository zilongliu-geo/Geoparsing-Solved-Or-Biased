<p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the northeastern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 50,976. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Bartlesville. Named for President <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, it is the smallest county in <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> in total area, adjacent to the largest county in <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Osage County</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> comprises the Bartlesville, OK Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Tulsa-Muskogee-Bartlesville, OK Combined Statistical Area. It is located along the border with <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. The <span class="loc">Osage</span> ceded their land claims in 1825, and the Federal Government allowed the Western <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> to settle in this area in 1828. The 1835 Treaty of <span class="loc">New Echota</span> confirmed <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> ownership of the land. The area now covered by <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was part of the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> Saline District between 1840 to 1856 and the <span class="loc">Cooweescoowee District</span> from 1856 to 1906. The first post office was established in 1859 at the confluence of <span class="loc">Butler Creek</span> and the <span class="loc">Caney River</span> by James L. Butler. Known as Little Verdigris, the settlement also had a trading post and a school. The Civil War caused most of the inhabitants to move away and the post office closed in 1866. In 1867, the Cherokees sold 157,600 acres to the Eastern <span class="loc">Delaware</span></p>
