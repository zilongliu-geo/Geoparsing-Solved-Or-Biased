<p><span class="loc">Rockville</span> is a city located in the central region of <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>. It is the county seat and is a major incorporated city of <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> and forms part of the <span class="loc">Baltimoreâ€“Washington metropolitan</span> area. The 2010 census tabulated the Rockville's population at 61,209, making it the third largest incorporated city in <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, behind Baltimore and Frederick. <span class="loc">Rockville</span> is the largest incorporated city in <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, although the nearby census-designated place of <span class="loc">Germantown</span> is more populous. <span class="loc">Rockville</span>, along with neighboring <span class="loc">Gaithersburg</span> and <span class="loc">Bethesda</span>, is at the core of the Interstate 270 Technology Corridor which is home to numerous software and biotechnology companies as well as several federal government institutions. The city also has several upscale regional shopping centers and is one of the major retail hubs in <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>. Situated in the Piedmont region and crossed by three creeks (<span class="loc">Rock Creek</span>, Cabin <span class="loc">John Creek</span>, and Watts Branch), <span class="loc">Rockville</span> provided an excellent refuge for semi-nomadic Native Americans as early as 8000 BC. By the first millennium BC, a few of these groups had settled down into year-round agricultural communities that exploited the native flora, including sunflowers and marsh elder. By AD 1200, these early groups (dubbed Montgomery Indians by later archaeologists) were increasingly drawn into conflict with the Senecas and Susquehannocks who had migrated south from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span>. Within the present-day boundaries of the city, six prehistoric sites have been uncovered and documented, and borne artifacts several thousand years old. By the year 1700, under pressure from European colonists, the majority of these original inhabitants had been driven away.</p>
