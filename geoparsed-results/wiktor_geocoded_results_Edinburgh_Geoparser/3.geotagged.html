<p><span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> (Nalibnos a <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span>) is a third-class partially urban municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 28,597 people. The town is home to the Our Lady of the Assumption Church (Nuestra Señora de la <span class="loc">Asuncion</span>), a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The townspeople celebrate their patronal fiesta in honor of the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of the Assumption (more commonly known as Apo Baket) every August 15 and lasting for several days. Situated at the western coastline of the island of <span class="loc">Luzon</span>, <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> is nestled in a valley surrounded by mountains. It lies in the central part of the province of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>. It is bounded to the north by the Municipality of <span class="loc">Narvacan</span>; to the east by Municipality of <span class="loc">Pilar</span>, <span class="loc">Abra</span> province and the Cordillera range; to the south by the Municipality of <span class="loc">San Esteban</span>; to the southeast by the Municipality of <span class="loc">Burgos</span>; and to the west by the <span class="loc">South China Sea</span>. <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> is politically subdivided into 33 barangays. The community of <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> must have been already an organized settlement before the Spaniards came to the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. When Captain Juan de Salcedo conquered the Ilocos in 1572, they found out that the people were already engaged in a brisk trade and commerce with the Japanese and the Chinese. The people’s main industries were fishing and farming and to some extent weaving of cotton cloth and pottery. The people were noted for their religiosity. They worshiped the anitos, spirits and local Gods. Although the conquest of the <span class="loc">Ilocos Region</span> was a slow and painful process for the inhabitants resisted, they were later conquered through the use of the sword and hand in hand with the Cross. It was the religious nature of the people that the friars greatly exploited to convert the Ilocanos to the new faith – Christianity.</p>
