<p><span class="loc">Richland</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Navarro County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 291 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Richland</span> is located at 31°55′34″N 96°25′35″W (31.926052, -96.426350). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.1 square miles (2.8 km2), all land. <span class="loc">Richland</span>, at the junction of Interstate 45 and State Highway 14, on <span class="loc">Pisgah</span> Ridge twelve miles south of <span class="loc">Corsicana</span> in south central <span class="loc">Navarro County</span>, was first settled in the late 1840s. Asa Chambers had established a store on the trail from <span class="loc">Corsicana</span> to Franklin by 1848, when a post office, named Richland Crossing after nearby <span class="loc">Richland Creek</span>, opened in his store. The store, which moved and changed ownership several times, continued to form the nucleus of the community until the early 1870s. When the <span class="loc">Houston</span> and Texas Central Railway was built through the area in 1871, the station on the <span class="loc">Pisgah</span> Ridge near the store was designated <span class="loc">Richland</span>, and a new community began to develop around the depot. A post office named <span class="loc">Richland</span> began operating in 1878, and by the mid-1890s the town had two steam gristmills and cotton gins, three general stores, a grocer, two blacksmiths, two saloons, a hardware store, a bank, and an estimated population of 150. The first school had begun operating around the time of the Civil War, and by 1906 the town had a two-teacher school with an enrollment of seventy-five. <span class="loc">Richland</span> continued to prosper during the 1920s, reaching a peak population of 750 in 1929. During the 1930s its population began to decline, in part because of the Great Depression. By 1950 the town had twelve businesses and a population of 369. The decline continued during the 1960s and 1970s, and by 1990 <span class="loc">Richland</span> had 244 residents and one business. The population reached 291 in 2000.</p>
