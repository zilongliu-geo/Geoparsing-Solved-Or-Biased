  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Campbell</span> is a town in the middle of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River in La <span class="loc">Crosse County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">La Crosse</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4358 as of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census. All of the town's population resides in its eastern portion, on the section of <span class="loc">French Island</span> denoted French Island CDP by the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau. Some of the island is part of the city of <span class="loc">La Crosse</span>. The Town of <span class="per">Campbell</span> borders the city of <span class="loc">La Crosse</span>. The unincorporated community of <span class="loc">West La Crosse</span> is also located in the town. The town was originally created in <span class="date">1851</span>, and was officially named after <span class="per">Erasmus D. Campbell</span>, a former Lieutenant Governor of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, the Town of <span class="per">Campbell</span> is confined to part of a large island bordered by the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> and Black rivers and <span class="loc">Lake Onalaska</span>. This island has been traditionally known as "<span class="loc">French Island</span>." <span class="per">Joseph French</span>, one of the earliest settlers of the town arrived in <span class="date">May 1851</span>. French's family originated from <span class="loc">Leicestershire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Later, French-Canadian settlers, primarily farmers from the Canadian <span class="loc">Province of Quebec</span>, settled on the island-part of <span class="per">Campbell</span>, then a much larger town between the incorporated settlements of <span class="loc">Onalaska</span> and <span class="loc">La Crosse</span>.</p><br><br>
