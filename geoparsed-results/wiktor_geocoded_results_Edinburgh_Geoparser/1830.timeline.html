  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tondo</span> is a district located in Manila, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It is the largest in terms of area and population of Manila's sixteen districts, with a Census-estimated 628,106 people in <span class="date">2010</span> and consists of two congressional districts. It is also the most densely populated district in the city. <span class="date">Today</span>, if it were an independent city, <span class="loc">Tondo</span> would rank as the tenth most populous city in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, behind only the other districts of the <span class="loc">City of Manila</span> combined, and the <span class="loc">cities of Quezon</span>, <span class="loc">Caloocan</span>, <span class="loc">Davao</span>, <span class="loc">Cebu</span>, <span class="loc">Zamboanga</span>, <span class="loc">Taguig</span>, <span class="loc">Antipolo</span> and <span class="loc">Pasig</span>. <span class="loc">Tondo</span> hosts the country's largest ports, the Manila <span class="loc">North Harbour</span> and the <span class="org">Manila International Container Terminal</span>. According to Laguna Copperplate Inscription, <span class="loc">Tondo</span> has existed since <span class="date">900 AD</span>, and has been ruled by Jayadeva who holds the Sanskrit title Senapati or "admiral". Numerous theories on the origin of the name "Tondo" have been put forward. <span class="org">Philippine National</span> Artist Nick Joaquin suggested that it might be a reference to high ground ("tundok"). French linguist Jean-Paul Potet, however, has suggested that the River Mangrove, Aegiceras corniculatum, which at the time was called "tundok" ("tinduk-tindukan" <span class="date">today</span>), is the most likely origin of the name.</p><br><br>
