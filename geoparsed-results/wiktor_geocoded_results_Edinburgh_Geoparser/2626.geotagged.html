<p>Alexandra is a town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Located at the junction of the Goulburn Valley Highway (B340) and Maroondah Highway (B360), 26 kilometres west of <span class="loc">Eildon</span>, in the Shire of <span class="loc">Murrindindi</span> local government area. At the 2011 census, Alexandra had a population of 2,656. The town was settled in the late 1860s, with a Post Office opening on 15 March 1867 (known until 24 April 1867) as <span class="loc">Redgate</span>. The town was originally known as <span class="loc">Redgate</span>, or Red Gate Diggings. The current name either derives from Alexandra of <span class="loc">Denmark</span> when the shire was given a statue of her, or from three men named Alexander (Alesander, McGregor, Alexander Don, and Alexander Luckie) who discovered gold in the area in 1866. The railway to Alexandra arrived as a branch line of the <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> railway line in 1909, and closed on 18 November 1978. In 2012, the closed rail line was used as part of the route for the 134 km long Great Victorian Rail Trail. The <span class="loc">Rubicon</span> Tramway connected Alexandra with the village of <span class="loc">Rubicon</span>, at the junction of the <span class="loc">Rubicon</span> and <span class="loc">Royston Rivers</span>.</p>
