<p><span class="loc">Roshchino</span> (Russian: Ро́щино; Finnish: <span class="loc">Raivola</span>), <span class="loc">Raivola</span> before 1948, is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) in <span class="loc">Vyborgsky District</span> of <span class="loc">Leningrad Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, and a station on the Saint Petersburg-Vyborg railroad. It is situated on the <span class="loc">Karelian Isthmus</span> 60 kilometers (37 mi) northwest of St. Petersburg, approximately halfway to <span class="loc">Vyborg</span>. Population: 13,439 (2010 Census); 9,393 (2002 Census); 8,436 (1989 Census). In the wooded areas surrounding <span class="loc">Roshchino</span> there are multiple marshes and small lakes. Lintula larch forest is located some 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) to the west from the railroad station. <span class="loc">Raivola</span> was first shown on maps of <span class="loc">Finland</span> in the 16th century. After 1812 it was under jurisdiction of Grand Duchy of <span class="loc">Finland</span> being part of Russian Empire, a part of the <span class="loc">Viipuri Province</span>. The mixed Russian-Finnish population of the area was engaged in agriculture. Around 1802 count <span class="loc">Saltykov</span> resettled some 609 of his subjects from Oryol Governorate to the area to meet growing manpower demands for his iron works; in addition to the iron foundry maps of mid-19th century show also sawmill. After the railroad to <span class="loc">Helsinki</span> was opened by czar Alexander II in 1870, <span class="loc">Raivola</span> was used for changing of locomotive crews. Establishment of the railroad station turned <span class="loc">Raivola</span> into suburb of St. Petersburg and development of the area continued with construction of summer cottages. By end of the century the population stood around 2,000, of which 169 were Finns. The village had shops, warehouses, two (Finnish and Russian) schools, and Russian Orthodox church of St. Nicholas with library and medical facility. Also hydro-electric power station and telephone station were established. The importance of the local railway station was eclipsed by <span class="loc">Terijoki</span> where Finnish customs depot was established in 1911</p>
