  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Wilson</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Mississippi County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The community is located in the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> delta and is surrounded by fertile cropland historically used to produce cotton. <span class="per">Wilson</span> started as a company town in <span class="date">1886</span> by Robert E. <span class="per">Lee Wilson</span>, who would build a cotton empire and run it from the city. The <span class="org">Wilson Company</span> would become so successful that all of the town's buildings were rebuilt in Tudor Revival architectural style following <span class="per">Wilson</span>'s son's honeymoon to <span class="loc">England</span> in <span class="date">1925</span>. <span class="per">Wilson</span> did not incorporate until <span class="date">1959</span>, and remained in the <span class="per">Wilson</span> family until <span class="date">2010</span>. The community has seen a rapid decline in economic activity and population since the advent of mechanization on the farm, reducing the need for manual labor to produce cotton. The population was 903 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Wilson</span> started as a company town for Robert E. <span class="per">Lee Wilson</span>'s nearby logging and sawmill operation founded in <span class="date">1886</span>. The village prospered when <span class="per">Wilson</span> decided to use the cleared land for agriculture instead of selling it after logging. In <span class="date">1900</span>, a major archaeological find occurred near <span class="per">Wilson</span> when <span class="per">James K. Hampson</span> discovered the Island 35 Mastodon. All residents of <span class="per">Wilson</span> except the postmaster and railroad employees had access to company doctors for $1.25 annually ($17.71 in 2015 dollars), a rarity in the poverty-stricken <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> delta. The company also employed people to work in <span class="per">Wilson</span>'s basic service industries, such as drycleaning and automobile repair, keeping the standard of living high.</p><br><br>
