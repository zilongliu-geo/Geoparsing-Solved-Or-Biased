<p><span class="loc">Lafayette</span> is a census-designated place in the center of Deer Creek Township, <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located at 39°56′15″N 83°24′24″W, along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 40, just west of its intersection with <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 42. <span class="loc">Lawrenceville</span> (also known regionally as "Limerick") was laid out in 1816, by Thomas Gwynne, on land he owned 1.5 miles (2.4 km) northwest of where <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> is located today. In 1816, Angus Ross opened Lawrenceville's first and only tavern. The Lawrenceville Post Office was established on July 2, 1825. In 1836-7, the National Road was completed through the township, missing <span class="loc">Lawrenceville</span>, and the town immediately began to die. By 1915, the original community was nothing more than pasture land, with no signs left to indicate there was ever a community. <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> was laid out on October 1, 1834, by William Minter, and named in honor of Gilbert du Motier, marquis de <span class="loc">Lafayette</span>. On December 31, 1836, the Lawenceville Post Office was moved to <span class="loc">Lafayette</span>, and renamed Lafayette Post Office, with John Minter as the first postmaster of the new branch. As of 1875, the community contained one drug store, one dry goods and grocery store, and one blacksmith shop. The post office was discontinued on December 31, 1905, with mail service going through the <span class="loc">London</span> branch. As of 1915, the community contained three general stores and one blacksmith shop.</p>
