<p>Samana is a city and a municipal council in <span class="loc">Patiala district</span> in the Indian state of <span class="loc">Punjab</span>. Before Independence, Samana was a part of Patiala Kingdom (PEPSU). Now it is a part of <span class="loc">Patiala District</span> of <span class="loc">Punjab</span> (<span class="loc">India</span>). It traces its history to the days of Raja Jaipal who ruled over, among others, the territories of <span class="loc">Bhatinda</span>, <span class="loc">Samana</span>. It fell into the hands of Shahab-ud-Din Muhammad Gauri after the conquest of <span class="loc">Ajmer</span> and <span class="loc">Delhi</span> and was entrusted to Qutb-ud-Din Aibek in 1192, along with the territories of <span class="loc">Ghuram</span> and <span class="loc">Sunam</span>. With the increasing importance of <span class="loc">Sirhind</span> under the Mughals, Samana received a little set-back. While Samana is said to be a place of saints and scholars during the Mughal days, it is notorious also for its professional executioners, who served at <span class="loc">Delhi</span> and <span class="loc">Sirhind</span>. Sayyad Jala-ud-Din, who executed Guru Teg Bahadur at <span class="loc">Delhi</span> in 1675 was from Samana. Beg brothers, who mercilessly butchered the younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh also belonged to <span class="loc">Samana</span>. This hated town was therefore one of the first places to have been sacked by Banda Bahadur. But the Mughals were yet too strong for the rising power of Sikhs and Samana had to be given up by them towards the end of 1710 AD.It was retaken in about 1742 AD by <span class="loc">Baba</span> <span class="loc">Ala</span> Singh, the founder of the Patiala ruling family and was recognized as a part of his territories by Ahamd Shah Durani.</p>
