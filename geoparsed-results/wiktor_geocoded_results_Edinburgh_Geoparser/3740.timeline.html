  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kingswood</span> is an urban area in <span class="loc">South Gloucestershire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, on the eastern border of the <span class="loc">City of Bristol</span>. In Saxon and Norman times, <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> Forest was a royal hunting estate which surrounded <span class="loc">Bristol</span>, extending as far as Filwood in <span class="loc">South Bristol</span>. "From early <span class="date">days</span> the Constable of <span class="loc">Bristol</span> Castle, the king's officer in the area, was also the Chief Ranger of the <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> Forest and the first of these recorded is Ella who died in 920. At the edge of the forest, to the north of the River Froom, lay the little hamlet of <span class="loc">Stapleton</span>, the name of which is Saxon in origin, being held to mean 'The farm, homestead or croft â€“ by or near the Stapol, post or pillar'". The <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> area first came into industrial prominence in the late 17th century, because of coal mining. Typical of these were coal fields in the <span class="loc">Easton</span> and <span class="loc">Coalpit Heath</span>/Yate areas. The coal mining history still affects the town with gardens occasionally opening up. The local MP has petitioned in Parliament for full surveys of the coal mines under the town.</p><br><br>
