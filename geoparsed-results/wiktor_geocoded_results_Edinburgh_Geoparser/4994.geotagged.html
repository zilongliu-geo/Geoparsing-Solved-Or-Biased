<p><span class="loc">El Centro</span> is a city in and county seat of <span class="loc">Imperial County</span>, the largest city in the Imperial Valley, east anchor of the Southern <span class="loc">California Border Region</span>, and the core urban area and principal city of the <span class="loc">El Centro</span> metropolitan area which encompasses all of <span class="loc">Imperial County</span>. <span class="loc">El Centro</span> is also the largest American city to lie entirely below sea level (-39 feet). The city, located in the far southeastern corner of California, is near the major Southern California city of <span class="loc">San Diego</span> and the Mexican <span class="loc">city of Mexicali</span>. Founded in 1906, W. F. <span class="loc">Holt</span> and C.A. Barker purchased the land on which <span class="loc">El Centro</span> was eventually built for about $40 an acre and invested $100,000 in improvements. As one historian of valley life put it, "in only five months <span class="loc">El Centro</span> went from a barley field to a city...". It is home to retail, transportation, wholesale, and agricultural industries. There are also two international border crossings nearby for commercial and noncommercial vehicles. The city's population was 42,598 at the 2010 census, up from 37,835 in 2000.</p>
