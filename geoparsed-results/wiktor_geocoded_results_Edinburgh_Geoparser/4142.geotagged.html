<p><span class="loc">Govan</span> /ˈɡɒvən/ is a town in the <span class="loc">province of Saskatchewan</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> located 111 kilometres north of Regina on Highway 20. In 2011 the town had 216 residents. The first settlers made their homes along the shores of <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> (now known as <span class="loc">Last Mountain Lake</span>), at places close to McKillops's Landing, Arlington Beach, and Taylorboro. The original settlers used the waters of <span class="loc">Last Mountain Lake</span>, which is 93 kilometres long, as a means of transportation. Supplies for the farmers were brought north up the lake and all the grain was taken down the lake in boats, then stored in elevators at the <span class="loc">East End</span>. This lake transportation system was abandoned when the early extension of the Canadian Pacific Railway Kirkella branch from <span class="loc">Bulyea</span> to <span class="loc">Lanigan</span> and on to <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span> was built, opening up more of the country to the settlers. The first house to be built within a five-mile radius of <span class="loc">Govan</span> was erected in 1903 by Oscar Landstrom, on the southeast quarter of Section 32, Township 27, Range 22 west of the second meridian. Some of the settlers came north from Craven, through <span class="loc">Bulyea</span> and <span class="loc">Strasbourg</span> districts. Others came up the waters on <span class="loc">Long Lake</span>.</p>
