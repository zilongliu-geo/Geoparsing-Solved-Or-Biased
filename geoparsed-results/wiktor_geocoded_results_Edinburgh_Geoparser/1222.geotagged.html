<p><span class="loc">Jamestown</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Fentress County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Fentress County</span>. The population of the city was 1,959 at the 2010 census. The <span class="loc">City of Jamestown</span> was established in 1823 as a county seat for <span class="loc">Fentress County</span>. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was incorporated as a city in 1837. Both <span class="loc">Fentress County</span> and the <span class="loc">City of Jamestown</span> are named for prominent local politician James Fentress (1763â€“1843), who made the appeal for the new county to be carved out of Overton and Morgan counties. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was built upon the site of a semi-permanent Cherokee village, which probably made use of the many natural rock shelters in the area. Before the founding of <span class="loc">Jamestown</span>, the area was known as "Sand Springs" for the many bubbling springs located within the city. The last remaining spring is located in the Mark Twain City Park, just northeast of the county courthouse. This spring provided water to the family of John M. Clemens, father of Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain), before they moved to <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. John Clemens served as the first circuit court clerk. He also drew the plans for the first courthouse and jail.</p>
