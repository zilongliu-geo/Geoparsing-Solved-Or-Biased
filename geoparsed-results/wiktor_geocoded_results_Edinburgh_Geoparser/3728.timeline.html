  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Taltal</span> is a Chilean commune and city in <span class="loc">Antofagasta Province</span>, <span class="loc">Antofagasta Region</span>. According to the <span class="date">2012</span> census, the commune has a population of 11,132 and has an area of 20,405.1 km2 (7,878 sq mi). The commune is home to Paranal Observatory and includes the northern portion of Pan de Azúcar National Park. The history of <span class="loc">Taltal</span> begins with the opening of the copper mine "<span class="loc">El Cobre</span>" by José <span class="per">Antonio Moreno</span> in <span class="date">1850</span> about 20 kilometers north of <span class="loc">Taltal</span>. This brought miners and prospectors to the area. In <span class="date">1855</span> <span class="per">Moreno</span> expanded his operations to include <span class="loc">Taltal</span>. The discovery of copper in <span class="date">1858</span> on nearby Mount Cachiyuyal increased pressure on the port, which had to utilize customs officials from <span class="loc">Copiapo</span>. So <span class="per">Moreno</span> requested official recognition of the port which was granted by decree on <span class="date">12 July 1858</span>. However, the real boom began in <span class="date">1876</span> with the opening of nitrate mines, in particular potassium nitrate. In <span class="date">1879</span>, the first nitrates were shipped from the area. In <span class="date">1882</span> a railway was completed from <span class="loc">Cachinal de la Sierra</span> and other nitrate mining sites. It was built by the "Taltal Railway Company", a British company, sold to private investors in <span class="date">1954</span>, and dismantled in <span class="date">1970</span> due to the end of nitrate mining. At the peak of production in <span class="date">the 1930s</span>, <span class="loc">Taltal</span> had a population of over 30,000 and was the third largest nitrate port in <span class="loc">Chile</span>.</p><br><br>
