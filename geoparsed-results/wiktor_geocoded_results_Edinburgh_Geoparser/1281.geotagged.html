<p>Long Beach is a city in <span class="loc">Nassau County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Just south of <span class="loc">Long Island</span>, it is located on Long Beach <span class="loc">Barrier Island</span>, which is the westernmost of the outer barrier islands off <span class="loc">Long Island</span>'s <span class="loc">South Shore</span>. As of the <span class="loc">United States</span> 2010 Census, the city population was 33,275. It was incorporated in 1922, and is nicknamed The City By the Sea (as seen in Latin on its official seal). The <span class="loc">city of Long Beach</span> is surrounded by Reynolds Channel to the north, east and west, and the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> to the south. As of 2012, Jack Schnirman is the city manager, a position appointed by the City Council. It has been democratic for many years. Long Beach's first inhabitants were the Algonquian-speaking Rockaway Indians, who sold the area to English colonists in 1643. While the barrier island was used by baymen and farmers for fishing and harvesting salt hay, no one lived there year-round for more than two centuries. In 1849 Congress established a lifesaving station. A dozen years before, 62 people died when the barque <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, carrying Irish immigrants to <span class="loc">New York</span>, ran ashore on New Year's Day.</p>
