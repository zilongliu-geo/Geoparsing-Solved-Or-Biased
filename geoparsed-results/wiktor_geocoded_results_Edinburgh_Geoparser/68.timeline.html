  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and is a part of the St. <span class="loc">George Metropolitan</span> Area. The population was 6,003 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 4,630 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. In <span class="date">1854</span>, <span class="per">Jacob Hamblin</span> was called by <span class="per">Brigham Young</span> to serve a mission to the southern Paiute and settled at <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> in the vicinity of the modern city of <span class="loc">St. George</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>. The first settlers built Fort Clara or Fort <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span>, in the <span class="date">winter</span> of 1855-1856. In the <span class="date">fall of 1861</span>, Swiss Mormon colonists arrived at the new settlement, but shortly afterward were victims of the large flood in the <span class="loc">Clara River</span> that wiped out the fort and most other buildings, its irrigation dams and ditches, in <span class="date">early in 1862</span>. This flood was part of the Great Flood of <span class="date">1862</span>. <span class="per">Hamblin</span>'s first home there was included in the destruction of this flood. His second wife <span class="per">Rachael</span> saved one of their young children from drowning, but the child soon after died from exposure. <span class="per">Rachael</span> never fully recovered from the exposure she got from the flood. Swearing to avoid the risk of flood, <span class="per">Hamblin</span> built a new home on a hill in <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span>. Owned <span class="date">today</span> by the Church of <span class="per">Jesus Christ</span> of Latter Day Saints, it is operated as a house museum, where Mormon missionaries give daily tours.</p><br><br>
