<p>Chandler is an outer suburb of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> 14 kilometres (9 mi) south-east of the CBD. The easternmost point of mainland <span class="loc">Brisbane City</span>, Chandler is a semi-rural suburb consisting largely of bushland and residential properties on acreage, close to the major commercial precincts of Carindale and Capalaba. Chandler is perhaps best known for the Sleeman Centre, a large sporting and entertainment complex. Chandler was named after the former Lord Mayor of Brisbane City Council, Sir John Beals Chandler. It remained sparsely populated for decades, retaining much of its natural bushland. This lack of population motivated the construction of multiple buildings of the Sleeman Centre for the 1982 Commonwealth Games. The Sleeman Centre housed the suburb's only significant structures until 2010, when the former suburb of <span class="loc">Capalaba</span> West became incorporated into Chandler. This extended Chandler's eastern border to <span class="loc">Tingalpa Creek</span>, separating <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> from <span class="loc">Redland City</span>, and added a small commercial area along Old Cleveland Road to the suburb, including the erroneously named Capalaba Produce Village. In the 2011 census, the population of Chandler was 1,422, of which 50.4% were female and 49.6% were male. The median age of the Chandler population was 42 years of age, 5 years above the Australian median.</p>
