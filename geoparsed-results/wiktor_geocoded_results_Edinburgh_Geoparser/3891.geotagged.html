<p><span class="loc">Mithapur</span>, <span class="loc">Gujarat</span> is a census town in Devbhumi <span class="loc">Dwarka district</span> in the Indian state of <span class="loc">Gujarat</span>. <span class="loc">Mithapur</span> had an area of 22.1 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi). <span class="loc">Mithapur</span> (<span class="loc">Gujrat</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>) is located at 22.41°N 69.00°E﻿ / 22.41; 69.00. It has an average elevation of 7 metres (22 feet). Introduction As with <span class="loc">Jamshedpur</span> and <span class="loc">Tata Steel</span>, so with Tata Chemicals and the two centres it has created around its operations: <span class="loc">Mithapur</span> in coastal <span class="loc">Gujarat</span> (in western <span class="loc">India</span>) and <span class="loc">Babrala</span> in <span class="loc">Uttar Pradesh</span> (northern <span class="loc">India</span>). Distinct in layout and geography, <span class="loc">Mithapur</span> and <span class="loc">Babrala</span> serve the needs, and then some, of the company's chemicals and fertiliser plants respectively. The <span class="loc">Mithapur</span> story began in 1939, when the Tatas took over the Okha Salt Works. Okhamandal, the region where <span class="loc">Mithapur</span> is situated, was an undeveloped and desolate place where many kingdoms and civilisations had thrived in the past. <span class="loc">Mithapur</span>, privately owned by Tata Chemicals, is part of the 5,398-acres of freehold land obtained in the 1930s from the government of the erstwhile princely state of <span class="loc">Baroda</span>.</p>
