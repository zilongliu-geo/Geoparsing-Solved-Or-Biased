<p>Columbus is a village in <span class="loc">Luna County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, about three miles north of the Mexican border. It is considered a place of historical interest, as the scene of the attack in 1916 by Mexican revolutionary leader Francisco "Pancho" Villa, that caused <span class="loc">America</span> to send 10,000 troops there in the Punitive Mexican Expedition. The population was 1,765 at the 2000 census. Columbus was established in 1891 just across the Mexican border from <span class="loc">Palomas</span>, Chihuahua, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, and named after 15th century explorer Christopher Columbus. In 1902, the village was moved three miles north when the <span class="loc">El Paso</span> and Southwestern Railroad built its <span class="loc">Columbus</span> Station. This Station is now converted into a museum run by the Columbus Historical Society. Around 1905, it was a very small town with a community of a hundred residents, two of those early settlers being Colonel Andrew O. Bailey, and Louis Heller. By this time, Columbus had only one general store, a saloon, and a society inspector. In time, a high school was built, and Perrow G. <span class="loc">Mosely</span> established the Columbus News, which later was renamed as the Columbus Courier. By 1915, the town had seven hundred residents, the <span class="loc">Columbus</span> <span class="loc">State Bank</span> was built, four hotels were constructed, several stores and a Baptist church were also established. At that time, Columbus also possessed rich silver, copper, lead, and zinc deposits.</p>
