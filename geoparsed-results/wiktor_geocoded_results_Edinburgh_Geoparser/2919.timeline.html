  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Buffalo is a town in <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along the <span class="loc">Kanawha River</span>. The population was 1,236 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Buffalo is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Along with numerous sites in the <span class="per">Kanawha</span> River Valley, Buffalo was originally settled by waves of ancient cultures of prehistoric indigenous peoples. Clovis points indicate the presence of inhabitants <span class="date">more than 10,000 years ago</span>. One of the last cultures, that of the Fort Ancient people, had a few villages such as <span class="per">Buffalo</span> and <span class="per">Marmet</span> that survived into the time of European exploration. Archaeologists have found European trade items among Fort Ancient artifacts. Historic tribes such as the <span class="loc">Huron</span>, from the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> region, and the Conoy (also spelled <span class="per">Conois</span> and <span class="per">Kanawha</span>) were driven out of the central valley by <span class="per">Iroquois</span>' invading from their base in present-day western <span class="loc">New York</span>. Many of the Conoy by the early 17th century had resettled on the west side of the <span class="loc">Chesapeake</span> Bay and below the <span class="loc">Potomac River</span>. After <span class="date">decades</span> of encroachment by English colonists, surviving Conoy (also called <span class="loc">Piscataway</span> by then) went north to <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and allied with the <span class="per">Susquehannock</span> and <span class="per">Iroquois</span>.</p><br><br>
