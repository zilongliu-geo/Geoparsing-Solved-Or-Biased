<p><span class="loc">Buxton</span> is a spa town in <span class="loc">Derbyshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It has the highest elevation of any market town in <span class="loc">England</span>. Close to the county boundary with <span class="loc">Cheshire</span> to the west and <span class="loc">Staffordshire</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Buxton</span> is described as "the gateway to the Peak District National Park". A municipal borough until 1974, <span class="loc">Buxton</span> was then merged with other localities lying primarily to the north, including <span class="loc">Glossop</span>, to form the local government district and borough of <span class="loc">High Peak</span> within the <span class="loc">county of Derbyshire</span>. Economically, <span class="loc">Buxton</span> is within the sphere of influence of <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>. <span class="loc">Buxton</span> is home to <span class="loc">Poole's Cavern</span>, an extensive limestone cavern open to the public, and St Ann's Well, fed by the geothermal spring bottled and sold internationally by Buxton Mineral Water Company. Also in the town is the Buxton Opera House, which hosts several music and theatre festivals each year. The <span class="loc">Devonshire</span> Campus of the University of Derby is housed in one of the town's historic buildings. <span class="loc">Buxton</span> is twinned with two other towns: <span class="loc">Oignies</span> in <span class="loc">France</span> and <span class="loc">Bad Nauheim</span> in <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The Romans developed a settlement known as Aquae Arnemetiae (or the spa of the goddess of the grove). The discovery of coins indicates that the Romans were in <span class="loc">Buxton</span> throughout their occupation. The origins of the town's name are uncertain. It may be derived from the Old English for <span class="loc">Buck Stone</span> or for <span class="loc">Rocking Stone</span>. The town grew in importance in the late 18th century when it was developed by the Dukes of <span class="loc">Devonshire</span>, with a resurgence a century later as the Victorians were drawn to the reputed healing properties of the waters.</p>
