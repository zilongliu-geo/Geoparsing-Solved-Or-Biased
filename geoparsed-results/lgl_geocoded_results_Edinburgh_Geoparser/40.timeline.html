  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>80-year-old killed in <span class="loc">Arlington</span> by neighbor backing up. An 80-year-old woman was killed this morning in <span class="loc">Arlington</span> when a neighbor accidentally hit her while backing out of a driveway. The woman was walking the 3800 block of <span class="loc">Silkwood Trail</span> in <span class="loc">South Arlington</span> about 7 a.m. when the collission occured, said <span class="per">Tiara Ellis</span>, an Arlington spokeswoman. She was struck by an SUV driven by a female neighbor. The driver was leaving to take her 15-year-old son to school, <span class="per">Ellis</span> said, when she felt resistance while backing out of the driveway. After pulling the car forward, she saw the 80-year-old. The son called 911. <span class="per">Ellis</span> said the driver told police that while she'd seen the elderly woman walking in the neighborhood before, she didn't see her when she started backing out of the driveway <span class="date">today</span>. Poor visibility related to the rain may have been a factor, police said. Police are still investigating, but no criminal charges are expected. “It looks like it was just an unfortunate accident,” <span class="per">Ellis</span> said.</p><br><br>
