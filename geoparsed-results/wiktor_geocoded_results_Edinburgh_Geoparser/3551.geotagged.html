<p>Alameda was a city in <span class="loc">Bannock County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Alameda was established as a village in 1924 at the consolidation of the villages of <span class="loc">Fairview</span> and <span class="loc">North Pocatello</span> which were platted on the northern boundary of the town of Pocatello in 1911 and 1914 respectively. New commercial and residential development in Alameda occurred in part as a result of its proximity to Pocatello and to a greater degree its location on the Yellowstone Highway (later designated <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 91), one of <span class="loc">Idaho</span>'s first designated highways. By 1930 the village exceeded its predessor villages' 1920 population by 144%. In just under 40 years of history, the village became <span class="loc">Idaho</span>'s 11th most populous City. It was consolidated with Pocatello in 1962 with the support of its mayor, George V. Hansen. Another nearby city, <span class="loc">Chubbuck</span>, opposed a similar merger and remained a separate municipality. Among its other businesses, Alameda had four pharmacies: Grand Central Pharmacy (300 block of Jefferson), Poleline Drug (Poleline Road), Alameda Pharmacy (375 <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span>) and Hiway Drug (320 <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span>).</p>
