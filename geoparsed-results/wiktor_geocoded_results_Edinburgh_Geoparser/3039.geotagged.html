<p><span class="loc">El Cajon</span> (/ɛlkəˈhoʊn/; Spanish: [elkaˈxon]) is a city in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Nestled in a valley surrounded by mountains, the city has acquired the nickname of "The Big Box". Its name originated similarly, from the Spanish phrase "el cajón", which means "the box" or "the drawer." <span class="loc">El Cajon</span>, the Spanish words for "the big box", was first recorded on September 10, 1821, as an alternative name for sitio rancho Santa Mónica, describing the "boxed in" nature of the valley in which it sat. The name appeared on maps in 1873 and 1875 as shortened to just "Cajon" until the modern town developed where the post office was named "Elcajon." In 1905, the name was once again expanded to "<span class="loc">El Cajon</span>" when <span class="loc">California</span> banker and historian, Zoeth Skinner Eldredge, insisted that the words be separated. <span class="loc">El Cajon</span> is located at 32°47′54″N 116°57′36″W (32.798300, -116.960055). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 14.4 square miles (37 km2), all land. It is bordered by <span class="loc">San Diego</span> and <span class="loc">La Mesa</span> on the west, <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> on the south, <span class="loc">Santee</span> on the north, and unincorporated <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span> on the east.
