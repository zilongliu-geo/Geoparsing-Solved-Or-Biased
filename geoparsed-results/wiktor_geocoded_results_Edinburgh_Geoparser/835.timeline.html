  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Manchester</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Clay County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the seat of its county and the home of a minimum- and medium-security federal prison. The city's population was 1,255 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town was founded to be the seat of the newly formed <span class="org">Clay Co.</span> in <span class="date">1807</span> on a 10-acre (4.0 ha) parcel near the Lower Goose Creek Salt Works. The county court stipulated that the town be named <span class="loc">Greenville</span> in honor of the War-of-1812 general who gave the county its name. The <span class="loc">Greenville</span> in <span class="loc">Muhlenberg County</span> had already preëmpted that name, however, and it was changed to "Manchester" in <span class="date">December</span>. There was a local legend in the town that this was in honor of the hometown of <span class="per">Gen. Garrard</span>'s second wife <span class="per">Lucy Lees</span>, but Rennick points out that she was born well after the naming of the city. He opines that it is more likely that the local businessmen simply wanted a name evocative of the English industrial success. <span class="loc">Manchester</span> is located at 37°9′10″N 83°45′48″W (37.152818, -83.763403). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.5 square miles (3.9 km2), all land.</p><br><br>
