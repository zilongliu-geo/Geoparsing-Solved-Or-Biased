  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Pakistan</span> to restore chief justice ousted by <span class="per">Musharraf</span>. <span class="loc">ISLAMABAD</span>, <span class="loc">Pakistan</span> â€” <span class="loc">Pakistan</span> agreed <span class="date">Monday</span> to reinstate a fired chief justice, a move that will help defuse a political crisis that has sparked street battles and raised fears of instability in the country at a time of surging Islamist violence. Opposition leaders and lawyers had vowed to sit-in at the parliament <span class="date">later Monday</span> until <span class="per">Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</span>, known for his independence and willingness to challenge authority, was reinstated. The capital has been barricaded and scores of extra police brought in amid fears of violence. In a dawn address to the nation that capped a night of high drama, <span class="per">Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani</span> announced <span class="per">Chaudhry</span> would be sworn in on <span class="date">March 21</span>, the day the current chief justice was due to retire. The speech triggered scenes of jubilation outside <span class="per">Chaudhry</span>'s home in the capital, <span class="loc">Islamabad</span>. <span class="per">Gilani</span> also ordered all lawyers and political activists arrested over <span class="date">the past week</span> to be freed immediately. The concession came as thousands of protesters led by <span class="per">Nawaz Sharif</span>, the head of the largest opposition party and a longtime foe of President <span class="per">Asif Ali Zardari</span>, were traveling to <span class="loc">Islamabad</span> to join the planned sit-in. Sharif joined the convoy after ignoring a house arrest order in his hometown of <span class="loc">Lahore</span> in <span class="loc">Punjab</span>, where his supporters fought running battles with police. "This is a victory for the people of this country," said <span class="loc">Baz</span> <span class="per">Mohammad Kakar</span>, a leader of the lawyers' movement. "<span class="per">Chaudhry</span> is the first chief justice in the history of <span class="loc">Pakistan</span> who has proved himself to be a judge for the people, as a chief justice for the people." Former President <span class="per">Pervez Musharraf</span> fired <span class="per">Chaudhry</span>, 60, in <span class="date">2007</span> after he took up cases challenging the leader's rule, sparking a wave of protests that helped force <span class="per">Musharraf</span> from power in <span class="date">2008</span>. <span class="per">Musharraf</span>'s successor, <span class="per">Zardari</span>, pledged to reinstate <span class="per">Chaudhry</span> within <span class="date">30 days</span> of taking office, but reneged on the promise, apparently fearing the justice might examine a deal that he and his wife, slain politician <span class="per">Benazir Bhutto</span>, struck with <span class="per">Musharraf</span> to grant the pair immunity from prosecution over alleged corruption cases. Lawyers and civil rights activists have remained committed to the cause of <span class="per">Chaudhry</span>'s reinstatement, believing it was a vital first step in getting an independent judiciary in <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>.</p><br><br>
