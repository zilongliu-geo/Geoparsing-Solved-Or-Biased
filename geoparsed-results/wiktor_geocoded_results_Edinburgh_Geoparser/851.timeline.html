  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Matara</span> (Metera) is an archaeological site in <span class="loc">Eritrea</span>. Situated a few kilometers south of <span class="loc">Senafe</span>, it was a major city in the DÊ¿mt and Aksumite Kingdoms. Since Eritrean independence, the <span class="loc">National Museum</span> of <span class="loc">Eritrea</span> has petitioned the Ethiopian government to return artifacts removed from the site. However, the efforts have thus far been rebuffed. <span class="loc">Matara</span> is the name of both a small village and an important archaeological site in <span class="loc">Eritrea</span>. The latter is located some 136 kilometers southeast of the capital <span class="loc">Asmara</span>, just past <span class="loc">Senafe</span> on the road leading south to the border with the <span class="loc">northern Tigray Region</span> of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. The archaeological site already has yielded evidence of several levels of habitation, including at least two different major cities, covering <span class="date">more than 1000 years</span>. The topmost layers are associated with the Aksumite Empire and date from the fourth to the eighth <span class="date">centuries</span>. This city was allied with or part of the powerful trading empire centered in the capital, <span class="loc">Aksum</span>, to the southwest. It appears that <span class="loc">Matara</span> was one of a string of cities along the trade route that ran from <span class="loc">Aksum</span> to its port city, Adulis, whose extensive ruins, surveyed but largely excavated, are in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Zula</span>, southeast of <span class="loc">Massawa</span> on the <span class="loc">Red Sea</span> coast. Keskese is located 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) north of <span class="loc">Matara</span>.</p><br><br>
