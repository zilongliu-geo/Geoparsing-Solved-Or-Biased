  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Luna</span> is a third class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">La Union</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 35,380 people. <span class="per">Luna</span> is politically subdivided into 40 barangays. <span class="per">Luna</span>'s poblacion (town center) consists of the four barangays: Victoria, <span class="loc">Salcedo</span>, <span class="loc">Alcala</span>, and <span class="loc">Magallanes</span>. <span class="per">Luna</span> was once called "Namacpacan", which is an Ilocano word meaning “one who feeds". As early as <span class="date">1587</span>, Namacpacan was recorded as a visita (satellite mission, whose church is manned by non-resident clergy based in the cabecera) of <span class="loc">Purao</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Balaoan</span>). It was a settlement along the camino real (national road) from <span class="loc">Vigan</span> to Manila, and travellers stopped there to refresh themselves. Since restaurants was not yet in vogue, local families offered the travellers food and lodging, hence the name. On <span class="date">18 October 1906</span>, during the terms of <span class="per">Governor Joaquin Luna</span> and Mayor Primitivo Resurrección Novicio, the town was renamed <span class="per">Luna</span> by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 1543. It was the first town that altered its name since the creation of the province in <span class="date">1850</span>. The change was to honour the famous <span class="org">Luna brothers</span>: Revolutionary General <span class="per">Antonio</span> and <span class="per">Spoliarium</span> painter Juan; their mother, Doña Laureana Novicio <span class="per">Luna</span>, was a native of Namacpacan.</p><br><br>
