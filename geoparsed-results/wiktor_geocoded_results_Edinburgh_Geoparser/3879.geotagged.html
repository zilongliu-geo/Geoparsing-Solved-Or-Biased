<p><span class="loc">Linton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Stockton Township</span>, <span class="loc">Greene County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,413 at the 2010 census. A coal mining city, it is located southeast of <span class="loc">Terre Haute</span>. The current mayor is John Wilkes. <span class="loc">Linton</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Bloomington</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Linton</span> was essentially founded around the entrepreneuring of John W. Wines, who first sold goods in the <span class="loc">Linton</span> area, briefly in 1831. Although he would later relocate to <span class="loc">Fairplay</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, he returned and opened a general store in <span class="loc">Linton</span> in 1837. He would later build a small horse mill as well as a tannery. The city itself was officially chartered and named in June 1850, laid out by Hannah E. Osborn and Isaac V. Coddington. In the late 19th century, small underground coal mines began to appear near and almost inside the city and the population expanded rapidly. At the turn of the 20th century, the population was larger than it is today. At one point in the 1920s, there were at least 35 drinking establishments and an equal number of churches.</p>
