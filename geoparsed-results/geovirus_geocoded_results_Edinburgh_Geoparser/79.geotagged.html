<p>The Church of Scientology in <span class="loc">southern California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> have received several envelopes containing a white powder which authorities say ended up being wheat germ and corn starch. Authorities had to evacuate at least one building in <span class="loc">Tustin</span> and shut down a street in <span class="loc">Glendale</span> while they examined the substance. Envelopes were also sent to <span class="loc">Hollywood</span>, <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> Valley and <span class="loc">Santa Monica</span> locations. "Initial field testing by LAPD indicates the powder is harmless. However, further testing will be conducted. We will also work to assess what threat, if any, was associated with the mailings and determine whether any federal statutes were violated," said Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the FBI. The envelopes, which we were sent through the <span class="loc">United States</span> Postal Service, targeted 10 different Churches throughout southern <span class="loc">California</span>. Some also contained threats. The Church has not issued a statement regarding the incidents and no one has yet claimed responsibility for sending the envelopes. This comes just before a scheduled protest which an Internet group called 'Anonymous' has organized, set to take place on February 10 at Church locations across the globe. According to the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> Times, authorities stated that there was no evidence connecting the mailings to the Internet group. On a Project Chanology website, 'Anonymous' made a statement about the senders of the powder under the heading 'To the Public and Anybody Investigating the Anthrax Hoax': "They may not even be Anonymous (they might even have been a plant by the "Church" of Scientology as black propaganda); we do not know, and by the nature of our organization, cannot know."</p>
