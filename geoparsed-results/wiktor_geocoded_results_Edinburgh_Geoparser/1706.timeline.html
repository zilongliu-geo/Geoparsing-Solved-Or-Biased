The town was at one time called <span class="loc">Oxford</span>, then <span class="loc">New Marlborough</span>, but was incorporated in <span class="date">1776</span> as <span class="per">Marlborough</span>. Many of the settlers were from <span class="loc">Marlborough</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, which had been named for <span class="per">John Churchill</span>, 1st <span class="per">Duke of Marlborough</span>, in the late 17th century. Land was set off in <span class="date">1815</span> to create the town of Troy. There was once an important granite industry here. Stone from <span class="per">Marlborough</span> quarries was used in buildings in <span class="loc">Boston</span>, at the <span class="org">College</span> of the <span class="loc">Holy Cross</span> in <span class="loc">Worcester</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, and locally in the Frost Free Library.
