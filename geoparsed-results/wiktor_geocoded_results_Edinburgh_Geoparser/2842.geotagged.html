<p><span class="loc">Northampton</span> /nɔːˈθæmptən/ is the county town of <span class="loc">Northamptonshire</span> in the East Midlands of <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies on the <span class="loc">River Nene</span>, about 67 miles (108 km) north-west of <span class="loc">London</span> and 50 miles (80 km) south-east of <span class="loc">Birmingham</span>. One of the largest towns in the <span class="loc">UK</span>, <span class="loc">Northampton</span> had a population of 212,100 in the 2011 census. Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. During the Middle Ages, the town rose to national significance with the establishment of <span class="loc">Northampton</span> Castle, which was an occasional royal residence and regularly hosted the Parliament of <span class="loc">England</span>. Medieval <span class="loc">Northampton</span> had many churches, monasteries and the University of Northampton, which were all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted its first town charter by King Richard I in 1189 and its first mayor was appointed by King John in 1215. The town is also the site of two medieval battles; the Battle of <span class="loc">Northampton</span> (1264) and the second in 1460. <span class="loc">Northampton</span>'s royal connection languished in the modern period; the town supported Parliament (the Roundheads) in the English Civil War, which culminated in King Charles II ordering the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The town also suffered the Great Fire of <span class="loc">Northampton</span> (1675) which destroyed most of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. <span class="loc">Northampton</span> continued to grow following the creation of the <span class="loc">Grand Union Canal</span> and the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, becoming an industrial centre for footwear and leather manufacture.</p>
