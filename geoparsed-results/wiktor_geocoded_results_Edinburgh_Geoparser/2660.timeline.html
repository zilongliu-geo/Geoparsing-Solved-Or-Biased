  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Paria /pəˈriːə/, (rhymes with "Maria") or <span class="loc">Pahreah</span>, is a ghost town on the <span class="loc">Paria River</span> in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in central <span class="loc">Kane County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was inhabited from <span class="date">1870</span> to <span class="date">1929</span>, and later used as a filming location. The area was first settled in <span class="date">1865</span> by a Mormon group led by Peter Shirts. This early settlement was named <span class="loc">Rockhouse</span>, for Shirts's strongly built sandstone house. After the end of the Black Hawk War in <span class="date">1867</span> settlers began to arrive at a rapid pace. Farming produced good crops for <span class="date">several years</span>, but irrigation was very difficult; each spring the surface runoff water was absorbed into the desert soil too quickly to properly water the fields. In <span class="date">1870</span> the residents agreed to move the settlement. They divided in two groups; half the people went about 5 miles (8.0 km) upstream and founded the town of <span class="loc">Pahreah</span>. In <span class="date">1871</span>, <span class="per">John D. Lee</span> came to the Paria area, fleeing investigators of the Mountain Meadows massacre. He constructed a dam and irrigation ditches with the help of many locals and passersby, including members of <span class="per">John Wesley Powell</span>'s second <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> expedition.</p><br><br>
