  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is the easternmost county of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census the population was 53,498. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="per">Charles</span> Town. The county was founded in <span class="date">1801</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is part of the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, <span class="loc">DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was formed from <span class="loc">Berkeley County</span> in <span class="date">1801</span> because the citizens of <span class="loc">southeastern Berkeley county</span> felt they had to travel too far to the county seat of <span class="loc">Martinsburg</span>. <span class="per">Charles Washington</span>, the founder of <span class="per">Charles</span> Town and brother to <span class="loc">George Washington</span> petitioned for a new county to be formed. It was named for <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span>, author of <span class="org">the Declaration of Independence</span> and third President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Virginia previously had a <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, which was lost to form the new state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. Accordingly, in the State records of Virginia, there will be listings for <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> from 1780-1792 and <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> from 1801-1863. Neither is still located in Virginia and despite naming a county after him twice, Virginia no longer has a county named for its hero <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span>. The county was a frequent site of conflict during the civil war, as <span class="org">Union</span> and Confederate lines moved back and forth along the <span class="loc">Shenandoah</span> Valley. Some towns in the county changed hands between the <span class="org">Union</span> and Confederacy over a dozen times, including <span class="per">Charles</span> Town, and especially Harpers Ferry.</p><br><br>
