  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Okruashvili</span>: <span class="per">Saakashvili</span> Greater Threat than <span class="loc">Russia</span>. <span class="per">Irakli Okruashvili</span>, former defense minister, said <span class="loc">Georgia</span> was in a situation wherein removal of <span class="per">President Saakashvili</span> from power “is justified with any humanely method,” as he posed “greater threat” to the country than <span class="loc">Russia</span>. <span class="per">Okruashvili</span>, whose party Movement for <span class="per">United Georgia</span> is part of group of another dozen of opposition parties planning to launch street protest rallies from <span class="date">April 9</span> to demand the President’s resignation, said in a televised interview that he personally had no presidential ambitions. The interview, which was recorded in <span class="loc">Paris</span> on <span class="date">March 24</span>, was aired by late on <span class="date">March 27</span> by the Tbilisi-based Maestro TV, which covers mainly the capital city. <span class="per">Okruashvili</span>, who has received political asylum in <span class="loc">France</span>, was sentenced to 11-year prison term in <span class="loc">Georgia</span> in absentia <span class="date">last year</span>. “After [the <span class="date">August</span>] war politicians should give up manipulating with the issue of restoration of the territorial integrity, especially during the election campaign, because that is an issue, which will be impossible to resolve in next ten or <span class="date">fifteen years</span> in the best case, if not in the next twenty or <span class="date">twenty five years</span>,” he said. <span class="per">Okruashvili</span> said that after the <span class="date">August</span> “military adventure” <span class="per">Saakashvili</span> had “no legitimate right to stay in power.” “I know that the remarks, which I will say <span class="date">now</span> will trigger lots of sharp comments, but I have to say it anyway – this is the case when removal of <span class="per">Saakashvili</span> from power is justifiable with any humanely method. He is <span class="date">today</span> the number one threat for the country and the greater threat than <span class="loc">Russia</span>,” <span class="per">Okruashvili</span> said. He said he did not believe that <span class="loc">Russia</span> was interested in removal of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>’s current leadership and said such rhetoric was part of the authorities’ “propaganda.” “A weak figure [in the Georgian leadership] like <span class="per">Saakashvili</span> is more acceptable for <span class="loc">Russia</span>,” <span class="per">Okruashvili</span> said. “<span class="per">Saakashvili</span>, who has almost no western support and no one in the west is even saying hello to him, is more acceptable for <span class="loc">Russia</span>. New leader in <span class="loc">Georgia</span> means new hope… One thing is clear: <span class="per">Saakashvili</span> is a headache for both the Georgian people and for the international community.” “If in <span class="date">2003</span> [the Rose Revolution] was called the democratic revolution, than <span class="date">today</span> too the same right exists to repeat it; is there enough resources or not for that purpose, that’s another issue,” he continued. “It is up to the Georgian people, it is our duty to maximally painlessly remove <span class="per">Saakashvili</span> from power. How that will be achieved? No one has the answer on that <span class="date">today</span>… A right vision, a joint action plan on where we are moving is required here, instead of changing plans every day. If there is a clear vision and joint plan [by the opposition] it will be achieved.” “Removal of <span class="per">Saakashvili</span> will be a painful process and it won’t be able to achieve in <span class="date">a day</span>; it won’t happen on <span class="date">April 9</span>,” he said. <span class="per">Okruashvili</span> said that unity of the opposition was the only “medicine that will help to removal Saakashvili.” “We [the opposition leaders] should forget all the personal regrets and mutual confrontation that we might had in <span class="date">the past</span>,” he said and added his party’s relation with the one of former parliamentary chairperson <span class="per">Nino Burjanadze</span>’s was a good example of that. He said that in <span class="date">2007</span> when he was arrested, <span class="per">Burjanadze</span>, who was the parliamentary chairperson at that time welcomed his arrested and “made a speech in the Parliament which amounted to accusing me in the state treason; but <span class="date">today</span> I have no problem in relations with <span class="per">Burjanadze</span>, because we will fail to achieve our joint goal without forgetting personal regrets of the past.”</p><br><br>
