  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Jamestown</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cloud County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 286. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was founded in <span class="date">1878</span>, and was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1883</span>. It was named for either <span class="per">Senator James Pomeroy</span>, or <span class="per">James P. Pomeroy</span>, a railroad official. A post office was opened in <span class="loc">Alva</span> (an extinct town) in <span class="date">1871</span>, but it was moved to <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> in <span class="date">1878</span>. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was located on the Missouri Pacific Railroad. History repeated itself on <span class="date">January 28, 2000</span> when another fire consumed several buildings on Main Street and spread to the city hall. And again, history repeated itself as the town rebuilt. Mayor <span class="per">Judy Hill</span> stated, "A fire like that can destroy a small town, but instead it ignited a community spirit here." In <span class="date">a few days</span>, <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was having town meetings to make plans for <span class="date">the future</span>. The funeral home in <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was selected as the temporary city office and meeting place. More than 50 people (out of a population of 307 at the time) came to town meetings there and the citizens organized into several committees to begin work.</p><br><br>
