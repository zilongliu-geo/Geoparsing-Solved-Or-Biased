On April 11, 1996, a <span class="loc">Montana</span> Rail Link train carrying chlorine derailed near <span class="loc">Alberton</span>. Three hundred fifty people were injured by chlorine inhalation. One thousand people were evacuated from <span class="loc">Alberton</span> and from <span class="loc">Frenchtown</span>.
