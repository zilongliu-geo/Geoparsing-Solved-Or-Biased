<p><span class="loc">Chamba</span> is a town and nagar panchayat in <span class="loc">Tehri</span> <span class="loc">Garhwal district</span> in the state of Uttarakhand, <span class="loc">India</span>. It is situated at a junction of roads connecting <span class="loc">Mussoorie</span> and <span class="loc">Rishikesh</span> with the <span class="loc">Tehri</span> Dam reservoir and New <span class="loc">Tehri</span>. Its nearby tourist places are <span class="loc">Dhanaulti</span>, Surkanda Devi Temple, Ranichauri, New <span class="loc">Tehri</span>, and <span class="loc">Kanatal</span>, halfway between <span class="loc">Chamba</span> and <span class="loc">Dhanaulti</span>. About 50 km from Mussoorie, the small hill town of <span class="loc">Chamba</span>, Uttaranchal, is another of those destinations yet unknown to most tourists and therefore unspoilt and fresh like a daisy for the lucky few who venture out seeking new places to explore and enjoy. <span class="loc">Chamba</span> is situated at an altitude of 1600m above sea level. There are pleasant forests of pine and deodar trees, with some good views. Unlike Mussoorie, this place is fairly quiet and picturesque, hence an excellent place to relax and wash off the city blues. One can reach <span class="loc">Chamba</span> in about 7-8 hrs from <span class="loc">Delhi</span> via <span class="loc">Hardwar</span>, <span class="loc">Rishikesh</span> and <span class="loc">Narendranagar</span> (290 km). One can also combine a stay at <span class="loc">Chamba</span> with a visit to <span class="loc">Mussoorie</span> or Dhanolti and reach via Dehradun, Mussoorie and Dhanolti.</p>
