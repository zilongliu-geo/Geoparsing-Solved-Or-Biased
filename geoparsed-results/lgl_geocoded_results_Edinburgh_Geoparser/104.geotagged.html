<p><span class="loc">Ohio</span> to review if Wal-Mart reneged on tax deal . <span class="loc">COLUMBUS</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span> (AP) â€” Economic development officials in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> say they will check whether Wal-Mart Stores Inc. violated terms of a tax agreement by closing an optical lab near <span class="loc">Columbus</span>. <span class="loc">Ohio</span> gave the world's largest retailer a $1.8 million job-creation tax credit in 2001 on the condition that the company create and maintain jobs there. Wal-Mart on Friday announced that it will close the lab, cutting 650 jobs. The lab makes eyewear for vision centers in Wal-Mart stores. Kelly Schlissberg, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Development, says the agency is reviewing its agreement with Wal-Mart to determine if the state can recoup money. A message seeking comment was left Saturday for a Wal-Mart spokesman.</p>
