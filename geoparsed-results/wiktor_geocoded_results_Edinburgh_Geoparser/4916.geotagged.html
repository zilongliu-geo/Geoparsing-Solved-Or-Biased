<p><span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 9,670. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Rockwell City</span>. <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> was formed on January 15, 1851 from open land originally named <span class="loc">Fox County</span>. It was renamed in 1853 after the seventh <span class="loc">US</span> Vice President secessionist John C. Calhoun. When the tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad were laid through the county in 1870, the county seat was moved from <span class="loc">Lake City</span> to <span class="loc">Rockwell City</span>. The first train reached <span class="loc">Rockwell City</span> on August 7, 1882 and the population count doubled in the same year. The first courthouse, built of wood, burned to the ground in 1884 and the county government moved into a nearby hotel. In 1913, the current courthouse was built. On July 6, 1893, <span class="loc">Pomeroy</span> was struck by a tornado that measured F5 on the Fujita scale. With a damage path 500 yards (460 m) wide and 55 miles (89 km) long, the tornado destroyed about 80% of the homes in <span class="loc">Pomeroy</span>. The tornado killed 71 people and injured 200.</p>
