  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> is an historic entertainment center and present day <span class="loc">district of Tijuana</span>, <span class="loc">Baja California</span>, at the southeastern end of the <span class="loc">Centro borough</span>. The <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Tourist Complex formed in <span class="date">the late 1920s</span> along <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Boulevard when a road was built that led from the historic Rio Zone to a natural hot springs two miles up the Tijuana River Valley. Paramount icons of <span class="loc">Tijuana</span> developed in <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> such as the <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> <span class="per">Casino</span> and <span class="per">Hotel</span> and the <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Racetrack. <span class="date">Today</span> <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> is one of Tijuana's paramount tourist centers and the location of some of the city's most affluent neighborhoods. The hot springs around which the <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Tourist Complex grew was a well known location and prior to major development, was the site of small hotels and cabins. With the development of the casino and resort in <span class="date">1928</span>, <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> developed as a premier tourist attraction that drew the likes of <span class="per">Charles Chaplin</span>, <span class="per">Rita Hayworth</span>, and <span class="per">Laurel</span> and <span class="per">Hardy</span>. The resort was designed in a Mexican and Californian colonial style, fitted with gardens, its own airstrip, bungalows, minarets, baths, and the casino and hotel itself. The <span class="org">Agua Caliente Club</span> was a golf course adjacent to the city that later became the <span class="org">Tijuana Country Club</span>. In <span class="date">1930</span> the golf course had its first PGA Tour event at the <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Open, won by <span class="per">Gene Sarazen</span>.</p><br><br>
