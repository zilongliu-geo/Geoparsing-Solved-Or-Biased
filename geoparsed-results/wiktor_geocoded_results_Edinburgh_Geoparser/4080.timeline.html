  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Altoona</span> is a city in Eau <span class="loc">Claire County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,056 as of <span class="date">July 1, 2013</span>. The city is a railroad terminal on the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific Railroad. The settlement of <span class="loc">Altoona</span> began in <span class="date">1881</span> when the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="per">St. Paul</span>, <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span> and <span class="loc">Omaha Railway</span> selected the site for a new terminal to replace the overcrowded existing terminal in <span class="loc">Eau Claire</span>. The railroad had originally planned to put the new terminal in <span class="loc">Fall Creek</span>, but the city of <span class="loc">Eau Claire</span> lobbied for a site closer to the existing one, and representatives from <span class="loc">Eau Claire</span> and the railroad walked the tracks from <span class="loc">Fall Creek</span> to <span class="loc">Eau Claire</span> to determine a suitable site. When the location of present-day <span class="loc">Altoona</span> - approximately three miles east of the existing <span class="loc">Eau Claire</span> terminal - was found to have sufficient flat land and access to water (via the <span class="loc">Eau Claire River</span>), the railroad began construction of the new terminal and the community of "<span class="loc">East Eau Claire</span>" was platted in <span class="date">October</span>. Residents began moving into the community in <span class="date">early 1882</span> and the railroad terminal became operational in <span class="date">May</span> of <span class="date">that year</span>. However, confusion between the "<span class="loc">Eau Claire</span>" and "<span class="loc">East Eau Claire</span>" stations quickly caused the railroad to rename the new terminal "Altoona" on <span class="date">October 14, 1882</span>. <span class="loc">Altoona</span> was incorporated as a city on <span class="date">April 5, 1887</span>.</p><br><br>
