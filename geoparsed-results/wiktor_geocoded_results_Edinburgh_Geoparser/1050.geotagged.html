<p><span class="loc">Marion</span> is a census-designated place in <span class="loc">Summit County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 685, according to the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Marion</span> is a small farming community located about 40 miles (64 km) east of <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span> and 18 miles (29 km) east of <span class="loc">Park City</span> in the upper <span class="loc">Kamas</span> Valley, part of the Wasatch Back region of <span class="loc">Utah</span>. Lying 2 miles (3.2 km) due north of the <span class="loc">city of Kamas</span> on <span class="loc">Utah</span> State Route 32, <span class="loc">Marion</span> has always been closely associated with <span class="loc">Kamas</span>. Approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) to the north, across the <span class="loc">Weber River</span>, is the <span class="loc">city of Oakley</span>. The area that is now <span class="loc">Marion</span> was used in the 1860s by rancher Samuel P. Hoyt, whose 600â€“700 head of cattle grazed over most of Marion's land. The settlement itself was founded in the mid-1870s and was originally named "Morrell" after William Morrell, who built the first house. A large portion of the early settlers were Danish American immigrants, and the community was also often called "<span class="loc">Denmark</span>". The name <span class="loc">Marion</span> has been credited to two different sources: Francis Marion Lyman, who, as President of the Quorum of the <span class="loc">Twelve Apostles</span> of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, organized the first ward in the area in 1909, and Marion Myrick Sorensen, who settled here with her first husband in 1882. The Marion precinct first appeared under that name in the 1900 census.</p>
