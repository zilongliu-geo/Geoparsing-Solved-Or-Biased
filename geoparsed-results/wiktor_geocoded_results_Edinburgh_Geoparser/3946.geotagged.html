<p>Picton, <span class="loc">Lennox</span> and <span class="loc">Nueva</span> (Spanish: Islas Picton, <span class="loc">Nueva</span> y <span class="loc">Lennox</span>) form a group of three islands (and their islets) on the extreme south of <span class="loc">South America</span>, in the Chilean commune of <span class="loc">Cabo de Hornos</span> in Antártica <span class="loc">Chilena Province</span>, <span class="loc">Magallanes</span> and Antártica <span class="loc">Chilena Region</span>. In the <span class="loc">Tierra del Fuego</span> archipelago, they lie east of <span class="loc">Navarino Island</span> and are separated from the Argentine part of <span class="loc">Isla Grande</span> in the north by the Beagle Channel. They have an area of 170.4 km2 (<span class="loc">Lennox</span>), 105.4 km2 (<span class="loc">Picton</span>), 120.0 km2 (<span class="loc">Nueva</span>). Near to the islands are the islets Snipe, Augustus, Becasses, Luff, Jorge, <span class="loc">Hermanos</span>, <span class="loc">Solitario</span>, <span class="loc">Gardiner</span>, Terhalten, Sesambre and others. Robert Fitzroy and Phillip Parker King called the island "Picton" in honour of Thomas Picton, first British governor of <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> in the West-Indies. <span class="loc">Lennox</span> was discovered 1624 by Dutch Admiral Schapenham and named Terhalten, after the officer who first sighted it. It was renamed later by Fitzroy and Parker King. From the signing of the Boundary treaty of 1881 between <span class="loc">Chile</span> and <span class="loc">Argentina</span> to 1904, the islands were considered in <span class="loc">Chile</span> and <span class="loc">Argentina</span> as Chilean Territories.</p>
