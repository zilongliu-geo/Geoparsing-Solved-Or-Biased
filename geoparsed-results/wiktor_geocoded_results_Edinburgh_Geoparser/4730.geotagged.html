<p><span class="loc">Bolivia</span> (/bəˈlɪviə/; Spanish: [boˈliβja]; Quechua: Buliwya [bʊlɪwja]; <span class="loc">Aymara</span>: Wuliwya [wʊlɪwja]; Guarani: Volívia [ʋoˈliʋja]), officially known as the Plurinational State of <span class="loc">Bolivia</span> (Spanish: Estado Plurinacional de <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>), is a landlocked country located in western-central <span class="loc">South America</span>. It is bordered to the north and east by <span class="loc">Brazil</span>, to the southeast by <span class="loc">Paraguay</span>, to the south by <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, to the southwest by <span class="loc">Chile</span>, and to the northwest by <span class="loc">Peru</span>. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with its largest city and principal economic centers located in the <span class="loc">Altiplano</span>. Before Spanish colonization, the <span class="loc">Andean region</span> of <span class="loc">Bolivia</span> was part of the Inca Empire, while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish conquistadors arriving from <span class="loc">Cuzco</span> and Asunción took control of the region in the 16th century. During most of the Spanish colonial period, <span class="loc">Bolivia</span> was known as Upper <span class="loc">Peru</span> and administered by the <span class="loc">Royal Court</span> of <span class="loc">Charcas</span>. <span class="loc">Spain</span> built its empire in great part upon the silver that was extracted from <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>'s mines.</p>
