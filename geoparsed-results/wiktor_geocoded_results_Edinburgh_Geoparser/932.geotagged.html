<p>Tabor is a city in <span class="loc">Fremont County</span> and extends northward into <span class="loc">Mills County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. The population was 1,040 at the 2010 census. Tabor is located at 40°53′48″N 95°40′21″W (40.896605, -95.672368). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.29 square miles (3.34 km2), all of it land. In 1852 the <span class="loc">city of Tabor</span> was founded by several Christian clergymen, who were also active abolitionists, (George Gaston, Samuel A. Adams, and Rev. John Todd) and their families. They chose to settle in what is now Tabor in order to found a Christian college, which eventually became Tabor College. The founders "were impressed with this high location and mutually selected the name "Tabor" after the Biblical name of <span class="loc">Mount Tabor</span>, a mountain near <span class="loc">Nazareth</span>, the town of Jesus' childhood." In the 1850s the abolitionist John Brown kept a store of weapons in Tabor, and met here with other supporters to plan his raids in Kansas and Virginia, including the Raid on Harpers Ferry. The town was the home of many abolitionists, including John Todd, a 'conductor' on the Underground Railroad and co-founder of Tabor College. Tabor College was located in the city from 1853 to 1927 before it closed its doors for financial reasons. The college's buildings housed German P.O.W.s during World War II. The only building remaining from the college has now been subdivided into apartments.</p>
