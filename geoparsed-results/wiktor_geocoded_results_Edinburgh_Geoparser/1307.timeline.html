  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 54,876. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Abingdon</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is part of the Kingsport–Bristol–Bristol, <span class="loc">TN-VA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area, commonly known as the "Tri-Cities" region. For <span class="date">thousands of years</span>, indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area. At the time of European encounter, the Chiska had a chief village near what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Saltville</span>, destroyed by the Spaniards in <span class="date">1568</span>. The <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> annexed the region from the Xualae around <span class="date">1671</span>, and ceded it to the <span class="loc">Virginia Colony</span> in <span class="date">1770</span> at the Treaty of <span class="loc">Lochaber</span>. The county was formed by Virginians in <span class="date">1776</span> from <span class="loc">Fincastle County</span>. It was named for <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, who was then commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is among the first geographical regions to be named after the president of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was raided by the <span class="org">Chickamauga</span> <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> during the Cherokee–American wars. In <span class="date">July, 1776</span>, Chief Dragging Canoe led an attack on Black's Fort (renamed <span class="loc">Abingdon</span> in <span class="date">1778</span>). The area remained prone to attack until after <span class="org">Chickamauga</span> leader <span class="per">Bob Benge</span> was finally slain by settlers in <span class="loc">Washington County</span> in <span class="date">1794</span>.</p><br><br>
