<p><span class="loc">Claremont</span> is an incorporated town in <span class="loc">Surry County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 343 at the 2000 census. A granite marker in a circle in the center of town commemorates the landing here on May 5, 1607, of English settlers. Beginning in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, <span class="loc">Claremont</span> was a busy port town on the navigable portion of the <span class="loc">James River</span>, shipping many goods, but especially hogsheads of tobacco. After the Civil War, Willie Allen, who inherited <span class="loc">Claremont</span> Manor, moved to <span class="loc">New York</span> and sold the property. J. Frank Mancha, a <span class="loc">Maryland</span> real estate developer took on the project to develop, subdivide and colonize a new town there in 1879. Incorporated in 1886, the town of <span class="loc">Claremont</span> became the eastern terminus of the new Atlantic and Danville Railway (A&amp;D), a narrow gauge railroad, which was completed to a point near Emporia called <span class="loc">James River</span> Junction, where it connected with a standard gauge track towards Danville. Unfortunately for <span class="loc">Claremont</span>, the A&amp;D decided to connect its western leg with a new eastern terminus in <span class="loc">West Norfolk</span> on the harbor of <span class="loc">Hampton Roads</span>, and the line to <span class="loc">Claremont</span>, which was never standard-gauged, went into semi-abandonment. After some use for lumber transport, the rails were removed in the 1930s.</p>
