  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Las Lajas</span> ("The Flagstones") is a town in <span class="loc">Neuquén Province</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, and the capital of <span class="org">Picunches Department</span>. The town, at an altitude of 900 metres (3,000 ft) above mean sea level, is located on the right shore of <span class="loc">Agrio</span> River at the Andean foothills. National Routes 22 and 40 intersect in this area of the central <span class="loc">Neuquén Province</span>. The Cuchillo Curá range, considered the most important underground ecosystem in <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, extends approximately 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from <span class="loc">Las Lajas</span>. Before the Araucanization of <span class="loc">Patagonia</span>, <span class="loc">Las Lajas</span> was originally populated by <span class="per">Pehuenche</span> and <span class="per">Picunche</span> natives. In <span class="date">1788</span>, the first expedition into the territory, under the command <span class="per">Francisco Esquivel</span> y <span class="loc">Aldao</span>, reached <span class="loc">Las Lajas</span>. In <span class="date">1882</span>, commander <span class="per">Ortega</span> established a fort for the Argentinian Army. The town was established on <span class="date">8 February 1897</span>, by <span class="loc">General Enrique Godoy</span>, the <span class="org">Argentinian Army</span>'s 4th Division commander. To take possession of the region and protect the inhabitants from the natives, the town became the headquarters of the 8th and 9th Cavalry Regiments. It was named "<span class="loc">Las Lajas</span>" after the creek <span class="loc">Las Lajitas</span>, whose bed soil is mainly composed of the stones. <span class="per">Governor Alsina</span> and the inhabitants of the town requested to move the National Territory's capital from <span class="loc">Chos Malal</span> to <span class="loc">Las Lajas</span>. The capital was ultimately moved to <span class="loc">Neuquén city</span> in <span class="date">1902</span>. The town received its current status of second-category municipality in <span class="date">1967</span>.</p><br><br>
