  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is a former unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Benton County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> and much of its surrounding township, <span class="per">Alexander</span>, is <span class="date">now</span> covered by water, as part of the <span class="per">Harry S. Truman</span> Dam and Reservoir. It was located about seven miles south of <span class="loc">Warsaw</span> just west of Route 83. The <span class="org">Fairfield Public Use Area</span> is on the shore near the location of the former community. One of the earliest residents of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> was <span class="per">Judge George T. Alexander</span>, a pioneer in <span class="loc">Missouri</span> since <span class="date">1816</span>, who built the town's covered bridge, and operated its mill. He arrived in <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> in <span class="date">1832</span> and purchased an Indian village for $60. He obtained a ferry license for the <span class="loc">Pomme de Terre River</span> at that spot in <span class="date">1836</span> and was elected as a county judge. The township was named for <span class="per">Alexander</span>. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> in <span class="date">1962</span> still had the remains of the old mill and the pillars from the old covered bridge. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> had a post office with the town bar in the same building, side by side. There also was an old country church on the north end of town and a bait shop in the center of town with a walkway to the banks of the river bank and the docks. There was a small local country store with food, hardware and clothing, as well as a gasoline station with a repair garage.</p><br><br>
