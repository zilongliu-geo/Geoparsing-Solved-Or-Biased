<p>Phoenix is a city in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,538 at the 2010 census. Phoenix is a part of the <span class="loc">Medford Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, in the Rogue Valley, and is 3 miles (5 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Medford</span> on Interstate 5. The Phoenix area was settled in about 1850 by brothers Hiram and Samuel Colver. Samuel Colver laid out the town in 1854. Early residents included Milton Lindley, who operated a sawmill that provided timbers in 1855 for a blockhouse as well as a flouring mill owned by Sylvester M. Wait. For a time, the settlement was known locally as <span class="loc">Gasburg</span> after a talkative employee in the kitchen serving the mill hands. Wait, who was an agent for the Phoenix Insurance Company of <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, assigned the official name, Phoenix, to the community and, in 1857, to its post office. <span class="loc">Waitsburg</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, was later named after Wait. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.44 square miles (3.73 km2), all of it land.</p>
