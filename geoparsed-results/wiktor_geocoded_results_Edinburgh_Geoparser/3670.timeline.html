  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Trancoso</span> is a district in the municipality of <span class="loc">Porto Seguro</span> in the state of <span class="loc">Bahia</span>, <span class="loc">Brazil</span>. The region was the landing point of the Portuguese explorer, <span class="per">Pedro Alvares</span> <span class="loc">Cabral</span> onto <span class="loc">Brazil</span>, on <span class="date">April 22, 1500</span>. It was founded by Jesuit Priests on <span class="date">1583</span>, with the name São João Baptista dos <span class="loc">Indios</span>. Shaped as a rectangle, the village retains the original style of its housing architecture. It is famous for its beaches, such as <span class="loc">Praia</span> dos Nativos, <span class="loc">Praia</span> dos <span class="loc">Coqueiros</span> and <span class="loc">Praia</span> do Espelho. In <span class="date">recent years</span> the location has been developed by the hotel industry, including the French Club Mediterranée, which has boosted real estate value. The federal Ministry of the Environment is currently expanding several National Parks and Natural Reserves nearby with the goal of preserving remaining areas of Atlantic Rain Forest. In addition, <span class="loc">Trancoso</span> is located at the starting point of a state Environmental Protection Area, the APA Caraíva-Trancoso, whose goal is to curtail touristic and economical development in the region, thereby minimizing negative impacts that may harm this biosphere. As in most of <span class="loc">Brazil</span>, the population is a mixture of native, African and Portuguese or other European descendants. In <span class="date">recent years</span>, "<span class="date">winter</span> birds" such as Canadians, Italians, Portuguese, Dutch, Greeks, Israeli, and other have purchased homes, bed and breakfast, restaurants, and stores here or in other <span class="loc">Porto Seguro</span> sections, such as <span class="loc">Arraial</span> d'Ajuda and eventually settled down in <span class="loc">Trancoso</span>.</p><br><br>
