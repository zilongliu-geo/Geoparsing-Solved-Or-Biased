  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cleveland</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Emery County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>. As of the <span class="date">2000</span> census, the town population was 508. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.9 square mile (2.3 kmÂ²), all land. <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> is located in a swale of land between the mountains and the desert. It embraces about 480 acres (1.9 km2) and is 7 miles (11 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Huntington</span>, 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Price, and 17 miles (27 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Castle Dale</span>. <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1884</span> by <span class="per">Samuel Nelson Alger</span> and <span class="per">Henry Sr</span>. These two men took up homesteading and soon after twenty five-families joined them. Firm roots began to take hold, and gradually with hard work and persistence, <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> began to grow. These families were typically pioneers. <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> was named after <span class="loc">Grover Cleveland</span> who was President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> in the 1880s. The "old timers" claim that farms within the boundaries of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> require less water than other farms in <span class="loc">Emery County</span> and had the most productive ground. Many of the founding fathers came to <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> because of good reports of plentiful grass and good homesteading. The reason that <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> was not settled sooner was the lack of a sufficient water source and supply.</p><br><br>
