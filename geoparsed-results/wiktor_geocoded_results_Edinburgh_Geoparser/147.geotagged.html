<p><span class="loc">San Juan</span> (/ˌsæn ˈhwɑːn/; Spanish pronunciation: [saŋ ˈxwan], <span class="loc">Saint John</span>) is the capital and most populous municipality in the Commonwealth of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>, an unincorporated territory of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 395,326 making it the 46th-largest city under the jurisdiction of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">San Juan</span> was founded by Spanish colonists in 1521, who called it <span class="loc">Ciudad</span> de <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> ("Rich Port City"). <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>'s capital is the second oldest European-established capital city in <span class="loc">the Americas</span>, after <span class="loc">Santo Domingo</span>, in the <span class="loc">Dominican Republic</span>. Several historical buildings are located in <span class="loc">San Juan</span>; among the most notable are the city's former defensive forts, Fort <span class="loc">San Felipe</span> del Morro and Fort San Cristóbal, and <span class="loc">La Fortaleza</span>, the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in <span class="loc">the Americas</span>. Today, <span class="loc">San Juan</span> is <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>'s most important seaport, and is the island's manufacturing, financial, cultural, and tourism center. The population of the Metropolitan Statistical Area, including <span class="loc">San Juan</span> and the municipalities of Bayamón, <span class="loc">Guaynabo</span>, <span class="loc">Cataño</span>, <span class="loc">Canóvanas</span>, <span class="loc">Caguas</span>, <span class="loc">Toa Alta</span>, <span class="loc">Toa Baja</span>, <span class="loc">Carolina</span> and <span class="loc">Trujillo Alto</span>, is about 2 million inhabitants; thus, about half the population of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> now lives and works in this area. <span class="loc">San Juan</span> is also a principal city of the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area. The city has been the host of events within the sports community, including the 1979 Pan American Games, 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games, events of the 2006, 2009 and 2013 World Baseball Classics, the Caribbean Series and the Special Olympics and MLB San Juan Series in 2010.</p>
