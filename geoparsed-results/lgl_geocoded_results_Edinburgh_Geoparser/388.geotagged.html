<p>Dulcimer festival draws fans from across <span class="loc">U.S</span>.. It was all about dulcimers and music on Saturday during the second weekend of the Dogwood Trails Celebration. The Palestine Old Time Music &amp; Dulcimer Festival was in high gear on Saturday at the Museum for East Texas Culture, the last full day of the three-day festival that brought people from all across the <span class="loc">United States</span> including <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> and Virginia to perform as well as participate. “It’s went really well — we’ve had a bigger crowd this year with lots of workshops and jammin’ sessions,” festival organizer Margaret Wright said. “We’ve had every kind of instrument — guitar, banjo, mandolin, hammer and mountain dulcimers, and fiddle.” More local people are starting to come out to the annual dulcimer festival, Wright said, joining the loyal dulcimer fans who helped put <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> on the “map,” so to speak, in the dulcimer world. “We’ve had a lot of Old Time music followers come out. One man from <span class="loc">Montana</span> met up with a friend from <span class="loc">Dallas</span> and they are both big Old Time fans,” she said. Several classes and private lessons also were held. “We’ve fashioned the festival to meet the needs of those who attend,” Wright said. “If they arrived too late for the class they needed, then we would pull someone to give them a private lesson.” Voice lessons also were given by classic and Old Time music voice extraordinaire Alice Gerraurd, Wright said. “She’s known for her voice — her country style of singing, Carter Family style,” Wright said. “She is a master of harmony.” Wright, who organizes the dulcimer festival along with her husband Jerry, wanted to send out a special thank you to the museum staff and the volunteers. “We had a lot of volunteers from <span class="loc">Crockett</span>, <span class="loc">Palestine</span> and Houston,” Wright said.</p>
