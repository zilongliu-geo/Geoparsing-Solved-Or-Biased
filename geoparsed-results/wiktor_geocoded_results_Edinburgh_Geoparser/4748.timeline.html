  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cordova</span> /kɔːrˈdoʊvə/ is a small town located near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Copper River</span> in the Valdez-Cordova Census Area, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, at the head of Orca Inlet on the east side of <span class="loc">Prince William Sound</span>. The population was 2,239 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Cordova</span> was named Puerto <span class="loc">Cordova</span> by Spanish explorer <span class="per">Salvador Fidalgo</span> in <span class="date">1790</span>. No roads connect <span class="loc">Cordova</span> to other Alaskan towns, so a plane or ferry is required to travel there. In the <span class="org">Exxon</span> Valdez oil spill of <span class="date">March 1989</span>, an oil tanker ran aground northwest of <span class="loc">Cordova</span>, heavily damaging ecology and fishing. In <span class="date">1790</span> the inlet in front of the current <span class="loc">Cordova</span> townsite was named Puerto <span class="loc">Cordova</span> by Spanish explorer <span class="per">Salvador Fidalgo</span>, after Spanish admiral <span class="per">Luis de Córdova y Córdova</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Cordova</span> was named after it, although the inlet itself was later renamed the Orca Inlet. <span class="loc">Cordova</span> proper was founded as a result of the discovery of high-grade copper ore at Kennecott, north of <span class="loc">Cordova</span>. A group of surveyors from <span class="loc">Valdez</span> laid out a town site and <span class="per">Michael James Heney</span> purchased half the land for the terminus of the <span class="loc">Copper River</span> and Northwestern Railway after determining that <span class="loc">Katalla</span> was a poor harbor. <span class="per">Heney</span> and his crew held a brief ceremony to organize the town on <span class="date">March 26, 1906</span>. <span class="date">A week later</span> crews arrived to begin work on the railroad. The first lots in the new town site, which make up the heart of present-day <span class="loc">Cordova</span>, were sold at auction in <span class="date">May 1908</span>. As the railroad grew, so did the town. Eventually schools, businesses, a hospital, and utilities were established. After the railroad was completed <span class="loc">Cordova</span> became the transportation hub for the ore coming out of Kennecott. In the <span class="date">years</span> <span class="date">1911</span> to <span class="date">1938</span>, more than 200 million tons of copper ore was transported through <span class="loc">Cordova</span>.</p><br><br>
