<p>Lee is a town in <span class="loc">Strafford County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,330 at the 2010 census. The town is a rural farm and bedroom community, being close to the University of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. Settled in 1657, Lee was originally part of the extensive early <span class="loc">Dover</span> township. It includes <span class="loc">Wheelwright</span> Pond, named for the Reverend John Wheelwright, the founder of <span class="loc">Exeter</span>. <span class="loc">Wheelwright</span> Pond was the site of a noted early battle during King William's War. Indians, incited by the government of New <span class="loc">France</span>, attacked <span class="loc">Exeter</span> on July 4, 1690. They were pursued by two infantry companies raised for the purpose, who overtook them at <span class="loc">Wheelwright</span> Pond on July 6, 1690. Fierce fighting on that day would leave 3 officers and 15 soldiers dead, together with a large number of Indians. Among the dead were Captain Noah Wiswall, Lieutenant Gershom Flagg, and Ensign Edward Walker of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span>. In 1735, <span class="loc">Durham</span>, which included Lee, separated from <span class="loc">Dover</span>. Then Lee, in turn, would separate from <span class="loc">Durham</span> on January 16, 1766 when it was established by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth. It was among the last of 129 towns to receive a charter during his administration, and named for British General Charles Lee, who later joined the American Revolution.</p>
