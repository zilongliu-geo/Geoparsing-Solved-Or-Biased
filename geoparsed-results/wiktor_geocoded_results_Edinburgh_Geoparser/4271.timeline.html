  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Camas /ˈkæməs/ is a city in <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, with a population of 19,355 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Officially incorporated on <span class="date">June 18, 1906</span>, the city is named after the camas lily, a plant with an onion-like bulb prized by Native Americans. At the west end of downtown <span class="loc">Camas</span> is a large Georgia-Pacific paper-mill from which the high school teams get their name "the Papermakers". Accordingly, the city is about 20 miles east (upwind) from <span class="loc">Portland</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. Historically, the commercial base of the city was based almost solely on the paper mill; however, the diversity of industries has been enhanced considerably in <span class="date">recent years</span> by the influx of several white-collar, high-tech companies including Hewlett-Packard, <span class="org">Sharp</span> Microelectronics, Linear Technology and <span class="per">WaferTech</span> and <span class="per">Underwriters</span> Labs . Annual events include the <span class="date">summer</span> "Camas <span class="date">Days</span>", as well as other festivals and celebrations. The east side of town borders the <span class="loc">city of Washougal</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, and the west side of town borders <span class="loc">Vancouver</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>. <span class="loc">Camas</span> lies along the <span class="loc">Washington</span> side of the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span>, across from <span class="loc">Troutdale</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, and is part of the <span class="loc">Portland</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area as defined by the United States Census Bureau. At this juncture the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span> is nearly a mile wide; vehicular traffic flows across the <span class="loc">Columbia</span> via the Interstate Bridge on I-5 and the Glenn <span class="loc">Jackson Bridge</span> on I-205. The main road through town is the limited-access SR 14 expressway.</p><br><br>
