<p><span class="loc">Newport</span> is a small unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Wakulla County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>, situated where <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 98 meets State Road 267. In 1841, the current <span class="loc">Newport</span> area and the community of <span class="loc">Port Leon</span>, just south, endured a severe yellow fever epidemic. In 1843 <span class="loc">Port Leon</span>, located on the St. Marks River, was devastated by a hurricane that produced a 10 foot storm surge. The area still struggles against the same recurring hurricane surges that move up the St. Marks River entrance. After the hurricane of September 13, 1843, washed away all of the homes, buildings and railroad tracks in <span class="loc">Port Leon</span> promoters Nathaniel Hamlin, James Ormond, Peter H. Swain and several others met a week later and made plans to establish another town. They spent several days searching for a site safe from the sea, then selected a piece of land on the west side of the St. Marks River, about two miles below the old town of Magnolia, <span class="loc">Florida</span>. This location offered high ground, fewer swamps, and beautiful bubbling springs. It was owned by the Apalachicola Land Co. The organization permitted citizens who had suffered from the storm to draw lots at a cost of $25 and up.</p>
