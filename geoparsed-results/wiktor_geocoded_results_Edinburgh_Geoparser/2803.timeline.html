  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newcastle</span> is a small town in <span class="loc">County Down</span>, <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>. It had a population of 7,444 in the <span class="date">2001</span> Census. The seaside resort lies on the <span class="loc">Irish Sea</span> coast at the base of <span class="loc">Slieve Donard</span>, one of the <span class="loc">Mourne Mountains</span>, and is known for its sandy beach and the <span class="loc">Royal County</span> Down Golf Club. The town lies within the Down District Council area. The town aims to promote itself as the "activity resort" for <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span> and its most special attribute is its location at the foot of <span class="loc">Slieve Donard</span>. The town has benefited from a multi million upgrade which makes it a high quality seaside attraction. The town is twinned with <span class="loc">New Ross</span>, <span class="loc">County Wexford</span>, in the <span class="loc">Republic of Ireland</span>. The name of the town is thought to derive from the castle built by <span class="per">Felix Magennis</span> of the <span class="per">Magennis</span> clan in <span class="date">1588</span>, which stood at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Shimna</span> River. This castle was demolished in <span class="date">1830</span>. The town is referred to as New Castle in the Annals of the Four Masters in <span class="date">1433</span> so it is likely that he built on the site of an existing structure.</p><br><br>
