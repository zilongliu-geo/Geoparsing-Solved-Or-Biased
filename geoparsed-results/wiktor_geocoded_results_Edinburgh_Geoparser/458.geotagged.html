<p><span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is an area of the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Sefton</span>, in <span class="loc">Merseyside</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is home to The Plaza Community Cinema and three primary schools. There is also Crosby Beach, which begins in <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> and stretches 3 miles up to <span class="loc">Blundellsands</span>. It is the location of Antony Gormley's Another Place. It is mainly connected to <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> by <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> railway station. Historically part of <span class="loc">Lancashire</span> and originally an area of <span class="loc">Crosby</span>, named Crosby Seabank, it consisted mostly of sandhills and fields. One of the first major buildings in the area was opened on 18 June 1816, the first anniversary of the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>, and was named the Royal <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> Hotel in honour of the event. Gradually, as population increased and the area became an identifiable location, it became known as <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. Some of the buildings in <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> for example, the Grade II Listed Potters Barn park buildings are replicas of the ones found in <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>, <span class="loc">Belgium</span>. Ironically, the name <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> was dropped from the original building, which still stands, and it is now known simply as the Royal Hotel.</p>
