<p><span class="loc">Oka</span> (Cayuga: Ganehsada:geh ) is a small Canadian city on the northern bank of the <span class="loc">Ottawa River</span> (Rivi√®re des Outaouais in French), northwest of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>, <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. Located in the Lower Laurentians on Lake of <span class="loc">Two Mountains</span>, where the <span class="loc">Ottawa</span> has its confluence with the St. <span class="loc">Lawrence River</span>, the town has a main thoroughfare that is now part of <span class="loc">Quebec</span> Route 344. This area was first settled by French colonists as a mission to First Nations in 1721 by brothers of the Sulpician Order branch of the Roman Catholic Church. Early native inhabitants were <span class="loc">Mohawk</span> (Kanienkaha), <span class="loc">Algonquin</span>, and Nipissing, who had a village known as Kanesatake, now a reserve within the boundaries of <span class="loc">Oka</span>. The area was inhabited for thousands of years by cultures of First Nations peoples. At the time of European contact, when <span class="loc">Montreal</span> was founded, the <span class="loc">Mohawk</span> Nation or Kanienkaha, one of the Five Nations of Iroquoian-speaking peoples based in upstate <span class="loc">New York</span>, used this territory as a hunting ground. The Sulpician Order established a Roman Catholic mission and trading post at what became the adjacent Kanesatake. Some <span class="loc">Mohawk</span> made this a new base; they were granted a nine-mile square portion of land by the French king in 1716 as he wanted to move them off the island of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>. The Sulpician Order was granted a narrow strip next to theirs. The Sulpicians arranged a change to the grant and deed without informing the <span class="loc">Mohawk</span>, gaining legal title to the land. The <span class="loc">Mohawk</span> protested, beginning in the late 18th century, but were never successful in regaining control of most of what they thought of as their land.</p>
