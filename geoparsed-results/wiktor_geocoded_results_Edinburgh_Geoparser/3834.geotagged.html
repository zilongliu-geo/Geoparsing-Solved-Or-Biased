<p><span class="loc">Layou</span> is a small town located on the island of <span class="loc">Saint Vincent</span>, in Saint Andrew Parish. There is a post office, a police station and a library. There are also two quarries. <span class="loc">Layou</span> is located on the western coast of <span class="loc">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</span> and was one of the first areas of settlement by the French, who were the first Europeans to settle in <span class="loc">St. Vincent</span> and The <span class="loc">Grenadines</span> in the early part of the eighteenth century. Even before then the Caribs used it as one of their settlements, as it is evident from the petroglyphs which are found in the area. In 1763, <span class="loc">St. Vincent</span> was taken over by the British and the lands in <span class="loc">Layou</span> were bought by them to cultivate sugar. <span class="loc">Layou</span> was still a small area formed around <span class="loc">Jackson Bay</span>. The cultivation of sugar cane started growing and larger estates were needed, so that the smaller holdings of the French were consolidated into larger estates. There were 3 main estates: <span class="loc">Ruthland</span> Vale estate, Akers estate and <span class="loc">Palmiste</span> Park estate. During slavery, most people lived on the estates but began to leave after slavery was abolished and to establish villages.</p>
