  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Sterling</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Loudoun County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. The population as of the <span class="date">2010</span> United States Census was 27,822. It is located northwest of <span class="loc">Herndon</span>, east of <span class="loc">Ashburn</span>, and west of <span class="loc">Great Falls</span>, and includes part of <span class="org">Washington Dulles International Airport</span> and the former AOL corporate headquarters. <span class="per">Sterling</span> is also home to the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office LWX (serving the <span class="loc">Baltimoreâ€“Washington Metropolitan</span> Area), as well as the <span class="per">Sterling</span> Field Support Center, the National Weather Service test, research, and evaluation center for weather instruments. In <span class="date">the beginning of 1962</span>, large farms made up the 1,762 acres (713 ha) of what <span class="date">today</span> is called <span class="per">Sterling Park</span>. Route 7, also known as Leesburg Pike, bordered what used to be <span class="per">Jesse Hughes</span>'s dairy farm. <span class="per">Hughes</span> arrived in <span class="loc">Loudoun County</span> in the early 20th century and was a longtime head of the county's Democrats. <span class="per">Fred Franklin Tavenner</span>, who was somewhat related to <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>, operated vast stretches of <span class="loc">Sterling Farm</span> at the southwest fringes of <span class="per">Sterling Park</span>. <span class="per">Tavenner</span> had purchased land from <span class="per">Albert Shaw</span>, Jr., who had inherited it from his father <span class="per">Albert</span> B. Shaw, editor and publisher of the American <span class="org">Review of Reviews</span>. One of Shaw's spreads, totaling 1,640 acres (660 ha), was called "The Experimental Farm" because it was one of the first area farms to receive a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> grant for applying "scientific methods", as <span class="per">Tavenner</span> called them. According to <span class="per">Tavenner</span>, refugees from the Soviet Union ran the farm while Shaw remained in New <span class="loc">York City</span>.</p><br><br>
