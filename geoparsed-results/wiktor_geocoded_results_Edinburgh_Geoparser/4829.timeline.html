  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Norfolk /ˈnɔːrfək/ is a county in <span class="loc">East Anglia</span>. It borders <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span> to the west and north-west, <span class="loc">Cambridgeshire</span> to the west and southwest, and <span class="loc">Suffolk</span> to the south. Its northern and eastern boundaries are the <span class="loc">North Sea</span> and, to the north-west, The Wash. The county town is <span class="loc">Norwich</span>. With an area of 2,074 square miles and a population of 859,400, <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> is a largely rural county with a population density of 401 per square mile. Forty per cent of the county's population live in four major built up areas: <span class="loc">Norwich</span> (213,000), <span class="loc">Great Yarmouth</span> (63,000), <span class="loc">King's Lynn</span> (46,000) and <span class="loc">Thetford</span> (25,000). The Broads is a network of rivers and lakes on the county's east coast, extending south into <span class="loc">Suffolk</span>. The area is a National Park and is protected by the Broads Authority. <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> was settled in pre-Roman times, with camps along the higher land in the west where flints could be quarried. <span class="per">A Brythonic</span> tribe, the Iceni, inhabited the county from the <span class="date">1st century BC</span> to the end of the <span class="date">1st century AD</span>. The Iceni revolted against the Roman invasion in <span class="date">47 AD</span>, and again in <span class="date">60 AD</span> led by Boudica. The crushing of the second rebellion opened the county to the Romans. During the Roman era in Norfolk roads and ports were constructed throughout the county and farming took place widely.</p><br><br>
