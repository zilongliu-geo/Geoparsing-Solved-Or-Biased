<p><span class="loc">Inglewood</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Taranaki Region</span> of <span class="loc">New</span> <span class="loc">Zealand</span>'s <span class="loc">North Island</span>. The population was 3,090 in the 2006 Census, an increase of 144 from 2001. In 2013 it had risen to 3,243. <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> is located 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) southeast of <span class="loc">New Plymouth</span> on State Highway 3, close to <span class="loc">Mount Taranaki</span>/Egmont. The town lies 200 metres (660 ft) above sea level. It is a small town servicing a mainly dairy farming region. Although close to <span class="loc">New Plymouth</span>, the town has the usual stores and services for town and country. <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> was named by Philip Colin Threkeld for <span class="loc">Inglewood Forest</span> in <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. The settlement was founded in 1873, and its name rapidly progressed from Moatown to Milton, before being renamed to <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> in 1875 to avoid confusion with Milton in the <span class="loc">South Island</span>. A number of buildings are listed by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. Of those, the Railway Station and Yard is the only one listed as Category I. The Shoe Store Building on the corner of <span class="loc">Rata</span> and <span class="loc">Richmond Streets</span> is one of eight listed as Category II.</p>
