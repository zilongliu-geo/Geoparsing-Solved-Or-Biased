<p><span class="loc">York County</span> is a county located in the north-central section of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> notorious as a hotbed of Klu Klux Klan activity after the Civil War. As of the 2010 census, the population was 226,073. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">York</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, and its largest city is <span class="loc">Rock Hill</span>. <span class="loc">York County</span> is included in the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-Rock Hill <span class="loc">SC Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. With a population of nearly 6,000 at the time of first European contact, the native inhabitants, the <span class="loc">Catawba</span> were primarily agriculturalists. Hernando de Soto passed through the area in the 1540s in his search for gold. Several decades later Juan Pardo recorded his observation of a predominant Native American tribe, later confirmed to be the <span class="loc">Catawba</span>, in the vicinity of present-day Fort Mill, east of the <span class="loc">Catawba River</span>. The Province of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> was founded in 1670. Twelve years later it was divided into three counties. One of these, <span class="loc">Craven County</span>, roughly encompassed the northern half of the colony (including the southern half of present-day <span class="loc">York County</span>), while the northern portion of <span class="loc">York County</span> was considered part of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>.</p>
