  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Huntington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hampshire County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,180 at the time of the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. Originally Plantation Number 9. by the <span class="org">Court</span> of <span class="loc">Massachusetts Bay</span>, <span class="loc">Huntington</span> has a colorful history, hinted at by the town's incorporation date of <span class="date">March 5th, 1855</span>, <span class="date">decades</span> later than the towns around it. The town was assembled from pieces of surrounding towns, which were grafted onto the town of <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, <span class="loc">Murrayfield</span>, and <span class="loc">Knightville</span> . The present village center sits on what was the meeting point of three towns and two counties. The location of the village created a tangle of jurisdictional confusion. With the coming of the railroad in the 1840s and the expansion of industry and population that came with it, the political difficulties that the boundaries presented became untenable. The solution that resulted in the town we call home <span class="date">today</span> was crafted by a <span class="loc">Northampton</span> attorney named <span class="per">Charles Huntington</span>. Once the new town was incorporated, <span class="per">Mr. Huntington</span> presented it with a gift that was the foundation of the town's library. After some discussion, the newly formed town voted to adopt the of name of '<span class="per">Huntington</span>', in honor of its recent architect and benefactor.</p><br><br>
