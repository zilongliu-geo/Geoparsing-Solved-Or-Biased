  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bradford</span> is the primary country urban area of the Town of Bradford West <span class="per">Gwillimbury</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, in <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It overlooks a farming community, known as The <span class="loc">Holland Marsh</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Holland River</span> that flows into <span class="loc">Lake Simcoe</span>. Within the municipal boundaries are a number of smaller communities, including: Bond Head, Dunkerron, Green Valley, <span class="loc">Pinkerton</span>, Fisher's Corners, <span class="per">Newton Robinson</span>, <span class="loc">Coulson</span> and <span class="loc">Deerhurst</span>. The eastern boundary of <span class="loc">Bradford</span> is the <span class="loc">Holland River</span>, named for <span class="per">Samuel Holland</span>, first Surveyor General of British <span class="loc">North America</span>, who passed this way on an exploration from <span class="loc">Toronto</span> to <span class="loc">Balsam Lake</span>, by way of <span class="loc">Lake Simcoe</span>, in <span class="date">1791</span>. For <span class="date">several years</span> the <span class="loc">Holland River</span> and <span class="loc">Lake Simcoe</span> provided the only means of transportation. <span class="loc">Holland</span> Landing was the northern terminus of <span class="loc">Yonge</span> Street. The military route to <span class="loc">Georgian Bay</span> during the War of <span class="date">1812</span> crossed <span class="loc">Lake Simcoe</span> to <span class="loc">Kempenfelt</span> Bay, then by the Nine Mile Portage to <span class="loc">Willow Creek</span> and the <span class="loc">Nottawasaga River</span>. The Penetanguishene Road, built between <span class="date">1814</span> and <span class="date">1815</span> from <span class="loc">Kempenfelt</span> Bay, provided an alternate route to <span class="loc">Georgian Bay</span>. However, early settlers also used this route to get to the frontier of <span class="loc">Simcoe County</span>, bypassing the areas of West <span class="per">Gwillimbury</span> and <span class="per">Essa</span> townships.</p><br><br>
