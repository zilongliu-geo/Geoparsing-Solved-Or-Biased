  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Dulcimer festival draws fans from across <span class="loc">U.S</span>.. It was all about dulcimers and music on <span class="date">Saturday</span> during the second <span class="date">weekend</span> of the Dogwood Trails Celebration. The <span class="org">Palestine Old Time Music &amp; Dulcimer Festival</span> was in high gear on <span class="date">Saturday</span> at the <span class="org">Museum for East Texas Culture</span>, the last full day of the three-day festival that brought people from all across the <span class="loc">United States</span> including <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> and Virginia to perform as well as participate. “It’s went really well — we’ve had a bigger crowd <span class="date">this year</span> with lots of workshops and jammin’ sessions,” festival organizer <span class="per">Margaret Wright</span> said. “We’ve had every kind of instrument — guitar, banjo, mandolin, hammer and mountain dulcimers, and fiddle.” More local people are starting to come out to the annual dulcimer festival, <span class="per">Wright</span> said, joining the loyal dulcimer fans who helped put <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> on the “map,” so to speak, in the dulcimer world. “We’ve had a lot of Old Time music followers come out. One man from <span class="loc">Montana</span> met up with a friend from <span class="loc">Dallas</span> and they are both big Old Time fans,” she said. Several classes and private lessons also were held. “We’ve fashioned the festival to meet the needs of those who attend,” <span class="per">Wright</span> said. “If they arrived too late for the class they needed, then we would pull someone to give them a private lesson.” Voice lessons also were given by classic and Old Time music voice extraordinaire <span class="per">Alice Gerraurd</span>, <span class="per">Wright</span> said. “She’s known for her voice — her country style of singing, <span class="per">Carter Family</span> style,” <span class="per">Wright</span> said. “She is a master of harmony.” Wright, who organizes the dulcimer festival along with her husband <span class="per">Jerry</span>, wanted to send out a special thank you to the museum staff and the volunteers. “We had a lot of volunteers from <span class="loc">Crockett</span>, <span class="loc">Palestine</span> and Houston,” <span class="per">Wright</span> said.</p><br><br>
