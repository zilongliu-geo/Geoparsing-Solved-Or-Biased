<p><span class="loc">Almagro</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [alˈmaɣɾo]) is a mostly middle-class barrio (neighbourhood) of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. The neighbourhood is delimited by <span class="loc">La Plata</span> avenue and Río de Janeiro street to the west, Independencia avenue to the south, Sánchez de <span class="loc">Bustamante</span>, Sánchez de <span class="loc">Loria</span> and <span class="loc">Gallo</span> streets to the east, and Córdoba/Estado de <span class="loc">Israel</span> avenues to the north. <span class="loc">Almagro</span> features strong commercial activity along its avenues, and has a high population density due to the many high-rise buildings erected along the railway line. The sectional government of the 6th circuit, which includes <span class="loc">Almagro</span> and <span class="loc">Boedo</span>, is located on Díaz Vélez avenue opposite Centenario park. In the 18th century, what is now the western part of <span class="loc">Almagro</span> belonged to Portuguese merchant Carlos de los Santos Valente and then to his estate. The eastern and northern sections were in the possession of Spaniard Juan María de <span class="loc">Almagro</span> y de la <span class="loc">Torre</span>, a barrister. The Argentine revolutionary government confiscated <span class="loc">Almagro</span>'s lands, only to return them to him in 1820. Both Santos Valente and Almagro managed agricultural establishments, and did not favor any kind of urban development.</p>
