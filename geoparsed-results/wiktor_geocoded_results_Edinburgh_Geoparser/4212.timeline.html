The population was 384 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Livermore</span> is the hometown of Baltimore Ravens tight end <span class="per">Dallas Clark</span>. <span class="loc">Livermore</span> was founded in <span class="date">1879</span>. The community grew in importance as an agricultural center with grain elevators and feed mills and merchants serving the surrounding rich farmland. The community is located adjacent to the confluence of the East Fork <span class="loc">Des Moines</span> River and Lott's Creek. Early industries included a brick and tile factory and agricultural products processing. As north central <span class="loc">Iowa</span>'s rural population dwindled, so has <span class="loc">Livermore</span>'s population. Its remaining elementary school closed in <span class="date">2005</span>. <span class="loc">Livermore</span> is located at 42°52′1″N 94°11′3″W (42.866849, -94.184051) at the confluence of <span class="loc">Lotts Creek</span> with the East Fork <span class="loc">Des Moines</span> River. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.70 square miles (1.81 km2), all of it land. With a sizeable German Catholic population surrounding <span class="loc">Livermore</span>, the community's largest church is Sacred Heart Catholic, followed by <span class="loc">Livermore</span> United <span class="per">Methodist</span> and <span class="per">Immanuel</span> <span class="loc">Lutheran</span>. Bethel Presbyterian Church closed in <span class="date">the late 1970s</span> and the building is <span class="date">now</span> home to the <span class="org">Livermore Community Club</span> and museum. Other community attractions include Old Settlers' Park, which dates to <span class="date">1890</span>, when early <span class="loc">Livermore</span> families each contributed a log to build a cabin in the thickly wooded park located at the west entrance to the community. The town also features a library, community swimming pool and a high school baseball/softball complex. Just north of <span class="loc">Livermore</span> is the picturesque Spring Valley Golf Club, named <span class="loc">Iowa</span>'s best nine-hole course, before it was expanded to 18 holes. Otto Field American Legion Post 415 is located in <span class="loc">Livermore</span> and the town's Friends &amp; Neighbors Club is an active seniors organization with its own building. <span class="loc">Livermore</span> Daze is an annual celebration that brings together antique car enthusiasts, parade participants and hundreds of residents and visitors to <span class="date">the weekend</span> event.</p><br><br>
