The population as of the 2000 census for zip code 21155, part of which covers <span class="loc">Arcadia</span>, was 2349. The town of <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> has many attractions and events. Three such events are the Annual Arcadia Bluegrass Festival, the Arcadia Championship Demolition Derbies and the annual show held by the Maryland Steam Historical Society, Inc. which features steam engines, antique cars, tractor pulls, country music and a flea market, among other attractions. <span class="loc">Arcadia</span>, is in fact a small rural town. The post office is in fact signed "Upperco". There is no police department, no Mayor or any other town governance. There is one church (Lutheran), Arcadia Volunteer Fire Company, the carnival grounds and a railroad track that runs through it. In recent decades there was a small independent convenience store and a Chrysler dealership, neither of which exist today. It is adjacent to <span class="loc">Maryland</span> Route 30 between the much larger towns of <span class="loc">Reisterstown</span> and <span class="loc">Hampstead</span>. There are three house-lined roads that meander through it, Arcadia Avenue, <span class="loc">Dover</span> Rd and Trenton Rd.</p>
