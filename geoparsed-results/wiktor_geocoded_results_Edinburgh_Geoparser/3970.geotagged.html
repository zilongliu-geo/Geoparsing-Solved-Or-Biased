<p><span class="loc">Olinda</span> (Portuguese pronunciation: [oˈlĩdɐ]) is a historic city in the Brazilian state of <span class="loc">Pernambuco</span>, located on the country's northeastern <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> coast, just north of <span class="loc">Recife</span> and south of <span class="loc">Paulista</span>. It has a population of 397,268 people  and is one of the best-preserved colonial cities in <span class="loc">Brazil</span>. <span class="loc">Olinda</span> features a number of major tourist attractions, such as a historic downtown area (World Heritage Site), churches, and the Carnival of <span class="loc">Olinda</span>, a popular street party, very similar to traditional Portuguese carnivals, with the addition of African influenced dances. Unlike in <span class="loc">Rio de Janeiro</span> and Salvador, in <span class="loc">Olinda</span>, admission to Carnival is free. All the festivities are celebrated on the streets, and there are no bleachers or roping. There are hundreds of small musical groups (sometimes featuring a single performer) in many genres. Several indigenous tribes occupied the coast of Northeastern <span class="loc">Brazil</span> for several thousand years, and the hills of the present day municipality of <span class="loc">Olinda</span> had settlements of Caetés and Tupinambá tribes, which were frequently at war. French mercenaries are thought to be the first Europeans to get to the region, but the Portuguese exploited intertribal rivalries and managed to build a stronghold on the former Caeté village in the higher hill. Recent studies by the Universidade Federal de <span class="loc">Pernambuco</span> have uncovered new evidence of the pre-colonial population of the area. The settlement of <span class="loc">Olinda</span> was founded in 1535 by <span class="loc">Duarte</span> <span class="loc">Coelho</span> <span class="loc">Pereira</span>; it was elevated to a town on March 12, 1537. It was made the seat of the Territorial Prelature of <span class="loc">Pernambuco</span> in 1614, becoming the <span class="loc">Diocese of Olinda</span> in 1676.</p>
