  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alma is a ghost town in Santa <span class="loc">Clara County</span> in <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies beneath the waters of the <span class="loc">Lexington</span> Reservoir above <span class="loc">Los Gatos</span>. The location is latitude 37.18N and longitude 121.98W. It was 551 feet (168 meters) above sea level. There are two different possible origins for the name of the town. The first is that the town was the location of a branch road that led to the <span class="loc">New Almaden</span> mine. The second, and more fanciful, origin is that the town was named after a local prostitute. The original town name registered with the Postal Service in <span class="date">1861</span> was <span class="loc">Lexington</span>. It was re-registered as Alma in <span class="date">1873</span>. The town was mostly demolished when the <span class="per">James J. Lenihan</span> Dam was constructed there in <span class="date">1952</span>. Alma, at the time, had a population of fewer than 100 people. The town was an important rail stop for the logging industry in the <span class="loc">Santa Cruz Mountains</span> as well as a stop for vacationers heading to the coast from the <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> Valley. Just north of Alma was the town of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, which had greatly declined by the time that dam and reservoir were constructed.</p><br><br>
