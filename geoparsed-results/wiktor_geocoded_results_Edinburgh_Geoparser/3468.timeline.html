  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Union City</span> is a village in <span class="per">Branch</span> and <span class="per">Calhoun</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. Located mostly within Union Township in <span class="loc">Branch County</span>, it sits at the junction of the <span class="loc">Coldwater</span> and <span class="per">St. Joseph</span> rivers; the <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> portion lies within that county's Burlington Township. It is part of the <span class="loc">Battle Creek</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,599 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. M-60 passes just north of the village. <span class="loc">Union City</span> is located on the northern border of <span class="loc">Branch County</span>, about ten miles (16 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Coldwater</span>. This is a small picturesque and historic town that functions primarily as an adjunct community to the greater <span class="loc">Coldwater</span> and <span class="loc">Battle Creek</span> areas. It has a striking turn-of-the-century look architecturally, with well–preserved downtown buildings and several Victorian style homes. A Civil War monument can be seen on the north end of the main street area in the churchyard, while a veteran’s memorial along the riverbank to the south end commemorates those who fought in more recent wars. <span class="loc">Union City</span> was first settled by <span class="per">Justin Goodwin</span> in <span class="date">1833</span>, when he built a mill here and became the first postmaster, calling it "Goodwinville". <span class="date">A year later</span>, he sold several hundred acres to <span class="per">E. W. Morgan</span>, who officially platted the site, renaming it from the "union" of the <span class="loc">Coldwater</span> and <span class="per">St. Joseph</span> Rivers, which join there. A consortium of four proprietors bought the site in <span class="date">1837</span>. It was eventually incorporated as a village in <span class="date">1866</span>.</p><br><br>
