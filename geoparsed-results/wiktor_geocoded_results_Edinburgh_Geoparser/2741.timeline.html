  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Panama</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Chautauqua County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 479 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Panama</span> is in the northwest part of the town of Harmony, at the junction of State Route 474 (Main Street) and County Route 33. The village is named after <span class="loc">Panama Rocks</span>, a large rock formation south of the village. Paleozoic fossils are visible in the outcrops. This site has become a tourist attraction, and the owners charge admission at the gate. The village of <span class="loc">Panama</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1861</span>. Among many early settlers was <span class="per">George Hawkins</span>, who purchased Lot 50 in <span class="date">1825</span>. He was born in <span class="date">1802</span> in <span class="loc">Oneida County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. About <span class="date">1827</span> he married <span class="per">Rhoda Powers</span> (born <span class="date">1806</span>). Together they cleared land to make a living. <span class="per">George</span> died in <span class="date">1883</span> and <span class="per">Rhoda</span> in <span class="date">1900</span>. <span class="per">Rhoda</span>'s father was <span class="per">Simeon Powers</span>, who established a Baptist church in the area. <span class="per">George</span>'s parents are unknown. Both are buried in <span class="org">Panama Union</span> cemetery under one headstone. The <span class="org">U.S. Post Office</span> at <span class="loc">Panama</span> was established in <span class="date">1826</span>. That was the first, officially recorded, use of the name "<span class="loc">Panama</span>". The traditional story is that <span class="loc">Panama</span> got its name from someone who had been across the <span class="loc">Isthmus of Panama</span>, and said local rock formations reminded him of <span class="loc">Panama</span>'s rocks. It is possible that this person was <span class="per">Moses Cushman</span> Marsh, who operated a trading company in <span class="loc">Panama</span>, and was <span class="loc">Panama</span>'s first postmaster. He had previously had a business in <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, and he may have been across the <span class="loc">Isthmus of Panama</span>.</p><br><br>
