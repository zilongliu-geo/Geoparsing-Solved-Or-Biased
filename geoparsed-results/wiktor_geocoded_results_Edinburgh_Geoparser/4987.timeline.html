  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mason County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 27,324. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span>. The county was founded in <span class="date">1804</span> and was named for <span class="per">George Mason</span>, delegate to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Constitutional Convention. Before the Civil War, the county was located in the State of Virginia. <span class="loc">Mason County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span>, WV-OH <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. In <span class="date">the second half of 1749</span>, the French explorer, Pierre Joseph Céloron de <span class="loc">Blainville</span>, claimed French sovereignty over the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> Valley, burying a lead plaque at the meeting point of the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Kanawha Rivers</span>, naming the place <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span>. In the Battle of <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span> (<span class="date">October 10, 1774</span>), fought on <span class="date">the future</span> site of the town, over one thousand Virginia militiamen, led by Colonel <span class="loc">Andrew Lewis</span> (<span class="date">1720</span>–<span class="date">1781</span>), defeated a roughly equal force of an Algonquin confederation of <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> and <span class="loc">Mingo</span> warriors led by <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> Chief <span class="per">Cornstalk</span> (ca. 1720-1777). The event is celebrated locally as the "First Battle of the American Revolutionary War" and in <span class="date">1908</span> the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senate authorized erection of a local monument to commemorate it as such. Most historians, however, regard it not as a battle of the Revolution (<span class="date">1775</span>–<span class="date">1783</span>), but as a part of <span class="per">Lord Dunmore</span>'s War (<span class="date">1774</span>). "Camp <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span>" was established by <span class="per">Col. Lewis</span> at the time of the Battle and the settlement that followed also took that name. Although not certain, <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span> may have been permanently settled by whites as early as <span class="date">1774</span>.</p><br><br>
