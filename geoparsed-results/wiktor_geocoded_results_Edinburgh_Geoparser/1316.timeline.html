  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Molo</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Nakuru County</span>. It is served by a branch of <span class="loc">Kenya</span> Railways, formerly the <span class="loc">Uganda</span> Railway, East <span class="org">African Railways Corporation</span> until <span class="date">1977</span>. <span class="loc">Molo</span> hosts a town council. The town has a population of 107,806 (<span class="date">2009</span> census). <span class="loc">Molo</span> is along the <span class="loc">Mau</span> Forest which runs on the <span class="loc">Mau Escarpment</span>. The town was a settlement established primarily because of its fertility and vast vegetation. It is one of the coldest places in the country. This is a perfect place for growing Pyrethrum, a cash crop that can be maintained with little resources. There are plenty of other crops that are grown by farmers both small and large scale and attracting settlers, many of them politically empowered. This massive invasion resulted to a high rate of forest destruction and timber poaching. Efforts to reclaim land and grow trees have been outpaced by logging and charcoal making. The Kenyan government has since declared all forests contained from human activity. Only imported timber is permitted from <span class="date">2002</span>. <span class="loc">Molo</span> town has seven wards, five of them (Kiambiriria, <span class="loc">Molo</span>, <span class="loc">Sachangwani</span>, <span class="loc">Turi North</span> and <span class="loc">Turi South</span>) are within <span class="loc">Molo</span> Constituency, while the remaining two (<span class="per">Koige</span> and <span class="per">Sirikwa</span>) are part of the Kuresoi Constituency.</p><br><br>
