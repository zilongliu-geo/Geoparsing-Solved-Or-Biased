<p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windsor County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 9,373 at the 2010 census. One of the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> grants, the township was chartered on August 20, 1761 by Governor Benning Wentworth and awarded to Gideon Lyman and 61 others. Although Springfield's alluvial flats made it among the best agricultural towns in the state, the <span class="loc">Black River</span> falls, which drop 110 feet (33.5 m) in 1/8 of a mile (201 m), helped it develop into a mill town. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> was located in the center of the Precision Valley region, home of the <span class="loc">Vermont</span> machine tool industry. In 1888, the <span class="loc">Jones</span> and <span class="loc">Lamson Machine Tool</span> Company (J&amp;L) moved to <span class="loc">Springfield</span> from <span class="loc">Windsor</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span> under the successful leadership of James Hartness. Gaining international renown for precision and innovation, J&amp;L ushered in a new era of precision manufacturing in the area. Edwin R. Fellows co-founded the Fellows Gear Shaper Company here in 1896. As knowledge and infrastructure grew to support precision machining, other companies such as the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company and Lovejoy Tool formed, grew, and provided much of the economic engine. Springfield Telescope Makers, the oldest amateur telescope makers' club in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, has been headquartered in <span class="loc">Springfield</span> since its inception in 1920. The club's clubhouse, Stellafane, located on the campus of Stellafane Observatory has hosted a convention for the geographically scattered club since 1927. During World War II, Springfield's production of machine tools was of such importance to the American war effort that the <span class="loc">US</span> government ranked <span class="loc">Springfield</span> (together with the Cone at <span class="loc">Windsor</span>) as the seventh most important bombing target in the country.</p>
