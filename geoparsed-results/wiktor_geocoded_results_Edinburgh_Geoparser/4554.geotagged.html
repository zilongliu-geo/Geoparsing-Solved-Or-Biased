<p>Mitchell is a city in <span class="loc">Marion Township</span>, <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,350 at the 2010 census. It is the birthplace of astronaut Gus Grissom, who flew on <span class="loc">Liberty Bell</span> 7, Gemini 3, and died in a launch pad fire at Kennedy Space Center in 1967. Mitchell was built as a railroad town in the mid-19th century. At this location in <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>, the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Indianapolis</span> and <span class="loc">Louisville Railroad</span>, better known by the shorter name of "the <span class="loc">Monon</span>", was built as a north-south line from <span class="loc">New Albany</span> to <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, passing through the area which became Mitchell in 1853. In 1857, the east-west <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Mississippi Railway</span> (later part of the <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Railroad</span>) was completed, as part of a link between <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span> and St. Louis. At the intersection of the two rail lines, a new town was planned. As the O&amp;M railroad was surveyed, the owners of the land arranged for one of the surveyors, <span class="loc">Ormsby</span> <span class="loc">McKnight</span> <span class="loc">Mitchel</span> (1810–1862), a <span class="loc">West Point</span> graduate and professor at the University of Cincinnati, to plat their new town in exchange for naming it for him. (The second "L" in Mitchell was added later). A native of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, Ormsby Mitchel grew up in <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, and was also an attorney and notable astronomer. He later became a Major General in the Union Army during the American Civil War (1861–1865), and is best known for ordering the raid that became famous as the Great Locomotive Chase. He was known as "Old Stars". General Mitchel died of yellow fever while serving in <span class="loc">Beaufort</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. [1]</p>
