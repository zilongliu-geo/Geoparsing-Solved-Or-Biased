<p><span class="loc">Farmington</span> is a town located in <span class="loc">Strafford County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The 2010 census reported that the town had a total population of 6,786. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> is home to Blue Job State Forest. The compact town center, where 3,885 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the <span class="loc">Farmington</span> census-designated place and is located at the junction of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> routes 75 and 153. Abenaki Indians once used the <span class="loc">Cochecho River</span> for transportation, and had a camping ground on <span class="loc">Meetinghouse</span> Hill, where they built birch bark canoes. Otherwise, the river valley was wilderness, through which Indians from the north traveled after crossing <span class="loc">Lake Winnipesaukee</span> on their way to raid settlements in and around <span class="loc">Dover</span>. To stop the raids, in 1721 the Colonial Assembly in <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> approved construction of a fort at the foot of the lake, with a soldiers' road built from <span class="loc">Dover</span> to supply it. In 1722, Bay Road was surveyed and completed. Along its course the town of <span class="loc">Farmington</span> would grow. The settlement began as the Northwest Parish of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, which was chartered in 1722. The last Indian attack in the general region occurred in 1748, but by 1749, Native Americans had disappeared from warfare and disease. Farmers cultivated the rocky soil, and gristmills used water power of streams to grind their grain. Sawmills cut the abundant timber, and the first frame house at the village was built in 1782. In 1790, Jonas March from <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> established a store, behind which teamsters unloaded on his dock the lumber he traded. The area became known as March's Dock, <span class="loc">Farmington</span> Dock, and finally just The Dock.</p>
