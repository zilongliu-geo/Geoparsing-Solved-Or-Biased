  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alma is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Catron County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, north of <span class="loc">Glenwood</span> and south of Reserve. <span class="per">Sergeant James C. Cooney</span> laid out a town on site of Alma in the early 1870s, but left it undeveloped. The town was bought by a <span class="per">Captain Birney</span>, who named it "Alma" for his mother. In <span class="date">1882</span> the <span class="org">U.S. Post Office</span> opened in Alma, lasting until <span class="date">1931</span>. The town was home of <span class="per">Butch Cassidy</span> and the Sundance Kid's infamous Wild Bunch gang for a short period. They worked at the nearby WS ranch. Reportedly, the foreman and ranch manager were very happy with the Wild Bunch's work since the rustling stopped while they were employed at the ranch. <span class="per">Tom Ketchum</span>, <span class="per">Harvey Logan</span> and <span class="per">William Antrim</span>, Billy the Kid's stepfather, also lived in Alma at some point. Artist Olaf Wieghorst once worked on the Cunningham Ranch near Alma. Alma is the site of a Boot Hill cemetery, which is located about two miles north of the town. The "Alma Massacre" involved a raid on <span class="loc">United States</span> settlers' homes around Alma in <span class="date">1880</span>. As many as 41 people were killed during and immediately after the event. There were two memorials erected to commemorate these events.</p><br><br>
