  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bellingham</span> /ˈbɛlɪndʒəm/ is a village in <span class="loc">Northumberland</span>, to the north-west of <span class="loc">Newcastle upon Tyne</span> and is situated on the <span class="loc">Hareshaw</span> burn at its confluence with the <span class="loc">River North Tyne</span>. <span class="loc">Hareshaw Linn</span> is a waterfall on the <span class="loc">Hareshaw Burn</span> near <span class="loc">Bellingham</span>. Famous as a stopping point on the <span class="loc">Pennine Way</span> trail it is popular with walkers and cyclists. The village's local newspaper is the Hexham Courant. There is also an 18 hole golf course which was established in <span class="date">1893</span>. The Heritage Centre is the local museum. Its exhibitions include the Border Counties Railway, the Border Reivers, mining, farming, the photography of W P Collier, and the Stannersburn Smithy. It has a database of local family names and one of old photographs. It also holds special exhibitions of historical or artistic interest, and readings and performances by poets, storytellers, musicians and dancers. The Grade-I listed St Cuthbert's Church (13th-century, substantially reconstructed in the early 17th century) is described as 'almost unique in <span class="loc">England</span>' owing to its stone barrel vault, which runs the length of the Nave and extends into the South Transept. Within the churchyard is "The Long Pack", purportedly the grave of a burglar who attempted to infiltrate a local house by hiding in a beggar's pack, but was discovered after he suffered an ill-timed coughing fit, and was promptly run through with the sword of the house's proprietor. From <span class="date">1735</span> the parish rectors at <span class="loc">Bellingham</span> were under the patronage of the Governors of <span class="org">Greenwich Hospital</span>. The Governors stipulated that the rectors were to be graduates of <span class="loc">Oxford</span> or <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> and naval chaplains. <span class="loc">Bellingham</span> Rectory was one of six such rectories in the <span class="loc">Simonburn</span> area.</p><br><br>
