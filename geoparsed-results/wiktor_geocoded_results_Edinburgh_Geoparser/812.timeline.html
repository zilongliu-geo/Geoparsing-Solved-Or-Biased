  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Mesa (/ˈmeɪsə/ MAY-sə) is a city in <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span>, in the State of <span class="loc">Arizona</span> and is a suburb located about 20 miles (32 km) east of <span class="per">Phoenix</span>. Mesa is the central city of the East Valley section of the <span class="loc">Phoenix Metropolitan</span> Area. It is bordered by <span class="loc">Tempe</span> on the west, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa <span class="org">Indian Community</span> on the north, <span class="per">Chandler</span> and <span class="per">Gilbert</span> on the south, and <span class="org">Apache</span> Junction on the east. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census Mesa became Arizona's center of population. Mesa is the third-largest city in <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, after <span class="per">Phoenix</span> and <span class="per">Tucson</span>, and the 38th-largest city in the <span class="loc">US</span>. The city is home to 439,041 people as of <span class="date">2010</span> according to the Census Bureau. Mesa is home to numerous higher education facilities including Polytechnic campus of <span class="org">Arizona State University</span>. The history of Mesa dates back <span class="date">at least 2,000 years</span> to the arrival of the Hohokam people. The Hohokam, whose name means "All Used Up" or "The Departed Ones", built the original canal system. The canals were the largest and most sophisticated in the prehistoric <span class="loc">New World</span>. Some were up to 90 feet (27 m) wide and ten feet deep at their head gates, extending for as far as 16 miles (26 km) across the desert. By A.D. <span class="date">1100</span> water could be delivered to an area over 110,000 acres (450 km2), transforming the <span class="loc">Sonoran Desert</span> into an agricultural oasis. By A.D. <span class="date">1450</span>, the Hohokam had constructed hundreds of miles of canals many of which are still in use <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
