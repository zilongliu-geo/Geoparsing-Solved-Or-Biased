Calhoun, a Vice President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The county is part of the <span class="loc">Camden</span>, <span class="loc">AR</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Each township includes unincorporated areas; some may have incorporated cities or towns within part of their boundaries. Arkansas townships have limited purposes in modern times. However, the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census does list Arkansas population based on townships (sometimes referred to as "county subdivisions" or "minor civil divisions"). Townships are also of value for historical purposes in terms of genealogical research. Each town or city is within one or more townships in an <span class="loc">Arkansas county</span> based on census maps and publications. The townships of <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> are listed below; listed in parentheses are the cities, towns, and/or census-designated places that are fully or partially inside the township.</p>
