  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Northampton</span> /nɔːˈθæmptən/ is the county town of <span class="loc">Northamptonshire</span> in the East Midlands of <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies on the <span class="loc">River Nene</span>, about 67 miles (108 km) north-west of <span class="loc">London</span> and 50 miles (80 km) south-east of <span class="loc">Birmingham</span>. One of the largest towns in the <span class="loc">UK</span>, <span class="loc">Northampton</span> had a population of 212,100 in the <span class="date">2011</span> census. Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. During the Middle Ages, the town rose to national significance with the establishment of <span class="loc">Northampton</span> Castle, which was an occasional royal residence and regularly hosted the Parliament of <span class="loc">England</span>. Medieval <span class="loc">Northampton</span> had many churches, monasteries and the <span class="org">University of Northampton</span>, which were all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted its first town charter by <span class="per">King Richard I</span> in <span class="date">1189</span> and its first mayor was appointed by <span class="per">King John</span> in <span class="date">1215</span>. The town is also the site of two medieval battles; the Battle of <span class="loc">Northampton</span> (<span class="date">1264</span>) and the second in <span class="date">1460</span>. <span class="loc">Northampton</span>'s royal connection languished in the modern period; the town supported Parliament (the Roundheads) in the <span class="org">English Civil War</span>, which culminated in King <span class="per">Charles II</span> ordering the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The town also suffered the Great Fire of <span class="loc">Northampton</span> (<span class="date">1675</span>) which destroyed most of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. <span class="loc">Northampton</span> continued to grow following the creation of the <span class="loc">Grand Union Canal</span> and the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, becoming an industrial centre for footwear and leather manufacture.</p><br><br>
