  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Boston</span> (pronounced /ˈbɒstən/) is the capital of the Commonwealth of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and the largest city in <span class="loc">New England</span>. The municipality is the northern anchor of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> northeast megalopolis. <span class="loc">New England</span>'s largest airport, <span class="org">Logan International Airport</span>, is within the municipal limits. Greater Boston's most impactful contributions to human civilization involve the region's higher education institutions and sports culture. The municipality was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution, such as the Boston Massacre, the <span class="org">Boston Tea Party</span>, the Battle of <span class="loc">Bunker Hill</span> and the Siege of <span class="loc">Boston</span>. Upon American independence from <span class="loc">Britain</span>, the municipality continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub, as well as a center for culture and education. Through land reclamation and municipal annexation, <span class="loc">Boston</span> has expanded beyond its original boundaries. The municipality's history attracts many tourists, with <span class="loc">Faneuil</span> Hall alone drawing over 20 million visitors per year. <span class="loc">Boston</span> is the site of the first public school in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>, <span class="org">Boston Latin School</span>, and the first rapid transit system, the Tremont Street Subway. Apart from higher education and sports, Boston's diverse economy includes biotechnology, finance, government activities, information technology and professional services. Households in the municipality claim the highest average rate of philanthropy in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> and businesses and institutions rank amongst the top in the country for environmental sustainability and investment. <span class="loc">Boston</span> has one of the highest costs of living in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>, though it remains high on world livability rankings.</p><br><br>
