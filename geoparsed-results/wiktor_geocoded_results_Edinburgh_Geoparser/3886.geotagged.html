<p>Linton is a small village in the Scottish Borders area of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is situated a mile north of the village of <span class="loc">Morebattle</span>. People have lived in the area since prehistoric times: on the summit of <span class="loc">Linton Hill</span> there is an Iron Age fort. Linton was a substantial village in the Middle Ages. The Somerville family first appear in the records as being from Linton in 1136. There was a tower built by the family close to the church, but it was destroyed by the forces of Henry VIII, during the Rough Wooing, and nothing now remains of it. Linton Church stands on top of a sandy mound, and used to be surrounded by water and marshland. The history of the church dates back to the 12th century, but the current building dates from 1911 and like its predecessors it has no solid foundations. The porch door has been inset with the "Somervail Stone" showing a knight fighting two beasts which is a link to the story of the Worm of Linton. A local legend concerning the founding of the church states that a young man killed a priest and was condemned to death. His two sisters pleaded for his life, which was granted on condition that they should sift as much sand as would form a mound on which to build a church. The sisters succeeded in the task, the church was built, and the man was freed.</p>
