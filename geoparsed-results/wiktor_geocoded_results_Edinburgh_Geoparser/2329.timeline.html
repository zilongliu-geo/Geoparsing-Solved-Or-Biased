  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dayton is a city in <span class="loc">Liberty County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,242 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Dayton, on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 90 six miles west of Liberty in southwestern <span class="loc">Liberty County</span>, was first called <span class="loc">West Liberty</span> and was considered part of the original town of Liberty, founded in <span class="date">1831</span>. The <span class="loc">Trinity River</span> divided the two parts of the town: Liberty was on its east bank, and <span class="loc">West Liberty</span> was on a hill three miles west of the river. A new road and a ferry directly connected the two. Both parts of the town were located on the four-league Mexican land grant appropriated for the capital of the old municipality of Sant√≠sima <span class="per">Trinidad de la Libertad</span>, which later became known as Liberty. The postmaster of <span class="loc">West Liberty</span> from <span class="date">March 25, 1839</span>, through <span class="date">September 15, 1841</span>, was <span class="per">A. Thouvenin</span>, probably the same man as <span class="loc">Arnold</span> <span class="per">Thouvenin</span>, who obtained a quarter-league Mexican land grant in <span class="loc">Polk County</span> in <span class="date">April 1835</span>. The <span class="loc">West Liberty</span> post office was apparently discontinued after <span class="date">a few years</span>. Land was designated for a school in <span class="date">1847</span>. The schoolhouse was accepted on <span class="date">December 31, 1853</span>, by the board of trustees of the <span class="org">Corporation of the Town</span> of Liberty. Also in <span class="date">1853</span>, A. N. <span class="per">B. Thompson</span> was authorized to survey and plat the town of <span class="loc">West Liberty</span>. During the Civil War, thirty-three ladies of <span class="loc">West Liberty</span> wrote to <span class="per">Governor Francis R. Lubbock</span> in <span class="date">January 1863</span>, petitioning him to relieve <span class="per">Mr. Sol Andrews</span> of his military duties so that he might continue his vocation of manufacturer of looms and spinning wheels, as cloth for clothing was desperately needed.</p><br><br>
