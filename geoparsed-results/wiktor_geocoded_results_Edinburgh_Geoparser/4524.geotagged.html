<p><span class="loc">Swansea</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Inyo County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It is located 8.5 miles (14 km) south of <span class="loc">New York Butte</span>, at an elevation of 3,661 ft (1,116 m). <span class="loc">Swansea</span> was a boomtown located on the eastern shore of <span class="loc">Owens Lake</span>. Spawned by the success of the silver mining operations in the nearby Cerro Gordo Mines in the late 1860s, <span class="loc">Swansea</span> became a hub for smelting the ore and transporting the resulting ingots to <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, over 200 miles away. The smelter operated from 1869 to 1874. <span class="loc">Swansea</span> was named after the mining town <span class="loc">Swansea</span> in south <span class="loc">Wales</span>, from which many experienced miners emigrated to the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The 1872 <span class="loc">Lone Pine</span> earthquake damaged the smelters and uplifted the shoreline, rendering the <span class="loc">Swansea</span> pier inaccessible by <span class="loc">Owens Lake</span> steamships. As a result, most of the smelting and transportation business moved to <span class="loc">Keeler</span>, approximately one mile to the south. In the summer of 1874, a thunderstorm-induced debris flow inundated <span class="loc">Swansea</span> under several feet of water, rock, and sand. By then the town had been almost deserted, and the debris flow marked the end of <span class="loc">Swansea</span>.</p>
