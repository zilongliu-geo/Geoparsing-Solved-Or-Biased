<p><span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Ulster County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,884 at the 2010 census, down from 6,241 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is in the northern part of the county, northwest of Kingston, and lies within the borders of the <span class="loc">Catskill</span> Park. The first non-indigenous settler arrived around 1770. The Town of <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> was established in 1787. Later, <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> contributed some of its territory to form the towns of <span class="loc">Middletown</span> (1789), <span class="loc">Windham</span> (1798), <span class="loc">Shandaken</span> (1804), and Olive (1853). <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> played host to numerous Hudson River School painters during the late 1800s. The Arts and Crafts Movement came to <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> in 1902, with the arrival of Ralph Radcliffe <span class="loc">Whitehead</span>, <span class="loc">Bolton Brown</span> and <span class="loc">Hervey White</span>, who formed the Byrdcliffe Colony. In 1906, L. Birge Harrison and others founded the Summer School of the Art Students League of <span class="loc">New York</span> in the area, primarily for landscape painting. Ever since, <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> has been considered an active artists colony. From 1915 through 1931, Hervey White's Maverick Art Colony held the Maverick Festivals, "in which hundreds of free spirits gathered each summer for music, art, theater and drunken orgies in the woods."</p>
