<p>Huntington is a city in <span class="loc">Baker County</span>, on the eastern border of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Snake River</span> and along Interstate 84 and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 30. The population was 440 at the 2010 census, down from 515 in 2000. Henry Miller settled in the area in August 1862. In 1870, Miller's Stagecoach Station was established before the coming of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company rail line in 1884, and was platted in 1885 or 1886. It soon became the primary shipping point for the cattle country to the south. Miller built the Stage Tavern, known for many years as "Miller Station". It was on the overland route that had been established in the valley, and had become well known to all who traveled in pioneer days. According to <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Geographic Names, Huntington was named for J.B. and J.M. Huntington, brothers who purchased Miller's holdings in 1882. The Huntingtons maintained a small trading post on their land. In 1884, the rails of the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> <span class="loc">Short Line</span> and the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company line were joined in Huntington. Since that time, Huntington has been an important railway division point. With the advent of the railroad came J.T. Fifer, who had been selling general merchandise to the construction crews moving his goods from town to town as the work progressed. Shortly after Fifer arrived, the Huntingtons closed up, leaving him alone in the general merchandise business. The Oregon Construction Company followed soon, with a stock of general merchandise, a blacksmith shop, the Pacific Hotel, several boarding houses and restaurants and a number of saloons.</p>
