  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 69,709. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Steubenville</span>. The county is named for <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span>, who was at the time Vice President. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is part of the Weirton-Steubenville, WV-OH <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which is also included in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-WV-OH Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was organized on <span class="date">July 29, 1797</span> by proclamation of Governor <span class="per">Arthur St. Clair</span>, <span class="date">six years</span> before <span class="loc">Ohio</span> was granted statehood. In <span class="date">1786</span>, the <span class="loc">United States</span> built Fort Steuben to protect the government surveyors mapping the land west of the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>. When the surveyors completed their task <span class="date">a few years later</span>, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement <span class="loc">La Belle</span>. When the County was created in <span class="date">1797</span>, <span class="loc">La Belle</span> was selected as the County seat. The town was subsequently renamed <span class="loc">Steubenville</span>, in honor of the abandoned fort. During the first half of the nineteenth century, <span class="loc">Steubenville</span> was primarily a port town, and the rest of the county consisted of small villages and farms. However, in <span class="date">1856</span>, <span class="loc">Frazier</span>, <span class="loc">Kilgore</span> and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the <span class="org">Steubenville Coal and Mining Company</span> sank a coal shaft, resulting in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> becoming one of the leading centers of the new Industrial Revolution.</p><br><br>
