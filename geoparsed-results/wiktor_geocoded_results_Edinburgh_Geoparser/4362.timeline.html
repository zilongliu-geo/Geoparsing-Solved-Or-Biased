  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kelso</span> is a suburb in the <span class="loc">City of Townsville</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, the last of three suburbs along Riverway Drive. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> is the only suburb on Riverway Drive that has homes backing onto the <span class="loc">Ross River</span>. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> was named after Scottish immigrants, and early settlers, <span class="per">Mary</span> and <span class="per">James</span> <span class="loc">Kelso</span>, who had cattle property in <span class="date">1878</span> called <span class="loc">Laudham</span> Park on Five <span class="loc">Head Creek</span>. To make way for construction of the <span class="loc">Ross River</span> Dam in <span class="date">1970</span>, the <span class="loc">Townsville City</span> Council resumed 1620ha of the property's best grazing land. At its peak, <span class="loc">Laudham</span> Park stretched for more than 40,000ha along both banks of the Upper <span class="loc">Ross River</span> to the foothills of <span class="loc">Mount Stuart</span> and out to the Pinnacles part of Hervey Range. Most of what was <span class="loc">Laudham</span> Park is <span class="date">today</span> under water due to the construction of the dam and the rest is <span class="date">now</span> the suburb of <span class="loc">Kelso</span>. The first residential blocks started selling back in <span class="date">1966</span>. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> is connected to <span class="loc">Townsville</span> by the Sunbus <span class="loc">Townsville</span>. This is also a source of transport for most students who go to schools around <span class="loc">Kelso</span> and <span class="loc">Townsville</span>, to and from school.</p><br><br>
