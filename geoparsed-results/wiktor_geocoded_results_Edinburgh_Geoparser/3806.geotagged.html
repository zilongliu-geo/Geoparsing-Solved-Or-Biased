Bethany was founded in 1855 by James Blumer White, however the area was mostly woodland prior to 1850. Homesteaders were moving into Bethany via a land grant from the government during this period of the town's history. The settlers mostly came from <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> and <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. In 1855 Blumer White built the first school house in the town, a small one-room log building, the building was also used as a church. (White being the school-master and J.E. <span class="loc">Dykes</span> being the pastor.) The area's last school to be built was Bethany Consolidated School. It contained grades 1-9 and employed five teachers. There has not been a school in the town since the 1940s.</p>
