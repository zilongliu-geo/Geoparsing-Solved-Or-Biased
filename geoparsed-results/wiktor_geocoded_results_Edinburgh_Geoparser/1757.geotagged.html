<p>Nelson is a city in <span class="loc">Pickens</span> and <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 1,314. It is part of the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> metropolitan area. The city is named for John Nelson, early landowner, farmer, and rifle maker. A railroad line built in 1883 from <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, through the valleys and mountain passes of <span class="loc">Cherokee County</span> to Nelson and Tate, made possible the development of large marble quarries. One of the largest marble veins in the world is in <span class="loc">Pickens County</span>, running at least 4 miles (6 km) long. It is a half-mile deep and almost that wide in places. Over 60 percent of the monuments in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span> are made from <span class="loc">Pickens County</span> marble. The Marble Museum is located in the <span class="loc">Nelson City</span> Hall and features a year-round exhibit that includes "examples of fine marble and shows the history of marble mining in <span class="loc">Pickens County</span>." Many stone cutters and other workers who migrated from either <span class="loc">Italy</span> or <span class="loc">Scotland</span> in the early years of the industry settled in Nelson to work in the area's marble industry. Today the <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Northeastern Railroad operates between Tate, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, and the CSX interchange at Elizabeth (Marietta) five days a week. The <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Marble rail lines at Tate and <span class="loc">Marble Hill</span>, and the Blue Ridge Scenic Railroad at Blue Ridge, <span class="loc">Georgia</span> are also operated by GNRR. Their website also states the "GNRR runs through a <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Marble facility that no is no longer served by rail" at Nelson.</p>
