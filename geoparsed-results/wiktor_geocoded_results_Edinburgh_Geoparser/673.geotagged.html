<p><span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Lane County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located about two miles south of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> and two miles north of <span class="loc">Junction City</span>, on <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 99E near the <span class="loc">Willamette River</span>. The first post office in the area was named Freedom, established in 1858. The name was changed to <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> in 1866 and to <span class="loc">Junction City</span> in 1872. It is likely the office was moved south two miles after the last renaming. About 1852 or 1853, a man named Woody started a "house of entertainment" (aka a roadhouse) at this locale, which he named "Woodyville". It was also known as Woody's Landing. The property was bought by Johnson Mulkey, who built a sawmill at the site and changed the name to <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>. The sawmill was still operating in 1861 and likely longer. Two stores operated at the site, which was chosen for its proximity to the southernmost navigable point on the river and a prosperous agricultural district, with hopes of the place becoming a viable town. The Great Flood of 1862 changed the course of the river, leaving the town too far from the main channel, however, and the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and <span class="loc">California Railroad</span> bypassed <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, so <span class="loc">Junction City</span> became the more important community.</p>
