<p><span class="loc">Kediri</span> is an Indonesian city, located near the <span class="loc">Brantas</span> River in the province of <span class="loc">East Java</span> on the island of <span class="loc">Java</span>. Archaeological artefacts discovered in 2007 appeared to indicate that the region around <span class="loc">Kediri</span> may have been the location of the Kediri kingdom, a Hindu kingdom in the 11th century. The city is a major trade centre for the Indonesian sugar and cigarette industry. The <span class="loc">Brantas</span> River valley was known as the site of classical Javanese culture, particularly between the 10th and 15th centuries. The town of <span class="loc">Kediri</span> was established by King Airlangga on the banks of the upper <span class="loc">Brantas</span> river in 1042. It was originally called Dahanapura or <span class="loc">Daha</span>. After the death of Airlangga his kingdom was divided into two parts: the kingdom of <span class="loc">Panjalu</span> in the west, and the kingdom of <span class="loc">Janggala</span> in the east. <span class="loc">Daha</span> became the capital of <span class="loc">Panjalu</span>, and later the capital of the Kediri kingdom. Over the centuries, control of the city passed to the Singhasari, Majapahit, <span class="loc">Demak</span> and <span class="loc">Mataram</span> kingdoms. The name "Kediri", or "Kadiri", is derived from the Sanskrit word <span class="loc">Khadri</span>, meaning Indian Mulberry, indicative of the mulberry trees (locally known as pac√© or mengkudu) which grew in the area.</p>
