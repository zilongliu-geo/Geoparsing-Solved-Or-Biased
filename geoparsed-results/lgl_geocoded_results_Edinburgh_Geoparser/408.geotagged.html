<p>3 officers treated at hospital after cruisers collide. Three <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> police officers were in stable condition last night at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania after their cruisers collided at 50th Street and Haverford Avenue, authorities said. The officers, whose names were not released, were responding yesterday afternoon to a call for assistance from another police officer who was pursuing a drug suspect at 50th and Arch Streets, according to authorities. A squad car with two officers was traveling west on <span class="loc">Haverford</span> when it collided shortly after 4 p.m. with another police vehicle carrying the third officer south on 50th. The impact pushed one of the vehicles onto the sidewalk. The officers - one was extracted from his car by the Jaws of Life - complained of neck and back injuries and were being evaluated. The narcotics suspect was finally stopped by police but was not found to have any drugs on him.</p>
