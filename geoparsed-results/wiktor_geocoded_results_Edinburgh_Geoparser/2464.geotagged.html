<p><span class="loc">Nanchang</span> (Chinese: 南昌) is the capital of <span class="loc">Jiangxi Province</span> in southeastern <span class="loc">China</span>. As of 2010, a population of 5,042,565 live in the prefecture, in which 2,357,838 live in the built-up area made up of all five urban districts. Located in the north-central part of the province, it is bounded on the west by the <span class="loc">Jiuling</span> Mountains, and on the east by <span class="loc">Poyang Lake</span>. Because of its strategic location connecting the prosperous East and <span class="loc">South China</span>, it has become a major railway hub in Southern <span class="loc">China</span> in recent decades. As the Nanchang Uprising in 1927 is distinctively recognized by the ruling Communist Party as "firing the first gunshot against the evil Nationalists", the current regime has therefore named the city since 1949 "the City of Heroes", "the place where the People's Liberation Army was born", and the most widely known "place where the military banner of the People's Liberation Army was first raised". The territories encompassing modern-day Jiangxi Province—including Nanchang—was first incorporated into <span class="loc">China</span> during the Qin dynasty, when it was conquered from the Baiyue peoples and organized as Jiujiang Commandery (Chinese: 九江郡). In 201 BC, during the Han dynasty, the city was given the Chinese name <span class="loc">Nanchang</span> and became the administrative seat of Yuzhang Commandery (Chinese: 豫章郡), and was governed by Guan Ying (Chinese: 灌嬰), one of Emperor Gaozu of Han's generals. The name <span class="loc">Nanchang</span> means "southern flourishing", derived from a motto of developing what is now southern <span class="loc">China</span> that is traditionally attributed to Emperor Gaozu himself.</p>
