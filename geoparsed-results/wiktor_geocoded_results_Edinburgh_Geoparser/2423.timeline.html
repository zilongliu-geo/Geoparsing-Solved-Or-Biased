The population was 710 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census and 557 as of the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The name (pronounced just like English cake) comes from the Tlingit word Ḵéix̱' (Northern Tlingit) or Ḵéex̱' (Southern Tlingit), which is derived from ḵée “dawn, daylight” and x̱ʼé “mouth”, i.e. “mouth of dawn” or “opening of daylight”. <span class="loc">Kake</span> is located at 56°58′15″N 133°56′2″W (56.970841, -133.933751). <span class="loc">Kake</span> is on the northwest coast of <span class="loc">Kupreanof Island</span> in the <span class="loc">Alexander Archipelago</span> in southeastern <span class="loc">Alaska</span>.
