  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alexandra (MƒÅori: Areketanara) is a town in the Central <span class="loc">Otago district</span> of the <span class="loc">South Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. It is located on the banks of the <span class="loc">Clutha River</span> (at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Manuherikia River</span>), on State Highway 8, 188 kilometres (117 mi) by road from <span class="loc">Dunedin</span> and 33 kilometres (21 mi) south of <span class="loc">Cromwell</span>. At the time of the <span class="date">2006</span> census, the permanent population was 4,827, an increase of 423 since <span class="date">2001</span>. 23.1 per cent of the population (higher than the national average) was aged over 65. The town was founded during the Central Otago goldrush in the 1860s, and was named after Alexandra of <span class="loc">Denmark</span> by <span class="per">John Aitken</span> <span class="loc">Connell</span> who surveyed the town. It was known to miners of the day by several names: the "Lower Township", the "Junction Township", and "Manuherikia". (The "Upper Township" was <span class="loc">Dunstan</span>, <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Clyde</span>.) Many orchards were destroyed in <span class="date">the 1980s</span> as a result of construction, 10 km upriver, of the <span class="loc">Clyde</span> <span class="loc">High Dam</span>, which is the country's third largest hydroelectric power station.</p><br><br>
