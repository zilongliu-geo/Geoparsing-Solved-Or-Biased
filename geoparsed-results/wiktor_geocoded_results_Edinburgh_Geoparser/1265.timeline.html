  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pasadena</span> /ˌpæsəˈdiːnə/ is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, within the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, the city's population is 149,043, making it the seventeenth most populous city in the state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, as well as the second-largest city in <span class="loc">Harris County</span>. The area was founded in <span class="date">1893</span> by <span class="per">John H. Burnett</span> of <span class="loc">Galveston</span>, who named the area after <span class="loc">Pasadena</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, because of the perceived lush vegetation. The <span class="org">Pasadena Volunteer Fire Department</span> is the largest all volunteer municipal fire department in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Prior to European settlement the area around <span class="loc">Galveston Bay</span> was settled by the <span class="loc">Karankawa</span> and Atakapan tribes, particularly the Akokisa, who lived throughout the Gulf coast region. Spanish explorers such as the Rivas-Iriarte expedition and <span class="per">José Antonio</span> de <span class="loc">Evia</span> charted the bay and gave it its name. The pirate <span class="loc">Jean Lafitte</span> established a short-lived kingdom based in <span class="loc">Galveston</span> in the early 19th century with bases and hide-outs around the bay and around <span class="loc">Clear Lake</span>. <span class="loc">Lafitte</span> was forced to leave in <span class="date">1821</span> by the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Navy. Following its declaration of independence from <span class="loc">Spain</span> the new nation of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> moved to colonize its northern territory of <span class="loc">Texas</span> by offering land grants to settlers both from within <span class="loc">Mexico</span> and from the nearby <span class="loc">United States</span>. The colony established by <span class="per">Stephen F. Austin</span> and the <span class="loc">Galveston Bay</span> and <span class="loc">Texas Land</span> Company of <span class="loc">New York</span> rapidly began a wave of settlement around the bay. Following a coup in the Mexican government by General <span class="loc">Antonio Lopez</span> de <span class="loc">Santa Anna</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> revolted against Mexican rule in <span class="date">1835</span>. After several battles and skirmishes the final battle of the <span class="loc">Texas</span> Revolution took place near modern <span class="loc">Pasadena</span> on <span class="date">April 21, 1836</span>. <span class="loc">Santa Anna</span> was captured at Vince's Bayou. Because this was the last conflict that led to the Mexican surrender, <span class="loc">Pasadena</span> and neighboring <span class="loc">Deer Park</span> have adopted the nickname "Birthplace of <span class="loc">Texas</span>".</p><br><br>
