<p><span class="loc">Northampton</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Northampton County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The borough is located in the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley region of eastern <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. As of the 2010 census, Northampton's population was 14,985. <span class="loc">Northampton</span> is located 8 miles (13 km) north of <span class="loc">Allentown</span> and 15 miles (24 km) west of Easton at 40°41′2″N 75°29′29″W (40.683896, -75.491353). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the borough/city has a total area of 2.7 square miles (7.0 km2); 2.6 square miles (6.7 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (3.70%), water. Northampton's elevation is 370 feet (110 m) above sea level. The <span class="loc">Lehigh River</span>, which separates <span class="loc">Northampton County</span> from <span class="loc">Lehigh County</span>, forms the city's western border. <span class="loc">Northampton</span> was once a global center for the manufacturing of cement. The Atlas Portland Cement Company was based there, until it was closed in 1982, due largely to foreign competition. <span class="loc">Northampton</span> was created from the villages of <span class="loc">Siegfried</span>, <span class="loc">Newport</span> and <span class="loc">Stemton</span>, which together were formed into an alliance in 1902. In 1909, Atlas petitioned county courts to change the alliance into a borough, reportedly because the change would make it easier for the company to send and receive mail. The Atlas Portland Cement Company plant closed in 1982, but city residents many of them former Atlas employees or their descendants — still identify strongly with the company and its history. The Atlas Portland Cement Company supplied most of the cement used in the building of the <span class="loc">Panama Canal</span>.</p>
