  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Board appointments go forward aside from discussion. The appointment of residents volunteering to serve on Dublin's boards and commissions is usually a pretty uncomplicated procedure. However, a resolution for the appointments began a discussion among <span class="loc">Dublin City</span> Council members at their <span class="date">Monday, March 16</span> meeting regarding the appointment of a City Council member to the city's <span class="per">Planning</span> and <span class="per">Zoning</span> Commission. During the council's goal-setting retreat in <span class="date">February 2008</span>, council members unanimously approved a motion to appoint a seventh citizen to a commission seat previously held by a council member, with plans to review the new process formally in <span class="date">January</span>. Council members <span class="per">Michael Keenan</span>, Rick <span class="per">Gerber</span> and <span class="per">John</span> <span class="loc">Reiner</span>, along with Mayor Marilee <span class="per">Chinnici-Zuercher</span> and <span class="per">Vice</span> Mayor Cathy Boring voted 'no' to Councilman Tim Lecklider's motion to not make the appointment to the planning and zoning commission until after discussion of the process, with Councilwoman <span class="per">Amy Salay</span> joining Lecklider in voting 'yes.' "We have had a tremendous workload," <span class="per">Chinnici-Zuercher</span> said. "When we made the decision to have this discussion in <span class="date">January</span>, this decision was made before the resignation of our city manager, and our search for a new one. "Boulder City Council offered then <span class="loc">Dublin City</span> Manager <span class="per">Jane Brautigam</span> a position as its city manager <span class="date">Aug. 10, 2008</span>. Her <span class="date">last day</span> in the <span class="loc">Dublin</span> post was <span class="date">Sept. 26, 2008</span>. The national search for a new city manager began <span class="date">Sept. 8</span>, when City Council unanimously approved a motion to engage the services of <span class="per">Thomas Dority</span> Sr., vice president of the Mercer Group, for the recruitment process. The result was the appointment of <span class="per">Terry Foegler</span> as Dublin's city manager, and his first official day of work was <span class="date">Feb. 17</span>. "This discussion is important, but we have had to go to a second tier of consideration," <span class="per">Chinnici-Zuercher</span> said, as she suggested council members discuss the commission issue in a committee of the whole meeting to be scheduled before <span class="date">September</span>. "It clearly needs to be discussed," <span class="per">Keenan</span> said. <span class="loc">Following City</span> Council's disapproval of the motion to exclude the planning and zoning seat from the appointments, it unanimously approved the following appointments:* <span class="per">Chris Amorose</span> <span class="per">Groomes</span> and <span class="per">Flite</span> <span class="loc">Freimann</span>, four-year terms on the <span class="per">Planning</span> and <span class="per">Zoning</span> Commission, expiring <span class="date">March 31, 2013</span>. * <span class="per">Carl Karrer</span>, three-year term on the Architectural Review Board as the <span class="org">Dublin Historical Society</span> representative, and <span class="per">Robert Schisler</span>, three-year term on the ARB as an Historic District merchant representative. Both terms expire <span class="date">March 31, 2012</span>. * <span class="per">Victoria Newell</span> and <span class="per">Brett Page</span>, a three-year term for each on the <span class="org">Board of Zoning Appeals</span>, expiring <span class="date">March 31, 2012</span>. * <span class="per">Patrick Todoran</span>, to the unexpired term of <span class="per">Keith Blosser</span> on the <span class="org">Board of Zoning Appeals</span>, a term which expires on <span class="date">March 31, 2010</span>. * <span class="per">Christine Gawronski</span> and Dona Givens, both reappointed to a three-year term on the Community Services Advisory Commission, expiring <span class="date">March 31, 2012</span>. * <span class="per">Kevin Cooper</span>, three-year term on the Community Services Advisory Commission, expiring on <span class="date">March 31, 2012</span>. * <span class="per">Susan Burness</span>, three-year term as the city representative to the <span class="org">Dublin Convention and Visitors Bureau Board</span>, a term which expires on <span class="date">March 31, 2012</span>. * Jamie <span class="per">Boff</span> and <span class="per">David</span> Cecutti, reappointed to three-year terms on the <span class="per">Parks</span> and <span class="per">Recreation</span> Advisory Commission, expiring <span class="date">March 31, 2012</span>. * DeWayne Howard, three-year term on the Personnel Board of Review, a term which expires on <span class="date">March 31, 2012</span>. "I do not wish to vote 'no,' because of the balance of those folks who have been appointed," <span class="per">Lecklider</span> said, as he cast his 'yes' vote. There is one remaining appointment to be made to the Architectural Review Board, and City Council hopes to complete this appointment at its <span class="date">April 6</span> meeting, <span class="org">Clerk of Council</span> <span class="per">Anne Clarke</span> said via e-mail <span class="date">Tuesday, March 17</span>. Board and commission members will have an orientation and training session at <span class="date">6:30 p.m. Monday, March 30</span> in <span class="loc">Talla</span> 2 at the <span class="org">Dublin Community Recreation Center</span>, 5600 Post Road, <span class="per">Chinnici-Zuercher</span> said.</p><br><br>
