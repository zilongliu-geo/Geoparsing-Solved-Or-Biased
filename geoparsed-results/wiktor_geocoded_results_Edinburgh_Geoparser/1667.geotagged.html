<p><span class="loc">Clark County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Nevada</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 1,951,269, with an estimated population of 2,000,759 in 2012. It is by far the most populous county in <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, accounting for nearly three-quarters of its residents. <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>'s most populous city, has been the county seat since the county was established. The county was formed by the <span class="loc">Nevada</span> Legislature by splitting off a portion of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> on February 5, 1909, and came into existence on July 1, 1909. The <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> Valley, a 600 sq mi (1,600 km2) basin, includes <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> as well as the other primary population center, the unincorporated community of Paradise. Much of the county was originally part of <span class="loc">Pah-Ute County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Territory before <span class="loc">Nevada</span> became a state. The county was named for William Andrews Clark, a Montana copper magnate and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senator. Clark was largely responsible for the construction of the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and Salt Lake Railroad through the area, a factor heavily contributing to the region's early development.</p>
