  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Latifabad</span> (Sindhi: لطيف آباد‎ ,Urdu: لطِيف آباد‎), is a town in the southern suburbs of the <span class="loc">city of Hyderabad</span>, in <span class="loc">Sindh</span>, <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>. <span class="loc">Latifabad</span> is named after the noted Sindhi Sufi poet, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai., its initial denizens were Sindhi but after communal riots in <span class="date">1980s</span> between Sindhi speaking and <span class="loc">Urdu</span> speaking people; it was populated as an extension to the <span class="loc">city of Hyderabad</span> to settle hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees from <span class="loc">India</span> fleeing from anti-Muslim pograms, along with the town of <span class="loc">Qasimabad</span>. The locals that settled the town at its inception were ethnically of a mixed population but as the city experienced its worst ethnic riots between <span class="per">Sindhis</span> and <span class="per">Muhajirs</span> in <span class="date">the 1980s</span>, the city was divided into Sindhi settling the town of <span class="loc">Qasimabad</span> and the Mohajirs settling down in <span class="loc">Latifabad</span>. Serving an ethnic majority of the Muhajir community, the <span class="org">Muttahida Qaumi Movement</span> to grow. The land in <span class="loc">Latifabad</span> was further divided into sectors, sub-classifying it into numbered units. For political rallies, MQM would specify areas in their sector notation rather than the numbered unit. To this date, the classification continues yet people prefer using the numbered units.</p><br><br>
