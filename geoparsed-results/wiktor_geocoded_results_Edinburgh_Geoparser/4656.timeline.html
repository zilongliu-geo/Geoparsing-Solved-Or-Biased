  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Baldwin</span> is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located in the town of <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> in <span class="loc">Nassau County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 24,033 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Baldwin</span> is also a station on the <span class="loc">Babylon</span> <span class="org">Branch of the Long Island Rail Road</span>. Original inhabitants of the area between <span class="loc">Parsonage Creek</span> near <span class="loc">Oceanside</span> and <span class="loc">Milburn Creek</span> near <span class="loc">Freeport</span> were Native Americans known as Merokes, or <span class="loc">Merrick</span>, an Algonquian tribe indigenous to most of the <span class="loc">South Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Long Island</span>, who lived in two villages along <span class="loc">Milburn Creek</span>. In <span class="date">1643</span>, the land became known as Hick's Neck after two of <span class="loc">Hempstead</span>'s early settlers, <span class="per">John Spragg</span> from <span class="loc">England</span> and <span class="per">John Hicks</span> from Flushing, who extended <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> village south to the salt meadows. The grist mill built by <span class="per">John</span> Pine in <span class="date">1686</span> on <span class="loc">Milburn Creek</span> attracted more settlers who engaged in fishing, farming, marshing, raising longwood, and breeding and raising sheep. Between the American Revolutionary War and the War of <span class="date">1812</span>, growing Hick's Neck came to be called the village of <span class="loc">Milburn</span>. The first churches were built in <span class="date">1810</span> and <span class="date">1872</span>, and the first school was built in <span class="date">1833</span>.</p><br><br>
