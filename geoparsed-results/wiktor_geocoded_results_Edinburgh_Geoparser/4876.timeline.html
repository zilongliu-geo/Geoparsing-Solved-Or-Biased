  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Recoleta</span> is a downtown residential neighborhood in the Autonomous City of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>; it is an area of great historical and architectural interest, mostly because of the <span class="loc">Recoleta</span> Cemetery . It is also an important tourist destination and cultural center of the city. It is also one of the most affluent neighborhoods and it is one of the priciest real estate in the city. The <span class="loc">Recoleta</span> is accessible by the “D Line” of the <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> Subway, which passes through the neighborhood. The <span class="loc">Recoleta</span> neighborhood is composed of the area limited by <span class="loc">Montevideo</span> and <span class="loc">Uruguay</span> Streets, Córdoba <span class="per">Avenue, Mario</span> <span class="per">Bravo</span> and <span class="per">Coronel</span> Díaz Streets, Las Heras Avenue, <span class="loc">Tagle</span> Street, the F.G.B.M railway, Jerónimo <span class="loc">Salguero</span> Street, and by the Río de <span class="loc">La Plata</span> or <span class="loc">River Plate</span>. Neighboring communities are <span class="loc">Retiro</span> to the southeast, <span class="per">San Nicolás</span>, <span class="loc">Balvanera</span> and <span class="loc">Almagro</span> to the south, and <span class="loc">Palermo</span> to the northwest, and the <span class="loc">River Plate</span> to the northeast. The name of the neighborhood comes from <span class="org">the Monastery of the Recollect Fathers</span>, members of the Franciscan Order which was established in the area at the beginning of the 18th century. They founded a monastery and a church dedicated to Nuestra Señora del Pilar with a cemetery attached. The <span class="loc">Recoleta</span> pathway is nearly the exact geographic center of the neighborhood, and one of its highest points in the city, which, at the end of the 19th century attracted wealthy families from the south of the city who sought to escape from the deadly yellow fever outbreak which began in <span class="date">1871</span>. From that time on, the <span class="loc">Recoleta</span> has been one of the most stylish and expensive neighborhoods in <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, home to private family mansions, foreign embassies, and luxury hotels, including the <span class="loc">Alvear</span> <span class="loc">Palace Hotel</span>, the most sumptuous in all of Latin <span class="loc">America</span>.</p><br><br>
