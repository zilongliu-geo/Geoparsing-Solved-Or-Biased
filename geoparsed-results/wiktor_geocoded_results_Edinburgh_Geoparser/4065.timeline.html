  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Birmingham</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Oakland County</span> of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span> and a suburb of <span class="loc">Detroit</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 20,103. The city's downtown attracts shoppers from throughout the Metro Detroit area. The area comprising what is <span class="date">now</span> the <span class="loc">city of Birmingham</span> was part of land ceded by Native American tribes to the <span class="loc">United States</span> government by the <span class="date">1807</span> Treaty of <span class="loc">Detroit</span>. However, settlement was delayed first by the War of <span class="date">1812</span> and subsequently by an unfavorable report by the Surveyor-General of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="per">Edward Tiffin</span>, regarding the placement of Military Bounty Lands for veterans of the War of <span class="date">1812</span>. <span class="per">Tiffin</span>'s report claimed that "There would not be an acre out of a hundred, if there would be one out of a thousand that would, in any case, admit cultivation." In <span class="date">1818</span>, Territorial Governor <span class="per">Lewis Cass</span> led a group of men along the Indian Trail. The governor's party discovered that the swamp was not as extensive as <span class="per">Tiffin</span> had supposed. Not long after <span class="per">Cass</span> issued a more encouraging report about the land, interest quickened in its suitability for settlement.</p><br><br>
