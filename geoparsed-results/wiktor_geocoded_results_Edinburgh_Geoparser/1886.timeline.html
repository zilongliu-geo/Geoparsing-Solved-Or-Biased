  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salisbury</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is 11 kilometres (7 mi) south of the <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> central business district. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> was named after the residence of <span class="per">William Coote</span>, an early <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> journalist and political figure, who lived in the area. The name was selected by the railway department when the Sunnybank/South Coast Railway Line opened in <span class="date">1885</span>. The book publishing company <span class="org">Boolarong Press</span> has its headquarters in the suburb. <span class="loc">Toohey</span> Mountain and forest is located on the north east boundary of the suburb. The area remained predominantly rural until after the Second World War. Because of its comparative remoteness, a series of munition factories were built in the area, along what is <span class="date">now</span> Evans Road. The tram line from the city to Moorooka was extended in <span class="date">1941</span> to Evans Road to service these factories. The tram line finally closed on <span class="date">13 April 1969</span>. By <span class="date">the end of October</span> <span class="date">1943</span>, the production of small arms at the Rocklea Factory had ceased and the place was ready for re-occupation and conversion to engine overhaul for the <span class="org">Department of Aircraft Production</span>. Provision was also made for the establishment on the site of the Salisbury Hotel.</p><br><br>
