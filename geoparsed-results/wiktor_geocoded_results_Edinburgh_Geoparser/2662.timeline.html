  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">El Espinal</span> is a Colombian city located in the <span class="org">Department of Tolima</span>, 146 km southwest from Bogotá. It is the second most important city of the department and is the rice capital of the center of the country.

It has a total length of 231 km², an urban area of 4.26 km², and a rural area of 212.74 km². The town is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="loc">Espinal</span>.
