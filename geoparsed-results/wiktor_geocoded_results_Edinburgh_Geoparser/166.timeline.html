  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Fernando</span> is a city located in the <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> Valley, in the northwestern region of <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city was named for the nearby Mission San <span class="per">Fernando Rey</span> de Espa√±a, and was part of the Mexican land grant of <span class="loc">Rancho</span> Ex-Mission <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>. In <span class="date">1874</span> <span class="per">Charles Maclay</span>, <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> founder, bought 56,000 acres (227 km2) of the <span class="loc">Rancho</span>. In <span class="date">1882</span>, cousins George K. <span class="per">Porter</span> and <span class="per">Benjamin</span> F. <span class="per">Porter</span> of future <span class="per">Porter</span> Ranch each received one-third of the total land. In <span class="date">1885</span>, <span class="per">Maclay</span> founded the <span class="org">Maclay School of Theology</span>, a Methodist seminary in his newly founded town of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>. After his death it became an affiliate and moved to the campus of the <span class="org">University of Southern California</span> and then the <span class="loc">Claremont School</span> of Theology. While most of the towns in the surrounding <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> Valley agreed to annexation by <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> in <span class="date">the 1910s</span>, eager to tap the bountiful water supply provided by the newly opened <span class="loc">Los Angeles Aqueduct</span>, <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>'s abundant groundwater supplies allowed it to remain a separate city. Even as the <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> Valley transformed itself from an agricultural area to a suburban one in the <span class="date">decades</span> after World War II, <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> retained its independence.</p><br><br>
