  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Andal</span> is a census town and location of a police station  in Durgapur subdivision of <span class="loc">Bardhaman district</span> in the Indian state of <span class="loc">West Bengal</span>. <span class="loc">Andal</span> is located at 23.60°N 87.20°E﻿ / 23.60; 87.20.
