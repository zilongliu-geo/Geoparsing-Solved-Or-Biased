  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Tapa is a town in <span class="loc">Lääne-Viru County</span>, <span class="loc">Estonia</span>. Located at the junction of the country's Tallinn–Narva (west–east) and Tallinn–Tartu–Valga (north–south) railway lines, it is an important centre of transit for freight (mainly Russian oil and timber) as well as rail passengers (mostly Estonian commuters). A home to soldiers since <span class="date">the 1930s</span>, Tapa also plays an important role in training young men and women in the <span class="org">Estonian Defense Forces</span>. The Valgejõgi River passes Tapa on its northeastern side. Tapa developed as a village probably in the 13th–14th <span class="date">centuries</span>. It was first mentioned in <span class="date">1482</span>, and the Tapa knight manor (Taps) in <span class="date">1629</span>. Tapa was officially recognized as a town in <span class="date">1926</span>. In <span class="date">October 2005</span>, the town merged with the municipalities of <span class="loc">Lehtse Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Saksi Parish</span>, and <span class="loc">Jäneda Parish</span> to form Tapa Parish. Tapa Museum was opened on <span class="date">10 June 2004</span>. The museum, in a <span class="date">1934</span>, two-storey house, collects and exhibits objects, including photos and documents, related to the history and culture of Tapa. All of the objects in the museum reflect the soul of Tapa's citizens, past and present. Temporary exhibits celebrate notable <span class="date">days</span> in Tapa's history and feature hobbies of the town's residents. The permanent collection presents Tapa as a railway, military, and sausage town.</p><br><br>
