<p>Hartford Police Find Guns, Drugs In Raids. Officers seized 1,248 bags of heroin, more than a pound of marijuana and three guns in raids in the city, <span class="loc">Hartford</span> police said Thursday, and arrested 13 people. The series of drug busts started with a bang — literally — about 6:10 a.m. Wednesday as SWAT team members and other officers rammed the door at 44-46 Hungerford St., police said. Police found 259 bags of heroin, 10 grams of marijuana and $4,388 in cash. They also found a stolen 9mm handgun and numerous rounds of ammunition. Four people, all of whom live at 44 Hungerford St., were arrested on drug and other charges: Kenneth Bonilla, 23; Edwin Luciano, 18; Enrique Luciano, 22; and Jose Luciano, 20. The department's Emergency Response Team worked with vice and narcotics detectives and officers in the Southwest Conditions Team to make the arrests.</p>
