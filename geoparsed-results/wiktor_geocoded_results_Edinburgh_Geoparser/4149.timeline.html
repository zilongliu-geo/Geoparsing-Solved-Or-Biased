  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Truro</span> is a town in central <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. <span class="loc">Truro</span> is the shire town of <span class="loc">Colchester County</span> and is located on the south side of the <span class="loc">Salmon River</span> floodplain, close to the river's mouth at the eastern end of <span class="loc">Cobequid Bay</span>. The Mi'kmaq name for the <span class="loc">Truro</span> area, "Wagobagitik" meaning "end of the water's flow", was shortened by Acadian settlers to "Cobequid" who arrived in the area in the early 1700s and by <span class="date">1727</span> had established a small village near the present downtown site of <span class="loc">Truro</span> known as "Vil <span class="loc">Bois Brule</span>" (Village in the burnt wood). Many Acadians in this region left in the Acadian Exodus which preceded the Expulsion of the Acadians in <span class="date">1755</span>, the town was resettled in <span class="date">1761</span> by Presbyterians of predominantly Ulster Scottish origin who came from <span class="loc">Ireland</span> via <span class="loc">New England</span>. It is named after the <span class="loc">city of Truro</span> in <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Originally a small farming community, the construction of the <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> Railway between <span class="loc">Halifax</span>, and <span class="loc">Pictou</span> in <span class="date">1858</span> caused the municipality to experience a fast rate of growth which increased even more when the railway connected to central <span class="loc">Canada</span> in <span class="date">1872</span> and became the Intercolonial Railway. The Intercolonial, which later became the Canadian National Railway built a large roundhouse and rail yard in <span class="loc">Truro</span>. Further rail links to <span class="loc">Cape Breton</span> and to the <span class="loc">Annapolis</span> Valley through the Dominion Atlantic Railway in <span class="date">1905</span> made the town even more a transportation hub for <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>. The railway also attracted industries such as the Truro Woolen Mills in <span class="date">1870</span> (which later became Stanfield's) and provincial institutions like the provincial Normal School (later the <span class="org">Nova Scotia Teachers College</span>) and the <span class="org">Nova Scotia Agricultural College</span>. The town officially incorporated in <span class="date">1875</span>. Many figures from the town's past are featured in over 40 tree sculptures which were carved in tree trunks after <span class="loc">Truro</span> lost most of its Elm trees to Dutch Elm Disease in <span class="date">the 1990s</span>. The history of the town and surrounding county is preserved at the <span class="org">Colchester Historical Museum</span> (c.1900-1901), which is designated under the provincial Heritage Property Act.</p><br><br>
