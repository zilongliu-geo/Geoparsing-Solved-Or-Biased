  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Copacabana</span> is the main Bolivian town on the shore of <span class="loc">Lake Titicaca</span>. The town has a large 16th-century shrine, the Basilica of Our Lady of <span class="loc">Copacabana</span>. Our Lady of <span class="loc">Copacabana</span> is the patron saint of <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>. The town is a destination for tourism in <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>. The town is also known for its famous Basilica, home of the <span class="org">Virgin</span> of <span class="loc">Copacabana</span>, its trout, and its quaint atmosphere. Built between Mount Calvario and Mount Niño Calvario, the town has approximately 6,000 inhabitants. Copacabana's religious celebrations, cultural patrimony, and traditional festivals are well known throughout <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>. Boats leave for <span class="loc">Isla del Sol</span>, the sacred Inca island from <span class="loc">Copacabana</span>. There is the belief that the name is derived from the Aymara kota kahuana, meaning "view of the lake." Nevertheless, the social scientist Mario Montaño Aragón, found in the "archives of Indias" in <span class="loc">Sevilla</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>, a completely different history: "Kotakawana" is the god of fertility in ancient Andean mythology, the equivalent to the classical Greek goddess Aphrodite or the <span class="per">Roman Venus</span>. This god is androgynous and lives in the <span class="loc">Titicaca</span>, and his court consists of creatures (male and female) that are represented in colonial sculptures and in Catholic churches. They were called "Umantuus", known as mermaids in Western culture.</p><br><br>
