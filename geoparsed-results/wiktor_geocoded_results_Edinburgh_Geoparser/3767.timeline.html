  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> is a small unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Steuben Township</span>, <span class="loc">Warren County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. <span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> was platted <span class="date">July 8, 1874</span> by <span class="per">John R. Johnson</span>, Senior, near <span class="loc">Sumner</span> Station. A post office was established there on <span class="date">December 2, 1875</span>, with <span class="per">George W. Johnson</span> as postmaster. As of <span class="date">September 1875</span> there were said to be about 50 people living in the town; there were several businesses including a dry goods store and a tan yard that produced leather. The town also had a druggist, a doctor, a lawyer, a blacksmith, a grain dealer, a railway agent, a tinker, and a boarding-house. As of <span class="date">1913</span>, the population was about 80. The town was established at the intersection of two rail lines: the existing <span class="loc">Toledo</span>, <span class="loc">Wabash</span> and Western Railroad and the new Coal Branch of the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Danville</span> and <span class="loc">Vincennes Railroad</span> (the branch being known as the "Pumpkin Vine" Railroad), which was laid down in <span class="date">1872</span>. The well-chosen location favored the town's success, but trains had stopped running on the Pumpkin Vine by <span class="date">1880</span>, just <span class="date">six years</span> after the town was formally established; and when the rails were removed shortly thereafter, the site's importance was diminished, and the town began to dwindle. The post office closed on <span class="date">August 31, 1907</span>.</p><br><br>
