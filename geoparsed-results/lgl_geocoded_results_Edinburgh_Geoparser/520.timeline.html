  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Firefighters battle <span class="loc">Tega Cay</span> fire. <span class="loc">TEGA CAY</span> &#x97; Local fire departments battled a blaze at a <span class="loc">Point Clear</span> home at 9:30 this morning. The <span class="org">Tega Cay Volunteer Fire Department</span> and Flint Hill Fire Department responded to the blaze, which began in the master bedroom and was contained to that area, according to <span class="loc">Tega Cay</span> Fire Department Chief <span class="per">Scott Szymanski</span>. The entire second floor of the home suffered significant smoke damage, <span class="per">Szymanski</span> added. <span class="per">Alexis Butler</span>, a <span class="date">2000</span> graduate of Fort Mill High School, was the only person home at the time of the fire. Butler was sleeping in the master bedroom when she awoke to smoke filling the room. She said she saw a small fire and tried to put it out with a glass of water she had beside the bed, but quickly realized the fire was spreading too quickly for her to extinguish. She rushed out of the home and called the fire department. The fire was extinguished by approximately 10 a.m., officials said. The cause of the fire is believed to be electrical, <span class="per">Szymanski</span> said. After the fire was out, firefighters spent the morning tossing debris out of the shattered master bedroom window, searching for any “hot spots” that might remain in the home, <span class="per">Szymanski</span> said. Butler and her family, including her mother <span class="per">Diane Butler</span>, who owns the house, will stay with her aunt, <span class="per">Susan Grubb</span>, who also lives in <span class="loc">Tega Cay</span>. As <span class="per">Alexis Butler</span> stood on her neighbor’s lawn, surveying the damage caused by the fire, she wondered aloud about the condition of her clothes, which were inside the bedroom closet. “Can you get the smoke out of clothes?” she asked.</p><br><br>
