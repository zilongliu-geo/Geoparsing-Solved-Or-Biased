  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Paradise is a city in <span class="loc">Russell County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 49. In <span class="date">1859</span>, a hunting party explored the area, including a small tributary of the Saline River which led them to a site abundant in water, timber, and bison. One of the hunters, James R. Mead, described the site as paradise, and the tributary subsequently became known as <span class="loc">Paradise Creek</span>. The first post office in the area opened under the name Paradise in <span class="date">1875</span>. In <span class="date">1887</span>, the <span class="org">Union</span> <span class="org">Townsite Company</span> established a town on the north side of the creek northwest of the post office, naming it <span class="loc">Ivamar</span> after Iva Marr, the daughter of a local rancher. The Paradise post office relocated to <span class="loc">Ivamar</span> <span class="date">the next year</span>, but kept its name. As a result, the town came to be known by both names; in <span class="date">1891</span>, the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific Railroad listed its rail stop there as Paradise with <span class="loc">Ivamar</span> in parentheses. The community grew through the 1890s to include a school, downtown businesses, and railroad facilities, reaching a population of 200 by <span class="date">1910</span>. <span class="loc">Ivamar</span> incorporated in <span class="date">1924</span> and finally changed its name to Paradise. The population of the community has gradually declined since <span class="date">the 1930s</span>.</p><br><br>
