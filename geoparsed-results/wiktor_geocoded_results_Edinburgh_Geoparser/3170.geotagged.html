<p>Lowell is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Idaho County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located at the confluence of the Selway and Lochsa rivers, where they join to form the Middle Fork of the <span class="loc">Clearwater River</span>. The community lies within the <span class="loc">Clearwater National Forest</span> at an elevation of 1,486 feet (453 m) above sea level, and was named after Henry Lowell, its first postmaster. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 12 is the only major highway to serve the community, and occupies the north bank of the Lochsa (and <span class="loc">Clearwater</span>). Lowell is between the three rivers, and is accessed by a bridge over the terminus of the Lochsa on Selway Road. The population of Lowell is 30, and there are several motels, resorts, and campgrounds that swell the population seasonally. The site of the Kooskia Internment Camp (1943–45) is about 6 miles (10 km) upstream of Lowell on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 12, on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Lochsa River</span>. This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Lowell has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated "Csb" on climate maps.</p>
