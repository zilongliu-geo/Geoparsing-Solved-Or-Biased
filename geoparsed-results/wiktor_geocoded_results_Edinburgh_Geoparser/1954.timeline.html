  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a town in Oak Grove Township, <span class="loc">Benton County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. The population was 1,162 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Lafayette</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was <span class="loc">Benton County</span>'s first town. Commissioners appointed by the <span class="org">Indiana General Assembly</span> selected the location in <span class="date">May 1843</span> to be the site of the county seat on land donated by <span class="per">Henry W. Ellsworth</span> and <span class="per">David Atkinson</span>. It was first called <span class="per">Milroy</span> in honor of <span class="per">Samuel Milroy</span>, one of the commissioners, but a town in <span class="loc">Rush County</span> already bore that name. In <span class="date">October 1843</span> the commissioners changed it to <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, after <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> (the home of <span class="loc">Ellsworth</span> and <span class="loc">Watkins</span>), but they discovered this name was also already being used in <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, so in <span class="date">December</span> <span class="per">Judge David J. McConnell</span> awarded the town its present name. Lots went up for sale at this time, with buyers allowed to pay for the lots in three installments over <span class="date">18 months</span>. The first building erected in <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was a two-story, wooden frame courthouse, designed and built by <span class="per">Francis Boynton</span>, and the second was a hotel, built by <span class="per">Henry L. Ellsworth</span> and operated by <span class="per">James L. Hatton</span>. The first home was that of <span class="per">Aaron Wood</span>, who also ran a small store that supplied groceries, beer and whiskey.</p><br><br>
