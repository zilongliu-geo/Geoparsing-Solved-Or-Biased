<p><span class="loc">Dover</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Tuscarawas County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 12,210 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Dover</span> was originally part of a grant to Col. James Morrison of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, who had received it from the federal government for Revolutionary War services. In 1802, two brothers-in-law from <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, Christian Deardorff and Jesse Slingluff, traveled through the area and so admired the potential quality of the land along the confluence of the <span class="loc">Tuscarawas River</span> and <span class="loc">Sugar Creek</span> that they bought 2,000 acres (8.1 km2) of land in 1806 for just over $4,600. The brothers-in-law settled there and the following year laid out the what they hoped would become a prosperous town. By 1818, there were only five buildings in <span class="loc">Dover</span>, including three taverns. The founders had hoped <span class="loc">Dover</span> would become the county seat, but that honor went to the neighboring town of <span class="loc">New Philadelphia</span>. The county grew, even if <span class="loc">Dover</span> did not. The region around Tuscarawas country was settled in large part by ethnic German and Moravian families migrating westward from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. Even today, the local telephone book features many German last names.</p>
