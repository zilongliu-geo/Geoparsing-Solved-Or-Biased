  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Brandon</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Hillsborough County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the Tampa–St. <span class="loc">Petersburg–Clearwater Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the CDP had a total population of 103,483. Its history began on <span class="date">January 20, 1857</span>, when <span class="per">John Brandon</span> (<span class="date">1809</span>–<span class="date">1886</span>) arrived at <span class="loc">Fort Brooke</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Tampa</span>) from <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> with his first wife <span class="per">Martha</span> (<span class="date">1813</span>–<span class="date">1867</span>) and six sons. At first he moved his family to what is <span class="date">now</span> the Seffner area. Then in <span class="date">August 1858</span>, <span class="per">John Brandon</span>, purchased 40 acres (160,000 m2) in the <span class="loc">New Hope</span> area (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Brandon</span>) and 160 acres (0.65 km2) later on and then named his land <span class="per">Brandon</span>. <span class="per">John</span> and his second wife <span class="per">Victoria</span>'s house was located on what would become the corner of <span class="per">Knights</span> and <span class="per">Victoria</span> Street. <span class="date">Four years later</span>, the <span class="loc">New Hope</span> Church was built on land donated by <span class="per">Brandon</span>. Besides being the first church in the community, it also served as <span class="per">Brandon</span>'s first school. In <span class="date">1890</span>, the <span class="org">Florida Central</span> and Peninsula Railroad came through the area, encouraging the people of <span class="loc">New Hope</span> to build a depot on Moon Avenue. Charles S. Noble, a <span class="org">Florida Central</span> and Peninsula Railroad engineer, was asked to plat approximately forty acres of land north of present day State Road 60, South of <span class="loc">Lake Meade</span>, east of Kings Avenue, and west to Parsons Avenue. Filed on <span class="date">April 24, 1890</span>, the surveyor named the community in honor of <span class="per">John Brandon</span> and <span class="per">Noble Street</span> for himself.</p><br><br>
