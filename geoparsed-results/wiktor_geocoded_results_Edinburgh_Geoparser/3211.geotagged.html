<p>Warren is an unincorporated community in the remote north central region of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, near the Frank <span class="loc">Church River</span> of No Return Wilderness. Located within the <span class="loc">Payette National Forest</span> in southern <span class="loc">Idaho County</span>, Warren is northeast of <span class="loc">McCall</span>, approximately 50 miles (80 km) by vehicle and about 30 miles (50 km) by air. South of the <span class="loc">Salmon River</span>, the elevation is 5,906 feet (1,800 m) above sea level. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Warren has a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc). Miners from the previous gold strikes in Pierce and Florence fanned out to the south and discovered gold in the <span class="loc">Warren Creek</span> area in August 1862. It led to the formation of the settlement, then in Washington Territory, making it one of the oldest settlements in present-day <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. With a gold mining boom in multiple regions during the Civil War, the Idaho Territory was established in 1863. Shortly after the gold discovery by Lewiston's James Warren, the Warren's Camp population swelled to over 2,000; the southerners called their area of the camp "Richmond" and northerners called theirs "Washington."</p>
