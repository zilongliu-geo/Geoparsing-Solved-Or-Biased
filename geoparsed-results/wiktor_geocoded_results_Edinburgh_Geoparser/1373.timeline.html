  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Cleveland</span>, a suburb of <span class="loc">Redland City</span>, is located on the western shores of <span class="loc">Moreton Bay</span> approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) east-south-east of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, the capital of <span class="org">the Australian</span> state of <span class="loc">Queensland</span>. It comprises commercial, residential and industrial areas and is the location of <span class="loc">Redland City</span>'s Council Chambers, offices and various cultural facilities. As at the <span class="date">2011</span> Census, <span class="per">Cleveland</span> was estimated to be home to 14,414 people, with the majority of these of working age. There are conflicting reports as to the naming of <span class="per">Cleveland</span>; it was either named in <span class="date">1770</span> by Captain <span class="per">James Cook</span> in honour of <span class="per">John Clevland</span>, <span class="org">the Secretary of the Admiralty</span> around the time, or by surveyors in the 1840s, in honour of William Vane, 1st <span class="per">Duke of Cleveland</span>. European settlement of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> and surrounding areas was banned from <span class="date">1824</span> until <span class="date">1842</span>, due to the <span class="loc">Moreton</span> Bay <span class="loc">Penal Settlement</span>, but the area to become <span class="per">Cleveland</span> was first surveyed in <span class="date">1840</span>, and in <span class="date">1841</span>, was recommended for a maritime or seaport township. In <span class="date">1847</span> a navigation beacon was established at <span class="loc">Cleveland Point</span>. In <span class="date">1847</span>, the Government planned for the new town, and on <span class="date">13 December 1850</span>, <span class="per">Cleveland</span> was proclaimed a township. The first land sales of the new township took place <span class="date">a year later</span>, with early purchases primarily around <span class="loc">Cleveland Point</span>, at the time an early candidate for a major port to replace <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>. <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> was troubled by sand bars across the mouth of the <span class="loc">Brisbane River</span>, and <span class="loc">Cleveland Point</span> was closer to the southern passage (the entrance to <span class="loc">Moreton Bay</span> between <span class="loc">North Stradbroke Island</span> and <span class="loc">Moreton Island</span>).</p><br><br>
