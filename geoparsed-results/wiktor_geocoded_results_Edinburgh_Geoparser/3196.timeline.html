  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Madison</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Norridgewock</span>) is a town in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,855 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The area was once territory of the <span class="loc">Norridgewock</span> Indians, a band of the Abenaki nation. Early visitors describe extensive fields cleared for cultivation. The tribe also fished the <span class="loc">Kennebec River</span>. French Jesuits established an early mission at the village, which was located at <span class="loc">Old Point</span>. But Father Sebastien Rale (or Rasle), appointed missionary in <span class="date">1694</span>, was suspected of abetting the tribe's raids on English settlements. <span class="per">Governor Joseph Dudley</span> put a price on his head. British troops attacked the village in <span class="date">1705</span> and again in <span class="date">1722</span>, but both times Father Rale escaped into the woods. But on <span class="date">August 23, 1724</span>, during Father Rale's War, soldiers attacked the village unexpectedly, killing 26 warriors and wounding 14, with 150 survivors fleeing to <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Among the dead was Father Rale. Settled by English colonists about <span class="date">1773</span>, the land would be surveyed in <span class="date">1791</span>. In <span class="date">1775</span>, <span class="per">Benedict Arnold</span> and his troops would march through <span class="loc">Norridgewock</span> Plantation, as it was known, on their way to the ill-fated Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. The town had originally been settled under the name "<span class="loc">Norridgewock</span> Falls." This was later changed to "Bernardstown," after the major land owning family, the Bernards. It was then officially incorporated on <span class="date">March 7, 1804</span>, the town was named after <span class="loc">United States</span> president <span class="per">James Madison</span>. Farming was an early industry, with hay and cattle the principal products. The native rock is slate, and a quarry was established to extract it. Because of the region's abundant forests, lumbering developed as an industry, with four sawmills operated by water power on the <span class="loc">Kennebec</span>. Here the <span class="loc">Norridgewock</span> Falls drop 90 feet (27 m) over a mile, which attracted other manufacturers as well. In the 19th century, the small mill town had factories which produced carriages, window sash, window blinds, doors and coffins.</p><br><br>
