<p><span class="loc">Paris</span> (French: [paʁi]) is the capital and most populous <span class="loc">city of France</span>. Situated on the Seine River, in the north of the country, it is in the centre of the Île-de-France region, also known as the région parisienne, "<span class="loc">Paris Region</span>". The <span class="loc">City of Paris</span> largely retains its one and a half century old administrative boundaries, with an area of 105 km² (41 mi²) and as of 2014 a population of 2,241,346. Together with its suburbs, the whole agglomeration has a population of 10,550,350 (Jan. 2012 census). <span class="loc">Paris</span>' metropolitan area spans most of the <span class="loc">Paris region</span> and has a population of 12,341,418 (Jan. 2012 census), or one-fifth of the population of <span class="loc">France</span>. The administrative region covers 12,012 km² (4,638 mi²), with approximately 12 million inhabitants as of 2014, and has its own regional council and president. <span class="loc">Paris</span> was founded in the 3rd century BC by a Celtic people called the Parisii, who gave the city its name. By the 12th century, <span class="loc">Paris</span> was the largest city in the western world, a prosperous trading centre, and the home of the University of Paris, one of the first in <span class="loc">Europe</span>. In the 18th century, it was the centre stage for the French Revolution, and became an important centre of finance, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts, a position it still retains today. Since the 19th century, the built-up area of <span class="loc">Paris</span> has grown far beyond its administrative borders.</p>
