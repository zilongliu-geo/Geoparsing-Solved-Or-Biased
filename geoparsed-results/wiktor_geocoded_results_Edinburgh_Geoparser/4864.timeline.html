  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Agua Prieta</span> (Opata: Bachicuy) is a town in <span class="loc">Agua Prieta</span> Municipality in the northeastern corner of the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Sonora</span> (31°19′33″N 109°32′56″W). It stands on the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>–<span class="loc">Mexico</span> border, adjacent to the town of <span class="loc">Douglas</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The municipality covers an area of 3,631.65 km² (1,402.2 sq mi). In the <span class="date">2010</span> census the town had a population of 79,138 people, making it the seventh-largest community in the state, and a literacy rate of 96.3%. 89% of the homes in the city have electricity, 94% have running water, and 86% are connected to the sewer system. The city's most important economic activities, in descending order, are industry, commerce and farming. The city is the location of the CFE <span class="loc">Agua Prieta</span> power plant. <span class="loc">Agua Prieta</span> began growing at the end of the 19th century as railroads were built between <span class="loc">Douglas</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, and <span class="loc">Nacozari</span>, <span class="loc">Sonora</span>, to transport minerals. As a result, the first settlers of the town were those employed by the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> mining company Phelps Dodge Corporation, which was based in <span class="loc">Douglas</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. The town was founded in <span class="date">1899</span> as the Commissary of <span class="loc">Fronteras</span>, but did not become an independent municipality with its current name until <span class="date">August 28, 1916</span>. Rodolfo L. Márquez was the new municipality's first president. It rose to the status of villa (town) on <span class="date">May 8, 1933</span>, and it was officially placed in the category of city relatively recently, on <span class="date">November 11, 1942</span>.</p><br><br>
