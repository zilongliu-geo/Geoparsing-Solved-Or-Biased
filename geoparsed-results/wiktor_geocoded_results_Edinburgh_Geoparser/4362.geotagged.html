<p><span class="loc">Kelso</span> is a suburb in the <span class="loc">City of Townsville</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, the last of three suburbs along Riverway Drive. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> is the only suburb on Riverway Drive that has homes backing onto the <span class="loc">Ross River</span>. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> was named after Scottish immigrants, and early settlers, Mary and James <span class="loc">Kelso</span>, who had cattle property in 1878 called <span class="loc">Laudham</span> Park on Five <span class="loc">Head Creek</span>. To make way for construction of the <span class="loc">Ross River</span> Dam in 1970, the <span class="loc">Townsville City</span> Council resumed 1620ha of the property's best grazing land. At its peak, <span class="loc">Laudham</span> Park stretched for more than 40,000ha along both banks of the Upper <span class="loc">Ross River</span> to the foothills of <span class="loc">Mount Stuart</span> and out to the Pinnacles part of Hervey Range. Most of what was <span class="loc">Laudham</span> Park is today under water due to the construction of the dam and the rest is now the suburb of <span class="loc">Kelso</span>. The first residential blocks started selling back in 1966. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> is connected to <span class="loc">Townsville</span> by the Sunbus <span class="loc">Townsville</span>. This is also a source of transport for most students who go to schools around <span class="loc">Kelso</span> and <span class="loc">Townsville</span>, to and from school.</p>
