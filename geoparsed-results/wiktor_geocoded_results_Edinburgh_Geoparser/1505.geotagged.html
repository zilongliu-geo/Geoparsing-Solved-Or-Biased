<p>Livingston is the name of a town in Izabal Department, eastern <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>, at the mouth of the Río Dulce at the <span class="loc">Gulf of Honduras</span>. The town serves as the municipal seat of the municipality of the same name. It was <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>'s main port on the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span> before the construction of nearby <span class="loc">Puerto Barrios</span>. Livingston is noted for its unusual mix of Garífuna, Afro-Caribbean, Maya and Ladino people and culture. In recent decades Livingston has developed a large tourist industry. Livingston is named after American jurist and politician Edward Livingston who wrote the Livingston Codes which -translated into Spanish by liberal leader José Francisco Barrundia- were used as the basis for the laws of the liberal government of the <span class="loc">United Provinces</span> of Central <span class="loc">America</span> in the early 19th century. This government did not came to fruition in <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>, however, because of the conservative and clerical revolution led by Rafael Carrera in 1838 that overthrew governor Mariano Galvez and gave way to a conservative and Catholic regime that lasted until 1871 in <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>. There is a large demand within <span class="loc">Guatemala</span> and some of its neighbors for edible oils and fats, which would explain how the African oil palm became so prevalent in the country in detriment of other oils, and which has allowed new companies associated to large capitals in a new investment phase that can be found particularly in some territories that form the Northern Transversal Strip of <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>. The investors are trying to turn <span class="loc">Guatemala</span> into one of the main palm oil exporters, in spite of the decline on its international price. The most active region is found in <span class="loc">Chisec</span> and Cobán, in Alta Verapaz Department; Ixcán in Quiché Department, and Sayaxché, Petén Department, where Palmas del Ixcán, S.A. (PALIX) is located, both with its own plantation and those of subcontractors. Another active region is that of Fray Bartolomé de las <span class="loc">Casas</span> and <span class="loc">Chahal</span> in Alta Verapaz Department; <span class="loc">El Estor</span> and <span class="loc">Livingston</span>, Izabal Department; and <span class="loc">San Luis</span>, Petén, where Naturaceites operates.</p>
