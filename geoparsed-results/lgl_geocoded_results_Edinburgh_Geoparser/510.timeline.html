  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Incarcerated father misses daughter's funeral. <span class="per">Megan Gildow</span> brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. ST. <span class="per">PARIS</span> â€” While hundreds of mourners paid their last respects to <span class="per">Cassie Karg</span> and three other children who died in a recent trailer fire in St. <span class="per">Paris, Cassie</span>'s father mourned the loss in a prison cell in Orient, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. Family members, prison officials and funeral home staff provided different stories about why <span class="per">Ricky Karg Jr.</span> was unable to visit his daughter one last time before she was buried <span class="date">last weekend</span>. <span class="per">Karg</span>, who is serving a sentence on charges of receiving stolen property and failure to comply, was told of his daughter's death during a visitation period on <span class="date">March 23</span>, <span class="date">about two days</span> after the fire, said <span class="per">Jackie Rutherford</span>, his sister and <span class="per">Cassie</span>'s aunt. While the family and the funeral home requested that he be allowed to visit his daughter, the request was eventually denied, she said. Instead, she said, <span class="per">Karg</span> wrote a letter that was placed in his daughter's casket during a viewing <span class="date">Friday</span>. "He's not a hardened criminal and I think he should have had a chance to see his daughter," <span class="per">Rutherford</span> said. The public viewing was scheduled to take place at <span class="org">Graham Middle School</span>, but the correctional facility's policy prohibits inmates from visiting schools, said <span class="per">Angela Hill</span>, a public information officer at the reception center. The facility also tried to schedule a private viewing, <span class="per">Hill</span> said, but prison officials were not able to do so because the funeral home was unable to provide a specific time when the casket would be available. "Because there were so many factors, we weren't able to make the arrangements, which had to be done in advance to allow (<span class="per">Ricky Karg</span>) to get to a private viewing," <span class="per">Hill</span> said. But <span class="per">Dave Vernon</span>, director of <span class="org">Vernon's Funeral Home</span> in <span class="loc">Urbana</span>, said he tried to work with the state and the family to coordinate a special visit, going as far as offering to transport the casket to <span class="loc">Mechanicsburg</span>, where it would be closer to the Correctional Reception Center in Orient where <span class="per">Ricky Karg</span>. Jr. is incarcerated. "It wasn't a matter of scheduling on our behalf," he said.</p><br><br>
