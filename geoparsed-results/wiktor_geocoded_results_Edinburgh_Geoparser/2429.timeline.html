  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bloomington</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Bernardino County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 23,851 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 19,318 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. Though <span class="date">now</span> unincorporated, many of the town's political activists are pushing for <span class="loc">Bloomington</span> to attain cityhood, while the nearby <span class="loc">cities of Rialto and Fontana</span> are attempting to annex the community. The incorporation effort is led by the BIC, the <span class="org">Bloomington Incorporation Committee</span>. <span class="loc">Bloomington</span> was originally developed as part of the land holdings of the Semi-Tropic Land and Water Company, which was formed in <span class="date">1887</span>. In <span class="date">1907</span>, the <span class="org">Riverside Portland Cement Company</span> built a large plant near the Crestmore Quarries (<span class="loc">South Bloomington</span>), and to provide transportation for employees built a standard gauge railroad to Riverside. On <span class="date">May 20, 1911</span> the line was opened to <span class="loc">Bloomington</span>. The original community, known as <span class="loc">Crestmore</span>, is generally located between Locust Avenue and Larch Avenue, south of <span class="loc">Jurupa Avenue</span>, extending to the <span class="loc">Riverside County</span> line. The Pacific Electric Crestmore Line (Riverside-Rialto) provided local service for <span class="date">many years</span>. The Semi-Tropic Land and Water Company (<span class="date">now</span> known as West Valley Water District) laid out the town sites of <span class="loc">Bloomington</span>, <span class="loc">Rialto</span>, <span class="loc">Fontana</span>, and Sansevaine. The town site for <span class="loc">Bloomington</span>, after being surveyed in <span class="date">April, 1888</span>, was bounded on the north by Valley Boulevard, on the south by Slover Avenue, on the east by Larch Avenue, and on the west by Linden Avenue.</p><br><br>
