  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Flores</span> is one of the <span class="loc">Lesser Sunda Islands</span>, an island arc with an estimated area of 14,300 km² extending east from the Java island of <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>. The population was 1,831,000 in the <span class="date">2010</span> census and the largest town is <span class="loc">Maumere</span>. <span class="loc">Flores</span> is Portuguese for "flowers". <span class="loc">Flores</span> is located <span class="loc">east of Sumbawa</span> and <span class="loc">Komodo</span> and west of Lembata and the Alor Archipelago. To the southeast is <span class="loc">Timor</span>. To the south, across the Sumba strait, is <span class="loc">Sumba</span> and to the north, beyond the <span class="loc">Flores Sea</span>, is Sulawesi. On <span class="date">12 December 1992</span>, an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale occurred, killing 2,500 people in and around <span class="loc">Maumere</span>, including islands off the North coast. In <span class="date">September 2003</span>, at Liang <span class="loc">Bua</span> Cave in western <span class="loc">Flores</span>, paleoanthropologists discovered small skeletons that they described as a previously unknown hominin species, Homo floresiensis. These are informally named hobbits and appear to have stood about 1 m (3.3 ft) tall. The most complete individual (LB1) is dated as <span class="date">18,000 years</span> old. Portuguese traders and missionaries came to <span class="loc">Flores</span> in the 16th century, mainly to <span class="loc">Larantuka</span> and <span class="loc">Sikka</span>. Their influence is still discernible in <span class="loc">Sikka</span>'s language, culture and religion. The first Portuguese visit took place in <span class="date">1511</span>, through the expedition of António de <span class="loc">Abreu</span> and his vice-captain <span class="per">Francisco Serrão</span>, en route through the Sunda islands.</p><br><br>
