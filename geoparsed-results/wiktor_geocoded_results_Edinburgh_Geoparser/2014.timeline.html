  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lawrence</span> is the sixth largest city in the state of <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Douglas County</span>. Located in northeastern <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, it is approximately 25 miles east of <span class="loc">Topeka</span>, and 35 miles west of the Missouri state border. <span class="per">Lawrence</span> is situated along the banks of the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and <span class="loc">Wakarusa Rivers</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city's population was 87,643. <span class="per">Lawrence</span> is a college town and is the home to the <span class="org">University of Kansas and Haskell Indian Nations University</span>. <span class="per">Lawrence</span> was founded by the <span class="org">New England Emigrant Aid Company</span> and was named for <span class="per">Amos Adams Lawrence</span> who offered financial aid and support for the settlement. <span class="per">Lawrence</span> was central to the Bleeding <span class="loc">Kansas</span> era and was the site of the <span class="org">Wakarusa War</span>, the sacking of <span class="per">Lawrence</span>, and the <span class="per">Lawrence</span> Massacre. <span class="per">Lawrence</span> had its beginnings as a center of <span class="loc">Kansas</span> politics. However, its economy soon diversified into many industries including agriculture, manufacturing, and ultimately education, beginning with the founding of the <span class="org">University of Kansas</span> in <span class="date">1866</span>, and later <span class="org">Haskell Indian Nations University</span> in <span class="date">1884</span>. Prior to <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory being opened to settlement in <span class="date">May 1854</span>, most of <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> was part of the Shawnee Indian Reservation. The <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trail followed the <span class="loc">Kansas River</span> through what would become <span class="per">Lawrence</span> and Mount Oread was used as a landmark and an outlook.</p><br><br>
