  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Waco /ˈweɪkoʊ/ is a city which is the county seat of <span class="loc">McLennan County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is situated along the <span class="loc">Brazos River</span> and I-35, halfway between <span class="per">Dallas</span> and <span class="per">Austin</span>. The city had a <span class="date">2010</span> population of 124,805, making it the 22nd-most populous city in the state. The <span class="loc">US</span> Census <span class="date">2014</span> population estimate is 130,194. The <span class="loc">Waco Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area consists of <span class="loc">McLennan</span> and Falls Counties, which had a <span class="date">2010</span> population of 234,906. <span class="loc">Falls County</span> was added to the Waco MSA in <span class="date">2013</span>. The <span class="loc">US</span> Census <span class="date">2014</span> population estimate for the Waco MSA is 260,430. Indigenous peoples occupied areas along the river for <span class="date">thousands of years</span>.

In <span class="date">1824</span>, Thomas M. Duke explored the area and reported to <span class="per">Stephen F. Austin</span>, describing the Waco village: "This town is situated on the <span class="loc">West Bank</span> of the River. They have a spring almost as cold as ice itself. All we want is some <span class="per">Brandy</span> and <span class="per">Sugar</span> to have Ice Toddy. They have about 400 acres (1.6 km2) planted in corn, beans, pumpkins, and melons and that tended in good order. I think they cannot raise more than One Hundred Warriors."</p><br><br>
