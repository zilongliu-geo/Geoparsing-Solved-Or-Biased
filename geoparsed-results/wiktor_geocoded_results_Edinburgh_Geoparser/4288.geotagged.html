<p>Kirkwood (formerly, Kirk, Kirkwood's, and <span class="loc">Roundtop</span>) is a census-designated place in Alpine and Amador counties, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 158 at the 2010 census. Kirkwood's main attraction is the Kirkwood Mountain Resort. The town is accessible by State Route 88. Kirkwood is within the Eldorado National Forest. Zack Kirkwood, a cattle rancher who had settled in the area, opened an inn, named Kirkwood's, in 1863 with the opening of the Amador/Nevada Wagon Toll Road, the primary route through the <span class="loc">Sierra Nevada Mountains</span>. The following year, <span class="loc">Alpine County</span> was created and the redrawing of the county borders placed the inn at the convergence of Alpine, <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>, and <span class="loc">Amador</span> counties (the borders were later changed so the inn is no longer in El <span class="loc">Dorado County</span>, but the original signpost marking the intersection of the three is still in the building). Eventually, the inn became a fashionable summer resort. After Zack's death, the inn stayed in the family and continued to operate until 1966, when it was sold to an investment group, who then converted it into the present-day Kirkwood Mountain Resort.</p>
