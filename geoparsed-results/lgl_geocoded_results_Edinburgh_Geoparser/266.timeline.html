  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Three Readington Township Boy Scouts become Eagles. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, the highest advancement rank in Scouting, a Boy Scout must fulfill requirements in the areas of leadership, service and outdoor skills. They must earn at least 21 merit badges, and must also demonstrate leadership skills by holding one or more positions of responsibility in the troop at each rank. Another step on the road to Eagle was to plan, develop and carry out a service project. <span class="per">Hyland</span>, son of <span class="per">Susan</span> and <span class="per">William Hyland</span>, led a service project to build picnic tables and park benches in strategic locations along the Bouman-Stickney interpretive trail loop at the <span class="org">Farmstead Museum</span> in Readington Township. Patrick worked with the <span class="org">Readington Township Open Space Committee</span> to identify requirements, research design and construction options, estimate costs and prepare a project plan. The project was funded through grant money awarded to the township by the Federal Highway Administration. Patrick is a senior at <span class="org">Hunterdon Central Regional High School</span>.</p><br><br>
