  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Union County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 28,961. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Union. The county was created in <span class="date">1785</span>. <span class="loc">Union County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Spartanburg</span>, <span class="loc">SC</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Greenville–Spartanburg–Anderson, <span class="org">SC Combined Statistical Area</span>. The area that includes <span class="loc">Union County</span> was once controlled by the Cherokee Indians and they used it as a hunting ground. Up until <span class="date">recent years</span>, one could find numerous arrowheads with little effort throughout the county. The first European settlers in <span class="loc">Union County</span> came from the backcountry of <span class="per">Virginia</span> and <span class="per">Pennsylvania</span>; more than three-fourths were Scotch-Irish Presbyterians. It has been suggested that the first group of pioneers arrived as early as <span class="date">1751</span>. They settled in the northwestern section of the county near a small river that would later be named <span class="loc">Fairforest Creek</span>. According to tradition, a member of the party looked out at the thick woodlands and exclaimed, "What a fair forest!" At the time of their arrival, wild buffalo and horses abounded as well as panthers and cougars, which were called "tigers" or "tygers" by the settlers. This may be where the <span class="loc">Tyger River</span> got its name.</p><br><br>
