  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Bathurst /ˈbæθəst/ is a regional city in the Central Tablelands of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is approximately 200 kilometres (120 mi) west of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and is the seat of the <span class="org">Bathurst Regional Council</span>. <span class="loc">Bathurst</span> is the oldest inland settlement in <span class="loc">Australia</span> and had an estimated population of 35,391 as at <span class="date">June 2014</span>. <span class="loc">Bathurst</span> is often referred to as the Gold Country as it was the site of the first gold discovery and where the first gold rush occurred in <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="date">Today</span> education, tourism and manufacturing drive the economy. The internationally known racetrack <span class="loc">Mount Panorama</span> is a landmark of the city. <span class="loc">Bathurst</span> has an historic city centre with many buildings remaining from the gold rush period of the mid to late 1800s. The median age of the city's population is <span class="date">34.0 years</span>; which is particularly young for a regional centre (the state average is 36.4), and is related to the large education sector in the community. Population growth has reached 1.6% per annum over <span class="date">the five years</span> until <span class="date">2010</span>, making <span class="loc">Bathurst</span> the seventh fastest growing regional city in NSW. This growth over <span class="date">recent years</span> has resulted in increased urban development including retail precincts, sporting facilities, housing estates and expanding industrial areas.</p><br><br>
