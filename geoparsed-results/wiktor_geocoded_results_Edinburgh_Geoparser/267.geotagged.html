<p>Magdalena is a village in <span class="loc">Socorro County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 926 in 2012. "The Lady on the Mountain" is a rock formation on Magdalena Peak overlooking Magdalena. Spanish soldiers saw the face of a woman on the west face of the peak. A priest with them was reminded of a similar peak in <span class="loc">Spain</span> called "<span class="loc">La Sierra</span> de <span class="loc">Maria Magdalena</span>", so he called the <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> one "<span class="loc">La Sierra</span> de Magdalena". The pass to the south of the peak became known as <span class="loc">Magdalena Gap</span>, and when a town grew up it received the same name. Magdalena has sought to transform itself into an art center and cultural destination, with the opening of several art galleries and the Magdalena Hall Hotel and the renovation of the Bank West building. Several rock and mineral shops have been around since the mining boom days. The ghost town of Kelly and two festivals, the Lady Magdalen Art Walk and the Old Timers Reunion and Rodeo, bring tourists to the area. In June 2013 the main village well stopped yielding water, leading to a period of conservation during which other <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> communities and organizations donated drinking and stock water for distribution to residents until local wells were brought back into operation later in the year.</p>
