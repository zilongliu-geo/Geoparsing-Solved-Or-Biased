  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Augusta</span> is a town on the south-west coast of Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, where the <span class="loc">Blackwood River</span> emerges into <span class="loc">Flinders Bay</span>. It is the nearest town to <span class="loc">Cape Leeuwin</span>, on the furthest southwest corner of <span class="org">the Australian</span> continent. In the <span class="date">2001</span> census it had a population of 1,091; by <span class="date">2011</span> the population of the town was 1,292 (excluding <span class="loc">East Augusta</span>). The town is within the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River local government area, and is in the <span class="loc">Leeuwin Ward</span>. It is connected by public transport to <span class="loc">Perth</span> via Transwa coach service SW1. <span class="loc">Augusta</span> was a <span class="date">summer</span> holiday town for many during most of the twentieth century, but late in <span class="date">the 1990s</span> many people chose to retire to the region for its cooler weather. As a consequence of this and rising land values in the Augusta-Margaret River area, the region has experienced significant social change. The coastline near the Augusta area was first sighted by Europeans in <span class="date">March 1622</span> when the Dutch <span class="loc">East India</span> Company ship <span class="per">Leeuwin</span> (Lioness) mapped and named the land north of <span class="loc">Cape Leeuwin</span> between <span class="loc">Hamelin Bay</span> and <span class="loc">Point D'Entrecasteaux</span> 't <span class="per">Landt van de Leeuwin</span>. In <span class="date">1801</span> Captain <span class="per">Matthew Flinders</span> named the "south-western, and most projecting part of <span class="per">Leeuwin</span>'s Land" <span class="loc">Cape Leeuwin</span>.</p><br><br>
