  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Campo is a municipality in the <span class="loc">district of Vallemaggia</span> in the canton of <span class="loc">Ticino</span> in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. In the 15th century, the Valle di Campo along with <span class="loc">Cevio</span>, <span class="loc">Bignasco</span> and <span class="loc">Cavergno</span> formed the Roana Superior, a kind of administrative district. Until <span class="date">1513</span>, Campo belonged to the <span class="loc">parish of Cevio</span>. <span class="per">Cimalmotto</span> and <span class="per">Niva</span> separated from Campo's church in <span class="date">1767</span> to form an independent parish. They also formed independent political municipalities until the beginning of the 19th century. The church of <span class="per">S. Bernardo</span> in Campo was probably built in the 14th century. In the first half of the 16th century, in <span class="date">1620</span> and 1740-45 it was enlarged. It contains frescoes by Giuseppe Mattia Borgnis (<span class="date">1745</span>), who also worked on the churches of <span class="loc">Cimalmotto</span> and <span class="loc">Niva</span>, the Baroque chapel of <span class="loc">San Giovanni</span> and the facade of Palazzi Pedrazzini. In the 17th and 18th <span class="date">Centuries</span>, the lack of arable land caused a strong migratory flow toward <span class="loc">Germany</span> and <span class="loc">Italy</span>. Some of the residents, especially merchants and emigrants, became wealthy. Many of the village buildings were richly decorated with frescoes. At this time a wealthy and influential middle class emerged with political and religious power. Currently, a few families still work in agriculture. The majority of houses in the village are second homes. Even in the 18th century the area was popular as a holiday destination. Since <span class="date">1850</span>, the population has declined with many residents moving to the cities. The great distances (42 km (26 mi) from <span class="loc">Locarno</span>) and adverse road make it difficult for the village to become a commuter town.</p><br><br>
