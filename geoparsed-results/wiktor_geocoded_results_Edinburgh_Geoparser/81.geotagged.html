<p><span class="loc">San Jose</span> is a fifth-class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Romblon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. Its territory is contiguous with <span class="loc">Carabao Island</span>, otherwise known as <span class="loc">Hambil</span> Island, the southernmost island of the province. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 10,294 people. Throughout much of its Spanish and American colonial history, the island and its inhabitants repeatedly changed hands between the political jurisdictions of <span class="loc">Romblon</span> and <span class="loc">Capiz</span> provinces, before becoming a separate municipality of <span class="loc">Romblon</span> in 1969. Majority of the town's inhabitants speak Onhan, a Western <span class="loc">Visayan</span> language also spoken in some parts of <span class="loc">Aklan</span> in <span class="loc">Panay Island</span>. <span class="loc">San Jose</span> is located near the resort island of Boracay. The original settlers of the island were the Aetas, locally known as <span class="loc">Ati</span> or <span class="loc">Ita</span> who were believed to have descended from Orang Asli, the aboriginal people of the <span class="loc">Malay Peninsula</span> in mainland <span class="loc">Asia</span>. The aborigines came to the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> during the Paleolithic period by way of land bridges that connected the archipelago to mainland <span class="loc">Asia</span>. The Aetas settled in different parts of <span class="loc">Panay Island</span> and on the southern portion of <span class="loc">Tablas Island</span>, including <span class="loc">Carabao Island</span> where <span class="loc">San Jose</span> is located.</p>
