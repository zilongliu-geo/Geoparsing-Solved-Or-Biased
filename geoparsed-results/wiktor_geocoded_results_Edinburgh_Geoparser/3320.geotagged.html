<p>Paradise is the name of an area at approximately 5,400 feet (1,600 m) on the south slope of <span class="loc">Mount Rainier</span> in <span class="loc">Mount Rainier</span> National Park in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The area lies on the border of Pierce and Lewis counties and includes the Paradise Valley and the Paradise Glacier which is the source of the <span class="loc">Paradise River</span>. Virinda Longmire named Paradise in the summer of 1885 while she viewed the wildflowers in the alpine meadows there. Paradise also offers views of <span class="loc">Mount Rainier</span> and the Tatoosh Range. Paradise is the most popular destination for visitors to Mount Rainier National Park. 62% of the over 1.3 million people who visited the park in 2000 went to Paradise. The road from the Nisqually entrance of the National Park to Paradise (State Route 706) is one of the few roads in the park open to automobiles in the winter. Paradise is the location of the historic Paradise Inn (built 1916), Paradise Guide House (built 1920) and Henry M. Jackson Visitor Center (built 1966; replaced 2008; original building demolished 2009). The inn is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The historic center of Paradise was designated the Paradise Historic District.</p>
