  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Clinton couple faces multiple drug counts. CLINTON — A town couple — neighbors of First Selectman <span class="per">William Fritz</span> and with no history of drug trafficking — was charged with multiple counts of selling narcotics, police said. <span class="per">Jeff Plancon</span>, 52, and Lyn <span class="per">Plancon</span>, 48, of 18 <span class="loc">Sunnybrook</span> Lane, have been selling cocaine and painkillers from their home for at least <span class="date">the four months</span> town police and the state police narcotics task force have had them under investigation, police said. With no criminal history of any sort, the Plancons were “flying under the radar” that usually would have alerted police to their drug business, Police Chief <span class="per">Joseph Faughnan</span> said. But town and state police were able to gain entry to the Plancons’ trade and make multiple purchases of narcotics from them, police said. Police believe the Plancons were buying the narcotics in <span class="loc">New Haven</span> and then selling them to a network of Shoreline customers. Police characterized it as a fairly small operation. In a police raid at their home <span class="date">Thursday</span>, the Plancons were arrested on warrants charging each with four counts of selling narcotics and one count of conspiring to sell narcotics.</p><br><br>
