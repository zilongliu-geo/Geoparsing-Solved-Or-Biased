  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Yuma</span> (<span class="loc">Cocopah</span>: Yuum) is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Yuma County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located in the southwestern corner of the state, and the population of the city was 93,064 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from the <span class="date">2000</span> census population of 77,515. <span class="loc">Yuma</span> is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Yuma</span>, <span class="loc">AZ</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of <span class="loc">Yuma County</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the <span class="date">2014</span> estimated population of the <span class="loc">Yuma</span> MSA is 203,247, though more than 85,000 retirees make <span class="loc">Yuma</span> their <span class="date">winter</span> residence. The area's first settlers were Native American tribes whose descendants <span class="date">now</span> occupy the <span class="loc">Cocopah</span> and Quechan reservations. In <span class="date">1540</span>, expeditions under <span class="per">Hernando de Alarcon</span> and <span class="per">Melchior Diaz</span> visited the area and immediately saw the natural crossing of the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> as an ideal spot for a city, as the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> narrows to slightly under 1,000 feet wide in one small point. Later military expeditions that crossed the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> at the <span class="loc">Yuma</span> Crossing include <span class="loc">Juan Bautista</span> de <span class="loc">Anza</span> (<span class="date">1774</span>), the Mormon Battalion (<span class="date">1848</span>) and the California Column (<span class="date">1862</span>).</p><br><br>
