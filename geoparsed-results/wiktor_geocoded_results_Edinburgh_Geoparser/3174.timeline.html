  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fremont</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Fremont Township</span>, <span class="loc">Steuben County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,138 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Settled in <span class="date">1834</span> as <span class="loc">Willow Prairie</span>, it became the Village of <span class="loc">Brockville</span> when it was platted in <span class="date">1837</span>. In <span class="date">1848</span>, it was renamed to honor <span class="per">John C. Frémont</span>, "the Great Pathfinder", in part because there was already a <span class="loc">Brockville</span> in <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. In <span class="date">1914</span>, the first hospital in <span class="loc">Steuben County</span> was opened in <span class="loc">Fremont</span> by <span class="per">Dr. Wade</span>. <span class="loc">Fremont</span> is located at 41°43′52″N 84°55′57″W, four miles east of the interchange between Interstate 69 and the <span class="loc">Indiana</span> Toll Road (Interstate 80/90) on State Road 120. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="loc">Fremont</span> has a total area of 2.22 square miles (5.75 km2), of which 2.21 square miles (5.72 km2) (or 99.55%) is land and 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2) (or 0.45%) is water. As an oddity, someone traveling due east from <span class="loc">Fremont</span> crosses into Michigan—not into <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. This is due to the early 19th century Ohio-Michigan boundary dispute over <span class="loc">Toledo</span> (q.v. <span class="org">Toledo War</span> for details).</p><br><br>
