  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rock Island</span> is an unincorporated community in the northeastern-most portion of <span class="loc">Warren County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town is named after an island on the <span class="loc">Caney</span> <span class="loc">Fork River</span> just below the confluence of the <span class="loc">Rocky River</span>. <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> is home to the Great Falls Dam and <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> State Park.

In <span class="date">1793</span>, in the latter part of the Cherokeeâ€“American wars, a skirmish was fought at <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> between a small contingent of soldiers pursuing several Chickamaugas, who had reportedly stolen horses.
