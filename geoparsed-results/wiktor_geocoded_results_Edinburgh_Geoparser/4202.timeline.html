  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Alcala</span> (Pangasinan: <span class="org">Baley na</span> <span class="loc">Alcala</span>; <span class="loc">Ilocano</span>: Ili ti <span class="loc">Alcala</span>), is a third class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Pangasinan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 41,077 people with land area of 5,508 hectares. <span class="loc">Alcala</span> recently broke the world record for longest grill measuring about 3 kilometres (9,840 ft). What is known <span class="date">now</span> as <span class="loc">Alcala</span> was formerly a barrio of <span class="loc">Bayambang</span>, formerly called "Dangla", a vernacular term referring to a medicinal shrub which grows abundantly in the place. As a barrio, it was subdivided into several smaller units called sitios, namely: Bugyao, <span class="loc">Bacud</span>, <span class="loc">Cupi</span>, <span class="loc">Bitulao</span>, <span class="loc">Guinawedan</span>, <span class="loc">Anulid</span>, <span class="loc">Cabicalan</span>, <span class="loc">Pindangan</span>, <span class="loc">Camanggaan</span> and <span class="loc">Sinabaan</span> On <span class="date">April 1, 1873</span>, the settlers established a community. They submitted a petition calling for the cessation of <span class="loc">Dangla</span> into a separate township, but it took <span class="date">more than two years</span> for the Spanish Authorities to take notice of the settlers' demands. Finally, on <span class="date">September 20, 1875</span>, a Royal Decree No. 682 was issued making the place an official municipality to be named <span class="loc">Alcala</span>, the name of a town in <span class="loc">Spain</span> where the then Governor of <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span> hailed from.</p><br><br>
