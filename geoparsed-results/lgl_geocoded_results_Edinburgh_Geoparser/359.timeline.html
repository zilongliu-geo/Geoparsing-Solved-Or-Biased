  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Council backs rival ecotown plan. Councillors backed their own plan for a rival ecotown to the proposed Weston Otmoor scheme despite a stormy meeting tonight. It devised the scheme as a rival to the original plan to build 15,000 homes near <span class="loc">Weston-on-the-Green</span>. <span class="loc">Cherwell</span> claims Weston Otmoor would damage <span class="loc">Bicester</span> and <span class="loc">Kidlington</span>, while its own plan would benefit the former. But villagers and landowners mounted angry opposition at tonight's meeting, rounding on the north west option's chief architect, Cherwell leader <span class="per">Barry Wood</span>. They have complained the scheme was drawn up without consulting them. <span class="per">Patrick Woodrow</span>, of <span class="loc">Bucknell</span>, told <span class="per">Mr Wood</span> to "find his spine" and stand up to housing minister <span class="per">Margaret Beckett</span>. Landowner Rosemary Henson, of <span class="loc">Himley</span> farm in Chesteron, said: "I bitterly resent being thrown to the wolves as a decoy to divert attention from <span class="loc">Weston</span> Otmoor." But Mr <span class="per">Wood</span> said the development would represent prosperity and investment in <span class="loc">Bicester</span>. He added the infrastructure <span class="loc">Bicester</span> desperately needed would only come with a large scale development like the north west <span class="loc">Bicester</span> proposal. Councillors backed the move to officially put <span class="loc">North West Bicester</span> in front of the Government as a better option to Weston Otmoor. A shortlist of ecotowns is expected to be drawn up in the <span class="date">summer</span>.</p><br><br>
