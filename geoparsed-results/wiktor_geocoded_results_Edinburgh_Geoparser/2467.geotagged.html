<p><span class="loc">Liverpool</span> is a Canadian community and former town located along the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> of the Province of Nova Scotia's <span class="loc">South Shore</span>. It is situated within the Region of Queens Municipality which is the local governmental unit that comprises all of <span class="loc">Queens County</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>. <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>'s harbour was an ancient seasonal camp of <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>'s native Mi'kmaq and was known as Ogomkigeak meaning "dry sandy place" and Ogukegeok, meaning "place of departure". Samuel de Champlain originally named the harbour Port Rossignol, in honour of Captain Rossignol, an early 17th-century founder of New <span class="loc">France</span> in <span class="loc">North America</span> who used the harbour for fur trading. Later Nicolas Denys, a pioneering 17th-century French explorer and trader of <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>, was granted land here by the leader of Acadia, Isaac de Razilly (c. 1632). Following the Expulsion of the Acadians during the French and Indian War (1754–1763), <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> was founded by New <span class="loc">England</span> Planters (commercially organized settlers) as a fishing port in 1759, originally named Lingley after Admiral Charles Lingley, and then renamed after <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> in <span class="loc">England</span> – which also lies along its own <span class="loc">Mersey River</span>. Silvanus Cobb was an original proprietor of the town. In 1759 Capt. Cobb became a proprietor of the new township of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>. <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> township was to run from <span class="loc">Cape Sable Island</span> to Port Medway and continuing 14 miles inland from the shore. Sylvanus transported many of the other original residents to the new settlement. On July 1, 1760, at the first meeting of the proprietors, Capt. Cobb made a petition to be granted a piece of land to build a house and a wharf. The land was granted and the house was built at the foot of present day <span class="loc">Wolfe</span> Street. There is a park and monument to <span class="loc">Cobb</span> at the site of his original home which was built from materials he transported from <span class="loc">New England</span>.</p>
