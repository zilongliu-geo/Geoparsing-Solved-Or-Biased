  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Columbia</span> /kəˈlʌmbiə/ is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Boone County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Founded in <span class="date">1820</span> as the county seat and home to the <span class="org">University of Missouri</span>, it had a <span class="date">2014</span> estimated population of 116,906, and it is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Columbia Metropolitan</span> Area, the state's fourth most populous metropolitan area. As a midwestern college town, the city has a reputation for progressive politics, public art, and powerful journalism. The tripartite establishment of <span class="org">Stephens College</span> (<span class="date">1833</span>), the <span class="org">University of Missouri</span> (<span class="date">1839</span>), and <span class="org">Columbia College</span> (<span class="date">1851</span>) has long made the city a center of education, culture, and athletic competition. These three schools surround Downtown Columbia on the east, south, and north; at the center is <span class="org">the Avenue of the Columns</span>, which connects Francis <span class="per">Quadrangle</span> and <span class="per">Jesse</span> Hall to the <span class="loc">Boone County</span> Courthouse and the City Hall. Originally an agricultural town, the cultivation of the mind is <span class="org">Columbia</span>'s chief economic concern <span class="date">today</span>. Never a major center of manufacturing, the city also depends on healthcare, insurance, and technology businesses. Several companies; such as Shelter Insurance, Carfax, and Slackers CDs and Games among them; were founded in the city. Cultural institutions include the State Historical Society of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, the <span class="org">Museum of Art and Archaeology</span>, and the annual True/False Film Festival. The <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Tigers, the state's only major athletic program, play football at <span class="loc">Faurot</span> Field and basketball at Mizzou Arena as members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC).</p><br><br>
