<p><span class="loc">Dundee</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Northern Territory</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, located approximately 125 km (78 mi) southwest of Darwin on a peninsula between the <span class="loc">Timor Sea</span> and <span class="loc">Bynoe Harbour</span>. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> consists of three separate localities: <span class="loc">Dundee</span> Beach on the <span class="loc">Timor Sea</span>, <span class="loc">Dundee Forest</span> in the central peninsula and <span class="loc">Dundee</span> Downs adjacent to <span class="loc">Bynoe Harbour</span> in the east. The localities are named after the original subdivisions, believed to be in reference to the film "Crocodile" <span class="loc">Dundee</span>. The permanent population is estimated at approximately 400 residents. Development in the area began in the 1990s, originally as a weekend retreat for Darwin residents. The local economy is still largely dependent on tourism, with fishing being the main attraction. Community services and amenities include a small school established in 1998, a volunteer fire brigade and several sporting and social clubs. The town is situated in an unincorporated area with no local government; however, the possibility of <span class="loc">Dundee</span>'s being included in an expanded Coomalie Shire has been raised in recent times. Currently, a volunteer progress association represents the interests of <span class="loc">Dundee</span> residents to the <span class="loc">Northern Territory</span> Government.</p>
