<p>Rincon is a town in <span class="loc">Effingham County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,836 at the 2010 census, up from 4376 at the 2000 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Savannah Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Rincon, in the southeast area of <span class="loc">Effingham County</span>, was incorporated as a city as recently as 1927. While the earliest settlers came to the area in 1751, its existence as a full-fledged community with families and businesses dates back to the late 19th century. The origin and development of Rincon really got its start with the coming of the railroad. Around the time of the turn of the 20th century a rail line was built from the <span class="loc">Carolinas</span> across the state line at the <span class="loc">Savannah River</span> and southward to Savannah. The name of the city is believed to have had its origin from the Spanish or Mexican name "Rincón", after a small but prosperous town in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. (Rincón means "corner.") Once the railroad and depot were built, a telegraph operator or agent is known to have been on duty as early as about 1895. This opened up the area to communication. With the coming of the railroad and service to Rincon and the combined availability of the "dirt" road (now State Highway 21) between Savannah and Rincon and beyond, and other country roads between farms and the town and outlying other towns, Rincon became a small hive of activity. The surrounding farmers, sawmill operators and the like, who "wagoned" their products, cotton and lumber, to Savannah, now could "wagon" to the Rincon railhead for shipment. They also could receive shipments and travel as rail passengers.</p>
