<p>Weston is a township situated 5 km (3.1 mi) inland from <span class="loc">Oamaru</span>, <span class="loc">South Island</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. It is regarded as one of the more affluent townships of the <span class="loc">Waitaki District</span> and had a population of 730 in the 2006 census. Weston has some of the largest sporting grounds in the <span class="loc">Oamaru region</span>, with the Weston Domain having a full size cricket oval, two football pitches and two rugby union fields, accompanied by a large pavilion and public garden/recreation area. Weston is home to the largest <span class="loc">Oamaru</span> stone quarry in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, supplying <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> and exporting much overseas. The quarry lies a further mile inland from Weston, so its daily operation is not noticed by Weston residents. International cement manufacturer Holcim has gained consent to open a cement plant near Weston, involving further limestone quarrying. The application prompted the founding of the Waiareka Preservation Society, which opposes the planned plant. Society members are worried how potential extra traffic through the township would impact on roading infrastructure. However, Holcim has stated a preference for rail transport between the cement works and harbour and would seek to reopen the line to Weston.</p>
