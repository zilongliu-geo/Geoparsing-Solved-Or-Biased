<p><span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Huron</span> and <span class="loc">Richland</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The population was 1,857 at the 2010 census. The <span class="loc">Richland County</span> portion of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Mansfield Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, while the <span class="loc">Huron County</span> portion is part of the Norwalk Micropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> was laid out in 1825. It was incorporated as a village in 1834. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> was formerly the headquarters of the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> Locomotive Works, a builder of industrial railroad locomotives. The factory closed in 1999. The company designed and built an automobile named <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> in the early part of the century, but it was not mass-produced, but there were trucks and tractors produced by Commercial Motor Truck Company under the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> name in the same period. Later, Chrysler Motors developed the Plymouth Automobile Division, but thought the Ohio company had infringed on their name. A court battle ensued over the ownership of the name <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, which Chrysler lost when it was determined the original <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> car preceded Chrysler's by several years. During the Great Depression, the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> Locomotive Plant designed and built the famous <span class="loc">Silver King</span> (originally the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>) tractor, a somewhat maligned favorite of local farmers and known for its fast road gear. The tractors were produced until the 1950s when it was sold to Mountain State Engineering in <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> and then discontinued. The village hosts the annual <span class="loc">Silver King</span> Festival during the first week of August when restored Silver Kings tractors from around the world are displayed.</p>
