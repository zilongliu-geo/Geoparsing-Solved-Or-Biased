  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Indiana</span> Governor <span class="per">Mike Pence</span> dropped his former opposition to needle exchange programs and on <span class="date">Tuesday</span> signed legislation passed by lawmakers on <span class="date">April 29</span> — <span class="date">the last day</span> of the state's legislative session — that would allow local health departments, municipalities, counties, or nonprofit organizations to implement needle exchange programs. The debate about the controversial programs came on the heels of an HIV outbreak in southern <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. Austin, in <span class="loc">Scott County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, was the epicenter of the outbreak. The number of new HIV positive cases in <span class="loc">Scott County</span> in this outbreak rose past 140. <span class="per">Governor Pence</span> declared the outbreak a public health emergency on <span class="date">March 26</span>, and at the same time approved a 30-day needle exchange program. Pence since offered a 30-day extension as the number of HIV positive cases continued to rise. Needle exchange programs provide clean needles in exchange for dirty needles. The sharing of dirty needles has been linked to the outbreak. Experts like <span class="per">Chris Beyrer</span>, president of the International AIDS Society, support needle exchange programs. <span class="per">Beyrer</span> told the Indianapolis Star, however, that temporary measures, like the one Pence implemented on <span class="date">March 26</span>, don't solve the long-term problem. The World Health Organization and <span class="org">the Centers for Disease Control</span> and Prevention also recommend needle exchange programs. But experts say long-term needle exchange programs are needed. The HIV epidemic in southern <span class="loc">Indiana</span> has been linked to a drug problem in <span class="loc">Scott County</span>. HIV and Hepatitis C are blood-borne viruses that spread by way of bodily fluids and bloodstream injections, especially when more than one person is using the same needle. Legislators on the committee responsible for Senate Bill 461 heard testimony <span class="date">last week</span> before voting. Representative <span class="per">Thomas Washburne</span>, Republican, <span class="loc">Evansville</span>, told Wikinews on <span class="date">April 27</span> that he was involved in conversations pertaining to needle exchange programs. "I am inclined to follow the recommendations of <span class="org">the Centers for Disease Control</span> in implementing needle exchanges," <span class="per">Washburne</span> said in an interview with Wikinews. "My vote against Senate Bill 461 was not due to the needle exchanges, but other issues involved in the bill." House members passed the bill 80–19, senators 38–11. After legislators passed the bill, <span class="per">Pence</span> told WISH-TV: "From my perspective, the focus needs to be on health emergencies. I have throughout my career not supported needle exchanges as anti-drug policies. But with regard to addressing an epidemic, which is what we’ve seen in <span class="loc">Scott County</span>, which is unprecedented in any rural part of the country. I was prepared to support that through executive action." <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, about 35 miles south of Austin, was the first <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> municipal government to approve a needle exchange program. The <span class="org">Louisville Metro Council</span> voted 22–0 to approve the program on <span class="date">April 23</span>. That approval requires reconsulting the council before actually implementing such a program. About 195 cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span> have adopted similar programs. <span class="per">Dr. William Shaffner</span>, a doctor and chair of the <span class="org">Department of Preventative Medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee</span>, told Wikinews reporters <span class="date">March 25</span> at the <span class="org">University of Southern Indiana in Evansville</span>, the day before Pence declared the public health emergency, such a program would make sense. He said the best course of action would be to "block and tackle." "Needle exchange programs ought to be used," <span class="per">Shaffner</span> said. "They have been proven to work and do not cause an increase in drug use."</p><br><br>
