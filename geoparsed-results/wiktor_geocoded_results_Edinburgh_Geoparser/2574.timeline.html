  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> is an industrial city in eastern <span class="loc">Contra</span> <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> in the <span class="loc">East Bay</span> region of the San Francisco Bay Area. The population was 63,264 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In <span class="date">1849</span>, <span class="per">Colonel Jonathan D. Stevenson</span> (from <span class="loc">New York</span>) bought the <span class="loc">Rancho</span> <span class="loc">Los Medanos</span> land grant, and laid out a town he called <span class="loc">New York of the Pacific</span>. By <span class="date">1850</span>, this venture failed. With the discovery of coal in the nearby town of <span class="loc">Nortonville</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, the place became a port for coaling, and adopted the name <span class="loc">Black Diamond</span>, after the mining firm that built the <span class="loc">Black Diamond</span> Coal Mining Railroad from there to <span class="loc">Nortonville</span>. Because of the industrial potential of the site, a name change to <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> was proposed in <span class="date">1909</span>. <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span>, originally settled in <span class="date">1839</span>, was called first "New <span class="loc">York</span> Landing", then "<span class="loc">Black Diamond</span>", before citizens voted on "Pittsburg" on <span class="date">February 11, 1911</span>. The name "Pittsburg" has at least two origins. First, it was the name of a coal mining company that built a railroad in <span class="date">1865</span> on the eastern edge of what is <span class="date">now</span> the city. Second, some citizens wanted to honor <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, (without the "H"), because of the city's relations with the steel building industry, which was first established by the <span class="org">Columbia Geneva Steel Company</span>. The original town site fronts on the Sacramento/San Joaquin River Delta, reflecting its origins as a deep water channel river port. (As of <span class="date">January 1, 2007</span>, state legislation [Assembly Bill <span class="date">2324</span>] enabled the city to manage its own riverfront for commercial development and subsequent port operations).</p><br><br>
