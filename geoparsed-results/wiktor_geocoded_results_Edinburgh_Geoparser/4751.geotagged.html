<p><span class="loc">Cordova</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Walker County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the 2000 census the population was 2,423. <span class="loc">Cordova</span> was originally a settlement on the Mulberry Fork of the <span class="loc">Black Warrior River</span> called "Dent" or "Dent's Place." The city was dubbed "Cordova" by Captain Benjamin M. Long in 1859. He named the city after a city in <span class="loc">Mexico</span> in which he was stationed during the Mexican War. Long himself opened a mercantile shop in the city and helped lure other industries into the city by providing the land necessary for their operations. The company that had the biggest impact on the City was Nashua Manufacturing Company out of <span class="loc">Nashua</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, who brought in the Indian Head Textile Mills. The mill brought with it many jobs, and as was customary of the day its own village. The company built over 100 houses in the city, many of which are still standing, and occupied today. The company even built the <span class="loc">Indian Head</span> school on the site of present day "Cordova Health and Rehabilitation Center." The mill helped to bring two major railways to the city, which at the time helped connect the city to much of the surrounding area. The mill eventually became its own "town" and even had its own separate police force. Indian Head Mills was one of the most highly awarded textile mills during World War II. Their products were found to be above all standards set forth by the government by the War Department. The Mill was referred to by the residents as the Cordova Spinners. The same way the mill shaped the city around the turn of the 20th century it also shaped it upon its closing in the middle of the century. Population declined and industry slowed, while neighboring Jasper took a strong hold on the county seat as the largest city in the county.</p>
