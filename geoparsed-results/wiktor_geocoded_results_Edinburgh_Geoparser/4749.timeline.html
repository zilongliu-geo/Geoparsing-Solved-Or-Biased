  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cordova</span> is a community in <span class="loc">Shelby County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Cordova</span> lies east of <span class="loc">Memphis</span>, north of <span class="loc">Germantown</span>, south of <span class="loc">Bartlett</span>, and northwest of <span class="loc">Collierville</span> at an elevation of 361 feet (110 meters). The majority of <span class="loc">Cordova</span> has been annexed by the <span class="loc">City of Memphis</span>. The remainder of <span class="loc">Cordova</span> is in unincorporated <span class="loc">Shelby County</span>, in the <span class="loc">Memphis</span> Annexation Reserve area. The boundaries of the Cordova community are inexact, but are generally regarded as the <span class="loc">Wolf River</span> on the south, Whitten Road on the west, Interstate 40 on the north, and Pisgah Road on the east. Parts of <span class="loc">Shelby Farms</span> are considered part of <span class="loc">Cordova</span>. The <span class="org">Old Cordova Area</span> is centered on <span class="loc">Macon</span> and <span class="loc">Sanga Roads</span>, 3 miles east of <span class="loc">Germantown Road</span>. It consists of the former town of <span class="loc">Cordova</span>, with some of the original structures still present. The <span class="org">Wolfchase Area</span> is not actually a part of <span class="loc">Cordova</span>, but is often referred to as part of the Cordova area by association. It contains major shopping centers, businesses and apartments. <span class="loc">Cordova</span> was a farming village east of <span class="loc">Memphis</span> with fewer than a dozen farms when it was founded in <span class="date">1835</span>. <span class="loc">Cordova</span> was renowned for the freshly cut flowers that were shipped to <span class="loc">Memphis</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> thus the town's motto was "Farms, Flowers and Fellowship".</p><br><br>
