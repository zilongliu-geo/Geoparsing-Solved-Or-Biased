  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mirik</span> is a picturesque tourist spot nestled in the serene hills of <span class="loc">Darjeeling district</span> in <span class="loc">West Bengal</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>. The name <span class="loc">Mirik</span> comes from the Lepcha words Mir-Yok meaning "place burnt by fire". <span class="loc">Mirik</span> has become a popular tourist destination for its climate, natural beauty and easy accessibility. The centre of all attraction is the Sumendu lake, surrounded by a garden on one side and pine trees on the other and linked together by an arching footbridge called Indreni Pull (Rainbow Bridge). A 3.5-km-long road encircles the lake and is used for walks with the view of Kangchenjunga on the far horizon. Boating on the quaint shikaras and pony riding are available. Mirik Bazar began a commercial centre of the region where people from the surrounding villages and tea gardens came to trade and buy their necessities. The present lake area was a marshland with thick growth of sweet flag (Acorus calamus, locally called bojho). A playground stood in the present garden area where the British officers played polo. In <span class="date">1969</span>, the <span class="loc">West Bengal</span> tourism department began the process of acquiring 335 acres of land from the neighbouring Thurbo tea estate. The work of developing this land into a tourist spot began in <span class="date">1974</span> when <span class="per">Siddhartha Shankar Ray</span> was the chief minister of <span class="loc">West Bengal</span>. The tourist spot, which included the newly built lake and the Day Centre, was inaugurated by the next chief minister of <span class="loc">West Bengal</span>, <span class="per">Jyoti Basu</span>, in <span class="date">April 1979</span>. With the flourishing of tourism, <span class="loc">Krishnanagar</span> developed on the other end of the lake with hotels and restaurants catering to tourists.</p><br><br>
