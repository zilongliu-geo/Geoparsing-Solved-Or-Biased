The district has a population of 6,869, although the town itself is about 500. It can swell to 5,000 people or more during the tourist season and during special holidays.

Towns belonging to the district besides <span class="loc">Tamarindo</span> are <span class="loc">Villarreal</span>, <span class="loc">Santa Rosa</span>, Garita Nueva, Hernández and San José de <span class="loc">Pinilla</span>. Playa Tamarindo is a long, rocky beach, with excellent waves near the mouth of the estuary. Currents can be strong, especially on a falling tide. <span class="loc">Tamarindo</span> has two main breaks for advanced surfers: Pico Pequeño a rocky point in front of the Hotel Tamarindo Diriá and the excellent river mouth break across from Cabinas Tsunami called <span class="loc">El Estero</span>. The rest of the beach breaks are perfect for learning. The biggest waves can get up to 12 feet, although only during November and December. <span class="loc">Playa Grande</span> beach is also where the Leatherback Turtle comes to lay its eggs. The leatherbacks take over the beach from November to April, digging their nests up to one meter deep, lay their eggs and cover the pit with sand, and return once again to the sea. After 60 to 90 days, the hatchlings emerge and immediately make their way to the water.</p>
