<p><span class="loc">Dover</span> is an unincorporated community on the banks of <span class="loc">Mission Creek</span> in <span class="loc">western Shawnee County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Founded in 1860, it was once a larger community, but it declined for most of the 20th century. Today a few commercial buildings remain at the intersection of K-4 Highway and 57th Street, but it is mainly a residential area. A newly founded Dover Community Foundation has been created to support the growth of the community and retention of its history. Camp Daisy Hindman, a rather large Girl Scout camp, is located 2 miles south of the town. 1Â½ miles west of town is a 50 ft high cliff known as Echo Cliff. Settlers came in the year 1856. The Sage and Bassett families in <span class="loc">Dover</span> came from <span class="loc">Somersetshire</span>, <span class="loc">Bristol</span>. <span class="loc">Dover</span> was made a voting precinct of Auburn township, October 1, 1860, and in the fall of 1867, was erected into a township. E.M. Hewins was the first trustee; Jacob Haskell and George Harden, Justices. The first postmaster was Alfred Sage, appointed in 1862. The family name, Sage, is still widespread in the area today.</p>
