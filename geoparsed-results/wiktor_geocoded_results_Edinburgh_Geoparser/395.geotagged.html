<p>Lincoln is a town in <span class="loc">Grafton County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the second-largest town by area in <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. The population was 1,662 at the 2010 census. The town is home to the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Highland Games and to a portion of Franconia Notch State Park. Set in the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span>, large portions of the town are within the White Mountain National Forest. The Appalachian Trail crosses in the northeast.

In 1764, Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth granted 32,456 acres (131.34 km2) to a group of approximately 70 land investors from <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. Lincoln was named after Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle, 9th Earl of Lincoln â€“ a cousin of the Wentworth governors. He held the position of comptroller of customs for the port of <span class="loc">London</span> under George II and George III, which was important to trade between <span class="loc">America</span> and <span class="loc">England</span>.</p>
