<p><span class="loc">Falmouth</span> is the chief town and capital of the <span class="loc">parish of Trelawny</span> in <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>. It is situated on <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>'s north coast 18 miles east of <span class="loc">Montego Bay</span>. It is noted for being one of the Caribbean's best-preserved Georgian towns. Founded by Thomas Reid in 1769, <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> flourished as a market centre and port for forty years at a time when <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> was the world's leading sugar producer. It was named after <span class="loc">Falmouth</span>, <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, the birthplace of Sir William Trelawny, the Governor of <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>, who was instrumental in its establishment. The town was meticulously planned from the start, with wide streets in a regular grid, adequate water supply, and public buildings. It even had piped water before New <span class="loc">York City</span>. During the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> was one of the busiest ports in <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>. It was home to masons, carpenters, tavern-keepers, mariners, planters and others. It was a wealthy town in a wealthy parish with a rich racial mix. Within the parish, nearly one hundred plantations were actively manufacturing sugar and rum for export to <span class="loc">Britain</span>. <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>, during this period, had become the world's leading sugar producer.</p>
