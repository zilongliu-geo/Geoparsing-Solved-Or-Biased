  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 51,599. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Malone</span>. The county is named in honor of American Founding Father <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Malone</span>, <span class="loc">NY</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. Much of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is within the <span class="loc">Adirondack</span> Park. Its Canadian borders are the <span class="loc">provinces of Quebec and Ontario</span>. <span class="loc">When counties</span> were established in <span class="loc">New York</span> in <span class="date">1683</span>, the present <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> was part of <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of <span class="loc">New York</span> State as well as all of the present State of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> and, in theory, extending westward to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. This county was reduced in size on <span class="date">July 3, 1766</span> by the creation of <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, and further on <span class="date">March 16, 1770</span> by the creation of <span class="loc">Gloucester County</span>, both containing territory <span class="date">now</span> in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. On <span class="date">March 12, 1772</span>, what was left of <span class="loc">Albany County</span> was split into three parts, one remaining under the name <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. One of the other pieces, <span class="loc">Charlotte County</span>, contained the eastern portion.</p><br><br>
