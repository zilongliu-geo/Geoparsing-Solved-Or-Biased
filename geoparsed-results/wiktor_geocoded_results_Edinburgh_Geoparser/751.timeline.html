  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Windsor</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Broome County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,247 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is on the south border of the county and is east of <span class="loc">Binghamton</span>. The town includes the village of <span class="loc">Windsor</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Windsor</span> is the largest in the county. This area along the <span class="loc">Susquehanna</span> had long been settled by varying cultures of indigenous peoples, including those of the historic <span class="loc">Iroquois</span> Confederacy, who used the river for transportation, water and fishing. Around 1712 remnants of the <span class="loc">Tuscarora</span> tribe settled in the northern part of the town. Also an Iroquoian-speaking people, they had migrated from <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, which they left because of warfare with English colonists and other tribes. In <span class="date">1722</span>, the <span class="loc">Tuscarora</span> were accepted by the <span class="loc">Iroquois</span> as the Sixth Nation of their political confederacy. Their fortified village, Onaquaga, was an outpost of the British Colonies. A mission had been established there by the Indian Superintendent, Sir <span class="per">William Johnson</span>. Mohawk and other allies of the British also became established there. <span class="per">Joseph Brant</span> used it as a base for his Volunteers, which fought with the British during the American Revolutionary War. In retaliation for joint British and <span class="loc">Iroquois</span> raids on frontier communities, the Continental Army attacked and destroyed Onaquaga in <span class="date">October 1778</span>.</p><br><br>
