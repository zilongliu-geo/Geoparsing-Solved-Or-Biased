  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Franklin</span> is a town in <span class="org">Franklin</span> Township, <span class="loc">Macon County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, within the <span class="loc">Nantahala National Forest</span>. The population was 3,845 as of the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Macon County</span>. <span class="org">Franklin</span> is an official <span class="loc">Appalachian</span> Trail-friendly destination. The <span class="org">Franklin</span> area is rich in gems and minerals and is known locally as the "Gem Capital of The World." Long before the first European settlers arrived to the mountains of southwestern <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, they were home to the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> Indian Nation. In a valley surrounded by some of the oldest mountains on earth, the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> called the area that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="org">Franklin</span>, "Nikwasi" or "center of activity". Nikwasi was an ancient and important <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> town. The remains of Nikwasi Mound are still visible in downtown <span class="org">Franklin</span>, marking the location of Nikwasi's townhouse. While the mound was probably built during the earlier Mississippian Culture, it was the spiritual center of the area. A Council House, or Town House, used for councils, religious ceremonies, and general meetings, was located on top the mound, and the ever-burning sacred fire, which the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> had kept burning since the beginning of their culture, was located there. Thus the mound was a most revered site.</p><br><br>
