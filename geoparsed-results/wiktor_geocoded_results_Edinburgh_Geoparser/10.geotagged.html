<p><span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa <span class="loc">Fe County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 423 at the 2000 census. The area that was later to be occupied by the village of <span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span> de la Cañada is located 25 miles northwest of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and a half-mile east of Española, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> at 5,655 feet AMSL, and UTM NAD 83, Z-13S, 404927E, 3983643N in the valley of the <span class="loc">Santa Cruz River</span> half-mile from its confluence with the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>. Upon arrival of Spanish conquistadores in 1540, the <span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span> area was inhabited by <span class="loc">Tewa</span> speakers (descendants of "Ancestral Puebloans," formerly referred to as "Anasazi"), and after <span class="loc">Vargas</span>' "reconquests" (of the Pueblo Revolt) of 1692 and 1696, by southern <span class="loc">Tewa</span> (or <span class="loc">Tano</span>) who had been relocated from the <span class="loc">Galisteo</span> Basin, 45 miles south, as a result of <span class="loc">Vargas</span>' Spanish repopulation efforts on behalf of the Spanish Crown. Among the best reference materials for this history is: "The Pueblo Indian Revolt of 1696 and the Franciscan Missions in <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>" by J. Manuel Espinosa (1991).</p>
