<p><span class="loc">Sabana Grande</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [saˈβana ˈɣɾande]) is a municipality of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> located north of <span class="loc">Lajas</span> and Guánica; south of <span class="loc">Maricao</span>; east of <span class="loc">San</span> Germán; and west of <span class="loc">Yauco</span>. <span class="loc">Sabana Grande</span> is spread over seven wards and <span class="loc">Sabana Grande</span> Pueblo (The downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Germán-Cabo <span class="loc">Rojo Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The municipality's name comes from the extensive plain that occupies the southern part of the municipality, better known as <span class="loc">Sabana Grande Abajo</span>. According to historian Mario Villar <span class="loc">Roces</span>, before 1808 there was a community with its own church on the land today known as <span class="loc">Sabana Grande Arriba</span>. Evidence of this is the oldest baptismal registry preserved from the area, as <span class="loc">Sabana Grande</span> was originally a sector of the municipality of San Germán. Because the community was so far from the center of San Germán, residents felt a need to build a church, which was established as an auxiliary to the San Germán parish. The church was built and was devoted to <span class="loc">San Isidro Labrador</span> and Santa María de la <span class="loc">Cabeza</span>.</p>
