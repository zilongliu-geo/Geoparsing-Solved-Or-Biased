<p><span class="loc">Poo</span>, or Pooh, also spelled Puh (altitude 2,662 metres or 8,736 ft), is a small town in <span class="loc">Kinnaur district</span>, <span class="loc">Himachal Pradesh</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>. It is also known as "Spuwa". The approximate population given within a 7 km radius of the town is 1,192. <span class="loc">Poo</span> is 58 km from Powari village along National Highway 22. It is renowned for its natural beauty, green fields, apricot orchards, vineyards and almond trees. Inscriptions suggest that <span class="loc">Poo</span> was an important trading center in the early 11th century. When A. H. <span class="loc">Francke</span> arrived in <span class="loc">Poo</span> from the south in July, 1910, it was the first village he found where the language was "entirely Tibetan". There is an ancient temple, the Lotsaba-bai-lha-khang, dedicated to Shakyamuni or Lord Buddha and attributed to the great translator (or Lotsaba), Rinchen Zangpo (958â€“1055). The shrine has wooden columns supporting a high ceiling. It has murals and a painted door from the period of Rinchen Zangpo (10th to 11th century), though they are in a poor state of preservation.</p>
