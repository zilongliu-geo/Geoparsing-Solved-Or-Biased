  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Two daughters of blues legend B.B. King are claiming on <span class="date">Monday</span> that he was poisoned by business manager LaVerne Toney and personal assistant <span class="per">Myron Johnson</span>. The allegations were made by daughters <span class="per">Karen Williams</span> and <span class="per">Patty King</span> in affidavits provided by their lawyer to the Associated Press. "I believe my father was poisoned and that he was administered foreign substances," <span class="per">Williams</span> and <span class="per">King</span> said in identically worded sections of the affidavits. "I believe my father was murdered." <span class="per">Williams</span> and <span class="per">King</span> also allege that family members were prevented from visiting their father prior to his death. The lawyer for King's estate says the claims are ridiculous. "I hope they have a factual basis that they can demonstrate for their defamatory and libelous allegations," lawyer <span class="per">Brent Bryson</span> said in a statement to the Associated Press. Bryson says that King was appropriately cared for by medical professionals up until his death on <span class="date">May 14</span> in <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>. An autopsy of B.B. King's body was carried out on <span class="date">Sunday</span> by the <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span> coroner's office. The coroner's office said on Twitter that it would be a minimum of six to <span class="date">eight weeks</span> before results of the autopsy are finalised. The <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> Police department said that a potential homicide investigation into the death of the blues legend will depend on autopsy findings.</p><br><br>
