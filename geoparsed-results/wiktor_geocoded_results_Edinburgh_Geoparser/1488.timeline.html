  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Claremont</span> is a western suburb of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, Western <span class="loc">Australia</span> on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Swan River</span>. Prior to European settlement, the Noongar people used the area as a source of water, for fishing and for catching waterfowl. In <span class="date">1830</span>, <span class="per">John Butler</span>, a settler, set up an inn at <span class="loc">Freshwater Bay</span> (in modern-day Peppermint Grove) to attract travellers on the road from <span class="loc">Perth</span> to <span class="loc">Fremantle</span>. A wetland became known as Butler's Swamp (later <span class="loc">Lake Claremont</span>). After the arrival of convicts in the colony in <span class="date">1850</span>, work began on constructing the <span class="loc">Fremantle</span> Road. The government allocated land on the foreshore and at Butler's Swamp to 19 pensioner guards and their families, and a permanent convict depot operated at <span class="loc">Freshwater Bay</span> (until <span class="date">1875</span>). A state school (<span class="date">1862</span>) and church were built, and a community grew around what is <span class="date">now</span> Victoria Avenue. A settler named <span class="per">James Morrison</span>, named his property at <span class="org">Swan</span> Location 702, Claremont Estate, after his wife, <span class="per">Clara</span> (ne√© de Burgh). During the 1870s, a number of prominent families, including the Triggs, <span class="per">Sandovers</span> and <span class="per">Stirlings</span>, acquired land in the district, around the later site of <span class="org">Christ Church Grammar School</span>; some of their homes were later bought and used by the school.</p><br><br>
