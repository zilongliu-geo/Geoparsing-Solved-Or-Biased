  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Jackson</span> is a town in <span class="loc">East Feliciana Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,842 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 4,130 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is part of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town of <span class="per">Jackson</span> was founded in <span class="date">1815</span> as the seat of justice for <span class="loc">Feliciana Parish</span> before the parish was divided into East and West. The town was a major commercial center and a center for education, earning it the title "Athens of the South". Legend holds that the town was originally called "Bear Corners" for the many wild black bears crossing nearby <span class="loc">Thompson Creek</span>, and that it eventually took its name from General <span class="per">Andrew Jackson</span>, who reportedly camped there with his troops on the return trip north after the <span class="date">1815</span> Battle of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. <span class="per">Jackson</span> was the parish seat only until <span class="date">1824</span>, when <span class="loc">Feliciana Parish</span> was split into two parishes, with Clinton selected as the new seat of government in <span class="loc">East Feliciana</span>. <span class="per">Jackson</span> was the location of the <span class="org">College of Louisiana</span> from <span class="date">1825</span> until <span class="date">1845</span>, and then the Methodist-affiliated Centenary College from <span class="date">1845</span> until <span class="date">1908</span>, when it relocated to <span class="loc">Shreveport</span>.</p><br><br>
