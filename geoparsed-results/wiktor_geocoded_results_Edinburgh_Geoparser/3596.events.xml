    The village has been famous since at least the late 19th century for its crushed red pepper.[2] The local variety of chili pepper is known as "буковец" (bukovec).[3] The name of the village—or a derivative of it—is now used as a name for crushed red pepper in general in a number of Southeast European languages: "буковка" (bukovka, Macedonian), "bukovka" (Serbian, Croatian and Slovene) and "μπούκοβο" (búkovo, Greek).
