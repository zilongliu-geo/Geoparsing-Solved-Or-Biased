<p><span class="loc">Oban</span> (/ˈoʊbən/ OH-bən; An t-Òban in Scottish Gaelic meaning The <span class="loc">Little Bay</span>) is a resort town within the <span class="loc">Argyll</span> and <span class="loc">Bute</span> council area of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. Despite its small size, it is the largest town between <span class="loc">Helensburgh</span> and <span class="loc">Fort William</span>. During the tourist season, the town can play host to up to 25,000 people. <span class="loc">Oban</span> occupies a setting in the <span class="loc">Firth of Lorn</span>. The bay is a near perfect horseshoe, protected by the island of <span class="loc">Kerrera</span>; and beyond <span class="loc">Kerrera</span>, the Isle of Mull. To the north, is the long low island of <span class="loc">Lismore</span>, and the mountains of <span class="loc">Morvern</span> and <span class="loc">Ardgour</span>. The site where <span class="loc">Oban</span> now stands has been used by humans since at least mesolithic times, as evidenced by archaeological remains of cave dwellers found in the town. Just outside the town stands <span class="loc">Dunollie</span> Castle, on a site that overlooks the main entrance to the bay and has been fortified since the Bronze age. Prior to the 19th century, the town itself supported very few households, sustaining only minor fishing, trading, shipbuilding and quarrying industries, and a few hardy tourists. The <span class="loc">Renfrew</span> trading company established a storehouse there in about 1714 as a local outlet for its merchandise, but no Custom-house was deemed necessary until around 1760.</p>
