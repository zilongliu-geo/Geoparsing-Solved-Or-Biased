  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Macon</span> /ˈmeɪkən/ (officially <span class="loc">Macon-Bibb County</span>) is a city located in the state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Macon</span> lies near the geographic center of the state, approximately 85 miles (137 km) south of <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, hence the city's nickname "the Heart of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>". Settled near the fall line of the <span class="loc">Ocmulgee River</span>, <span class="loc">Macon</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Bibb County</span> and had a <span class="date">2014</span> estimated population of 153,691. <span class="loc">Macon</span> is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Macon</span> metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 231,259 in <span class="date">2014</span>. <span class="loc">Macon</span> is also the largest city in the Macon-Warner Robins Combined Statistical Area (CSA), a larger trading area with an estimated 417,473 residents in <span class="date">2014</span>; the CSA abuts the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> metropolitan area just to the north. In a <span class="date">2012</span> referendum, voters approved the consolidation of <span class="loc">Macon</span> and <span class="loc">Bibb County</span>, and <span class="loc">Macon</span> became <span class="loc">Georgia</span>'s fourth-largest city (just after <span class="loc">Augusta</span>). The two governments officially merged on <span class="date">January 1, 2014</span>. <span class="loc">Macon</span> is served by three interstate highways: I-16 (connecting the city to Savannah and coastal <span class="loc">Georgia</span>), I-75 (connecting the city with <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> to the north and <span class="loc">Florida</span> to the south), and I-475 (a city bypass highway).</p><br><br>
