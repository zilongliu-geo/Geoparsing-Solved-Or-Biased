  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Toledo</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Lewis County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 725 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Toledo</span> was officially incorporated on <span class="date">October 10, 1892</span>. <span class="loc">Toledo</span> was named by <span class="per">Celeste Rochon</span> after a pioneer side wheel paddle steamer operated by <span class="per">Captain Oren Kellogg</span> of the <span class="org">Kellogg Transportation Company</span>. The boat traveled the <span class="loc">Cowlitz River</span>. A picture of the riverboat is hanging downtown next to the drugstore. The first school in <span class="loc">Toledo</span> was called the OK <span class="org">School</span>. It was a one-room school house. Most of the kids that lived out of the town limits had to ride a boat across the river to and from school until the bridge was built. The current Middle <span class="org">School</span> was originally the High <span class="org">School</span> until the new High <span class="org">School</span> was built in the late 70s-early 80s. While the middle school was being remodeled in <span class="date">1995</span> the children were relocated for the year to St. Mary's <span class="org">Church and School</span>. The Cowlitz Indian Tribe made a special <span class="org">Totem Pole for Toledo High School</span>. The town has always used the "Indian" as the <span class="org">School</span>'s mascot (of course after receiving permission from the tribe). Recently, a painting was donated to the High <span class="org">School</span> of "Old Ike" who was the last full blooded Cowlitz Indian. His portrait still hangs within the halls of the High <span class="org">School</span>.</p><br><br>
