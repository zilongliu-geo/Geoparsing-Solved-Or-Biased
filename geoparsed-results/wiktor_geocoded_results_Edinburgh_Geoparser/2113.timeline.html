  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Waterford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Oxford County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,553 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is a recreation area noted for historic architecture and scenic beauty. The township was granted on <span class="date">February 24, 1774</span> by the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> to Captain <span class="per">Andrew Gardner</span> and his company of soldiers for services under <span class="per">Sir William Phipps</span> during the <span class="date">1690</span> expedition against <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It replaced a <span class="date">1735</span> grant called <span class="loc">Toddstown</span> or Township No. 6 (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Henniker</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>), which was ruled invalid when the state line was redrawn between <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> in <span class="date">1741</span>. The land was surveyed in <span class="date">1774</span>; in <span class="date">spring of 1775</span>, <span class="per">David McWain</span> of <span class="loc">Bolton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> arrived with his dog at a lot he bought for $40. He cleared land and built a log cabin, returning to <span class="loc">Bolton</span> for 2 winters until he settled permanently at <span class="loc">Waterford</span> in <span class="date">spring of 1777</span>. <span class="per">McWain</span> preferred solitude, and was deeply annoyed when he first saw smoke rising about 12 miles (19 km) away at <span class="per">Paris Hill</span>. "Humph," he said, "I would like to know who is settling over there right under my nose!" Other grantees arrived nevertheless, most from the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> towns of <span class="loc">Bolton</span>, <span class="loc">Harvard</span>, <span class="loc">Stow</span>, <span class="loc">Northborough</span> and <span class="loc">Rowley</span>. Indeed, the northwestern part of the plantation was once known as <span class="loc">Rowley</span> after the inhabitants' former hometown.</p><br><br>
