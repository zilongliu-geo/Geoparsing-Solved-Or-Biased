<p><span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is an affluent neighborhood in northwest <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span>, known for its large homes and tree-lined streets and more recently for being a military superfund site of former <span class="loc">Camp Leach</span>. It houses most of the main campus of American University, which gives its name to the neighborhood to <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>'s northeast, American University Park. The neighborhood houses the main campus of American University at 4400 Massachusetts Avenue, the <span class="loc">Wesley Theological Seminary</span> at 4500 Massachusetts Avenue, and the former Washington College of Law campus at 4801 Massachusetts Avenue and 4910 Massachusetts Avenue, which has since been moved to nearby Tenleytown neighborhood. <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> Avenue and Loughboro Road are to its south, <span class="loc">Dalecarlia Parkway</span> is to its west, and Massachusetts Avenue is to its northeast. Paradoxically, the neighborhood to the northeast is called American University Park, even though the bulk of the main campus is located in <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>'s residents include notable media personalities (e.g., Ann Compton, Jim Vance), lawyers (e.g., United States Attorney General Eric Holder, Brendan Sullivan), politicians, corporate officers, and elite <span class="loc">Washington</span> society (e.g., <span class="loc">Washington</span> Nationals principal owners Ed Cohen and Debra Cohen). After the second world war, General of the Army Omar Bradley moved to a house on Indian lane in <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>. Richard Nixon lived in neighboring <span class="loc">Wesley Heights</span> before becoming President; his immediate predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson, after becoming Vice President under John F. Kennedy, purchased a three-story mansion named <span class="loc">Les Ormes</span> (The Elms) in <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> along 52nd Street NW that had previously been the home of socialite and ambassador Perle Mesta. George H. W. Bush also lived in the neighborhood prior to his White House years. Presently it is the residence of the ambassador of <span class="loc">Algeria</span>. Warren Buffett and sister Doris Buffett lived on 49th Street during their years attending Wilson High School.</p>
