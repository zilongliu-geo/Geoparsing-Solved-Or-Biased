<p><span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Bethlehem Township</span>, <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, twenty-five miles up the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> from <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. It was platted in 1812 and according to WPA records was presumably named for <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. Its first office was established on March 6, 1816. The community's post office is popular around Christmas with those wanting to have a <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> postmark on Christmas letters and cards. Much of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>'s history was destroyed by the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> flood of 1937. What is known is that prior to its formation, the land which would become <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> was owned by Colonel John Armstrong, who had been the commander of <span class="loc">Fort Finney</span> (located in present-day <span class="loc">Jeffersonville</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>). The first settlers arrived at the site in 1805 Armstrong and others, most notably Jonathon Clark and William Plaskett, platted the community in 1812. It was laid out in 124 lots in a rectangular manner. Armstrong named it after <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, where he was born. Early in its history, <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> was blessed with a steamboat and ferry landing, and with its road to <span class="loc">New Washington</span> and <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> became a major transportation center. The economy of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> in the antebellum era focused on farming, shopping, and trade. By 1833, 300 individuals lived in the community.</p>
