  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Regina</span> (/rᵻˈdʒaɪnə/ <span class="loc">Assiniboine</span>: huhúžubina; Cree: oskana kā-asastēki) is the capital city of the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Saskatchewan</span>. The city is the second-largest in the province, after <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span>, and a cultural and commercial centre for southern <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span>. It is governed by <span class="loc">Regina City</span> Council. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159. <span class="per">Regina</span> was previously the seat of government of the North-West Territories, of which the current <span class="loc">provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta</span> originally formed part, and of the <span class="loc">District of Assiniboia</span>. The site having previously been <span class="loc">Wascana</span> ("Buffalo Bones" in Cree), it was renamed in <span class="date">1882</span> in honour of <span class="per">Queen Victoria</span>, <span class="per">Victoria Regina</span>, by her daughter <span class="per">Princess Louise</span>, wife of the <span class="loc">Marquess</span> of <span class="loc">Lorne</span>, then the Governor General of <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West, on its treeless flat plain <span class="per">Regina</span> has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off, <span class="loc">Wascana Creek</span>. Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 840-foot (260 m) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake. <span class="per">Regina</span>'s importance was further secured when the new <span class="loc">province of Saskatchewan</span> designated the city its capital in <span class="date">1906</span>. <span class="loc">Wascana Centre</span>, created around the focal point of <span class="loc">Wascana</span> Lake, remains one of <span class="per">Regina</span>'s attractions and contains the Provincial Legislative Building, both campuses of the <span class="org">University</span> of <span class="per">Regina</span>, the provincial museum of natural history, the <span class="per">Regina</span> Conservatory (in the original <span class="org">Regina College</span> buildings), the <span class="org">Saskatchewan Science Centre</span>, the MacKenzie Art Gallery and the <span class="org">Saskatchewan Centre</span> of the Arts.</p><br><br>
