  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Norfolk /ˈnɒrfɒrk/ or /ˈnɒrfoʊk/ is a city in <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, 113 miles northwest of <span class="loc">Omaha</span> and 83 miles west of <span class="loc">Sioux City</span> at the intersection of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Routes 81 and 275. The population was 24,210 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, making it the ninth-largest city in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. It is the principal city of the <span class="org">Norfolk Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. In <span class="date">late 1865</span> three scouts were sent from a German Lutheran settlement near <span class="loc">Ixonia</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, to find productive, inexpensive farmland that could be claimed under the Homestead Act. From the Omaha area they followed the <span class="loc">Elkhorn River</span> upstream to <span class="loc">West Point</span>. Finding that area too crowded, they continued up the river. On <span class="date">September 15</span>, they reached the junction of the <span class="loc">Elkhorn</span> and its North Fork, and chose that area as a settlement site. On <span class="date">May 23, 1866</span>, a party of 124 settlers representing 42 families from the <span class="loc">Ixonia</span> area set out for northeast <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> in three wagon trains. They arrived at the new site on <span class="date">July 15</span>. A second group of settlers from <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> arrived in <span class="date">July 1867</span>.</p><br><br>
