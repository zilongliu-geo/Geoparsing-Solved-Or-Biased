<p><span class="loc">Tigre</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈtiɣɾe], Tiger) is a town in the <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> Province, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, situated in the north of Greater <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, 28 km (17 mi) north of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> city. <span class="loc">Tigre</span> lies on the Paraná Delta and is an important tourist and weekend attraction, easily reached by bus and train services, including the scenic Tren de la Costa. It is the principal town of the Tigre Partido. The town sits on an island created by several small streams and rivers and was founded in 1820, after floods had destroyed other settlements in the area, then known as the Partido de las Conchas. The area's name derives from the “tigres” or jaguars that were hunted there, on occasions, in its early years. The area was first settled by Europeans who came to farm the land, and the port developed to serve the Delta and to bring fruit and wood from the Delta and ports upstream on the Paraná river. <span class="loc">Tigre</span> is still an important timber processing port. The “Puerto de Frutos” (fruit port) is now a crafts fair located in the old fruit market by the riverside. The Naval Museum is also nearby. Antiques shops, riverside restaurants and pubs, the casino and Parque de la Costa, an amusement park and its renowned natural beauty make <span class="loc">Tigre</span> a popular tourist destination throughout the year.</p>
