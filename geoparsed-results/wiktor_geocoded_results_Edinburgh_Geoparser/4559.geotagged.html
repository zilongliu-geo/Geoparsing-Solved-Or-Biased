<p><span class="loc">Mitchell</span> is a community located in the Rural Municipality of <span class="loc">Hanover</span>, <span class="loc">Manitoba</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is located three kilometers <span class="loc">west of Steinbach</span>, <span class="loc">Manitoba</span> along Provincial Highway 52, and has a population of 1,136 as of 2011. The Mitchell School District was established in 1919. A one-room schoolhouse served the community until the 1950s, when another room has added to handle increasing student enrollment. In 1968, the school district was dissolved and became part of the newly formed Hanover School Division, after which students from <span class="loc">Mitchell</span> were required to attend school in <span class="loc">Steinbach</span>. The school division has since constructed new elementary and middle schools in <span class="loc">Mitchell</span> and only high school students from the <span class="loc">Mitchell</span> area are presently required to attend school in <span class="loc">Steinbach</span>. <span class="loc">Mitchell</span> has a full range of community-run recreational facilities, including an indoor arena, baseball fields, soccer pitches, and tennis courts. The <span class="loc">Mitchell</span> Arena was built in 1979 and is home to community's ice hockey teams, nicknamed the Mohawks. The <span class="loc">Mitchell</span>'s minor hockey teams play in various Eastman Minor Hockey leagues. The Junior Mohawks have been members of the Hanover Tache Junior Hockey League since 1987 and previously played in the <span class="loc">Manitoba</span> Junior 'B' Hockey League. The Mohawks has also fielded senior teams in the past that played in the Hanover-Tache and Carillon Senior Hockey Leagues.</p>
