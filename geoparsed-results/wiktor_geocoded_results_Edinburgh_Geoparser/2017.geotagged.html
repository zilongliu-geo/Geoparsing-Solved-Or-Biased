<p>Lawrence is a small town of 474 inhabitants (as per the 2001 census) in <span class="loc">Otago</span>, in <span class="loc">New</span> <span class="loc">Zealand</span>'s <span class="loc">South Island</span>. It is located on State Highway 8, the main route from <span class="loc">Dunedin</span> to the inland towns of Queenstown and Alexandra. It lies 35 kilometres to the northwest of Milton, 11 kilometres northwest of <span class="loc">Waitahuna</span>, and close to the <span class="loc">Tuapeka River</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Clutha</span>. Lawrence's main claim to fame is of being the focal point for Otago's 1860s gold rush, after the discovery of the metal at nearby Gabriel's Gully by Gabriel Read. In mid-1862, it is estimated that twice as many people lived around the banks of the <span class="loc">Tuapeka River</span> as did in <span class="loc">Dunedin</span> itself. Additionally, the tune to <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>'s national anthem was composed in Lawrence by John J. Woods, a Lawrence school teacher. The town was named for Sir Henry Lawrence, hero of the <span class="loc">Lucknow</span> military campaign of 1857, and is billed as "The Gateway To Central Otago". In 1877, a branch line railway was built from the Main South Line to Lawrence, and the town remained the terminus of the line until an extension was built in 1910. Although originally known as the Lawrence Branch, this line ultimately became known as the <span class="loc">Roxburgh</span> Branch. The railway closed in 1968 and the town's station has subsequently been demolished, but some relics still remain, including the goods shed.</p>
