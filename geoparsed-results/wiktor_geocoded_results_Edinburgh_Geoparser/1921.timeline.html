  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Thornton</span> is a village on the <span class="loc">Fylde</span>, in <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, about 4 miles (6 km) north of <span class="loc">Blackpool</span> and 2 miles (3 km) south of <span class="loc">Fleetwood</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">Borough of Wyre</span>. Together with its neighbouring town of <span class="loc">Cleveleys</span>, <span class="loc">Thornton</span> forms part of the unparished area known as Thornton-Cleveleys. The two communities are linked by Victoria Road. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> is first mentioned in <span class="date">1086</span> in the Domesday Book, where it was referred to as Torentum. At the time it covered a large area including what are <span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Cleveleys</span> and <span class="per">Fleetwood</span>, and had a very low population density. It is thought that a settlement had existed at the site since the Iron Age, and a Roman road passes close to the village. The area remained lightly populated until <span class="date">1799</span>, when the marshland around the village was drained and agricultural production began on a large scale. A railway station was opened in <span class="loc">Thornton</span> in <span class="date">1865</span>. The opening of salt works at nearby <span class="loc">Burn Naze</span> by the United Alkali Company in the early 1890s (later becoming ICI) led to significant expansion of the village, with new houses and community buildings constructed. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> became an Urban District Council in <span class="date">1900</span>, surviving until <span class="date">1974</span> when it became part of the <span class="loc">Wyre Borough</span> Council.</p><br><br>
