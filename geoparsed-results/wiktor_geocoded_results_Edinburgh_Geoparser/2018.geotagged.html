<p><span class="loc">Voznesenka</span> (Russian: Вознесенка) is a small unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Kenai Peninsula Borough</span>, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located on the <span class="loc">Kenai Peninsula</span>, about 25 miles east of Homer, <span class="loc">Voznesenka</span> is one of several villages founded by Russian Old Believers in the <span class="loc">Fox River</span> area. The village was founded in 1985 by residents who decided to leave <span class="loc">Nikolaevsk</span> and begin new settlements in the <span class="loc">Kachemak Bay</span> area. The name in Russian means Ascension (вознестись, voznestis' - to ascend) referring to the holiday of The Ascension. The village is situated on a bluff over <span class="loc">Kachemak Bay</span>, and is the end of the maintained road system on the western <span class="loc">Kenai Peninsula</span>. A switchback trail leads about 1,000 feet (300 m) down to the beach; it can be traveled by foot or 4-wheel drive vehicle except at the highest tides to reach the neighboring village of Kachemak Selo. There are more than 40 families living in <span class="loc">Voznesenka</span>. Although unincorporated, the community has a mayor, a community council, and a water-utility board. There is also a community church and a public school in the village. Emergency services are provided by Kachemak Emergency Services Area Fire and EMS. The community is accessible by gravel road, the paved access road from Homer ending where the village begins. In 2009 the Mile 17 fire threatened the village.</p>
