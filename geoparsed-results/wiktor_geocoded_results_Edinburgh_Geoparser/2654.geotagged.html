<p><span class="loc">Pila</span> is a third class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Laguna</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 46,534 people. <span class="loc">Pila</span> has a total land area of 31.2 km². The town of <span class="loc">Pila</span> is the site for some well-preserved houses dating back to the Spanish period as well as the old <span class="loc">Saint Anthony</span> of <span class="loc">Padua Parish</span> Church, the first Antonine church in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. Don Felizardo <span class="loc">Rivera</span>, who donated his lands to the church and municipal government, is the recognized founder of <span class="loc">Pila</span>. He is the ancestor of prominent families in <span class="loc">Pila</span> surnamed <span class="loc">Rivera</span>, <span class="loc">Relova</span>, <span class="loc">Agra</span> and Álava. This also served as a location for the reality show, The Amazing Race <span class="loc">Asia</span> 2 and the ABS-CBN daytime drama hit series Be Careful With My Heart. <span class="loc">Pila</span> is politically subdivided into 17 barangays. In 1957, the sitio of <span class="loc">Pinagbayanan</span> was converted into a barrio. <span class="loc">Pila</span> and adjacent towns along the shores of <span class="loc">Laguna de Bay</span> are considered by archaeologists as one of the oldest settlements in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. The community is one of three such concentrations of population known archaeologically to have been in place before A.D. 1000. Archaeologists recovered in Pinagbayanan potteries and artifacts that indicate considerable settlement in the area during the Late Tang Dynasty (900 A.D.). Archaeologists also recovered ancient horse bones ending the debate on whether the Spaniards brought them or not. The scientists were able to uncover <span class="loc">Philippines</span>’ oldest crematorium in the same area. It is worthwhile to note that the oldest Philippine document, the 900 A.D. Laguna Copperplate Inscription, mentioned <span class="loc">Pila</span> (as Pailah) twice and its ruler Jayadewa.</p>
