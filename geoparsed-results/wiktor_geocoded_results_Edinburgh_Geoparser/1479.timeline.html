  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ward County</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> was founded in <span class="date">1883</span>, having been third in a series that included two earlier settlements. Despite this, <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is still the oldest city in <span class="loc">Ward County</span>, as well as north-western and north central <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>. In <span class="date">1885</span>, as it was the only city in the then-newly formed <span class="org">Imperial</span> <span class="loc">Ward County</span> (<span class="date">now</span> split into Ward, <span class="loc">Renville</span>, Mountrail, and Burke counties), it was given the county seat, a position it held until <span class="date">1888</span>. The population was 1,060 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is part of the <span class="org">Minot Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, and its former settlements were founded by <span class="per">James Johnson</span> and <span class="per">James Colton</span> (the men who also settled <span class="loc">Larimore</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>) in Dakota Territory in the late 1870s. Earlier settlements were The Forks, and later <span class="per">Colton</span> (named after <span class="per">James Colton</span>), which are considered forerunners of the city. Its current name was given to it by <span class="per">James Johnson</span> during the creation of the post office, and was the name of his hometown of <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. The name "The Forks" is used as a nickname for <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, both alluding to its heritage, as well as its geographic location at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Des Lacs</span> and <span class="loc">Souris Rivers</span>. One of the first buildings in <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, the first '<span class="loc">Ward County</span> Courthouse'; built by <span class="per">James Johnson</span>, and used originally as a granary; was moved to the <span class="loc">North Dakota</span> State Fair fairgrounds in the mid-20th century and <span class="date">now</span> serves as one of the 2 buildings of the <span class="loc">Ward County</span> Historical Society`s <span class="org">Fairgrounds Museum</span>. In the early 1890s, the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> Reporter became the first newspaper in western <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>. It would in <span class="date">the future</span> be renamed to the Minot Daily News. On <span class="date">June 24, 2011</span>, the entire city was evacuated when floodwaters wiped through the town.</p><br><br>
