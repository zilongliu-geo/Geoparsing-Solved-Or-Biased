Residents named the town in honor of Chief Logan of the Mingo Indian tribe. He and his band lived in this area at the time of European-American settlement. <span class="loc">Ohio</span> Governor Thomas Worthington established the community in 1816. According to the Ohio Historical Society, Logan had about 250 residents in 1825, and 600 by 1840. The <span class="loc">Hocking River</span> provided sufficient water power for the purpose of operating grist and sawmills, particularly at the falls above Logan. The town of Logan was slow to progress until the opening of the <span class="loc">Hocking</span> Canal, a branch of the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Erie Canal</span>, in 1838. Several industries prospered due to the rich mineral resources of the <span class="loc">Hocking</span> Valley.</p>
