TORRINGTON — City Council tentatively approved several budget changes during a meeting <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, that would affect recycling and <span class="date">winter</span> maintenance supplies for the 2009-10 fiscal year. Mayor <span class="per">Ryan Bingham</span> proposed a reduction of $150,000 in a disposal line item, putting the funds at $1 million. <span class="per">Jerry Rollett</span>, city engineer, noted that was the cost of savings from the city’s decision to switch to single-stream recycling. <span class="date">Last week</span> the council unanimously approved the switch to the new system, which would allow residents to combine recyclables in the same bin. The vote came with an approval to utilize <span class="loc">USA</span> <span class="per">Hauling</span> and <span class="per">Recycling</span> Inc.Along with accepting the new company, the refuse contract line item jumped from $893,000 to $1.77 million. The reason for the hike was due to the contract with <span class="loc">USA</span> <span class="per">Hauling</span>, which was numbered at $2.06 million for the year. A combination of other line items made up for the remainder of the contract prices, he said.</p><br><br>
