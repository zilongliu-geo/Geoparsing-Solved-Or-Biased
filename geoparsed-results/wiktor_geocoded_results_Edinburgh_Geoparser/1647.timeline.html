  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Samana</span> is a city and a municipal council in <span class="loc">Patiala district</span> in the Indian state of <span class="loc">Punjab</span>. Before Independence, <span class="per">Samana</span> was a part of Patiala Kingdom (PEPSU). <span class="date">Now</span> it is a part of <span class="loc">Patiala District</span> of <span class="loc">Punjab</span> (<span class="loc">India</span>). It traces its history to the <span class="date">days</span> of Raja Jaipal who ruled over, among others, the territories of <span class="loc">Bhatinda</span>, <span class="loc">Samana</span>. It fell into the hands of Shahab-ud-Din <span class="per">Muhammad Gauri</span> after the conquest of <span class="loc">Ajmer</span> and <span class="loc">Delhi</span> and was entrusted to Qutb-ud-Din Aibek in <span class="date">1192</span>, along with the territories of <span class="loc">Ghuram</span> and <span class="loc">Sunam</span>. With the increasing importance of <span class="loc">Sirhind</span> under the Mughals, <span class="per">Samana</span> received a little set-back. While <span class="per">Samana</span> is said to be a place of saints and scholars during the Mughal <span class="date">days</span>, it is notorious also for its professional executioners, who served at <span class="loc">Delhi</span> and <span class="loc">Sirhind</span>. Sayyad Jala-ud-Din, who executed Guru Teg Bahadur at <span class="loc">Delhi</span> in <span class="date">1675</span> was from <span class="per">Samana</span>. <span class="org">Beg brothers</span>, who mercilessly butchered the younger sons of <span class="per">Guru Gobind Singh</span> also belonged to <span class="loc">Samana</span>. This hated town was therefore one of the first places to have been sacked by Banda Bahadur. But the Mughals were yet too strong for the rising power of <span class="per">Sikhs</span> and <span class="per">Samana</span> had to be given up by them towards <span class="date">the end of 1710</span> AD.It was retaken in about <span class="date">1742 AD</span> by <span class="loc">Baba</span> <span class="loc">Ala</span> <span class="per">Singh</span>, the founder of the Patiala ruling family and was recognized as a part of his territories by Ahamd Shah Durani.</p><br><br>
