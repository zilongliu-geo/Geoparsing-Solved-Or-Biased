  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Kirkwood</span> (formerly, Kirk, <span class="per">Kirkwood</span>'s, and <span class="loc">Roundtop</span>) is a census-designated place in <span class="per">Alpine</span> and <span class="per">Amador</span> counties, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 158 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Kirkwood</span>'s main attraction is the <span class="per">Kirkwood</span> Mountain Resort. The town is accessible by State Route 88. <span class="per">Kirkwood</span> is within the Eldorado National Forest. <span class="per">Zack Kirkwood</span>, a cattle rancher who had settled in the area, opened an inn, named <span class="per">Kirkwood</span>'s, in <span class="date">1863</span> with the opening of the <span class="per">Amador</span>/Nevada Wagon Toll Road, the primary route through the <span class="loc">Sierra Nevada Mountains</span>. <span class="date">The following year</span>, <span class="loc">Alpine County</span> was created and the redrawing of the county borders placed the inn at the convergence of Alpine, <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>, and <span class="loc">Amador</span> counties (the borders were later changed so the inn is no longer in El <span class="loc">Dorado County</span>, but the original signpost marking the intersection of the three is still in the building). Eventually, the inn became a fashionable <span class="date">summer</span> resort. After <span class="per">Zack</span>'s death, the inn stayed in the family and continued to operate until <span class="date">1966</span>, when it was sold to an investment group, who then converted it into the present-day <span class="per">Kirkwood</span> Mountain Resort.</p><br><br>
