<p>Columbia was a town in <span class="loc">Fluvanna County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, at the confluence of the James and Rivanna Rivers. The population was 49 at the 2000 census, making it <span class="loc">Virginia</span>'s smallest incorporated town. Known as Point of Fork through the late 18th century, it was the setting of a minor battle during the Revolutionary War. Columbia is part of the <span class="loc">Charlottesville Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Columbia dates back to 1788. In the mid-19th century, Columbia was a point along the stagecoach route between <span class="loc">Richmond</span> and <span class="loc">Staunton</span>. <span class="loc">Gum Creek</span>, Point of Fork Arsenal, Point of Fork Plantation, and Tinsley Tavern are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The town saw significant flooding during Hurricane Camille in 1969. Columbia was the last remaining independent town in <span class="loc">Fluvanna County</span>. However, in May 2014, Columbia's Mayor and Town Council proposed disincorporation which, if successful, would result in the town being reabsorbed by the County. In June 2014, Preservation <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, a historic preservation group in the Commonwealth, placed the Town of <span class="loc">Columbia</span> on its "most endangered" list. A small group of individuals has stepped forward to raise public support to document and preserve the history of the town, which had a mayor before there was a President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p>
