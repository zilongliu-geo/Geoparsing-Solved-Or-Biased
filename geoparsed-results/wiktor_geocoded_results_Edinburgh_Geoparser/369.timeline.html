  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Kingston is a small town in rural Shire of <span class="loc">Hepburn</span> in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Kingston is located about 15 km from <span class="loc">Creswick</span>, just off the Midland Highway and is about 20 km from <span class="loc">Daylesford</span>. Kingston's post code is 3364. Kingston was once a thriving gold mining town during the Victorian Gold Rush and became the administrative centre of the Creswick Shire. <span class="org">Kingston Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">11 October 1858</span>. Kingston once had a large coach and vehicle building manufacturer, <span class="org">Barker Brothers</span>, up to five hotels, a flour mill and numerous chaff mills. After the miners left so did the industry and in <span class="date">1976</span> the railway station and the Creswickâ€“Daylesford train line closed. The local hotel, like many businesses in small rural communities (such as shops and schools), closed after dwindling support from the local community continuing the vicious circle of declining country towns and the subsequent need to drive greater distances for basic services. <span class="date">Now</span>, Kingston supports numerous bed and breakfasts and rural cropping. The area's rich red volcanic soil and good rainfall support agricultural industries including potatoes (typically grown for food processor <span class="loc">McCains</span>), sheep and wheat. While its location, being around 25 minutes from <span class="loc">Daylesford</span>, has started to attract retirees and city folk looking to buy weekenders or holiday houses ( which while they may be transient residents, has provided some much needed new investment and stimulated the local economy).</p><br><br>
