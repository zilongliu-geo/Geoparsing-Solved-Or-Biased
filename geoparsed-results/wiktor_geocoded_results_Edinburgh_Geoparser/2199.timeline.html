  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Malta</span> (/ˈmɒltə/; Maltese: [ˈmɐltɐ]), officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Malta</span> (Maltese: <span class="loc">Repubblika ta' Malta</span>), is a Southern European island country comprising an archipelago in the <span class="loc">Mediterranean Sea</span>. It lies 80 km (50 mi) south of <span class="loc">Italy</span>, 284 km (176 mi) east of <span class="loc">Tunisia</span>, and 333 km (207 mi) north of <span class="loc">Libya</span>. The country covers just over 316 km2 (122 sq mi), with a population of just under 450,000 (despite an extensive emigration programme since the Second World War), making it one of the world's smallest and most densely populated countries. The capital of <span class="loc">Malta</span> is <span class="loc">Valletta</span>, which at 0.8 km2, is the smallest national capital in the European Union. <span class="loc">Malta</span> has two official languages: Maltese and English. <span class="loc">Malta</span>'s location has historically given it great strategic importance as a naval base, and a succession of powers, including the Phoenicians, Romans, Moors, <span class="loc">Normans</span>, Sicilians, Spanish, Knights of <span class="loc">St. John</span>, French and British, have ruled the islands. <span class="loc">Malta</span> was awarded the <span class="per">George Cross</span> by <span class="per">King George VI</span> in <span class="date">1942</span>, for the country's bravery in the Second World War. The <span class="per">George Cross</span> continues to appear on <span class="loc">Malta</span>'s national flag. Under the <span class="loc">Malta</span> Independence Act, passed by the British Parliament in <span class="date">1964</span>, <span class="loc">Malta</span> gained independence from the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> as an independent sovereign Commonwealth realm, officially known from <span class="date">1964</span> to <span class="date">1974</span> as the <span class="loc">State of Malta</span>, with <span class="per">Elizabeth II</span> as its head of state. The country became a republic in <span class="date">1974</span>, and although no longer a Commonwealth realm, remains a current member state of <span class="org">the Commonwealth of Nations</span>. <span class="loc">Malta</span> was admitted to the United Nations in <span class="date">1964</span> and to the European Union in <span class="date">2004</span>; in <span class="date">2008</span>, it became part of the Eurozone.</p><br><br>
