  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Farmington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The community is nestled in a valley among the <span class="loc">Boston</span> Mountains, a subset of the <span class="loc">Ozark</span> Mountains. Although the first settlers came from the Deep South in <span class="date">1828</span>, the community did not incorporate until <span class="date">1946</span>. Located immediately west of <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span> in the <span class="loc">Northwest Arkansas metropolitan</span> statistical area, <span class="loc">Farmington</span> has been experiencing a population boom in <span class="date">recent years</span>, as indicated by a 66% growth in population between the <span class="date">2000</span> and 2010 censuses. It has been characterized as a bedroom community by the <span class="org">University of Arkansas Community Design Center</span>. The first settlers came from the Deep South in <span class="date">1828</span>, and the area was known as Engel's Mill until a post office was built in <span class="date">1868</span> and the village was renamed. The Civil War was rough on the community, as many residents were Confederate sympathizers despite most of northwest <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> supporting the <span class="org">Union</span>. <span class="org">The Battle of Prairie Grove</span> occurred not far from <span class="loc">Farmington</span>, and the city was subject to raids by both armies as well as unaffiliated guerrillas and roughnecks. Around the 1890s, residents found prosperity by growing strawberries and grapes and shipping them on the St. Louisâ€“San Francisco Railway. The tracks were pulled up during World War II, something the company had wanted to do for <span class="date">years</span>, under the guise of the war effort. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">October 15, 1946</span>.</p><br><br>
