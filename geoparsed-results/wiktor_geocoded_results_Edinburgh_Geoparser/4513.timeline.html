  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Seaforth</span> is a district within the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Sefton</span>, <span class="loc">Merseyside</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically in <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, it is located to the north of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>, between <span class="loc">Bootle</span> and <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. The name of <span class="per">Seaforth</span> is thought to come from the Old Norse sæ-fjord, sæ-ford, "sea inlet". It was recorded as Safforde "sea ford" in <span class="date">1128</span>, suggesting Old English name origins. Another theory for the name of the area is that it was taken from <span class="org">Seaforth House</span>, named after <span class="per">Francis Mackenzie</span>, 1st <span class="per">Baron Seaforth</span>, who built the mansion in <span class="date">1813</span> for his daughter and her husband, <span class="per">Sir John Gladstone</span>, father of <span class="per">William Ewart Gladstone</span>, four times Prime Minister of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. A permanent military presence was established in the borough with the completion of <span class="per">Seaforth</span> Barracks in <span class="date">1882</span>. <span class="loc">Seaforth</span> Dock opened in <span class="date">1972</span> and is the largest dock facility on the <span class="loc">River Mersey</span>. It is part of the Port of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> and <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> <span class="loc">Freeport</span>. <span class="per">Seaforth</span> joined Crosby Municipal Borough in <span class="date">1937</span>, having previously been part of <span class="loc">Waterloo with Seaforth</span> urban district. The whole of <span class="loc">Crosby</span> became part of the new Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Sefton</span> on <span class="date">1 April 1974</span>.</p><br><br>
