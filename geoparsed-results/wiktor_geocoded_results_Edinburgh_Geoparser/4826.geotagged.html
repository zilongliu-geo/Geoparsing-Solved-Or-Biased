<p><span class="loc">Churchill</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Gallatin County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 902 at the 2010 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Bozeman</span>, <span class="loc">MT</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. It was formerly part of the Amsterdam-Churchill CDP. <span class="loc">Churchill</span> is located at 45°45′00″N 111°18′37″W (45.749951, -111.310256). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 3.6 square miles (9.3 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Church Hill</span>, or <span class="loc">Churchill</span> as it was later shortened by Gallatin County Road Department, is located a few miles away from <span class="loc">Amsterdam</span> on a locally prominent hill. <span class="loc">Churchill</span> is the site of the Dutch community's church- the 1st Christian Reformed Church, today known as Manhattan Christian Reformed Church; and related parent-operated private P-12 school, Manhattan Christian School. The large church on the hill is the probable origin of the name. Not to be outdone, The Milwaukee Road Railway designated the other side of "the hill" as Holland, and made a siding for agricultural goods on its railway about two miles to the east, and designated it as the Holland Siding.</p>
