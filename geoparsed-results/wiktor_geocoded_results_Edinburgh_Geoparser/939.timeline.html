  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> is the third largest city in the state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Greene County</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census data, the population was 159,498, an increase of 5.2% since the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is one of the two principal cities of the <span class="loc">Springfield-Branson Metropolitan</span> Area, which has a population of 537,631 and includes the <span class="loc">counties of Christian</span>, Dallas, <span class="loc">Greene</span>, <span class="loc">Polk</span>, <span class="loc">Webster</span>, <span class="loc">Stone</span> and <span class="loc">Taney</span>. Springfield's nickname is the "<span class="loc">Queen City</span> of the <span class="loc">Ozarks</span>" and is known as the "<span class="org">Birthplace of Route</span> 66". It is also home of several universities including <span class="org">Missouri State University</span>, <span class="org">Drury University</span>, and <span class="org">Evangel University</span>. The territory known as <span class="loc">Missouri</span> was included in the Louisiana Purchase of <span class="date">1803</span>. Soon after, the Delaware Native Americans received treaty land where Springfieldâ€™s <span class="loc">Sequiota</span> Park and the antique stores of its <span class="loc">Galloway</span> Village stand <span class="date">today</span>. To the west, 500 Kickapoo Native Americans built wickiups on the prairie that still bears their name. <span class="loc">Missouri</span> became a state on <span class="date">August 10, 1821</span>, and in <span class="date">1833</span> the legislature designated most of the southern portion a single county. It was named for American Revolutionary War General <span class="per">Nathanael Greene</span>, largely through a campaign by Springfield's founder, <span class="per">John Polk</span> Campbell, to honor a man he admired. <span class="per">A Tennessee</span> homesteader, <span class="per">Campbell</span> announced his claim in <span class="date">1829</span>. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> was officially founded in <span class="date">1830</span> and later incorporated in <span class="date">1838</span>.</p><br><br>
