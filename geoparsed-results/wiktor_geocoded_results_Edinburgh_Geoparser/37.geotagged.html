<p><span class="loc">Santa Rosa</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Sonoma County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Its estimated 2014 population was 174,170. <span class="loc">Santa Rosa</span> is the largest city in <span class="loc">California</span>'s <span class="loc">North Coast</span>, Wine Country and the <span class="loc">North Bay</span>; the fifth most populous city in the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> Bay Area after <span class="loc">San Jose</span>, <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>, <span class="loc">Oakland</span>, and <span class="loc">Fremont</span>; and the 28th most populous city in <span class="loc">California</span>. Before the arrival of Europeans, the wide valley containing <span class="loc">Santa Rosa</span> was home to a strong and populous tribe of Pomo natives known as the Bitakomtara. The Bitakomtara controlled the valley closely, barring passage to others until permission was arranged. Those who entered without permission were subject to harsh penalties. The tribe gathered at ceremonial times on <span class="loc">Santa Rosa Creek</span> near present-day Spring Lake Regional Park. Upon the arrival of Europeans, the <span class="loc">Pomos</span> were decimated by smallpox brought unintentionally from <span class="loc">Europe</span>, and by the eradication efforts of Anglo settlers. By 1900 the Pomo population had decreased by 95%. The first known permanent European settlement of <span class="loc">Santa Rosa</span> was the homestead of the Carrillo family, in-laws to Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, who settled the Sonoma pueblo and Petaluma area. In the 1830s, during the Mexican period, the family of María López de <span class="loc">Carrillo</span> built an adobe house on their <span class="loc">Rancho Cabeza</span> de <span class="loc">Santa Rosa</span> land grant, just east of what later became downtown <span class="loc">Santa Rosa</span>. Allegedly, however, by the 1820s, before the <span class="loc">Carrillos</span> built their adobe in the 1830s, Spanish and Mexican settlers from nearby <span class="loc">Sonoma</span> and other settlements to the south raised livestock in the area and slaughtered animals at the fork of the <span class="loc">Santa Rosa Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Matanzas Creek</span>, near the intersection of modern-day <span class="loc">Santa Rosa</span> Avenue and Sonoma Avenue. This is supposedly the origin of the name of <span class="loc">Matanzas Creek</span> as, because of its use as a slaughtering place, the confluence came to be called <span class="loc">La Matanza</span>.</p>
