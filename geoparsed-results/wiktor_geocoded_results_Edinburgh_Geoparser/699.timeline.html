  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Stratford</span> is a town on the <span class="loc">Avon River</span> in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 232 kilometres (144 mi) east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> on the Princes Highway in Shire of Wellington. At the <span class="date">2006</span> census, <span class="loc">Stratford</span> had a population of <span class="date">1950</span>. The town services the local regional community and travellers on the Princes Highway. Stratford's principal industries are dairying, sheep, cattle and horse breeding and vegetable crops. The town has numerous coffee shops and cafes, a cellar door for a local winery, Design Gallery, model railway shop, a pub, parks and playgrounds for car travellers to break their journey. The origin of the town's name is unclear. Many believe it derives from <span class="loc">Stratford-upon-Avon</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="per">William Shakespeare</span>'s birthplace, a view which is lent credence by the fact that it is located by the river <span class="loc">Avon</span>. Locals have embraced the connection with <span class="per">Shakespeare</span> and a <span class="per">Shakespeare</span> on the River Festival has been a successful annual event since <span class="date">1989</span>, incorporating works of <span class="per">Shakespeare</span> and modern Australian plays. In <span class="date">1998</span> the town formally became a member of the Stratford Sister Cities program to promote friendship and cultural exchange between participating countries.</p><br><br>
