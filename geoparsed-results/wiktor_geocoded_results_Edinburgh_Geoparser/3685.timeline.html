  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Denton</span> is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside, <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, five miles (8 km) east of <span class="loc">Manchester</span> city centre. Historically part of <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, it had a population of 36,591 at the <span class="date">2011</span> Census. <span class="loc">Denton</span> probably derives its name from Dane-town, an etymology supported by other place names in the area such as Danehead-bank and Daneditch-bourne. The word 'Dane' is itself derived from Anglo-Saxon denu, dene, daenland, meaning a valley. So literally <span class="loc">Denton</span> means valley town. A Byzantine coin was discovered in Danesheadbank, dating from the sixth or seventh century, as part of the <span class="loc">Denton</span> coin hoard. The early medieval linear earthwork Nico Ditch passes through <span class="loc">Denton</span>; it was probably used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9th <span class="date">centuries</span>. A 300 m stretch is still visible on <span class="loc">Denton</span> golf course, about 4 m wide and 1.5 m deep. Felt hatting was recorded in <span class="loc">Denton</span> as early as <span class="date">1702</span> and <span class="loc">Denton</span> gained supremacy in the hatting industry towards the end of the 19th century. The increasing importance of <span class="loc">Denton</span> and <span class="loc">Haughton</span> as centres of felt hat production is demonstrated by the increase of manufacturers in the area: in <span class="date">1800</span> there were 4 hatting firms in <span class="loc">Denton</span> and <span class="loc">Haughton</span>, but by <span class="date">1825</span> there were 25 manufacturers, making it the third largest hat making centre in the north west. By <span class="date">1840</span>, 24,000 felt hats were produced in <span class="loc">Denton</span> <span class="date">a week</span>. The prosperity of the hatting industry is reflected in the growth of the town from 2,501 in <span class="date">1801</span> to 6,759 in <span class="date">1841</span>.</p><br><br>
