  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Delano</span> is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Wichita</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. A mixed commercial and residential area on the west bank of the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River, it is home to Friends University, Lawrence–Dumont Stadium, and Exploration Place, the <span class="loc">Sedgwick County</span> science museum. Thanks to the availability of cheap land under the Homestead Act of <span class="date">1862</span>, settlers purchased land across the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River from <span class="loc">Wichita</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. These settlers named their new community <span class="loc">Elgin</span>. In <span class="date">1870</span>, <span class="loc">Elgin</span> became a cattle shipment point on the <span class="loc">Chisholm</span> Trail and began to grow. In <span class="date">March 1871</span>, local residents renamed the town <span class="per">Delano</span> after <span class="per">Columbus Delano</span>, Secretary of the Interior under President <span class="per">Ulysses S. Grant</span>. Hotels, saloons, and other new businesses opened over <span class="date">the next two years</span> along with a post office and a toll bridge across the river to <span class="loc">Wichita</span>. Unlike <span class="loc">Wichita</span>, <span class="per">Delano</span> had no law enforcement. As a result, it became an area center of drinking, gambling, and prostitution for cowboys working in the cattle trade. Gunfights occurred as well, including a fatal and locally famous incident between two saloon keepers in <span class="date">1873</span>. In the late 1870s, the cattle trade relocated west to <span class="loc">Dodge City</span>, and <span class="loc">Delano</span>’s period as a rowdy cowtown came to a close.</p><br><br>
