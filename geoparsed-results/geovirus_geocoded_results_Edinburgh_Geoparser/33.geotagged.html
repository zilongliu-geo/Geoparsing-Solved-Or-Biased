<p>Cases of the H5 type of the avian flu have been discovered in Romanian and Ukrainian fowl. <span class="loc">Romania</span> has banned hunting in parts of the country and Ukrainian troops have moved from house to house in villages rounding up chickens, ducks and geese for a mass cull. The village of <span class="loc">Ciocile</span> in the Romanian <span class="loc">county of BrÄƒila</span> has been quarantined and thousands of birds have been killed in an attempt to contain the outbreak, the Bucharest Daily News reported. The H5 virus had been detected in nearby villages of Bumbacari and Dudescu in previous tests on Thursday. Romanian Agriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur said that further tests in a British laboratory will be needed to determine whether the outbreak is the lethal H5N1 strain, which is feared to be able to mutate into a form that would be easily transmitted between humans. The H5N1 strain has already been confirmed in the villages of <span class="loc">Ceamurlia de Jos</span>, <span class="loc">Maliuc</span> and <span class="loc">Caraorman</span>, where the virus is suspected to have been brought by birds from <span class="loc">Russia</span>. The large delta area is a destination for migrating fowl. Meanwhile, five Ukrainian villages in <span class="loc">Crimea</span> have been the site for a mass cull in order to contain the country's first bird flu outbreak. Though tough measures are being taken in the area, villagers say their poultry had been infected by the disease for more than two months without any official action being taken.</p>
