  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salto</span> is the capital city of the <span class="org">Salto Department</span> in northwestern <span class="loc">Uruguay</span>. As of the <span class="date">2011</span> census it had a population of 104,028 and is the second most populated city in <span class="loc">Uruguay</span>. It is served by the <span class="org">Nueva Hesperides International Airport</span>. The city is located on Route 3 about 496 kilometres (308 mi) northwest of <span class="loc">Montevideo</span>, and on the east bank of the Río <span class="loc">Uruguay</span> across from the <span class="loc">city of Concordia</span> in <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. About 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) north of the city the <span class="loc">Salto Grande</span> Bridge, built on top of the <span class="loc">Salto Grande</span> Dam, joins the two sides. Built on hills and bluffs, the city is situated near the <span class="loc">Rio Uruguay</span>'s 'big jump' falls, which is also the location of the <span class="loc">Salto Grande</span> Dam. The land is low lying alongside the river bank, with an elevation of 48 metres (157 ft) above sea level. During the Guarani War the governor of <span class="loc">Rio de la Plata</span>, <span class="per">José</span> de Andonaegui, and the <span class="per">Marquis of Valdelirios</span> pleaded with Governor <span class="per">José Joaquín</span> de <span class="loc">Viana</span> to move north with an army of 400 men and enforce the terms of the Treaty of <span class="loc">Madrid</span>. In <span class="date">October of 1756</span> <span class="loc">Viana</span> built several barracks for his army located in the area who had to survive on hunting and fishing. The sheds he built were called <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> del <span class="loc">Salto Chico</span>. Thus, the short-lived first settlement in the present <span class="loc">city of Salto</span> dates from <span class="date">8 November 1756</span>, which remains as its date of foundation. Some people say it was "by chance", such as the writer <span class="per">Francisco Bauza</span> in his book Dominación española en <span class="loc">Uruguay</span>. In <span class="date">1757</span>, <span class="loc">Viana</span> and the superior Governor of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="per">Pedro de Cevallos</span>, built a strong fort called <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>. The fort had a chapel, which was under the patronage of <span class="loc">San Antonio de Padua</span>. Also in that period, Spanish troops captured the Portuguese colony at <span class="loc">Colonia del Sacramento</span> and used its facilities for <span class="date">seven years</span> before abandoning it in <span class="date">1763</span>.</p><br><br>
