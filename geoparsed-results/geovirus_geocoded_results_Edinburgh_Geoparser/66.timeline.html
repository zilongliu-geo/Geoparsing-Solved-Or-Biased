  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">John Clifford</span>, Chief Veterinarian of the <span class="loc">United States Department of Agriculture</span>, confirms that tests done on a sample from a cow on a farm in <span class="loc">Alabama</span> indicate bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease. The original results were confirmed by a Western Blot Test. "We received a positive result on a Western blot confirmatory test conducted at the USDA laboratories in <span class="loc">Ames</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, on samples from an animal that had tested 'inconclusive' on a rapid screening test performed on <span class="date">Friday, March 10, 2006</span>. In this instance, the inconclusive result from the contract lab in <span class="loc">Georgia</span> was confirmed through a second rapid test at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. <span class="date">Now</span>, the Western blot test has returned a positive result, and that is sufficient for us to confirm this animal to be positive for BSE, which is why we are making this announcement <span class="date">today</span>," said <span class="per">Clifford</span>. "The samples were taken from a non-ambulatory animal on a farm in <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. A local private veterinarian euthanized and sampled the animal and sent the samples for further testing, which was conducted at one of our contract diagnostic laboratories at the <span class="org">University</span> of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. The animal was buried on the farm, and it did not enter the animal or human food chains," he added. This is the third case of Mad Cow disease in the <span class="loc">U.S</span>. The first case turned up in <span class="date">December of 2003</span>, when a cow from a <span class="loc">Washington</span> state farm, born in <span class="loc">Canada</span>, tested positive for the disease. The second cow to test positive for the disease, found <span class="date">last June</span>, was born on a farm in <span class="loc">Texas</span>. On <span class="date">March 1, 2006</span>, <span class="loc">Sweden</span> announced its first possible case of Mad Cow disease, and on <span class="date">January 23</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> announced its fourth case of the disease. Worldwide, at least 150 people have died from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is linked to Mad Cow disease.</p><br><br>
