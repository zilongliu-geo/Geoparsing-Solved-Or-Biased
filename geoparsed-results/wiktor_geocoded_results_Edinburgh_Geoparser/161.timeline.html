  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Banda</span> is a hill that lies in <span class="loc">Nakawa Division</span>, within <span class="loc">Kampala</span>, the capital of <span class="loc">Uganda</span>, the third-largest economy in the East <span class="org">African Community</span>. <span class="loc">Banda</span> also refers to the neighborhoods on the slopes of the hill and between <span class="loc">Banda Hill</span> and <span class="loc">Kireka</span>, extending all the way to the Kampala-Jinja Highway. The southwestern slopes of the hill are occupied by the neighbourhood known as <span class="loc">Kyambogo</span>, and is the location of the campus of <span class="org">Kyambogo University</span>, one of the nine public universities in the country. <span class="loc">Banda</span> is bordered by Kiwaatule to the north, <span class="loc">Kireka</span> to the east, Kinnawattaka to the southeast, <span class="loc">Mbuya</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Nakawa</span> to the southwest, Ntinda to the west and northwest. The location of the hill is approximately 11 kilometres (6.8 mi), by road, east of <span class="loc">Kampala</span>'s central business district. The coordinates of <span class="loc">Banda</span> Hill are:0°21'14.0"N, 32°37'57.0"E (Latitude:0.353889; Longitude:32.632500). The full name of <span class="loc">Banda</span> is Bandabalogo. Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, Kabaka Muteesa <span class="per">I Mukaabya</span> Walugembe Kayiira, the 30th <span class="loc">Kabaka</span> of the <span class="loc">Kingdom of Buganda</span>, who reigned from <span class="date">1856</span> until <span class="date">1884</span>, maintained a palace on the hill. It was at this palace that British explorer <span class="per">John Hanning Speke</span> met Kabaka Walugembe Muteesa I in <span class="date">1862</span>. Muteesa detained <span class="per">Speke</span> for some <span class="date">months</span> before finally releasing him in his quest to look for the source of the <span class="loc">Nile River</span>. At <span class="loc">Banda</span>, Muteesa faced many misfortunes, which he attributed to ill luck or witch-craft, thus the name Bandabalogo ("Wizards of <span class="loc">Banda</span>"). He left <span class="loc">Banda</span> and built another palace at <span class="loc">Nabulagala</span> which he later called <span class="loc">Kasubi</span>, named after his mother’s village in <span class="loc">Kyaggwe County</span>, which is <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Mukono District</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, the great, great grandson of Muteesa I, <span class="loc">Kabaka</span> <span class="per">Ronald Muwenda</span> Mutebi II, the reigning Buganda monarch, maintains a palace on the hill with the entrance facing west, as is the tradition.</p><br><br>
