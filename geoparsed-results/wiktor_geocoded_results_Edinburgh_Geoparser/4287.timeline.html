  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Kirkwood</span> is an inner-ring suburb of <span class="per">St. Louis</span> located in St. <span class="loc">Louis County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city's population was 27,540. Founded in <span class="date">1853</span>, the city is named after <span class="per">James P. Kirkwood</span>, builder of the Pacific Railroad through that town. It was the first planned suburb located west of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. Plans for a new community close to <span class="per">St. Louis</span> began following the <span class="per">St. Louis</span> Fire (<span class="date">1849</span>) and the <span class="date">1849</span> cholera outbreak that killed a tenth of the residents of downtown <span class="per">St. Louis</span>. <span class="per">Kirkwood</span> was the first suburban municipality built outside of the St. <span class="loc">Louis City</span> boundaries. <span class="loc">Hiram</span> <span class="per">W. Leffingwell</span> and <span class="per">Richard Smith Elliott</span> bought land 14 miles (23 km) from downtown in <span class="date">1850</span> at about the same time <span class="per">James P. Kirkwood</span> was laying out a route for the Pacific Railroad. <span class="per">Kirkwood</span> was platted in <span class="date">1852</span>, and named for <span class="per">James P. Kirkwood</span>, chief engineer of the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Pacific Railroad. When the railroad reached the community in <span class="date">1853</span>, the developers sold lots for the <span class="org">Kirkwood Association</span>. Other <span class="per">Leffingwell</span> developments were to include the construction of <span class="loc">Grand Avenue</span> and the establishment of <span class="loc">Forest Park</span>.</p><br><br>
