  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is a town in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Sussex County</span>, <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population of the town is 6,422, an increase of 38.3% over <span class="date">the previous decade</span>. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Lewes</span>, sited on the <span class="loc">Delaware Bay</span>, was designated as the first county seat. It was the first colony in <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, founded by the Dutch in <span class="date">1631</span>, and it remained the only significant European settlement in the region for some time. When English colonists <span class="loc">William Penn</span> organized the three southern counties of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, which are <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, <span class="loc">Lewes</span> was the natural choice for the location of the <span class="loc">Sussex County</span>'s <span class="org">Seat</span> of Justice. <span class="loc">Sussex County</span> was not well defined until after <span class="date">1760</span>, following resolution of a dispute between <span class="loc">William Penn</span>'s family and <span class="per">Frederick Calvert</span>, 6th <span class="per">Baron Baltimore</span> after intervention from the <span class="org">Crown</span>. This dispute over borders had delayed discussion over the location of a county seat. Earlier <span class="per">Charles Calvert</span>, 5th <span class="per">Baron Baltimore</span> had argued that the county ended with <span class="loc">Lewes</span>, while Penn's sons stated it continued into <span class="loc">Fenwick Island</span>, which it <span class="date">now</span> does. The Masonâ€“Dixon line was surveyed as part the agreement between the <span class="loc">Penns</span> and <span class="per">Lord Baltimore</span>, and it has since defined the western and southern border of the county. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>, located more centrally in the county, was later designated as its seat for court.</p><br><br>
