  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Limeira</span> is a city in the eastern part of the Brazilian state of São Paulo. The population is 296,440 (<span class="date">2015</span> est.) in an area of 581 km². The elevation is 588 m. It is 154 km from São Paulo, the state capital, and <span class="date">1011</span> km from <span class="loc">Brasilia</span>, <span class="loc">Brazil</span>'s capital. The city can be easily reached from São Paulo by two highways: <span class="per">Rodovia</span> <span class="per">Anhanguera</span> and <span class="per">Rodovia</span> dos <span class="loc">Bandeirantes</span>. Once an important and strategical pole of the coffee culture, <span class="loc">Limeira</span> was also known as the "Brazilian orange capital" due to the great citrus production that occurred in <span class="date">the past</span>, although <span class="date">now</span> the main crop cultivated in the city is the sugar cane. Afterwards, it became recognized by its new plated jewelry and semi-jewelry industry which attract customers from all over the world, giving the city the title of "<span class="loc">Brazil</span>'s plated jewelry capital". There are more than 450 companies that are responsible for half of <span class="loc">Brazil</span>'s exports in this sector. There is a famous farm located in <span class="loc">Limeira</span>, Fazenda Ibicaba, that belonged to <span class="per">Nicolau de Campos</span> Vergueiro, who brought the first immigrants from <span class="loc">Europe</span>, especially from <span class="loc">Germany</span>, <span class="loc">Portugal</span>, <span class="loc">Switzerland</span> and <span class="loc">Belgium</span>, to replace the enslaved African-Brazilian workers, which was basically a government effort to "bleach" the race, as it was feared <span class="loc">Brazil</span> would become a "black country". <span class="loc">Limeira</span> is thus said to have accomplished the first positive experience with immigrant workers in <span class="loc">Brazil</span>. Probably because Northern Europeans preferred to run their own farms rather than to subject themselves to indentured work and the Portuguese tended to work in commerce, Italian immigrants were brought to work the fields. Such immigrant groups were greater in numbers than all the others all over São Paulo state. Northern Europeans and the first Italians to arrive in the country often came with the promise of being granted lands in exchange for their work, but the last ones were treated socially only better than the slaves themselves. The latter, nonetheless, had nowhere to go for jobs as slavery ended and many begged to be rehired for food. The situation of some of them improved when the British installed the railway in the country and gave them prestigious jobs with housing. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Limeira</span> is located in a prosperous region in São Paulo State.</p><br><br>
