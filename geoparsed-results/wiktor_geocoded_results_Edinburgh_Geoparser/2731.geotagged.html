<p>Columbia is a city in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, which was formed six years before <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> was admitted to statehood. Columbia was named for <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, from which many of the early settlers had migrated. The population was 6,603 as of the 2000 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Marion County</span>. The site was first settled by John and William <span class="loc">Lott</span> in the early 19th century, giving the town its original name, Lott's Bluff. It was incorporated as <span class="loc">Columbia</span> on June 25, 1819, becoming the fourth municipality in the state of <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. It served as the temporary capital of <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> from November, 1821, when the 5th session of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Legislature first met there, until 1822. In that year, a special session of the legislature met in <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, inaugurating Governor Walter Leake, and selecting LeFleur's Bluff (now Jackson) as the permanent capital.[1] Former <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> governor and Columbia native Hugh L. White introduced white squirrels to the area, and they are still common in <span class="loc">Columbia City</span> Park.[2] On December 23rd, 2014, an EF3 tornado ripped through areas around <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, killing four people and causing widespread damage.</p>
