<p><span class="loc">Berkeley</span> is a village located in <span class="loc">Cook County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Incorporated in 1924, the population at the 2010 census was 5,209. The town has a commuter railroad station on Metra's Union Pacific/<span class="loc">West Line</span> with service to downtown <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> is on <span class="loc">Cook County</span>'s western border, 14 miles west of the <span class="loc">Chicago Loop</span>. With Interstates 290 and 294 forming its western and part of its southern boundary, and the Union Pacific Railroad (formerly the <span class="loc">Chicago</span> &amp; <span class="loc">North Western</span>) and the large Proviso Railyard (a classification yard) to the north, <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> has ready access to the metropolitan region. Yet the transportation corridors that make <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> accessible to distant places also serve to separate the village from its nearest neighbors, creating a small-town atmosphere. <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> is located at 41°53′12″N 87°54′38″W (41.886794, -87.910528). According to the 2010 census, <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> has a total area of 1.4 square miles (3.63 km2), all land. Beginning in 1835 the area that was to become <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> was home to farmers, most of German and Dutch ancestry. Settling on farms that ranged from 40 to 160 acres, the Dutch tended to be truck farmers, while the Germans did general farming. This small group of farm families established a one-room school called <span class="loc">Sunnyside</span> in 1848. Now housed in a larger and newer building, Sunnyside Elementary School still operates today. A short distance west on St. Charles Road (which was completed in 1836), farmland was donated for what is now known as Old Settler's Cemetery.</p>
