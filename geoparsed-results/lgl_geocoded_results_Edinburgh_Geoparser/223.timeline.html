  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>More bad wiring imperils troops in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>. <span class="loc">WASHINGTON</span> — The military is racing to inspect more than 90,000 <span class="loc">U.S.</span>-run facilities across <span class="loc">Iraq</span> to reduce a deadly threat troops face far off the battlefield: electrocution or shock while showering or using appliances. About one-third of the inspections so far have turned up major electrical problems, according to interviews and an internal military document obtained by The Associated Press. Half of the problems they found have since been fixed but about 65,000 facilities still need to be inspected, which could take the rest of <span class="date">this year</span>. Senior Pentagon officials were on <span class="loc">Capitol</span> Hill <span class="date">this week</span> for briefings on the findings. The work assigned to Task Force SAFE, which oversees the inspections and repairs, is aimed at preventing deaths like that of Staff <span class="per">Sgt. Ryan Maseth</span>, 24, of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. He died in <span class="date">January 2008</span>, one of at least three soldiers killed while showering since the invasion of <span class="loc">Iraq</span> in <span class="date">2003</span>. Scores more soldiers suffered shocks between <span class="date">September 2006</span> and <span class="date">July 2008</span>, according to a database maintained by <span class="org">KBR Inc.</span>, the <span class="loc">Houston</span>-based contractor that oversees maintenance at most <span class="loc">U.S.</span> facilities in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>. “We got a ton of buildings we know probably aren’t safe and we just don’t have them done yet,” said Jim Childs, an electrician the task force hired to help with the inspections. “It’s Russian roulette. I cringe every time I hear of a shock.” <span class="per">Ron Vance</span>, who served as a sergeant in the California <span class="org">Army</span> National Guard, remembers being knocked out cold in a shower building in <span class="date">2004</span> in <span class="loc">Taji</span>, <span class="loc">Iraq</span>. He said he screamed and fell while showering, suffering burns on his back and shoulders. Another soldier who tried to pry him from the shower head also was injured. <span class="per">Vance</span>, 57, of <span class="loc">Fresno</span>, <span class="loc">Calif.</span>, said he’s still too traumatized to shower without his wife nearby. Sen. <span class="per">Bob Casey</span>, D-Pa. , called Task Force SAFE’s findings troubling. He said the task force is doing good work but said problems should have been fixed much earlier. “Just imagine getting the news that they’ve done 25,000 facilities, but your son or daughter is in the 65,000 they haven’t done,” <span class="per">Casey</span> told the AP. <span class="date">Last year</span>, 94 troops stationed in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>, <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span> or other Central Command countries sought medical treatment for electric shock, according to Defense Department health data. KBR’s database lists 231 electric shock incidents in the more than 89,000 facilities the company runs in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>, according to military records. KBR is the target of a wrongful death lawsuit filed by <span class="per">Maseth</span>’s family. They claim the company knew there were electrical problems in the building where he died, but didn’t fix them. His mother testified <span class="date">last year</span> on <span class="loc">Capitol</span> Hill. <span class="org">Army</span> investigators have since reclassified <span class="per">Maseth</span>’s death as negligent homicide caused by KBR and two of its supervisors. An <span class="org">Army</span> investigator said KBR failed to ensure work was done by qualified electricians and plumbers. The case is under legal review. “KBR is not responsible for the electrocution deaths widely reported, including that of Staff <span class="per">Sgt. Ryan Maseth</span>,” <span class="per">Heather Browne</span>, a KBR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. KBR and another contractor, <span class="org">Arkel International</span>, are the targets of a second lawsuit, filed by the family of another soldier electrocuted in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>, Staff <span class="per">Sgt. Christopher Lee Everett</span>, 23, of <span class="loc">Huntsville</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. <span class="per">Everett</span>, a member of the <span class="org">Texas Army National Guard</span>, was killed in <span class="date">September 2005</span> when the power washer he was using to clean a vehicle short-circuited. Task Force SAFE inspectors found many of the facilities <span class="date">that fall</span> under KBR’s contract have electrical problems, according to an internal military document obtained by The Associated Press. Of the 20,340 maintained by KBR and inspected so far, 6,935 failed the government inspection, the document said. When about 2,000 of the buildings with faulty work were re-inspected, the facilities passed, the document said. The Defense Contract Management Agency has accepted KBR’s plans to correct the problems, according to the document the AP obtained. It said the agency will closely oversee KBR’s work. Sen. <span class="per">Byron Dorgan</span>, D-N.D., questioned why KBR has been allowed to continue to perform electrical work in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>. He said the military should take a more careful look at the electrical work in <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>, too, where KBR also has a large contract for electrical work. “If they found widespread problems, the obvious question is why has there not been action to remove the contract and bring in another contractor?” <span class="per">Dorgan</span> said. <span class="per">Browne</span>, the company spokeswoman, said KBR has cooperated with the government, performing technical inspection and providing requested information. Task Force SAFE (the acronym stands for <span class="org">Safety Action for Fire and Electricity</span>) said it is making progress. The <span class="org">Army</span> is tracking reports of just over two fires each day in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>, mostly blamed on electrical faults. But that’s down from nearly five fires <span class="date">a day</span>, Brig. <span class="per">Gen. Kurt Stein</span> said in an e-mail to the AP. <span class="per">Stein</span> said the number of electrical shocks has also been reduced. “Although we are still seeing some electrical shocks, they tend to be minor and are often preventable,” <span class="per">Stein</span> said. In addition to the repairs, <span class="per">Stein</span> said the military has purchased more reliable surge protectors to replace ones that had been bought in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>. “Our hearts go out to the families of those who died or were injured from electrical shock or fire,” <span class="per">Stein</span> said. “We take our job to inspect, identify, repair and prevent electrical and fire incidents very seriously.” <span class="per">Vance</span>, the guardsman who was shocked in the shower, said the military didn’t take his injuries seriously. He’s since retired on partial disability from the Veterans Affairs Department for a “cognitive disorder” related to the incident, but he has sought additional compensation for what he describes as ongoing knee and shoulder problems for falling in the shower. “I really don’t think they cared. I didn’t die,” <span class="per">Vance</span> said. “It wasn’t a priority on their list. It was like, he’s fine. He’s alive. He’s OK.”</p><br><br>
