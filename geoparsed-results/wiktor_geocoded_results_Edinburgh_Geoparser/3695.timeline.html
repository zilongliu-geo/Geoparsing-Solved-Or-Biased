  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Auckland</span>, in northern <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. It is located on the north shore of the <span class="loc">Waitemata Harbour</span>, four kilometres northwest of the <span class="loc">Auckland city</span> centre. <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> was a city until amalgamated into <span class="loc">North Shore</span> City; prior to that it was a borough. As a city and borough it included areas known as: <span class="loc">Birkenhead Point</span>, <span class="loc">Highbury</span>, <span class="loc">Chatswood</span>, <span class="loc">Verrans</span> Corner, <span class="loc">Birkdale</span> and <span class="loc">Beach Haven</span>. Since amalgamation took place, it is less clear whether "<span class="loc">Birkenhead</span>" includes <span class="loc">Verrans</span> Corner, <span class="loc">Birkdale</span> and <span class="loc">Beach Haven</span>. In <span class="date">November 2010</span>, the suburb was included into the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> ward, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of the new <span class="loc">Auckland city</span>, under authority of the <span class="org">Auckland Council</span>. Under the new <span class="org">Auckland Council</span>, <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> is part of the <span class="org">Kaipatiki Local Board Area</span>. The southern part of the suburb is known as <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> Point and lies on a promontory between <span class="loc">Chelsea</span> Bay and Little <span class="loc">Shoal Bay</span>, one kilometre to the west of the northern approaches to the Auckland Harbour Bridge. It is surrounded by the suburbs of <span class="loc">Northcote</span> and <span class="loc">Highbury</span> to the north and <span class="loc">Chelsea</span> and <span class="loc">Chatswood</span> to the west.</p><br><br>
