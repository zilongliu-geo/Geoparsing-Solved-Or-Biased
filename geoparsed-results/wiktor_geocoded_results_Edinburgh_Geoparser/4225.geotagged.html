<p>Winton, originally "Withington" is an area north-east of <span class="loc">Eccles</span> in <span class="loc">Salford</span>, <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The population of the <span class="loc">City of Salford</span> ward at the 2011 census was 12,067. Historically in <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, <span class="loc">Winton</span> is a residential area surrounded by <span class="loc">Patricroft</span>, <span class="loc">Peel Green</span>, <span class="loc">Monton</span>, <span class="loc">Barton-upon-Irwell</span>, <span class="loc">Eccles</span> and <span class="loc">Worsley</span>. Winton is between <span class="loc">Monton</span>, <span class="loc">Worsley</span>, <span class="loc">Peel Green</span> and <span class="loc">Patricroft</span>, divided by the motorway interchange of the M602, M60 and M62. The boundaries of Winton are the Liverpool-Manchester railway on <span class="loc">New Lane</span> (borders with <span class="loc">Peel Green</span>), the railway on <span class="loc">Worsley</span> Road (borders with <span class="loc">Patricroft</span>), the <span class="loc">Bridgewater Canal</span> bridge at the top of <span class="loc">Parrin</span> Lane (borders with <span class="loc">Monton</span>) and the <span class="loc">Worsley</span> Road/<span class="loc">Barton</span> Road change (borders with <span class="loc">Worsley</span>). Winton, along with some of its neighbouring villages, including <span class="loc">Barton</span> and <span class="loc">Monton</span>, is believed to be <span class="loc">Saxon</span> in origin. However, Winton is not in the Domesday Book although neighbouring <span class="loc">Barton</span> is. Winton is believed to have been originally known as Withinton. In 1262, Richard de Winton was granted 7 acres (28,000 m2) of land by former landowner, Thomas Grelley, at a rate of one shilling and two pence (1s 2d or 6p) per year. These 7 acres (28,000 m2) grew over the next few decades to become the hamlet of Winton.</p>
