<p><span class="loc">Fala</span>, is a hamlet in the south-eastern corner of <span class="loc">Midlothian</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, and about 15 miles from <span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>. The parish is about five miles long from east to west, and one mile broad from north to south, and contains about 3,120 acres (12.6 km2). It is bounded by the following parishes: <span class="loc">Humbie</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Soutra</span> (to which it is now conjoined) on the south, <span class="loc">Heriot</span> &amp; Stow on the west, and on the north by the detached parts of <span class="loc">Borthwick</span>, <span class="loc">Cranstoun</span>, and <span class="loc">Crichton</span>. <span class="loc">Fala</span> <span class="loc">Hall Burn</span> rises in the moor to the south of <span class="loc">Fala Flow</span> and forms the boundary between <span class="loc">Fala</span> and <span class="loc">Soutra</span> parishes. The streams eventually run into the <span class="loc">Cakemuir Burn</span> above Costerton. Due to its location, the village, and more so <span class="loc">Fala Dam</span> due to its topography, can often get cut off from the outside world during heavy snowfalls, with residents known to be snowed in for several days. In 1834 a road (today the A68), with a still extant Toll House at <span class="loc">Fala</span>, was constructed between <span class="loc">Edinburgh</span> and <span class="loc">Lauder</span> and it bisects the parish, marking off the cultivated lands to the east from the pastures to the west. To the west of this highway can be traced the King's Road, which is said to have been made by King Malcolm IV to cross the Lammermuirs to <span class="loc">Lauderdale</span>. Dere Street, the Roman road, can be traced at various places on the hills towards Channelkirk to the south west of the A68.</p>
