<p><span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is the shire town and county seat of <span class="loc">Windsor County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the town population was 3,048. It includes the villages of <span class="loc">South Woodstock</span>, <span class="loc">Taftsville</span>, and <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>. Chartered by <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Governor Benning Wentworth on July 10, 1761, the town was a <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> grant to David Page and 61 others. It was named after <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> in <span class="loc">Oxfordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, as a homage to both <span class="loc">Blenheim Palace</span> and its owner, George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough. The town was first settled in 1768 by James Sanderson and his family. In 1776, Major Joab Hoisington built a gristmill, followed by a sawmill, on the south branch of the <span class="loc">Ottauquechee River</span>. The town was incorporated in 1837. Although the Revolution slowed settlement, <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> developed rapidly once the war ended in 1783. The Vermont General Assembly met here in 1807 before moving the next year to the new capital at <span class="loc">Montpelier</span>. Waterfalls in the <span class="loc">Ottauquechee River</span> provided water power to operate mills. Factories made scythes and axes, carding machines, and woolens. There was a machine shop and gunsmith shop. Manufacturers also produced furniture, wooden wares, window sashes and blinds. Carriages, horse harnesses, saddles, luggage trunks and leather goods were also manufactured. By 1859, the population was 3,041. The <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> Railroad opened to White River Junction on September 29, 1875, carrying freight and tourists. The <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> Inn opened in 1892.</p>
