Its one-character abbreviation is "豫" (yù), named after <span class="loc">Yuzhou</span> (豫州; Yùzhōu), a Han Dynasty state (zhou) that included parts of <span class="loc">Henan</span>. Although the name of the province (河南) means "south of the river", approximately a quarter of the province lies north of the <span class="loc">Yellow River</span>, also known as the "<span class="loc">Huang He</span>". <span class="loc">Henan</span> is often referred to as <span class="loc">Zhongyuan</span> or <span class="loc">Zhongzhou</span> (中州) which literally means "central plain land" or "midland", although the name is also applied to the entirety of <span class="loc">China</span> proper. <span class="loc">Henan</span> is the birthplace of Chinese civilization with over <span class="date">3,000 years</span> of recorded history, and remained <span class="loc">China</span>'s cultural, economical, and political center until <span class="date">approximately 1,000 years ago</span>. Numerous heritages have been left behind including the ruins of Shang Dynasty capital city Yin and the Shaolin Temple.
