  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Madison</span> will dump assessors . DANIELSVILLE - <span class="loc">Madison County</span> commissioners voted <span class="date">Monday</span> to wipe clean the county Board of Tax Assessors by dismissing all four members. The county attorney will draft a letter of dismissal for the assessors laying out the reasons they're being dismissed and letting them know when they can appear before commissioners to tell their side of the story. <span class="date">Monday</span>'s vote, which was unanimous, comes after commissioners voted to take away the assessors' power over personnel and after Commission Chairman Anthony Dove requested that all the assessors resign. The tax assessors office and its governing board have been in turmoil for <span class="date">years</span> and failed to finish the county's tax digest on time for nearly <span class="date">a decade</span>. The chronically late digests - compilations of the value of all taxable county property - have caused confusion for taxpayers, who may have to pay <span class="date">two years</span>' worth of taxes in <span class="date">2009</span>, Dove said at <span class="date">Monday</span>'s meeting. "When you're hired to do a job, if you do not do your job in <span class="date">a week</span>, you're let go - certainly, if you do not do that job in <span class="date">years</span>," he said. Dove said he was forced to take action after the assessors recommended only one candidate in <span class="date">four months</span> to fill the long-open job of chief appraiser and after the interim chief offered her resignation <span class="date">this month</span>. Commissioners <span class="per">Stanley Thomas</span> and <span class="per">John Pethel</span> agreed that problems with the assessors had gone on long enough. "Every section of the county, every taxpayer is concerned about this tax situation," <span class="per">Thomas</span> said. Although the assessors board's chairman has promised to bring <span class="date">this year</span>'s digest in on time, "we're further behind <span class="date">now</span> than we have been in the last two or <span class="date">three years</span>," <span class="per">Pethel</span> said. "I don't know how he intends to get the digest out without a chief appraiser." Commissioners voted to dismiss the assessors after a brief closed-door session <span class="date">Monday night</span>. Commissioners also said they would vote <span class="date">next month</span> on Dove's recommendation for a new chief appraiser. Before closing the meeting to the public, Commissioner <span class="per">Mike Youngblood</span> pointed out that Board of Assessors Chairman <span class="per">David Ragland</span> has been on the board for only <span class="date">seven months</span>. Assessors <span class="per">Jim Escoe</span> and <span class="per">Larry Stewart</span>, who were appointed by commissioners in <span class="date">August 2005</span>, attended <span class="date">Monday</span>'s meeting. <span class="per">Ragland</span> and board Vice Chairwoman <span class="per">Samantha Garland</span>, who was appointed in <span class="date">April 2004</span>, were not there. <span class="per">Escoe</span> said after the meeting he's approached commissioners at least a couple of times to explain the problems in the tax office, but he's been ignored. "They don't want to know what the problem is," he said. "They think the problem exists in everything." The assessors don't plan on backing down by resigning, and <span class="per">Escoe</span> said he would take his case to a judge. "I relish this; I want this," he said. "<span class="date">Now</span> we can go and get this out in the public."</p><br><br>
