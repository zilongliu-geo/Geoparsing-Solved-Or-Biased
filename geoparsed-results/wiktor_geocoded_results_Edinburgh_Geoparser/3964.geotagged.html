Since December 2015 significant improvements to the frequency of the Local Link (formerly known as Déise Link) bus service are in effect. A bus shelter has also been provided in the town. There are now four services a day each way Mondays to Saturdays inclusive to <span class="loc">Dungarvan</span> via <span class="loc">Cappoquin</span> including a commuter service. Connections to <span class="loc">Waterford</span> and <span class="loc">Rosslare</span> Europort can be made at <span class="loc">Dungarvan</span>. In the other direction there are four services to and from Tallow where connections can be made for <span class="loc">Fermoy</span>. On Saturdays a local bus company operate a service to Cork. On Sundays Bus Éireann route 366 links <span class="loc">Lismore</span> to <span class="loc">Dungarvan</span> and <span class="loc">Waterford</span>.
