  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Exeter</span> (/ˈɛksᵻtər/) is a cathedral city in <span class="loc">Devon</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> with a population of 124,328 (mid-2014 est.). It lies within the ceremonial <span class="loc">county of Devon</span>, of which it is the county town as well as the home of <span class="org">Devon County Council</span>. Currently, the administrative area has the status of a non-metropolitan district and is therefore under the administration of the <span class="org">County Council</span> (there was a plan to grant the city unitary authority status, although this was scrapped under the <span class="date">2010</span> coalition government). The city is on the <span class="loc">River Exe</span> about 37 miles (60 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> and 70 miles (110 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Bristol</span>. <span class="loc">Exeter</span> was the most south-westerly Roman fortified settlement in <span class="loc">Britain</span>, although there is evidence a Cornish tribe existed in <span class="loc">Exeter</span> before the Roman invasion. <span class="loc">Exeter</span> became a religious centre during the Middle Ages and into the Tudor times: <span class="loc">Exeter</span> Cathedral, founded in the mid 11th century, became Anglican during the 16th-century English Reformation. During the late 19th century, <span class="loc">Exeter</span> became an affluent centre for the wool trade, although by the First World War the city was in decline. After the Second World War, much of the city centre was rebuilt and is <span class="date">now</span> considered to be a centre for modern business and tourism in <span class="loc">Devon</span> and <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>.</p><br><br>
