  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Batavia</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. It was founded in <span class="date">1833</span>, and is the oldest city in <span class="loc">Kane County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. A small portion of <span class="loc">Batavia</span> lies in <span class="loc">DuPage County</span>. During the latter part of the 19th century, <span class="loc">Batavia</span>, home to six American-style windmill manufacturing companies, became known as "The Windmill City." Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, a federal government-sponsored high-energy physics laboratory, where both the bottom quark and the top quark were first detected, is located in the city. <span class="loc">Batavia</span> is part of a vernacular region known as the Tri-City area, along with <span class="per">St. Charles</span> and <span class="loc">Geneva</span>, all western suburbs of similar size and relative socioeconomic condition. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a total population of 26,045, which was estimated to have increased to 26,318 by <span class="date">July 2012</span>. <span class="loc">Batavia</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1833</span> by <span class="per">Christopher Payne</span> and his family. Originally called Big Woods for the wild growth throughout the settlement, the town was renamed by local judge and former Congressman <span class="per">Isaac Wilson</span> in <span class="date">1840</span> after his former home of <span class="loc">Batavia</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. Because <span class="per">Judge Wilson</span> owned the majority of the town, he was given permission to rename the city.</p><br><br>
