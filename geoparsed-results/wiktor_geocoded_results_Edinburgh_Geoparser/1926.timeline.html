  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Thornton</span> (Scots: <span class="loc">Thorntoun</span>) is a village in Fife, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is between <span class="loc">Kirkcaldy</span> and <span class="loc">Glenrothes</span>, and stands between the <span class="loc">River Ore</span> and <span class="loc">Lochty Burn</span>, which are at opposite ends of the main street. The village has a small railway station, which is called <span class="loc">Glenrothes</span> with <span class="loc">Thornton</span>. Although situated at the south end of <span class="loc">Thornton</span>, it also serves the <span class="loc">Glenrothes</span> area. This rail halt was opened in <span class="date">May 1992</span>, restoring a rail service to <span class="loc">Thornton</span> lost when its main line railway station closed in <span class="date">October 1969</span> as a consequence of the <span class="date">1963</span> report by Dr <span class="per">Richard Beeching</span> on the Reshaping of British Railways (the Beeching Report). The village is well served by local buses, operated by Stagecoach in Fife and running between <span class="loc">Kirkcaldy</span> and <span class="loc">Glenrothes</span>. However, express services between those towns bypass <span class="loc">Thornton</span>. During the first part of the 20th century, <span class="loc">Thornton</span> railway station was situated on the <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> to <span class="loc">London</span> main line to the east of the village, at the end of Station Road. To the west, alongside the <span class="loc">Dunfermline</span> line, was built the largest railway marshalling yard in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> during <span class="date">the 1950s</span>. Though much reduced, this yard is still in use for rail freight services.</p><br><br>
