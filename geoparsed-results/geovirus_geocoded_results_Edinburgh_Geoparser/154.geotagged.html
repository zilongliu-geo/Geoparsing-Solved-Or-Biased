<p>"18 hours of mass hysteria" (according to the Sunday Times of India) broke out last Friday in <span class="loc">Mumbai</span> as hundreds of residents flocked to <span class="loc">Mahim</span> Creek, one of the most polluted creeks in <span class="loc">India</span> that receives thousands of tonnes of raw sewage and industrial waste every day after reports that the salt water had suddenly turned "sweet". Television reports showed people drinking water on the spot with their hands, and others bathing, apparently to wash away their sins with the "holy" water. At the height of the hysteria, bottled mineral water was selling for Rs 50 (RM4.50), with people buying the mineral water simply for the bottles, pouring away the mineral water and filling the bottles with water from the creek. News reports of the <span class="loc">Mahim</span> Creek incident sparked further mass hysteria at <span class="loc">Gujarat</span> within hours, with residents there claiming that seawater at Teethal beach in <span class="loc">Valsad</span> had also turned sweet. About 400 people had gathered by the beach in the evening. In the aftermath of the incident, local authorities stated that they were being were extra vigilant because of the possibility of a severe outbreak of water-borne diseases, such as gastroenteritis as a result of so many people drinking contaminated water. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board had warned people not to drink the water, but despite this many people had collected it in bottles, even as plastic and rubbish had drifted by on the current. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai had ordered a bacteriological report into the "sweet" water, but suspected that "contamination in the water might have been reduced due to the waters from <span class="loc">Mithi</span> River flowing into the mouth of <span class="loc">Mahim Bay</span>". By Saturday morning, the hysteria had died down, as the taste of the water had returned to normal.</p>
