  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Navarro</span> (formerly known as <span class="per">Wendling</span>) is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Mendocino County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span>. It is located 18 miles (29 km) west of <span class="loc">Ukiah</span>, at an elevation of 269 feet (82 m). It may be reached via California State Route 128, which connects it to the Pacific coast to the west and to the <span class="loc">Anderson</span> Valley to the southeast. A former town of approximately 1000 people named <span class="loc">Navarro</span> was founded in the 1860s, located approximately 14 miles to the west of the present town, at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Navarro River</span> in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Navarro River</span> Redwoods State Park. A post office opened there in <span class="date">1867</span>. In <span class="date">1902</span>, the mill at the mouth of the river burned down, and the post office closed. A new mill was built in <span class="date">that year</span> by <span class="per">G. C. Wendling</span> on the north fork of the <span class="loc">Navarro River</span>, at the present location of <span class="loc">Navarro</span>, and in <span class="date">1905</span> the town of <span class="per">Wendling</span> was founded around the mill; a post office was opened there in <span class="date">1914</span>. However, in <span class="date">1916</span> the <span class="per">Wendling</span> mill was bought by the <span class="org">Navarro Lumber Company</span>, at which point <span class="per">Wendling</span> became known as <span class="loc">Navarro</span> Mill or more simply <span class="loc">Navarro</span>. To reduce confusion, the dwindling seaside town of <span class="loc">Navarro</span> became known as Old <span class="loc">Navarro</span>, <span class="loc">Navarro</span> Ridge, or Navarro-by-the-sea.</p><br><br>
