  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Alta</span> is a town in Salt <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 383 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, a slight increase from the <span class="date">2000</span> figure of 370. <span class="loc">Alta</span> is also the location of <span class="org">Alta Ski Area</span>, a ski resort that has 500,000 visitors <span class="date">a year</span>. It is known for its powder skiing and its refusal to allow snowboarding. <span class="loc">Alta</span> has been important to the development of skiing in <span class="loc">Utah</span>. <span class="loc">Alta</span> was founded about <span class="date">1865</span> to house miners from the Emma mine, the Flagstaff mine, and other silver mines in Little Cottonwood Canyon. Sensationally rich silver ore in the Emma mine enabled its owners to sell the mine at an inflated price to British investors in <span class="date">1871</span>. The subsequent exhaustion of the Emma ore body led to the recall of the American ambassador to <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>, who was a director of the company, and Congressional hearings in <span class="loc">Washington</span>. An <span class="date">1878</span> fire and an <span class="date">1885</span> avalanche destroyed most of the original mining town, though some mining activity persisted into the 20th century. By <span class="date">the 1930s</span>, only one resident, <span class="per">George Watson</span>, remained in the town. Facing back taxes on mining claims he owned, Watson donated much of the land in <span class="loc">Alta</span> to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Forest Service. Watson stipulated that the Forest Service use the land to construct a ski area. In <span class="date">1935</span>, Norwegian skiing legend Alf Engen was hired to help develop the area, and <span class="loc">Alta</span> opened its first ski lift in <span class="date">1938</span>.</p><br><br>
