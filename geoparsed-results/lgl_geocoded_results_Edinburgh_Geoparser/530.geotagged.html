<p>'The Color Purple' author traveling to <span class="loc">Gaza</span>. Pulitzer-prize winning author Alice Walker, who wrote "The Color Purple," is traveling to <span class="loc">Gaza</span> along with other female activists to highlight the devastation wrought by the three week long Israeli offensive against the Hamas terror rulers of <span class="loc">Gaza</span>. Pulitzer-prize winning author Alice Walker, who wrote "The Color Purple," is traveling to <span class="loc">Gaza</span> along with other female activists on Sunday. Photo: AP Walker, who was making her first trip to <span class="loc">Gaza</span>, said it was important for Americans who give so much military aid to <span class="loc">Israel</span> to understand how their money was being used. Walker is part of a group of about 60 women going to <span class="loc">Gaza</span> to deliver aid and meet with NGOs and residents. The trip, organized by the <span class="loc">US</span> anti-war group Code Pink, is intended to push both <span class="loc">Israel</span> and <span class="loc">Egypt</span> to open the borders into <span class="loc">Gaza</span>, said Medea Benjamin, co-founder of Code Pink who helped organize the trip.</p>
