  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Lamont</span> visits Harwinton supporters. HARWINTON — Former Democratic Senate nominee <span class="per">Ned Lamont</span> appeared at the <span class="org">Harwinton Senior Center</span> <span class="date">Sunday</span> to share his thoughts on <span class="per">President Obama</span>’s <span class="date">first two months</span> in office and the current state of Connecticut’s economy. Speaking to a crowd of around 35 people made up mostly of <span class="org">Harwinton Democratic Town Committee</span> members, <span class="per">Lamont</span> thanked the locals who, he said, supported him so vigorously during his failed but hotly contested Senate run against <span class="per">Joe Lieberman</span> in <span class="date">2006</span>. “It’s great to see so many friends here,” he said. Notables among the crowd included Harwinton First Selectman <span class="per">Frank Chiaramonte</span>, Litchfield Selectman <span class="per">Marsha Bernstein</span>, Burlington Selectman <span class="per">Richard Miller</span> and <span class="per">Stamford</span> Mayor <span class="per">Dan Malloy</span>.</p><br><br>
