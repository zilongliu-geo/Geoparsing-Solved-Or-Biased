  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Mornington</span> is a suburb of the <span class="loc">city of Dunedin</span>, in the <span class="loc">South Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. It is situated on hilly slopes 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) to the west of the city centre, the slopes forming part of a ridge which surrounds the heart of the city. At the time of the <span class="date">2006</span> census, the permanent population was 3,393, a decrease of 15 since <span class="date">2001</span>. The use of the name <span class="per">Mornington</span> for the area was first recorded in <span class="date">1862</span>. There seems to be some conjecture about the origin of the name - some sources record it as being purely descriptive, with the suburb receiving the first rays of the sunrise. There is some likelihood, however, that it was named by early landholder David Mailer after <span class="per">Mornington, Victoria</span>. <span class="per">Mornington</span> was a separate borough until amalgamation with <span class="loc">Dunedin city</span> in <span class="date">1916</span> <span class="per">Mornington</span>'s main streets are <span class="loc">Mailer Street</span>, <span class="loc">Elgin Road</span>, <span class="loc">Glenpark Avenue</span>, <span class="loc">Eglinton Road</span>, and <span class="loc">Kenmure Road</span>. It is a mainly residential suburb, with a retail area on <span class="loc">Mailer Street</span>. The suburb is surrounded by the suburbs of <span class="loc">Kenmure</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Roslyn</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Maryhill</span> to the southwest, Belleknowes to the northeast, and The Glen - divided roughly between <span class="loc">Mornington</span> and <span class="loc">Caversham</span> in the southeast.</p><br><br>
