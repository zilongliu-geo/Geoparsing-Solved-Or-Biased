  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Albany</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and the seat of <span class="loc">Dougherty County</span>. Located in southwest <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, it is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Albany</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span> metropolitan area. The population was 77,434 at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, making it the eighth-largest city in <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. The area where <span class="loc">Albany</span> is located was formerly inhabited by the Creek Indians, who called it Thronateeska after their word for "flint" because of the mineral flint that was found near the river. The Creeks used this flintstone to make tools and weapons such as arrowheads. American settlement began with <span class="per">Nelson Tift</span>, a businessman from <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, who took land along the <span class="loc">Flint River</span> in <span class="date">October 1836</span> after Indian removal. The Creek were forced to relocate to Indian Territory west of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. <span class="per">Tift</span> named his new town <span class="loc">Albany</span> after the capital of <span class="loc">New York</span>; both were located at the navigable heads of rivers. <span class="per">Alexander Shotwell</span> laid out the town in <span class="date">1836</span>. It was incorporated as a city by an act of the General Assembly of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> on <span class="date">December 27, 1838</span>. <span class="per">Tift</span> for <span class="date">decades</span> was its leading entrepreneur. An ardent booster, he promoted education, business, and railroad construction. During the Civil War he provided naval supplies and helped build two ships. He opposed Radical Reconstruction inside the state and in Congress and was scornful of the Yankee carpetbaggers who came in. Fair concludes that <span class="per">Tift</span> became "more Southern than many natives." His pro-slavery attitudes before the war and his support for segregation afterward made him compatible with <span class="loc">Georgia</span>'s white elite.</p><br><br>
