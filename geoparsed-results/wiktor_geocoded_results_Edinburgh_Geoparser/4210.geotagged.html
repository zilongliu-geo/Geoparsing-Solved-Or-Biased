<p><span class="loc">Mamer</span> (preferred pronunciation [ˈmaːməɾ]) is a commune and town (strictly classified as a village) in south-western <span class="loc">Luxembourg</span>. It is located 7 km (4.3 mi) west of <span class="loc">Luxembourg</span> City. The commune includes <span class="loc">Mamer</span> itself, and also the smaller communities of <span class="loc">Capellen</span> and <span class="loc">Holzem</span>. <span class="loc">Mamer</span> is situated on the river <span class="loc">Mamer</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Alzette</span>. The A6 motorway from <span class="loc">Luxembourg</span> to <span class="loc">Brussels</span>, also designated European route E25, runs through <span class="loc">Mamer</span>. As of 2014, <span class="loc">Mamer</span>, which lies in the east of the commune, has a population of 8,173. The town is the thirteenth-largest in <span class="loc">Luxembourg</span>. The commune as a whole is the fourteenth-most populous in the country. The Treveri, a Gallic or Celtic tribe, inhabited the region for several hundred years until they were conquered by Julius Caesar in 54 BC. A Celtic necropolis from the 1st century was discovered in the early 1970s on the Juckelsboesch plateau between <span class="loc">Mamer</span> and <span class="loc">Kehlen</span>. A beautiful dark blue glass bowl was among the offerings found in the tombs. During the Gallo-Roman era which lasted until about 450, the Romans built and maintained a number of roads in the area including the Kiem (Latin caminus, road) linking Trier to <span class="loc">Reims</span> through what is now <span class="loc">Mamer</span>. Mambra was a Roman vicus centred on a villa with thermal baths, sited on the banks of the <span class="loc">Mamer</span> River at the eastern end of today's <span class="loc">Mamer</span>. The Roman settlement was burnt by Germanic invaders around 276.</p>
