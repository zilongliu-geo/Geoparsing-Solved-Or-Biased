  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Chandler</span> is an outer suburb of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> 14 kilometres (9 mi) south-east of the CBD. The easternmost point of mainland <span class="loc">Brisbane City</span>, <span class="per">Chandler</span> is a semi-rural suburb consisting largely of bushland and residential properties on acreage, close to the major commercial precincts of <span class="per">Carindale</span> and <span class="per">Capalaba</span>. <span class="per">Chandler</span> is perhaps best known for the <span class="org">Sleeman Centre</span>, a large sporting and entertainment complex. <span class="per">Chandler</span> was named after the former <span class="per">Lord Mayor of Brisbane</span> City Council, Sir <span class="per">John Beals Chandler</span>. It remained sparsely populated for <span class="date">decades</span>, retaining much of its natural bushland. This lack of population motivated the construction of multiple buildings of the <span class="org">Sleeman Centre</span> for the <span class="date">1982</span> Commonwealth Games. The <span class="org">Sleeman Centre</span> housed the suburb's only significant structures until <span class="date">2010</span>, when the former suburb of <span class="loc">Capalaba</span> West became incorporated into <span class="per">Chandler</span>. This extended <span class="per">Chandler</span>'s eastern border to <span class="loc">Tingalpa Creek</span>, separating <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> from <span class="loc">Redland City</span>, and added a small commercial area along Old Cleveland Road to the suburb, including the erroneously named <span class="per">Capalaba</span> Produce Village. In the <span class="date">2011</span> census, the population of <span class="per">Chandler</span> was 1,422, of which 50.4% were female and 49.6% were male. The median age of the <span class="per">Chandler</span> population was <span class="date">42 years</span> of age, <span class="date">5 years</span> above <span class="org">the Australian</span> median.</p><br><br>
