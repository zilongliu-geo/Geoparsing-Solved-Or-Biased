<p>Baldwin is a town in <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,525 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, metropolitan statistical area. First called Flintstown Plantation, it was granted in 1774 by the Massachusetts General Court to survivors of the Concord, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, company commanded by Captain John Flint. It replaced a grant of about 1735 which gave them Township No. 3, because when state borders were adjusted in 1741, the town turned out to be in New Hampshire—present-day Walpole. On June 23, 1802, Flintstown was incorporated as Baldwin, named for Colonel Loammi Baldwin, for whom the Baldwin apple was named. <span class="loc">Sebago</span> was set off and incorporated in 1826. The surface of the town is broken, but with soil favorable to grain and hay. Baldwin would be noted for its orchards, and a factory was established in <span class="loc">East Baldwin</span> for drying apples. There was also a corn factory. Brooks provided water power for various mills which produced board lumber, barrel staves and shooks. During times of drought, the <span class="loc">Saco</span> Water Power Company could regulate water at <span class="loc">Great Falls</span> to run mills down the <span class="loc">Saco River</span> in <span class="loc">Saco</span> and in <span class="loc">Biddeford</span>. The <span class="loc">Portland</span> and Ogdensburg Railroad followed the <span class="loc">Saco</span> River valley for the length of Baldwin.</p>
