The name is a MƒÅori word meaning "eyelash", but has also been said to mean "to bubble up", referring to hot springs in the area. Mount Parakiore is a volcanic dome rising 391 m to the northwest of the town. It is <span class="date">about one million years</span> old, and part of the Harbour Fault which also includes <span class="loc">Mount Hikurangi</span> near <span class="loc">Hikurangi</span>, and <span class="loc">Parahaki</span> in <span class="loc">Whangarei</span>. The population was 7,038 in the <span class="date">2013</span> Census. Coal mining was an early industry in the area.

In <span class="date">1882</span> a short railway line was completed between <span class="loc">Kamo</span> and <span class="loc">Whangarei</span> to carry the coal. This was one of Northland's first railways. The railway still exists as part of the <span class="loc">North Auckland Line</span>. The mine closed in <span class="date">1955</span>, with the seams worked out. <span class="loc">Limonite</span> was also quarried at <span class="loc">Kamo</span>. A <span class="org">Wesleyan</span> church was built in <span class="date">1881</span>, the Anglican All Saints Church in <span class="date">1886</span>, and a Presbyterian church in <span class="date">1911</span>. The first Roman Catholic church in the <span class="loc">Whangarei</span> area opened in <span class="loc">Kamo</span> about <span class="date">1881</span>.</p><br><br>
