  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>State legislator sponsors bill for his industry. A state <span class="org">House</span> leader is sponsoring a bill this session that would make it easier for his industry to sell houses. State Rep. <span class="per">Jay Roberts</span> (R-Ocilla), chairman of the <span class="org">House</span> Majority Caucus, is pushing HB 516, which would prohibit <span class="loc">Georgia</span> communities from putting restrictions on modular homes, which are built off-site at a factory. <span class="per">Roberts</span> is a manager at <span class="org">Georgia Modular Systems</span>, of <span class="loc">Fitzgerald</span>, a maker of manufactured homes, duplexes and townhouses. The lawmaker said he doesn’t consider working on the issue a conflict of interest. “I don’t own a plant, but I do work in a plant,” he said. “I’ve thought about it, but nobody understands this issue. Nobody understands this business.” He said his company does not sell many houses in <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. On his financial disclosure form, <span class="per">Roberts</span> lists himself as an employee of <span class="org">Georgia Modular Systems</span>. In an interview <span class="date">Friday</span>, <span class="per">Roberts</span> would not specify his position at the company, only saying he worked “in management.” He previously was a vice president at another modular-home business. Only a few <span class="loc">Georgia cities</span>, including <span class="loc">Gainesville</span> and <span class="loc">Duluth</span>, have zoning rules that restrict modular homes, but the issue has come up across the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="per">Roberts</span>’ legislation stems from a legal battle that arose in <span class="date">2005</span>, when <span class="loc">Gainesville</span> officials stopped a local modular-home builder from finishing several homes in the city. <span class="per">Grant Smerecznsky</span>, owner of Building Systems Network LLC, sued, and the issue is pending in the courts. He approached <span class="per">Roberts</span> and <span class="per">Steve</span> <span class="loc">Snyder</span>, executive director of the Modular Building Systems Association in <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, <span class="loc">Pa</span>. <span class="per">Smerecznsky</span> said he has never used <span class="per">Roberts</span>’ company as a supplier, but he would if he had the chance. He said he does not think <span class="per">Roberts</span> is serving his own interests with the bill. He said <span class="per">Roberts</span> is simply standing up for an industry that he believes is being discriminated against by some communities because they think modular means mobile homes. “He’s doing what an elected official should do,” <span class="per">Smerecznsky</span> said. “He’s doing something for the people.” <span class="loc">Gainesville</span> Mayor Myrtle Figueras would not comment, citing the court case. Councilman <span class="per">Danny Dunagan</span> also said he could not comment on the case, but said of the bill, “I have a real problem with a legislator pushing legislation that directly affects his business. I think that’s kind of unethical.” <span class="per">Rick Thompson</span>, executive secretary of the <span class="org">Georgia State Ethics Commission</span>, said nothing in the state Ethics-in-Government act prohibits a lawmaker from submitting legislation related to his own business. <span class="loc">Snyder</span> said he called <span class="per">Roberts</span> to talk to him about the issue. Asked in an interview who lobbied for the issue, <span class="loc">Snyder</span> said, “I did.” <span class="per">Thompson</span> said lobbyists for an industry “are required to register and report if they undertake to promote or oppose legislation.” Told about this later, <span class="per">Synder</span> said he initially misspoke. He said he talked with <span class="per">Roberts</span> and provided him copies of similar legislation in other states, but he did not come to <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and lobby. <span class="loc">Snyder</span> is not registered to lobby in <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. <span class="loc">Snyder</span> said he was thinking of flying down for debate on the bill <span class="date">last week</span>, but he decided not to because, “I thought this whole thing was taken care of.” Asked about <span class="per">Roberts</span> pushing a bill affecting his business, <span class="loc">Snyder</span> said, “I get that, but there is nothing diabolical here. I need a legislator who understands our industry. He said he’d be happy to do it.” <span class="per">Synder</span> said <span class="per">Roberts</span> “really did a great job for us. I would hate to see this guy get mud on him.” <span class="per">Roberts</span>’ bill has passed out of the <span class="org">House</span> and is <span class="date">now</span> under consideration in <span class="org">the Senate</span>. Just before it passed, however, opponents of the bill submitted an amendment that weakens its authority over local zoning. The change, <span class="loc">Snyder</span> said, “makes the bill worthless to us.” <span class="per">Roberts</span> said he is <span class="date">now</span> trying to change it back in <span class="org">the Senate</span>. <span class="per">Al Outland</span>, spokesman for the <span class="org">Georgia Municipal Association</span>, said the group was concerned the bill would overrule local zoning, but the amendment allayed their concerns. If the amendment stands, the organization is neutral on the bill, he said. <span class="per">Roberts</span> isn’t the only lawmaker to introduce legislation this session about his own industry. Rep. <span class="per">Clay Cox</span> (R-Lilburn) filed legislation to limit oversight of the private probation business. He is CEO of a large private probation company. After The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the bill, Cox pulled it and said he is reworking it.</p><br><br>
