  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santo Domingo</span> is a third class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 27,596 people. <span class="loc">Santo Domingo</span> is politically subdivided into 36 barangays. The name of the municipality came from its old moniker, "Paggappuan ti <span class="loc">Santol</span> ti <span class="loc">Domingo</span>," an Ilocano term meaning "The source of the <span class="loc">Santol</span> sold every <span class="date">Sunday</span>." <span class="loc">Santol</span> (Sandoricum koetjape) is the name of the tree bearing round, yellowish fruits growing in abundance in the municipality, notably in Barangay Pussuac. During the Spanish era, an enlisted man of the Spanish Civil Guard looked for the source of the santol being sold in the markets of Ciudad Fernandina (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Vigan City</span>) on <span class="loc">Sundays</span> during the <span class="date">months</span> of <span class="date">June</span> to <span class="date">August</span>. To do so, he asked for a leave of absence from his platoon leader to trace the source of the fruits. With his Ilocano guide, he searched the lands north of Villa Fernandina. He found nothing in the neighboring towns of <span class="loc">Bantay</span>, <span class="loc">Santa Catalina</span>, <span class="loc">San Vicente</span>, and <span class="loc">Bantaoay</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">San Ildefonso</span>). He finally found lots of santol-bearing trees in a place north of <span class="loc">Bantaoay</span> <span class="date">now</span> called Barangay Pus-uac. He has found the "Paggappuan ti <span class="loc">Santol</span> ti <span class="loc">Domingo</span>." The town was named <span class="loc">Santo Domingo</span> on account of this feat.</p><br><br>
