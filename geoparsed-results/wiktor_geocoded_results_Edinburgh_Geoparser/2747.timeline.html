  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Perth</span> is a town in <span class="loc">northern Tasmania</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It lies 20 km south of <span class="loc">Launceston</span>, on the Midland Highway. The town has a population of 2,239 and is averaging a 1% increase per year (<span class="date">2001</span> census). <span class="loc">Perth</span> is part of the <span class="org">Northern Midlands Council</span>. Federal Lyons MHR <span class="per">Eric Hutchinson</span> also has an office in the town. At the <span class="date">2006</span> census, <span class="loc">Perth</span> had a population of 2,239. It is the first major town out of <span class="loc">Launceston</span> on the route to <span class="loc">Hobart</span>, and also serves as a major junction for people bypassing <span class="loc">Launceston</span> on the route from <span class="loc">Hobart</span> to the northwest of the state. Like nearby <span class="loc">Longford</span>, <span class="loc">Perth</span> is a historic town with many buildings dating back to the early 19th century. In <span class="date">1837</span>, <span class="date">five years</span> after the practice ceased in <span class="loc">England</span>, the body of <span class="per">John McKay</span> was gibbetted near the spot where he murdered <span class="per">Joseph Wilson</span> near <span class="loc">Perth</span>. There was great outcry, but the body was not removed until an acquaintance of <span class="per">Wilson</span> passed the spot and horrified by the spectacle of <span class="per">McKay</span>'s rotting corpse, pleaded with the authorities to remove it.</p><br><br>
