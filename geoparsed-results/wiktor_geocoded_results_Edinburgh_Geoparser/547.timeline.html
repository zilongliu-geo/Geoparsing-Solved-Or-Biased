  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hastings</span> is a city in <span class="per">Dakota</span> and <span class="per">Washington</span> counties, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, near the confluence of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">Vermillion</span>, and St. Croix Rivers. Its population was 22,172 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Dakota County</span>, which contains most of it as well as a small part extending into <span class="loc">Washington County</span>. It is named for the first elected governor of the state of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="per">Henry Hastings Sibley</span>. The advantages of Hastings's location that led to its original growth are that it is well-drained, provides a good riverboat port, and is close to a hydropower resource at the falls of the <span class="loc">Vermillion River</span>. Other sites closer to the river confluence are either too swampy (<span class="loc">Dakota County</span>) or too hilly (<span class="loc">Washington County</span> and <span class="loc">Pierce County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>). <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 61 and Minnesota State Highways 55 and 316 are three of the main routes in <span class="loc">Hastings</span>. The area around <span class="loc">Hastings</span> was first settled by a military detachment sent from Fort Snelling to guard a blocked shipment of supplies in the <span class="date">winter of 1820</span>. A <span class="per">Lieutenant William G. Oliver</span> camped in an area that would come to be known as <span class="per">Oliver</span>'s Grove, and in <span class="date">1833</span> a trading post was opened there. After the Treaty of <span class="loc">Mendota</span> of <span class="date">1851</span> opened the area for white settlement, <span class="per">Oliver</span>'s Grove was surveyed and incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1857</span>, <span class="date">a year</span> before Minnesota's admission to the union. That same year <span class="loc">Hastings</span> was named the county seat of <span class="loc">Dakota County</span>. The name "Hastings" was drawn out of a hat from suggestions placed in it by several of the original founders.</p><br><br>
