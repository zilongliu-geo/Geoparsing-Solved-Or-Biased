  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Edo</span> (江戸, literally "bay-entrance" or "estuary"), also romanized as <span class="loc">Yedo</span> or <span class="loc">Yeddo</span>, is the former name of <span class="loc">Tokyo</span>. It was the seat of power for the Tokugawa shogunate, which ruled <span class="loc">Japan</span> from <span class="date">1603</span> to <span class="date">1868</span>. During this period, it grew to become one of the largest cities in the world and home to an urban culture centered on the notion of a "floating world". From the establishment of the Tokugawa bakufu headquarters at <span class="loc">Edo</span>, the town became the de facto capital and center of political power, although <span class="loc">Kyoto</span> remained the formal capital of the country. <span class="loc">Edo</span> grew from what had been a small, little-known fishing village in <span class="date">1457</span> into the largest metropolis in the world with an estimated population of 1,000,000 by <span class="date">1721</span>. <span class="loc">Edo</span> was repeatedly devastated by fires, with the Great Fire of Meireki in <span class="date">1657</span> being the most disastrous. An estimated 100,000 people died in the fire. During the Edo period, there were about 100 fires mostly begun by accident and often quickly escalating and spreading through neighborhoods of wooden machiya which were heated with charcoal fires. Between <span class="date">1600</span> and <span class="date">1945</span>, Edo/Tokyo was leveled every 25–<span class="date">50 years</span> or so by fire, earthquakes, or war.</p><br><br>
