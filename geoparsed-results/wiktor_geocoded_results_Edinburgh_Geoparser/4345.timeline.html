  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pierce County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Washington</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, the population was 795,225, making it the second-most populous county in <span class="loc">Washington</span> behind <span class="loc">King County</span>. The county seat and largest city is <span class="loc">Tacoma</span>. Formed out of <span class="loc">Thurston County</span> on <span class="date">December 22, 1852</span>, by the legislature of Oregon Territory, it was named for <span class="loc">U.S.</span> President <span class="per">Franklin Pierce</span>. <span class="loc">Pierce County</span> is included in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, <span class="loc">WA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Pierce County</span> is notable for being home to <span class="loc">Mount Rainier</span>, the tallest mountain and a volcano in the <span class="org">Cascade</span> Range. Its most recent recorded eruption was between <span class="date">1820</span> and <span class="date">1854</span>. There is no imminent risk of eruption, but geologists expect that the volcano will erupt again. If this should happen, parts of <span class="loc">Pierce County</span> and the <span class="loc">Puyallup Valley</span> would be at risk from lahars, lava, or pyroclastic flows. The <span class="loc">Mount Rainier</span> Volcano Lahar Warning System was established in <span class="date">1998</span> to assist in the evacuation of the <span class="loc">Puyallup River</span> valley in case of eruption. According to the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span>, the county has a total area of 1,806 square miles (4,680 km2), of which 1,670 square miles (4,300 km2) is land and 137 square miles (350 km2) (7.6%) is water. The highest natural point in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">Mount Rainier</span> at 14,410 feet (4,392 m), is located in <span class="loc">Pierce County</span>.</p><br><br>
