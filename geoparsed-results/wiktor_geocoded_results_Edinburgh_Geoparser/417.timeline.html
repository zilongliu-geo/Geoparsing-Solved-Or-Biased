  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salem</span> is an unincorporated community east-centrally located in <span class="loc">Lee County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 280 between <span class="loc">Opelika</span> and <span class="loc">Phenix City</span>. It is part of the Auburn Metropolitan Area. <span class="loc">Salem</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1835</span>, and grew rapidly for <span class="date">the next two decades</span>. <span class="loc">Salem</span> incorporated in <span class="date">1846</span> and quickly became one of the area's largest cities. However, a fire which engulfed the town in <span class="date">1854</span> and the subsequent Civil War resulted in the collapse of the town's government, and rapid depopulation. <span class="loc">Salem</span> lost a bid to be the county seat of the newly formed <span class="loc">Lee County</span> in <span class="date">1865</span>, and then saw its charter become inactive in the following <span class="date">decades</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Salem</span> is a small unincorporated community of a few hundred. By the late 20th century <span class="loc">Salem</span> was the location of <span class="loc">Lee County</span>'s only covered bridge, the Salem-Shotwell <span class="loc">Covered</span> Bridge. A symbol of the area, the bridge was destroyed by a fallen tree following a storm in <span class="date">2005</span>. It was rebuilt in <span class="date">2007</span> at <span class="loc">Opelika</span> Municipal Park in nearby <span class="loc">Opelika</span>. A post office operating under the name <span class="loc">Salem</span> was first opened in <span class="date">1839</span>.</p><br><br>
