  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Sidney</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Richland County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, less than 10 mi (16 km) away from the <span class="loc">North Dakota</span> border. The population was 5,191 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city lies along the <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span> River and is in proximity to the badlands of the Dakotas. <span class="per">Sidney</span> is approximately midway between <span class="loc">Glendive</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span> and <span class="loc">Williston</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>. Settlers began arriving in the area in the 1870s, and a post office was established in <span class="date">1888</span>. Six-year-old <span class="per">Sidney Walters</span> and his parents were staying with <span class="per">Hiram Otis</span>, the local justice of the peace, and <span class="per">Otis</span> decided that <span class="per">Sidney</span> was a good name for the town. <span class="date">The following year</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span> became a state and <span class="per">Sidney</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1911</span>. [1] <span class="per">Sidney</span> was originally part of <span class="loc">Dawson County</span>, but became the county seat of <span class="loc">Richland County</span> at its inception in <span class="date">1914</span>. Agriculture became an important part of the region after the Lower <span class="org">Yellowstone Irrigation Project</span> was completed in <span class="date">1909</span>. A dam was built on the river south of <span class="loc">Glendive</span>, which diverted water from the river into a 115.2 km (71.6 mi) main canal, which runs north-south, parallel to the <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span>, irrigating land from <span class="loc">Glendive</span> north up to <span class="loc">Fairview</span>, where it dumps into the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. This project irrigates 51,429 acres (208.13 km2) and serves water to 450 farms, according to the manager of the Lower <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span> Irrigation Districts.</p><br><br>
