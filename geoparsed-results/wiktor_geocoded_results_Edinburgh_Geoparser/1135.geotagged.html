<p><span class="loc">Brighton</span> is the northernmost suburb of <span class="loc">Brisbane City</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, located 19 kilometres (12 mi) north of the Brisbane CBD. The Nashville locality makes up much of the southwest of the suburb. At the 2011 Australian Census the suburb had a population of 9,012. <span class="loc">Brighton</span> features mostly suburban housing. The large nursing home Eventide, run by the Queensland Government, is within <span class="loc">Brighton</span>. <span class="loc">Brighton</span> was also home to the World War II barracks of the RAAF Air Training School between December 1940 to May 1946 and was built on reclaimed land. After this time it became The Eventide Nursing Home. More than 700 patients were transferred from <span class="loc">Dunwich</span> on <span class="loc">North Stradbroke Island</span> to the facility. It was announced in late 2012 that the nursing home will close because ensuring the aging buildings complied with building codes was uneconomic. In the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Brighton</span> recorded a population of 9,012 people, 51.1% female and 48.9% male. The median age of the <span class="loc">Brighton</span> population was 40 years of age, 3 years above the Australian median. 78.4% of people living in <span class="loc">Brighton</span> were born in <span class="loc">Australia</span>, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were <span class="loc">England</span> 5.3%, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> 4.3%, <span class="loc">Scotland</span> 0.8%, <span class="loc">Philippines</span> 0.6%, <span class="loc">Ireland</span> 0.5%.</p>
