<p>Mission is a city in <span class="loc">Todd County</span>, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and the <span class="loc">Rosebud Indian Reservation</span>. The population was 1,182 at the 2010 census. Mission is home of the Sinte Gleska University. It is the largest incorporated community in the county, but is smaller than the unincorporated community of Rosebud, which is the capital of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. It is named for one of the many missions established by religious groups in the late 19th century to assist the Sicangu Lakota (Rosebud Sioux) and other Native American people. The major economical center of the county, it is located at the junction of US-83 and US-18 (the <span class="loc">Oyate</span> Trail, the home of <span class="loc">Todd County</span> School District, <span class="loc">Cherry-Todd Rural</span> Electric Cooperative, and various federal/tribal agencies). On episodes of The Price Is Right, the host Bob Barker — who is 1/8 Sioux — noted that Mission was the town in which he spent his childhood while his mother worked as a teacher on the Indian reservation. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.59 square miles (1.53 km2), all of it land.</p>
