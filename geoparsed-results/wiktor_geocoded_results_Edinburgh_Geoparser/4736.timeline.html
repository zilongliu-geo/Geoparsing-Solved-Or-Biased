  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Exeter</span> is a borough in the Greater Pittston-Wilkes-Barre area of the center-west <span class="loc">Wyoming</span> Valley region in <span class="loc">Luzerne County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, about 10 miles (16 km) west of <span class="loc">Scranton</span> and a few miles northwest of Wilkes-Barre on the opposite shore of the main <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span> fork. The borough was founded in the middle of a fertile agricultural area—once the heartlands of the Susquehannock Amerindian peoples—and much lumbering and coal-mining was carried out in the area from early in the 19th century. In the 1830s the region entered a boom period and began shipping coal by the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Canal, and by the 1840s even down the <span class="loc">Lehigh Canal</span> to <span class="loc">Allentown</span>, <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>, Trenton, <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> City, and other East Coast cities and ports via the connecting engineering works of the <span class="org">Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company</span> such as the upper <span class="loc">Lehigh Canal</span>, the Ashley Planes and the early <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> and <span class="loc">Susquehanna Railroad</span>, along with other railroads that flocked to or were born in the area. After severe flooding ripped up the upper <span class="loc">Lehigh Canal</span> in the 1860s, the L&amp;S was extended to the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> along the lower canal, keeping the big cities' markets connected to the still growing <span class="loc">Wyoming</span> Valley collieries and breakers. A second rail line was pushed up the <span class="loc">Lehigh Gorge</span>, the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> <span class="per">Valley Railroad</span> enabling a resurgent coal exportation to the East Coast cities and connecting the region to the <span class="loc">Erie</span> <span class="per">Railroad</span> and <span class="per">Buffalo</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. By <span class="date">1900</span>, the population consisted of 1,948 persons; in <span class="date">1910</span>, 3,537 persons; and in <span class="date">1940</span>, 5,802 persons. The town lost usable lands in <span class="date">1959</span> in the Knox Mine Disaster, when the river broke into the roof of sub-river anthracite mines and, in one moment, all but killed the local anthracite mining industry. Subsequently, despite the local loss of industry, the fact that the population was 5,652 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census indicates that the former Indian and farmlands have been attractive to building developers.</p><br><br>
