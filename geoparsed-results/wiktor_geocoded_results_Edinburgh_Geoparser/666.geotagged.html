<p><span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Dallas County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 36,361 at the 2010 census. Founded in 1852 as a frontier post, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is one of <span class="loc">Dallas County</span>'s earliest settlements. Today, it is a suburban community located in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, approximately 15 miles (24 km) south of Downtown Dallas. <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is part of the Best Southwest area, which includes <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, <span class="loc">Cedar Hill</span>, <span class="loc">DeSoto</span>, and <span class="loc">Duncanville</span>. In 1841, an act of the Republic of <span class="loc">Texas</span> Congress authorized President Mirabeau Lamar to enter into a contract with William S. Peters and nineteen associates to promote settlement in <span class="loc">North Texas</span> and paid the company with free land in exchange for recruiting new settlers. Around 600 families would settle in what became known as Peters Colony from 1841 through 1844. The Peters' group advertised heavily in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, and <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, and for that reason, many of the earliest settlers were from those states. The first group to settle in the <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> area was Roderick Rawlins and his family from <span class="loc">Greene County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. They left for <span class="loc">Texas</span> in September 1844. Rawlins and two of his sons-in-law came ahead to select the general area where they would settle. They chose an uninhabited area south of Dallas along the north bank of <span class="loc">Ten Mile Creek</span> as the site of their new settlement. In December 1844, the three men went back to <span class="loc">Lamar County</span> near the <span class="loc">Red River</span> to bring the rest of their wagon train. All of the settlers had arrived by January 2, 1845 and they formed a community known as <span class="loc">Hardscrabble</span>. It consisted of two rows of log cabins with a street running north and south. In total, 30 men, women, and children lived in <span class="loc">Hardscrabble</span>.</p>
