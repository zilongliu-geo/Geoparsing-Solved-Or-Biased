<p><span class="loc">La Palma</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [la ˈpalma]), also <span class="loc">San Miguel</span> de <span class="loc">La Palma</span>, is the most north-westerly island of the <span class="loc">Canary Islands</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>. <span class="loc">La Palma</span> has an area of 706 km2 making it the fifth largest of the seven main <span class="loc">Canary Islands</span>. The total population is about 86,000, of which 18,000 (2003 data) live in the capital, <span class="loc">Santa Cruz de la Palma</span> and about 20,000 (2004 data) in <span class="loc">Los Llanos de Aridane</span>. <span class="loc">La Palma</span> has "sister city" status with El <span class="loc">Dorado Hills</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. In 1815, the German geologist Leopold von Buch visited the <span class="loc">Canary Islands</span>. It was as a result of his visit to <span class="loc">Tenerife</span> where he visited the Las Cañadas caldera and then later to <span class="loc">La Palma</span> where he visited the Taburiente caldera, that the Spanish word for cauldron or large cooking pot - "caldera" - was introduced into the geological vocabulary. In the center of the island is the Caldera de Taburiente National Park; one of four national parks in the <span class="loc">Canary Islands</span>. <span class="loc">La Palma</span>, like the other islands of the <span class="loc">Canary Island</span> archipelago, is a volcanic ocean island. The volcano rises almost 7 km (4 mi) above the floor of the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>. There is road access from sea level to the summit at 2,426 m (7,959 ft), which is marked by an outcrop of rocks called <span class="loc">Los Muchachos</span> ("The Lads"). This is the site of the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, one of the world's premier astronomical observatories.</p>
