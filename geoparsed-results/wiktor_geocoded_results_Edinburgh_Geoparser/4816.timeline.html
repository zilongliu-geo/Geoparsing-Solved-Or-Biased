  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 72,321. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Cookeville. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is part of the Cookeville, <span class="org">TN Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is named in honor of <span class="per">Israel Putnam</span>, who was a hero in the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span> and a general in the American Revolutionary War. The county was initially established on <span class="date">February 2, 1842</span>, when the Twenty-fourth <span class="org">Tennessee General Assembly</span> enacted a measure creating the county from portions of <span class="per">Jackson</span>, <span class="loc">Overton</span>, <span class="loc">Fentress</span>, and White counties. After the survey was completed by Mounce Gore, the <span class="org">Assembly</span> instructed the commissioners to locate the county seat, to be called "Monticello," near the center of the county. Contending, however, that the formation of <span class="per">Putnam</span> was illegal because it reduced their areas below constitutional limits, <span class="per">Overton</span> and <span class="per">Jackson</span> counties secured an injunction against its continued operation. <span class="per">Putnam</span> officials failed to reply to the complaint, and in the <span class="date">March 1845</span> term of the Chancery Court at <span class="loc">Livingston</span>, <span class="per">Chancellor Bromfield L. Ridley</span> declared <span class="per">Putnam</span> unconstitutionally established and therefore dissolved. The <span class="date">1854</span> act reestablishing <span class="per">Putnam</span> was passed after Representative <span class="per">Henderson</span> M. Clements of <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> assured his colleagues that a new survey showed that there was sufficient area to form the county. <span class="loc">White Plains</span>, near modern <span class="loc">Algood</span>, acted as a temporary county seat.</p><br><br>
