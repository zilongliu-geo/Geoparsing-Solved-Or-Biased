The population was 11,417 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, making it the most populous city in <span class="loc">Miami County</span>. <span class="loc">Peru</span> is located along the <span class="loc">Wabash</span> River, which divides the city in two. Residents usually pronounce the name of <span class="loc">Peru</span> like the name of the South American nation of <span class="loc">Peru</span> is commonly pronounced in American English. Elderly Hoosiers commonly use the archaic pronunciation of /ˈpɪəruː/ PEE-roo. On <span class="date">August 18, 1827</span>, <span class="per">Joseph Holman</span> bought land near the confluence of the <span class="loc">Mississinewa</span> and <span class="loc">Wabash Rivers</span> from <span class="per">John B. Richardville</span>, the chief of the Miami Indians. The sale was approved on <span class="date">March 3, 1828</span> by President <span class="per">John Quincy Adams</span>. On <span class="date">March 12, 1829</span>, <span class="per">Holman</span> had the land surveyed and laid out into the town of <span class="loc">Miamisport</span>. <span class="loc">Peru</span> was founded in <span class="date">1834</span> by William N. Hood, who had bought 210 acres of land from Miamisport's founder <span class="per">Joseph Holman</span> <span class="date">five years earlier</span>. By <span class="date">1835</span>, court was being held in <span class="loc">Peru</span> rather than <span class="loc">Miamisport</span>, and the name "Miamisport" quietly disappeared as <span class="loc">Peru</span> became the dominant community in the area. <span class="per">Frances Slocum</span> was reunited with members of her family near <span class="loc">Peru</span> in <span class="date">1837</span>, after <span class="date">nearly sixty years</span> of captivity among Native Americans.</p><br><br>
