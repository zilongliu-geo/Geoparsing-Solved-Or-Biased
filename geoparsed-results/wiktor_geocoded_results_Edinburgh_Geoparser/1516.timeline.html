  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Easton</span> is a village on the <span class="loc">Isle of Portland</span> in <span class="loc">Dorset</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The village is situated at <span class="loc">Tophill</span>, within the centre of the island. As with the rest of Portland's villages and settlements, <span class="per">Easton</span>, including the settlements <span class="per">Reforne</span> and <span class="per">Straits</span>, has been designated as a conservation area, as it is a place of special architectural and historic interest. <span class="per">Easton</span>, <span class="per">Wakeham</span> and <span class="per">Reforne</span> were designated pre-1974. The village has a small square with many shops and shopping arcade, three churches, a small park, and other amenities, including various pubs, as well as the nearby Secondary school Royal Manor Arts College. Along with <span class="per">Fortuneswell, Easton</span> is the main hub of the <span class="loc">Isle of Portland</span>'s activities. <span class="per">St George</span>'s Centre and The <span class="per">George</span> Inn lies within the <span class="per">Reforne</span> area of <span class="per">Easton</span>, and provides facilities for many local events. <span class="per">Easton</span> was established around a natural watercourse and various springs, of which there are indications of medieval inhabitants. The village pond was situated at <span class="per">Easton</span> Square, and a well head and pump were later installed in <span class="date">1775</span>. <span class="per">Easton</span> largely developed through Tophill's prime industry of agriculture. By <span class="date">1782</span>, <span class="per">Easton</span> was the island's second largest settlement. The island's first school, <span class="org">Maister's School</span>, opened in Straits during <span class="date">1720</span>. St. <span class="per">George</span>'s Church was built as the island's parish church within <span class="per">Reforne</span>, between <span class="date">1754</span> and <span class="date">1766</span>, replacing <span class="per">St</span> Andrew's.</p><br><br>
