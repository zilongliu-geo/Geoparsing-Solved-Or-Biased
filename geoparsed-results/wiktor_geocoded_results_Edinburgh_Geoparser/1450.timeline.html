  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">York</span> (/ˈjɔːrk/) is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers <span class="loc">Ouse</span> and <span class="loc">Foss</span> in <span class="loc">North Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The municipality is the traditional county town of <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span> to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in <span class="loc">England</span> throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions. The city was founded by the Romans as Eboracum in <span class="date">71 AD</span>. It became the capital of the Roman <span class="loc">province of Britannia Inferior</span>, and later of the kingdoms of <span class="loc">Northumbria</span> and Jórvík. In the Middle Ages, <span class="loc">York</span> grew as a major wool trading centre and became the capital of the northern ecclesiastical province of the <span class="org">Church of England</span>, a role it has retained. In the 19th century, <span class="loc">York</span> became a hub of the railway network and a confectionery manufacturing centre. In recent <span class="date">decades</span>, the economy of <span class="loc">York</span> has moved from being dominated by its confectionery and railway-related industries to one that provides services. The <span class="org">University of York</span> and health services have become major employers, whilst tourism has become an important element of the local economy.</p><br><br>
