<p>Linden is a village in the <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span> of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is in the City of <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span>, 81 km west of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and 19 km east of <span class="loc">Katoomba</span>. The village is on the Great Western Highway and has a railway station on the Main Western railway line served by NSW TrainLink's <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span> Line. It shares a post office, and therefore the 2778 postcode, with adjoining <span class="loc">Woodford</span>. At the 2006 census, its population was 427, including 11 indigenous people (2.6%). The railway station at Linden was built in 1874 and was named after Linden Lodge, the home built in 1865 by local businessman William Jolley <span class="loc">Henderson</span>. Linden was originally known as Seventeen Mile Hollow because of its location 17 miles (27.35 km) from the <span class="loc">Nepean River</span>. It was originally the location of a tollhouse erected in 1849 and demolished in the 1860s during the construction of the railway. The village is near the grave of John Donohoe, a road-gang convict who died on 25 June 1837. It is also near Caley's Repulse, a mound of rocks in the shape of a pyramid that was believed to have been constructed by Aborigines. However, some sources maintain that this is a fallacy and that the pile of rocks actually date back to 1912, when a group from the Royal Australian Historical Society made a pile of rocks in the wrong place. Other nearby attractions include <span class="loc">King's Cave</span> and Linden Observatory.</p>
