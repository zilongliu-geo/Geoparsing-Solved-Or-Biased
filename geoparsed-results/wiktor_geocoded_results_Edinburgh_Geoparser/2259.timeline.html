  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, its population was 46,034. The county seat is <span class="loc">Newport</span>. The county is named for <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span>, 16th president of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Newport</span>, <span class="loc">OR</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> was created by the <span class="org">Oregon Legislative Assembly</span> on <span class="date">February 20, 1893</span>, from the western portion of <span class="loc">Benton</span> and <span class="loc">Polk</span> counties. The county adjusted its boundaries in <span class="date">1923</span>, <span class="date">1925</span>, <span class="date">1927</span>, <span class="date">1931</span>, and <span class="date">1949</span>. At the time of the county's creation, <span class="loc">Toledo</span> was picked as the temporary county seat. In <span class="date">1896</span> it was chosen as the permanent county seat. Three elections were held to determine if the county seat should be moved from <span class="loc">Toledo</span> to <span class="loc">Newport</span>. Twice these votes failedâ€”in <span class="date">1928</span> and <span class="date">1938</span>. In <span class="date">1954</span>, however, the vote went in <span class="loc">Newport</span>'s favor. While <span class="loc">Toledo</span> has remained the industrial hub of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, the city has never regained the position it once had. Like <span class="loc">Tillamook County</span> to the north, for the first <span class="date">decades</span> of its existence <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> was isolated from the rest of the state. This was solved with the construction of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 101 (completed in <span class="date">1925</span>), and the Salmon River Highway (completed in <span class="date">1930</span>). In <span class="date">1936</span>, as one of many federally funded construction projects, bridges were constructed across the bays at <span class="loc">Waldport</span>, <span class="loc">Newport</span>, and <span class="loc">Siletz</span>, eliminating the ferries needed to cross these bays.</p><br><br>
