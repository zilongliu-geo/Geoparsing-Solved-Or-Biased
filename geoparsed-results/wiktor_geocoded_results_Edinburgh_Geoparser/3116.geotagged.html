<p>Camden is a city in <span class="loc">Wilcox County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,257 at the 2000 census, at which time it was a town. What is now Camden was established on property that was donated by Thomas Dunn in order to have a new town founded on the site. Dunn's Federal style house, built in 1825, is the oldest documented house in the town. The first county seat was in the community of <span class="loc">Canton Bend</span>. It was moved to <span class="loc">Barboursville</span>, later renamed Camden, in 1833. It had been named <span class="loc">Barboursville</span> in honor of <span class="loc">United States</span> Congressman Philip Barbour of Virginia. Incorporated in 1841, Camden was renamed by local physician John D. Caldwell in honor of his hometown of Camden, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. The earliest documented industries in the town were a brickyard, sawmill, and window fabricator. The Camden Phenix was the town's earliest known newspaper. It also became the home of the red-brick Greek-Revival style Wilcox Female Seminary and Female Institute, built from 1845â€“50. It has housed the Wilcox County Historical Society since 1976. The red-brick Greek-Revival style <span class="loc">Wilcox County</span> Courthouse, also listed on the National Register, was completed in 1857. It replaced an earlier wood-frame structure.</p>
