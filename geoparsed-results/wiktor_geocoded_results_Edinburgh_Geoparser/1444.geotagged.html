<p><span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Litchfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is named after <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, <span class="loc">Devon</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The population was 12,243 at the 2010 census. The town of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> includes the villages of <span class="loc">Terryville</span> and <span class="loc">Pequabuck</span>. The community was incorporated in 1795, and became known nationally for the manufacture of clocks. The town was named after <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Northbury</span>, a section of Waterbury]) was originally used as a burying ground for <span class="loc">Waterbury</span>. History records show that it was founded by a group of people who believed they found a large deposit of lead. This fabled "lead mine" never actually existed (or is still yet to be discovered). The oldest home in the community is on Route 6, and dates to 1690-1700. In the 1790s, <span class="loc">George Washington</span> traveled through here, both to visit relatives and to stay away from the coastline. The Terry family participated in a great deal of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>'s history. Eli Terry became partners with Seth Thomas (clockmaker) and Silas Hoadley to manufacture clocks in the <span class="loc">Greystone</span> section of town. Eli gave the factory to Hoadley and Thomas, and opened his own clock factory near Carter Road in Plymouth Center, while Thomas moved to <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> Hollow. Eli Terry, Jr. (son of Eli Terry) joined with another man who was interested in the cabinet and lock industry and they opened Eagle Lock Company. In the 1880s, the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> Hollow section of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> decided to split off and become their own town called <span class="loc">Thomaston</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, named after Seth Thomas (clockmaker). The Eagle Lock Company closed in the 1970s and later, in 1975, the entire abandoned site burned, leaving one building left undamaged. The rest of the buildings were torn down or had floors removed.</p>
