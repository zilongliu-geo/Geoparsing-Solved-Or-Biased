  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Carmel</span> (Hebrew: כרמל <span class="loc">Karmel</span>) is an Israeli settlement in south-east Har Hebron area of the <span class="loc">West Bank</span>, close by the Palestinian villagers of <span class="per">Umm al-Kheir</span>, who settled there <span class="date">several decades ago</span> after <span class="loc">Israel</span> expelled them from the Arad desert, and who purchased the land from residents in the Palestinian village of <span class="loc">Yatta</span>. According to <span class="per">David Shulman</span>, <span class="loc">Carmel</span> lies on lands appropriated from the Bedouin of that village. It falls under the jurisdiction of the <span class="org">Har Hebron Regional Council</span> and associates ideologically with the <span class="org">Amana</span> settlement movement. The moshav was founded in <span class="date">1980</span>, next to the land on which the Hadaleen Bedouin tribe live, as a Nahal military-establishment, and was "civilianized" in <span class="date">1981</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, the settlement is home to approximately 70 families. The name <span class="loc">Carmel</span> was chosen due to the moshav's close proximity to the location of Biblical Carmel (Joshua 15:55), the home of <span class="loc">Nabal</span>. <span class="loc">Carmel</span> is mentioned in 1 Samuel 25:2 as the home of <span class="loc">Nabal</span>. The new settlement is expanding, and, according to one commentator, 'continuing to usurp the land of its neighbors, who lived at the site <span class="date">decades</span> before the settlers arrived.'</p><br><br>
