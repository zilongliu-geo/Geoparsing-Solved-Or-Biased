  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Chorrera</span> is a city and municipality in central <span class="loc">Panama</span>, located about 30 km south-west of <span class="loc">Panama City</span>. Is the capital of the <span class="loc">province of Panamá Oeste</span> and one of the larger cities in the country and is fond of the phrase "<span class="loc">La Bella</span>, Enamoradora y Querendona, La Gran Chorrera", reportedly as a tribute to its beautiful women, kind people, and happy nightlife. <span class="loc">La Chorrera</span> is renowned for its international fair and famous as being the home of <span class="per">Bollo</span> and <span class="per">Chicheme</span>. It is the home of <span class="per">San Francisco F.C.</span>, <span class="per">Mariano Rivera</span> (Apaga y Vamonos, New York Yankees), <span class="per">Vicente Mosquera</span> (former World Boxing Champion), and <span class="per">José Luis Garcés</span>. <span class="loc">La Chorrera</span> has a warm tropical climate with heavy seasonal rains in the <span class="date">months</span> of <span class="date">May</span> to <span class="date">November</span>, leading to extensive grasslands that favor the raising of cattle and to a lesser extent pigs. The fertile lands yield good crops of pineapple, rice, coffee, oranges, cassava, beans and sugar cane. Approximately 2% of the country's lumber comes from this district. <span class="loc">La Chorrera</span> is located on the Panamerican Highway between the <span class="loc">districts of Capira and Arraiján</span>, and is about 7 kilometers from the Pacific coast.</p><br><br>
