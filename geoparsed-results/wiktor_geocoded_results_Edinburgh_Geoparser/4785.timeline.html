  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Princeton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Patoka Township</span>, <span class="loc">Gibson County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,644 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, and it is part of the greater <span class="loc">Evansville</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, Metropolitan Area. The city is the county seat of and the largest city in <span class="loc">Gibson County</span>. In <span class="date">1800</span> the <span class="loc">Indiana</span> Territory was created with <span class="loc">Vincennes</span> (<span class="loc">Knox County</span>) as its capital. The rich farmlands in the southwest of the territory with access to the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> attracted many pioneers and settlers to the area, one of whom was an Irish immigrant named <span class="per">William Prince</span>. Born in <span class="date">1772</span>, he immigrated to <span class="loc">America</span> <span class="date">22 years later</span>. He would become a <span class="loc">Gibson County</span> Commissioner and the namesake for the county seat of <span class="loc">Princeton</span>. The <span class="date">year 1813</span> saw the move of the territorial capital east from <span class="loc">Vincennes</span> to <span class="loc">Corydon</span> and the creation of <span class="loc">Gibson County</span>. <span class="org">Gibson</span> had previously been part of the vast <span class="loc">Knox County</span> which covered all the land of southwestern <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, bordered by the <span class="loc">Wabash</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Rivers</span>. By <span class="date">early 1814</span>, settlers to this area were asking for a "seat of justice," or county seat. <span class="per">Captain William Prince</span> was one of four commissioners who located the seat at the half-way stand on the <span class="loc">Evansville</span> and <span class="loc">Vincennes</span> stage line. By drawing of lots, commissioners decided to name the town after <span class="per">Captain Prince</span>.</p><br><br>
