  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Mission is a city in <span class="loc">Johnson County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and part of the <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> Metropolitan Area. The population was 9,323 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. An Indian mission was established in <span class="date">1829</span> at the town's site, hence the name of the later settlement. The site where Mission <span class="date">now</span> sits was once a rest stop for wagons moving westward on the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail during the 19th Century. The clear spring water rising to the surface in present-day Mission made it an ideal place to collect drinking water for horses and travelers. For <span class="date">years</span> the area was owned as a homestead by the Breyfogel family, who subdivided their land into 245 lots and sold them off in the early 20th Century. The town grew up slowly in <span class="date">the 1920s and 1930s</span>, benefiting from its close proximity to <span class="loc">Kansas City</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. After World War II however, the town grew rapidly amid the post-war housing boom, as young families from <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> purchased their first homes. In <span class="date">2003</span>, Mission absorbed the neighboring <span class="loc">city of Countryside</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, the town retains this "post-war look," with small houses of different designs on large lots, in contrast to stereotypical neighborhoods of outer-ring suburbs.</p><br><br>
