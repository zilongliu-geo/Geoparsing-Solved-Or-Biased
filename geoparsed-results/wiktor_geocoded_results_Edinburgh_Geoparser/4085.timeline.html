  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Chail</span> is a hill station in <span class="loc">Himachal Pradesh</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>. <span class="loc">Chail</span> is 44 km from <span class="loc">Shimla</span> and 45 km from Solan. The Chail Palace is well known for its architecture, the palace was built as <span class="date">summer</span> retreat by the Maharaja of <span class="loc">Patiala</span> during the British Raj, on the land allotted to him by the British for former's assistance in the Anglo-Nepalese War. The cricket ground and a polo ground which is there at an altitude of 2,250 m was owned by erstwhile royal family of <span class="loc">Patiala</span>. It is the world's highest cricket ground. <span class="loc">Chail</span> is also considered as the hiker's paradise. The area is away from the bustling life of the state capital <span class="loc">Shimla</span>. In <span class="date">1891</span>, Maharaja <span class="per">Bhupinder Singh</span> of <span class="loc">Patiala</span> incurred the rage of <span class="per">Lord Kitchener</span>. It led to the restriction of his entry in the Indian <span class="date">summer</span> capital, <span class="loc">Shimla</span>. This incensed the Maharaja and he vowed to build a new <span class="date">summer</span> retreat for himself. So he rebuilt the place (Chail) as per his requirements. After accession to the <span class="org">Indian Union</span>, Maharaja of <span class="loc">Patiala</span> donated most of his buildings to <span class="org">Chail Military School and Government of India</span>.</p><br><br>
