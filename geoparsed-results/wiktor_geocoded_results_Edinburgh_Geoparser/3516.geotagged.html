<p><span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> was first settled in 1686. The population was 17,456 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is home to Greenfield Community College, the Pioneer Valley Symphony Orchestra, and the <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> Fair. The city has a Main Street Historic District containing fine examples of Federal, Greek Revival, and Victorian architecture. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area. Pocumtuck Indians first settled and originally inhabited the <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> area. Native American artifacts found in the area have been dated between 7,000 to 9,000 years BCE. The Pocumtucks planted field crops and fished local rivers but were wiped out by the Mohawks in 1664. Thereafter, the newly unoccupied area—being the eastern terminus of the Mohawk Trail, a principal route for Native American trade traveling west into New York—was colonized as part of <span class="loc">Deerfield</span> by the English in 1686. In 1753, <span class="loc">Greenfield</span>, named for the <span class="loc">Green River</span>, was incorporated as a separate town from <span class="loc">Deerfield</span>. In 1795 the <span class="loc">South Hadley Canal</span> opened, enabling boats to bypass the <span class="loc">South Hadley</span> falls and reach <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> via the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>. Located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Deerfield</span> and Green rivers, and not far from where they merge into the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>, <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> developed into a trade center. Falls provided water power for industry, and <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> grew into a prosperous mill town. John Russell established the <span class="loc">Green River</span> Works in 1834, hiring skilled German workers at what was the country's first cutlery factory. The <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> Railroad was the first of several railways to enter the town, replacing the former canal trade. During the 19th and 20th centuries, <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> was one of the most important American centers of the tap and die business and was the home of Greenfield Tap &amp; Die Company (GTD).</p>
