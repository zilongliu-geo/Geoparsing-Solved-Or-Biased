  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Baia</span> (Hungarian: Moldvabánya, Latin: Civitas Moldaviae) is a commune in the <span class="loc">Suceava County</span>, <span class="loc">Romania</span> with a population of 6,793 (<span class="date">2002</span> census). It is composed of two villages, <span class="loc">Baia</span> and <span class="loc">Bogata</span>. Located on the <span class="loc">Moldova</span> River, it was one of the earliest urban settlements in <span class="loc">Moldavia</span>. The Romanian baia and Hungarian banya both mean "mine". Archeologists found traces of iron slag and coal, but only for a brief period before 14th century, before the arrival of the colonists. It is possible that it derives from the term <span class="loc">Bania</span> (from Ban, a political leader). <span class="loc">Baia</span> was mentioned for the first time in the Nestor chronicle under the name <span class="loc">Bania</span>. Another name of the settlement was Târgul Moldovei which means "the market of <span class="loc">Moldavia</span>", referring to the <span class="loc">Moldova</span> River. Its Hungarian name was Moldvabánya, "the <span class="loc">Moldova</span> mine". It also had a Latin name, Civitas Moldaviae which was found on an early seal of the city. There has been a settlement in <span class="loc">Baia</span> since the 13th century, but the first written evidence is from <span class="date">the following century</span>. It is possible that a document in <span class="loc">Poland</span> mentions the town in <span class="date">1335</span>, when a certain merchant was mentioned by the name of "<span class="per">Alexa Moldaowicz</span>" (i.e. Alexa from the Town of <span class="loc">Moldavia</span>) and the next was in <span class="date">1345</span>, when <span class="loc">Baia</span> is placed on a list of towns of the Franciscan missionaries.</p><br><br>
