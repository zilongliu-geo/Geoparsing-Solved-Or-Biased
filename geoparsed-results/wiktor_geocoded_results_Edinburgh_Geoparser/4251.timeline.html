  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Magong City</span> (Chinese: 馬公市) is the county seat of <span class="loc">Penghu County</span>, <span class="loc">Republic of China</span> (<span class="loc">Taiwan</span>). <span class="loc">Magong</span> is on the western part of the main <span class="loc">Penghu</span> Island. The earliest temple in the country to the goddess <span class="loc">Matsu</span> is found on <span class="loc">Magong</span>. <span class="loc">Magong</span> is therefore also known as "Magong Ao" (馬宮澳 or originally, 媽宮澳), or "Matsu Palace Seaport". The first character of the name was changed from "mother" (媽, mā) to "horse" (馬, mǎ) in <span class="date">1920</span> under Japanese rule. Known as Makō in Japanese, the area was a major base for the <span class="org">Imperial</span> Japanese Navy and embarkation point for the invasion of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. On <span class="date">25 December 1981</span>, Makung was upgraded from an urban township to be a county-controlled city. In <span class="date">January 2009</span>, <span class="loc">Taiwan</span> adopted the usage of Hanyu Pinyin to replace Tongyong Pinyin, hence the use of "Magong". <span class="loc">Magong City</span> contains 33 municipal villages (里 li): (Romanizations are in Hanyu Pinyin) <span class="loc">Fuxing</span> (復興里) <span class="loc">Chang</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> (長安里)</p><br><br>
