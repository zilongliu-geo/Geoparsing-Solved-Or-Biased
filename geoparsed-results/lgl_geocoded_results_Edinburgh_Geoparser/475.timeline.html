  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Traffic plan in the works for Olympic oval. Richmond Winterfest <span class="date">Weekend</span> attracted 47,000 people to the Richmond Olympic Oval and has, in part, prompted staff to plot a traffic plan for future events. Winterfest and <span class="date">last December</span>’s opening ceremony brought a crush of people—and vehicles—to the city’s riverfront venue. In her report to council, events development manager <span class="per">Ann Phelps</span> noted experience at both events are being drawn upon to produce a traffic and transportation plan for future events. The oval hosted Winterfest <span class="date">Weekend</span> on <span class="date">Feb. 14 and 15</span>. It was the third annual event organized by the city, attracting 350 volunteers and costing $668,000—$90,000 came from city coffers, the rest from sponsors. <span class="date">This year</span>’s headliners were rock band Brandon Paris Band and illusionist <span class="per">Julianna Chen</span>.</p><br><br>
