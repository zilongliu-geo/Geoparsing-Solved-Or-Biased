  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Pocahontas County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 260 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> was named for pioneer <span class="per">John</span> (Richard) Hill, from <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, who built a log cabin near what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Lobelia</span>. Most of the early settlers were Scots-Irish and worked in agriculture and stock raising. In the 1800s the town of <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> centered on the educational institution Little Levels Academy. Established in <span class="date">1842</span>, the school closed <span class="date">18 years later</span> at the onset of the Civil War. In <span class="date">1865</span>, the county purchased the building and ran it as a public school through the 1880s, and it became a school of higher order for boys called <span class="org">Hillsboro Academy</span>. The basement of the Methodist Church served as a school of high order for girls called <span class="org">Hillsboro College</span>, or Little Levels Seminary. Eventually the brick Academy was torn down and replaced by a wood frame school for both boys and girls. Later the school was re-built in brick as <span class="org">Hillsboro High School</span>. <span class="loc">Millpoint</span>, in northern <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span>, was once the site of a small industrial village, "including within its limits proper a store, a blacksmith shop, two flour mills, and three homes." One of the mills has been restored and can be seen along Rt. 219.</p><br><br>
