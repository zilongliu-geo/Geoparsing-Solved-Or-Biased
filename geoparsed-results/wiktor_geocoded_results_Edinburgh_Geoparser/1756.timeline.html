  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Nelson</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Cheshire County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 729 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Nelson</span> includes the village of <span class="loc">Munsonville</span>. Originally named Monadnock No. 6, the town was granted in <span class="date">1752</span> by Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span>. It was first settled in <span class="date">1767</span> by Breed Batchelder. On <span class="date">February 22, 1774</span>, the town was incorporated by Governor <span class="per">John Wentworth</span> as Packersfield, after a major proprietor, Thomas Packer, the sheriff at <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>. The name was changed in <span class="date">1814</span> to <span class="per">Nelson</span> in honor of Viscount <span class="per">Horatio Nelson</span>, British admiral and naval hero. Located on the height of land separating the watersheds of the <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> and <span class="loc">Merrimack</span> rivers, <span class="per">Nelson</span> became primarily an agricultural community. The uneven surface proved good for grazing. But with streams rising from four ponds to provide water power, it also developed industry. The village of <span class="loc">Munsonville</span>, situated on the stage line at the outlet of <span class="loc">Granite Lake</span>, manufactured cotton cloth and chairs. The L. J. Colony Chair Co. produced between 25,000 and 30,000 chairs annually, hiring women and children from local farms to weave the rattan seats and backs. At one time, <span class="loc">Munsonville</span> had 1,000 homesteads and 10 school districts. The mills have since closed, and <span class="loc">Munsonville</span> is <span class="date">today</span> a resort of <span class="date">summer</span> homes.</p><br><br>
