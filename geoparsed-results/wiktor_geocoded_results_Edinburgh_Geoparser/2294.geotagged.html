<p><span class="loc">Dumbo</span> (or <span class="loc">DUMBO</span>, short for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) is a neighborhood in the New <span class="loc">York City</span> <span class="loc">borough of Brooklyn</span>. It encompasses two sections: one located between the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges, which connect Brooklyn to <span class="loc">Manhattan</span> across the <span class="loc">East River</span>, and another that continues east from the <span class="loc">Manhattan</span> Bridge to the <span class="loc">Vinegar Hill</span> area. The neighborhood is bounded by Brooklyn Bridge Park to the north, the <span class="loc">Brooklyn</span> Bridge to the west, <span class="loc">Brooklyn Heights</span> to the south and <span class="loc">Vinegar Hill</span> to the east. <span class="loc">Dumbo</span> is part of Brooklyn Community Board 2. Originally a ferry landing and industrial area, the entirety of <span class="loc">Dumbo</span> was bought by developer David Walentas and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community first becoming a haven for artist galleries and presently a center for technology startups. The large community of tech startups earned <span class="loc">DUMBO</span> the moniker as "the center of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle". In that time, <span class="loc">Dumbo</span> has become Brooklyn's most expensive neighborhood, as well as New <span class="loc">York City</span>'s fourth richest community overall, due in part to the large concentration of technology startups, its close proximity to <span class="loc">Manhattan</span> and the prevalence of converted industrial buildings into spacious luxury residential lofts.</p>
