  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Entroncamento</span> (Portuguese pronunciation: [ẽtɾõkɐˈmẽtu]) is a Portuguese municipality in <span class="loc">district of Santarém</span> in the Médio Tejo Subregion (Middle <span class="loc">Tagus</span>) of the <span class="loc">Centro Region</span>. The population in <span class="date">2011</span> was 20,206, in an area of 13.73 km². Situated in the Ribatejo, it benefits from its geo-strategic position along the <span class="loc">Tagus</span> Valley, with important accessibility to the motorways and railway-lines that historically proportioned its growth and expansion. <span class="loc">Entroncamento</span> originated in the middle of the 19th century, with the birth of the national railway network, as a simple train-stop, from two small railway construction camps: <span class="per">Casal</span> das <span class="per">Vaginhas</span> and <span class="per">Casal</span> das <span class="loc">Gouveias</span>. The majority of the early rail workers/settlers were foreign, coming from different countries throughout <span class="loc">Europe</span>, but eventually workers from <span class="loc">Beira Baixa</span> and <span class="loc">Alentejo</span> moved to the region. Its toponimc name <span class="loc">Entroncamento</span> literally mean junction, owing to being the junction of the two railway lines that developed in <span class="date">1864</span>: the <span class="loc">Linha</span> do <span class="loc">Norte</span> (Northern Line) and the <span class="loc">Linha</span> do Leste (Eastern Line). Hinged between its links with the east and <span class="loc">Beira Baixa</span>, the station at <span class="loc">Entroncamento</span>, for <span class="date">many decades</span>, was the obligatory stop that moved goods and people to the north and east. During this time, many celebrated travellers from <span class="loc">Europe</span> used the Eastern, dining in the station en route, such as the literary celebrates <span class="per">Hans Christian Andersen</span>, <span class="per">Ramalho Ortigão</span>, Eça de <span class="per">Queiroz, Alberto</span> <span class="loc">Pimentel</span>, Luísa de <span class="loc">Freitas</span> <span class="per">Lomelino</span> and <span class="per">Eduardo</span> Meneres. Political leaders also became frequent visitors both before and after the <span class="date">25 April</span> Revolution, such as João Chagas, politician and journalist, who travelled to <span class="loc">Lisbon</span> in order to assume the direction of the new government, after the dictatorship of <span class="per">General Pimenta</span> de <span class="loc">Castro</span>. For <span class="date">a long time</span>, the two settlements were divided between two neighbouring municipalities, because the rail-line itself determined its boundary. To the west of the lines were the <span class="loc">parishes of Santiago</span> (in <span class="loc">Torres Novas</span>) and to the east the territory was part of the parish of <span class="loc">Nossa Senhora</span> da Assunção da <span class="loc">Atalaia</span> (municipality of <span class="loc">Vila Nova da Barquinha</span>). The small settlement continued to growing, owing to the development of rail transport and support structures, later the installation of military <span class="date">quarters</span> (after <span class="date">1916</span>) determined the geographic accessibility, resulting in further influx of families.</p><br><br>
