<p>Hamilton (/ˈhæməltən/; 2011 population 519,949; UA population 670,580; CMA population 721,053) is a port city in the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Ontario</span>. Conceived by George Hamilton when he purchased the Durand farm shortly after the War of 1812, Hamilton has become the centre of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span> known as the <span class="loc">Golden Horseshoe</span>. On January 1, 2001, the new <span class="loc">City of Hamilton</span> was formed through the amalgamation of the former city and the other constituent lower-tier municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth with the upper-tier regional government. Residents of the old city are known as Hamiltonians. Since 1981, the metropolitan area has been listed as the ninth largest in <span class="loc">Canada</span> and the third largest in <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. Hamilton is home to the Royal Botanical Gardens, the Canadian Warplane <span class="loc">Heritage Museum</span>, the <span class="loc">Bruce</span> Trail, McMaster University and Mohawk College. McMaster University is ranked 4th in <span class="loc">Canada</span> and 94th in the world by Times Higher Education Rankings 2015-16 and has a well known medical school. The Canadian Football Hall of Fame can be found downtown right beside <span class="loc">Hamilton City</span> Hall and across town to the east, the Canadian Football League's Hamilton Tiger-Cats began playing at the new <span class="loc">Tim Hortons</span> Field in 2014, which was built as part of the 2015 Pan American Games.</p>
