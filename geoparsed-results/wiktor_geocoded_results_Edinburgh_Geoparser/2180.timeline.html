  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Sharon is an unincorporated community and coal town in southeastern <span class="loc">Kanawha County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located along the <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> Turnpike. Sharon is located at 38°09′34″N 81°26′49″W (38.159549, -81.447059). Its elevation is 673 feet (205 m). Sharon is located on Secondary State Route 79, locally known as <span class="loc">Cabin Creek</span> Road. Exit 79 of Interstate 77 is located here; no services are available at the exit. Until <span class="date">the 1980s</span>, a rail spur ran from the CSX railroad tracks up a short hollow, serving a coal mine tipple. The remnants of the tracks and rail bed can still be seen at present day along Paint Branch, however, no sign remains of the at-grade crossing of <span class="loc">Cabin Creek</span> Road or the trestle that crossed <span class="loc">Cabin Creek</span>. As a result of the badly needed upgrade of the <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> Turnpike to Interstate standards, multiple homes occupying the adjacent land were bought by the state and demolished. Remains and markers from an abandoned 19th century era cemetery were also relocated. Sharon had a <span class="loc">United States</span> Post Office until <span class="date">the early 1990s</span>, the ZIP code was 25182.</p><br><br>
