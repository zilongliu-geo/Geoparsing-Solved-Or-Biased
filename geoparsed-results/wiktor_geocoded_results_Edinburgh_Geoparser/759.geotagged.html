<p>Gloria (formerly <span class="loc">Maligaya</span>) is a third-class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Oriental Mindoro</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 42,012 people. The town was previously a barangay called <span class="loc">Maligaya</span>, the largest barangay during the administration of President Diosdado Macapagal. Local politicians, led by former guerrilla chief Nicolas Jamilla, Sr., battled for the conversion of <span class="loc">Maligaya</span> into a new town. They renamed it after the ten-year-old daughter of the President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who later on herself became the fourteenth President in 2001. Jamilla became the first mayor of the town, which kept the old name "Maligaya" as the name of a barangay in the poblacion. Gloria is divided into 27 barangays: nine (9) barangays are situated along the national highway; six (6) are coastal barangays; and twelve (12) interior barangays on the west side. Gloria was once part of the municipality of <span class="loc">Pinamalayan</span>. In 1915, migrant families from <span class="loc">Marinduque</span> settled in Barrio Tambong, and in 1930, when a national road was built through <span class="loc">Pinamalayan</span>, they moved west and occupied the area along this road. <span class="loc">Tambong</span> was later divided into two barrios: the first retained the original name, while the second was called <span class="loc">Maligaya</span> (meaning "happy"), alluding to the settlers' happiness at the bountiful yield of their agricultural crops.</p>
