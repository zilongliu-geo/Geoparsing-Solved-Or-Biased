<p><span class="loc">Bombo</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Luweero District</span> in the <span class="loc">Central Region</span> of <span class="loc">Uganda</span>. <span class="loc">Bombo</span> is located approximately 37 kilometres (23 mi), by road, north of <span class="loc">Uganda</span>'s capital, <span class="loc">Kampala</span>. The coordinates of <span class="loc">Bombo</span> are:0°34'36.0"N, 32°32'42.0"E (Latitude:0.576667; Longitude:32.545000). <span class="loc">Bombo</span> is one of three town councils in <span class="loc">Luweero District</span>, the other two being Luweero and Wobulenzi. All three municipalities are located on the <span class="loc">Kampala</span> - Masindi highway, that continues to <span class="loc">Gulu</span> and <span class="loc">Arua</span> in Northern <span class="loc">Uganda</span>. The town has a large Nubian minority, the Nubians having settled there when they came from <span class="loc">Sudan</span> to serve in the British Colonial army. <span class="loc">Bombo</span> remains the location of an army barracks, and was the headquarters of the Ugandan Ministry of Defense until December 2007, when they were moved to <span class="loc">Mbuya</span>, in <span class="loc">Nakawa Division</span> in southeastern <span class="loc">Kampala</span>. <span class="loc">Bombo</span>, however, remains the headquarters of the <span class="loc">Uganda</span> Land Forces Ugandan districts are often named after main municipal centres. The area in which Bombo town is a main township became <span class="loc">Bombo District</span>, one of the first regions that initially received district status when <span class="loc">Uganda</span> became independent in October 1962. In 1967 the district was renamed <span class="loc">East Mengo</span>. In 1974, <span class="loc">Uganda</span> reorganized from districts into provinces, and <span class="loc">East Mengo</span> became the <span class="loc">Province of Bombo</span>. Provinces were reorganized into districts in 1980, and the <span class="loc">district of Luwero</span> was created, with Bombo town as one of the main town councils.</p>
