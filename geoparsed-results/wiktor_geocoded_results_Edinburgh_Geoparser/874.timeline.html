  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dol</span> (pronounced [ˈdoːl]; formerly: Štajngrob or Štajngrob ob Dreti) is a small settlement in the Upper <span class="loc">Dreta</span> Valley in the Municipality of <span class="loc">Gornji Grad</span> in <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. Traditionally the area belonged to the <span class="loc">Styria region</span> and is <span class="date">now</span> included in the Savinja Statistical Region. The name <span class="loc">Dol</span> is a common toponym in <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. It is derived from the common noun dol 'small valley', referring to a local geographical feature. <span class="loc">Dol</span> was formerly known as Štajngrob or Štajngrob ob Dreti in Slovene. Before the settlement was renamed, <span class="loc">Dol</span> was the name of a hamlet of Štajngrob. The older name is derived from German but underwent folk etymology, in which the final element (originally German -grube 'depression, basin') was changed to Slovene -grob 'grave'. <span class="loc">Dol</span> is the site of a mass grave from the Second World War. The <span class="loc">Ravni</span> 2 Mass Grave (Slovene: Grobišče v Ravneh 2) is located above <span class="loc">Dreta</span> Creek, about 150 m south of the Prodnik farm. Together with the <span class="loc">Ravni</span> 1 Mass Grave in neighboring <span class="loc">Gornji Grad</span>, it contains the remains of 100 to 200 people executed by the Partisan command of the Fourth Operation Zone in the <span class="date">fall of 1944</span>.</p><br><br>
