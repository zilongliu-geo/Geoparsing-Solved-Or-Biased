  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Haimen</span> (simplified Chinese: 海门; traditional Chinese: 海門; pinyin: Hǎimén, Qihai dialect: [haɪ.məŋ], Shanghai: [hɛ̝.məŋ]) is a county-level city under the administration of <span class="loc">Nantong</span>, <span class="loc">Jiangsu province</span>, with a population of approximately 1 million. It is located at the opposite side of the <span class="loc">Yangtze River</span> to Shanghai and is directly north of <span class="loc">Chongming Island</span> except for a small portion that forms <span class="loc">Haimen City</span>'s Haiyong Township. <span class="loc">Chonghai</span> Bridge links the city to <span class="loc">Chongming County</span>. <span class="loc">Haimen</span> is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="loc">Haimen</span>. The area that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Haimen</span> was formed from silt deposits from the <span class="loc">Yangtze River</span>. Several sandbanks, including <span class="loc">Dongzhou</span> (东洲; 東洲) and Buzhou (布洲), joined together with the mainland in the Tang dynasty. In 958 CE, during the Later Zhou dynasty in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, <span class="loc">Haimen County</span> was established, the seat established at Dongzhou Town. Because the mouth of the <span class="loc">Yangtze River</span> moved northward during the Ming dynasty, <span class="loc">Haimen</span> has dealt with flooding that destroyed parts of the county, including Lüsi (吕四; 呂四), <span class="loc">Yudong</span> (余东; 余東), and <span class="loc">Sijia</span> (Chinese: 四甲).</p><br><br>
