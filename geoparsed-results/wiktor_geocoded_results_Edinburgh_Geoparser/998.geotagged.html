<p>Linden is the second largest town in <span class="loc">Guyana</span> after <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>, and capital of the Upper <span class="loc">Demerara-Berbice region</span>, located at 6°0′0″N 58°18′0″W, altitude 48 metres (160 feet). It was declared a town in 1970, and includes the communities of MacKenzie and Wismar. It lies on the <span class="loc">Demerara River</span> and has a population of roughly 29,298 (Bureau of Statistics, Population and Housing Census - 2002, <span class="loc">GUYANA</span>). It is primarily a bauxite mining town, containing many mines 60–90 metres deep, with many other pits now in disuse. Commercial bauxite mining started in Linden, eighty years ago. In 1916 the Demerara Bauxite Company Limited, known as <span class="loc">DEMBA</span>, a subsidiary of the Aluminum Company of Canada Limited, was established with the objective of mining, processing and selling bauxite. The site chosen for this preliminary venture was on the <span class="loc">Demerara River</span>, 105 kilometres (65 mi) south of the capital city <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>. At that time there was no settlement in the area, except for the <span class="loc">wards of Wismar</span>, <span class="loc">Guyana</span> Wismar and Christianburg. Mackenzie, the center of the company's operations, takes its name from an American geologist of Scottish descent, George Bain Mackenzie, who first visited and explored the area for bauxite in 1913. He returned in 1914, bought lands for mining, and built several 45-ton wooden barges for use at the riverside near Three Friends Mine, which was the first mine to be worked.</p>
