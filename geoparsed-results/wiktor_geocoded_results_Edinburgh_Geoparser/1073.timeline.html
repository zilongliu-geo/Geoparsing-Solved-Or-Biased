  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Franklin</span> is a city in and the parish seat of <span class="per">St. Mary</span> Parish, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,660 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Morgan City</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="per">Franklin</span>, named for <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>, was founded in <span class="date">1808</span> as Carlin's Settlement, and became the parish seat in <span class="date">1811</span>. The town was incorporated in <span class="date">1820</span>. Though early settlers included French, Acadian, German, Danish and Irish, the town's culture and architecture is heavily influenced by the unusually large numbers of English that chose to settle there after the <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> Purchase in <span class="date">1803</span>. Numerous large sugar plantations arose in the area, and with the development of steamboating, <span class="per">Franklin</span> became an interior sugar port. <span class="org">Franklin's First United Methodist Church</span> was established in <span class="date">1806</span>, making it the first Protestant church established in the state of <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>. By the 1830s, <span class="loc">Bayou Teche</span> was the main street of Acadiana, with one plantation after another. The area's sugar cane planters were among the South's wealthiest agriculturists. This is reflected in the grand plantation homes and mansions they built in <span class="per">Franklin</span> and the surrounding countryside. Most of these magnificent structures are still standing and well preserved, giving <span class="per">Franklin</span> its unique architectural flavor. <span class="per">Franklin</span>'s Historic District is listed in <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> and encompasses over 420 notable structures.</p><br><br>
