  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Dale County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census its population was 1,511. Once the county seat of <span class="loc">Dale County</span>, <span class="loc">Newton</span> lost this distinction to nearby <span class="loc">Ozark</span> in <span class="date">1870</span>, and is <span class="date">now</span> a small farming community. It incorporated in <span class="date">1887</span>. The city currently forms a part of the Ozark micropolitan statistical area. <span class="loc">Newton</span> is located at 31°21′N 85°36′W (31.344,-85.593). According to the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span>, the town has a total area of 14.3 square miles (37 km2), of which 14.3 square miles (37 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) (0.21%) is water. The <span class="loc">Choctawhatchee River</span> flows just to the north and west of <span class="loc">Newton</span>. At one time this waterway was navigable by steamboat from its mouth in <span class="loc">Choctawhatchee Bay</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span> all the way to <span class="loc">Newton</span>. <span class="loc">Alabama</span> State Route 123 and <span class="loc">Alabama</span> State Route 134 both pass through <span class="loc">Newton</span>. <span class="loc">Newton</span> was founded in <span class="date">1843</span> after the formation of <span class="loc">Coffee County</span> from <span class="loc">Dale County</span>'s western half, which rendered the original county seat of Daleville off-center. The town was a scene for Confederate recruiting during the Civil War, and was the site of a battle in <span class="date">March 1865</span> between local Home Guard troops and elements of the 1st <span class="loc">Florida</span> Cavalry (<span class="loc">US</span>) operating out of <span class="loc">Florida</span>. The Federals were led by <span class="per">Joseph Sanders</span>, a <span class="loc">Dale County</span> resident who had previously been a captain in the 31st <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Infantry, but had later switched sides and joined the Federals. Seeking to burn the county courthouse, the attackers were repulsed when local troops ambushed their column as they entered the town. This event is commemorated by a monument located in downtown <span class="loc">Newton</span>, and by annual re-enactments.</p><br><br>
