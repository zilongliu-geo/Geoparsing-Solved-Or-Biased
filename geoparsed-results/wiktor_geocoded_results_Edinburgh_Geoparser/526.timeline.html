  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alexandria, also called The <span class="loc">City of Alexandria</span>, is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 139,966, and in <span class="date">2014</span>, the population was estimated to be 150,575. Located along the western bank of the <span class="loc">Potomac River</span>, Alexandria is approximately 7 miles (11 km) south of downtown <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C</span>. Like the rest of Northern Virginia, as well as Central Maryland, modern Alexandria has been shaped by its proximity to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> capital. It is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> military, or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the federal government. One of Alexandria's largest employers is the <span class="org">U.S. Department of Defense</span>. Another is the <span class="org">Institute for Defense Analyses</span>. In <span class="date">2005</span>, the United States Patent and Trademark Office moved to Alexandria. The historic center of Alexandria is known as <span class="loc">Old Town</span>. With its concentration of boutiques, restaurants, antique shops and theaters, it is a major draw for tourists. Like <span class="loc">Old Town</span>, many Alexandria neighborhoods are compact, walkable, high-income suburbs of <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C</span>. It is the 7th largest and highest-income independent city in Virginia.</p><br><br>
