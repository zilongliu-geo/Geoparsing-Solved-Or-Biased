<p><span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Nevada</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 5,345. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Pioche. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> was established in 1866 after Congress enlarged <span class="loc">Nevada</span> by moving its state line eastward and southward at the expense of <span class="loc">Utah</span> and <span class="loc">Arizona</span> territories. It is named after <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span>, the 16th President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Original legislation called for the creation of a "<span class="loc">Stewart County</span>", after <span class="loc">Nevada</span> Senator William M. Stewart, but this was later changed in a substitute bill. Crystal Springs was the county's first seat in 1866, followed by <span class="loc">Hiko</span> in 1867, and Pioche in 1871. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> initially included the town of <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>. However, <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, including <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>, was separated from <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> effective July 1, 1908, by act of the <span class="loc">Nevada</span> Legislature. Area 51 is in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, and the county sheriff acts in proxy for the perimeter security forces. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 10,637 square miles (27,550 km2), of which 10,633 square miles (27,540 km2) is land and 3.8 square miles (9.8 km2) (0.04%) is water. While only the third largest county by area in the state of <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, it is the seventh largest county in area in the entire <span class="loc">United States</span>, not including boroughs and census areas in <span class="loc">Alaska</span>. The south ridge of <span class="loc">Mount Grafton</span>, the summit of which is just north of the county line in neighboring White <span class="loc">Pine County</span>, contains the highest point in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> at 10,640 feet (3,240 m). The highest independent mountain completely within <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is Shingle Peak, while the county's most topographically prominent peak is Mormon Peak.</p>
