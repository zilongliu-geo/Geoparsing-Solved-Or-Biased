  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Delta</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, is a community in the Township of <span class="loc">Rideau Lakes</span>, <span class="loc">Leeds</span> and <span class="loc">Grenville County</span> in Eastern <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. The village is located between two lakes, Upper <span class="loc">Beverley</span> and Lower <span class="loc">Beverley</span>, along highway 42, approximately 15 kilometers <span class="loc">west of Athens</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span> and 28 kilometers <span class="loc">east of Westport</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. The original name for <span class="org">Delta</span> was <span class="loc">Stevenstown</span>, chosen for its founder, Baptist Clergyman <span class="per">Abel Stevens</span>. <span class="per">Stevens</span>, a British Loyalist from <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, settled in the area in <span class="date">1796</span>, attracted by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe's offer of free land in <span class="loc">Upper Canada</span>. Within <span class="date">2 years</span>, <span class="per">Stevens</span> had convinced about 100 families to relocate to the region. Among many of his achievements, <span class="per">Stevens</span> founded the village's first mill (the predecessor to the <span class="per">Old Stone</span> Mill, built by <span class="per">William Jones</span>, not by <span class="per">Stevens</span> as is commonly mistaken), a Baptist church in neighbouring <span class="loc">Philipsville</span>, and an iron-works in what is <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Lyndhurst</span>. <span class="org">Delta</span> saw a few name changes during its early <span class="date">years</span>. After the construction of the stone mill, the name of <span class="loc">Stevenstown</span> was changed to <span class="per">Stone Mills</span>. In <span class="date">1821</span>, it was changed once more to <span class="loc">Beverley</span>, in honour of the Legislative Assembly member Sir <span class="per">John Beverley Robinson</span>. Then, finally, in <span class="date">1886</span>, the name was changed to <span class="org">Delta</span>, after an application for a town post office was rejected upon the discovery that a village already existed by the name of <span class="loc">Beverley</span>. '<span class="org">Delta</span>' was chosen because the shape of the two <span class="loc">Beverley</span> Lakes, connected by the village, resembles triangles - the shape of the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet, delta.</p><br><br>
