  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A 27-year-old former beauty student from the <span class="loc">Gold Coast</span> of <span class="loc">Australia</span> faces the death penalty. She was allegedly caught at Bali airport importing marijuana from <span class="loc">Australia</span> in <span class="date">October</span>. Appearing before an Indonesian judge after authorities found 4.1kg of high-grade cannabis in her unlocked boarding bag, she could be sentenced to death by firing squad, the maximum penalty for the crime. With that possibility looming for <span class="per">Ms. Corby</span>, her father journeyed to her side, and an anonymous email petition was distributed around <span class="loc">Australia</span> and overseas, calling on <span class="org">the Australian</span> government to ensure that, innocent or guilty, <span class="per">Ms. Corby</span> is returned to <span class="loc">Australia</span> to escape execution. An Australian witness who volunteered information which he says will endanger his own life, has testified that <span class="per">Schapelle Corby</span> was unwittingly caught up in a domestic Australian drug-running operation gone wrong. The man alleged that Australian airport workers had placed the contraband in her luggage after it had been checked-in, with the drugs to have been removed before the luggage left <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="per">Ms. Corby</span>, who says she is innocent of the charges, staggered and paused to vomit while being led through a throng of journalists watching her trial in <span class="loc">Jakarta</span>, <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>, earlier today. "I'm really sick," <span class="per">Ms. Corby</span> told Densbar's head judge <span class="per">Linton Sirait</span>, who told her to take better care of herself in jail so she would not get diarrhea. "Don't be stressed," <span class="per">Judge Sirait</span> added as he adjourned the trial until <span class="date">April 14</span>. Her sister said a doctor would visit her in prison to assess her condition. Her father, suffering with prostate cancer, said it was difficult to watch his daughter struggling so hard when things were nearing the "nitty-gritty <span class="date">now</span>." He added: "The stress and the whole thing and the stomach cramps and the nerves. It's getting on top of her." Australian politicians, noting the public support thrown behind the <span class="loc">Gold Coast</span> citizen, are promising to take her case up on several issues with the Indonesian Attorney-General later today. However, <span class="per">Mr. Corby</span> expressed doubts that politicians could work things out: "It depends on what they call justice here [in <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>]. It looks a bit fairyland to me." "Everything's reversed here. You're guilty until you're proven innocent," commented <span class="per">Mr. Corby</span> in <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>. Indonesian President <span class="per">Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono</span> is said to be monitoring the case to ensure the court hands down a just and fair verdict.</p><br><br>
