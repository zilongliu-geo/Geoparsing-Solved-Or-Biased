  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Kingston is a small village on the <span class="loc">Isle of Purbeck</span> in the <span class="loc">county of Dorset</span> in southern <span class="loc">England</span>. Kingston is situated about two miles south of <span class="loc">Corfe Castle</span> and five miles west of <span class="loc">Swanage</span>. The village of Kingston is situated on a hill near <span class="loc">Swyre Head</span>, the highest point of the <span class="loc">Purbeck Hills</span>. The village is surrounded by woods and stands at a height of over 400 ft (120 Metres) above sea level and can be seen from far away. Kingston lies within the civil parish of <span class="loc">Corfe Castle</span>. The parish forms part of the Purbeck local government district. The village is notable because it has two churches. Since the 12th century, up until <span class="date">1877</span>, Kingston had been a chapelry of <span class="loc">Corfe Castle</span>. A chapel stood on the east side of the village and it was served by the Rector of <span class="loc">Corfe Castle</span> or his assistant. In <span class="date">1833</span> <span class="per">John Scott</span>, the first <span class="per">Earl of Eldon</span>, (later <span class="per">Lord Chancellor Eldon</span>) replaced the chapel, at his own expense, with the present church building standing on the site. It was designed by his son-in-law, <span class="per">George Repton</span>, and largely followed the ground plan of the replaced chapel, embodying most of the old building material. The church was surrounded by many graves. The first Earl and his wife are buried in the churchyard. The old church remained in use as the church hall for <span class="date">many years</span>, later it became disused and is <span class="date">now</span> a private residence. Many of the gravestones were transferred to a separate graveyard, while others were used for paving or broken up.</p><br><br>
