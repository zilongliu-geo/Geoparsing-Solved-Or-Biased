<p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the northwest part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 203,065, making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The county seat is <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>'s 17th county, formed on October 17, 1828, and named for <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, the first President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is part of the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, <span class="loc">AR-MO Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> began as part of the Cherokee Territory, following an 1817 treaty. The area was next known as <span class="loc">Lovely County</span>, and one year later <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was created after another Cherokee treaty. The court house was centrally located in the <span class="loc">city of Washington</span>, modern-day <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span> (renamed to avoid confusion with <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> in <span class="loc">South Arkansas</span>). The Lee Creek Valley in southern <span class="loc">Washington County</span> contained many of the county's early settlements, including Cane Hill and <span class="loc">Evansville</span>. Arkansas College and Cane Hill College were both founded in <span class="loc">Washington County</span> within a day of each other in 1834, with the University of Arkansas being founded in <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span> in 1871. The county witnessed major battles during the American Civil War, including the Battle of <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span>, the Battle of Prairie Grove, and the Battle of Cane Hill. The county then was sparsely settled and many residents were pro-Union, since slaves were few, plantations almost nonexistent, and news came via <span class="loc">White River</span> travelers, not from the southern part of the state. A Butterfield Overland Mail route was established through the county in 1858, causing more families to settle there.</p>
