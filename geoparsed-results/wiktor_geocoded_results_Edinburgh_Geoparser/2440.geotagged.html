<p><span class="loc">Orange County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 372,813. The county seat is <span class="loc">Goshen</span>. This county was first created in 1683 and reorganized with its present boundaries in 1798. <span class="loc">Orange County</span> is included in the New <span class="loc">York-Newark-Jersey City</span>, <span class="loc">NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is in the state's <span class="loc">Mid-Hudson Region</span> of the <span class="loc">Hudson</span> Valley. <span class="loc">The County</span> Executive is Steve Neuhaus. <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was officially established on November 1, 1683, when the Province of <span class="loc">New York</span> was divided into twelve counties. Each of these was named to honor member of the British royal family, and <span class="loc">Orange County</span> took its name from the Prince of Orange, who subsequently became King William III of <span class="loc">England</span>. As originally defined, <span class="loc">Orange County</span> included only the southern part of its present-day territory, plus all of present-day <span class="loc">Rockland County</span> further south. The northern part of the present-day county, beyond <span class="loc">Moodna Creek</span>, was then a part of neighbouring <span class="loc">Ulster County</span>. At that date, the only European inhabitants of the area were a handful of Dutch colonists in present-day <span class="loc">Rockland County</span>, and the area of modern <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was entirely occupied by the native Munsee people. Due to its relatively small population, the original <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was not fully independent and was administered by New <span class="loc">York County</span>.</p>
