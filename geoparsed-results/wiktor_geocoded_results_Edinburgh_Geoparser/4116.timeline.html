  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Marshalltown</span> is a city in, and the county seat of, <span class="loc">Marshall County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 27,552 in the <span class="date">2010</span> census, compared to 26,009 in <span class="date">2000</span>. <span class="per">Henry Anson</span> was the first European settler in what is <span class="date">now</span> called <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span>. In <span class="date">April 1851</span>, <span class="per">Anson</span> found what he described as “the prettiest place in Iowa.” On a high point between the <span class="loc">Iowa River</span> and <span class="loc">Linn Creek</span>, <span class="per">Anson</span> built a log cabin. A plaque at 112 West Main Street marks the site of the cabin. In <span class="date">1853</span> <span class="per">Anson</span> named the town Marshall, after <span class="loc">Marshall</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, a former residence of his. The town became <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span> in <span class="date">1862</span> because another Marshall already existed in <span class="loc">Henry County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span> (In <span class="date">1880</span>, Marshall's name changed to <span class="loc">Wayland</span>). With the help of Potawatomi chief <span class="per">Johnny Green</span>, <span class="per">Anson</span> persuaded early settlers to stay in the area. In the mid-1850s, <span class="per">Anson</span> donated land for a county courthouse. Residents donated money for the building’s construction. In <span class="date">1863</span> the title of county seat transferred from the village of <span class="loc">Marietta</span> to <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span>. The young town began growing. By <span class="date">1900</span>, <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span> had 10,000 residents. Many industries began developing in <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span>, like Fisher Controls, <span class="loc">Lennox International</span> and <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span> Company.</p><br><br>
