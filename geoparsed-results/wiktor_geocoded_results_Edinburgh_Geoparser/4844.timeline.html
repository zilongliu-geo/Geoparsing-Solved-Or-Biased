  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Grafton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Rensselaer County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,130 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is believed that the town received its name from <span class="loc">Grafton</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, from where the first town supervisor, <span class="per">Nathaniel Dumbleton</span>, was originally from. The town is an interior town near the north-central part of the county. NY Route 2 passes across the town. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> is notable for having a Peace Pagoda, built by Nipponzan Myohoji buddhist order in <span class="date">1993</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Grafton</span> was originally a part of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, and at that time was known as <span class="loc">Roxborough</span>. The first settlements are not clear from the ca. 1765-1807 map of the manor. As part of Rennesselaerswyck, the first inhabitants were renters of that estate. The question of the first settlement of <span class="loc">Grafton</span> has never been settled. The names of the first white men who built new homes in the wilderness and the date of their coming probably will never be known. In all probability, however, the town was the last in <span class="loc">Rensselaer County</span> to be settled. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> was formed from the towns of <span class="per">Troy</span> and <span class="per">Petersburgh</span> on <span class="date">March 20, 1807</span>, and even at this comparatively late day it had few inhabitants. <span class="per">Abel Owen</span> is generally believed to have been the first man to enter the rather unattractive mountain wilderness and build himself a home. he was a sturdy farmer, an indefatigable laborer, and to encourage further settlement the patroon, <span class="per">Stephen Van Rensselaer III</span>, gave him a grant of 200 acres (81 ha) or more of what was then thought to be the best land in that section adapted to farming. <span class="per">Owen</span> was not long without neighbors, if indeed there were not one or more families located in that vicinity when he built his log house.</p><br><br>
