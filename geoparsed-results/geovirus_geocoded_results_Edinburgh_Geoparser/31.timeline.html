  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Millions of infected birds have been slaughtered in <span class="loc">China</span> and despite the spread of the virus it is only <span class="date">today</span> that the World Health Organization has confirmed the first human cases in the country. The cases include at least one fatality, a 24-year-old female poultry worker in the eastern province of Anhui. The other confirmed case is a 9-year-old boy in the central <span class="loc">province of Hunan</span> who has since recovered. The officials in Liaoning have reportedly finished vaccinating all 320 million birds in the northeastern province. <span class="per">David Nabarro</span>, the United Nations coordinator for bird and human flu, says such vaccination programs are "the right thing to do" since slaughtering the animals will not work due to the virus being so entrenched in <span class="loc">China</span>'s birds.</p><br><br>
