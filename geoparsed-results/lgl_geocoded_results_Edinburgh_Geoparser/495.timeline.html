  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Chicopee residents discuss conservation land purchase. Several residents in the area had protested land owner <span class="per">Yves Demers</span>' plans to build single-family homes on the land. He is <span class="date">now</span> negotiating to sell 30.23 acres to the city for conservation purposes while keeping 1.5 acres at the end of <span class="per">Nelson Street</span> to build two single-family homes. The land has been appraised at $450,000, while he has signed an "offer to sell real estate" agreement with the city for $500,000. In <span class="date">December</span>, the council granted <span class="per">Demers</span> a zone change from industrial to Residential A on 31.7 acres there to build single family houses. <span class="per">Bissonnette</span> told residents the city doesn't want to build a park on the conservation land. Some residents are concerned about increased traffic in the neighborhood if the land becomes a recreational area. "This is not going to be a park. The idea is to keep it in its most natural setting," <span class="per">Bissonnette</span> said. The City Council's Recreation Committee will hold a public hearing on the grant application on <span class="date">Wednesday</span> at 6:30 p.m. in Council Chambers in City Hall. The mayor and city department heads also gave briefings on the <span class="org">Front</span> Street reconstruction project, that has just begun, along with the upcoming <span class="loc">Center</span> Street reconstruction project, the <span class="org">CVS</span> under construction at <span class="loc">Hampden</span> and <span class="loc">Center</span> streets, and construction of the bike path-canal park from <span class="per">Front Street</span> near City Hall to <span class="per">Grape Street</span> that should begin <span class="date">next month</span>.</p><br><br>
