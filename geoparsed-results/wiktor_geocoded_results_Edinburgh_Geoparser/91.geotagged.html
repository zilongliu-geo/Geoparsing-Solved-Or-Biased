<p><span class="loc">Bali</span> is an island and <span class="loc">province of Indonesia</span>. The province includes the island of <span class="loc">Bali</span> and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably <span class="loc">Nusa Penida</span>, <span class="loc">Nusa Lembongan</span>, and <span class="loc">Nusa Ceningan</span>. It is located at the westernmost end of the <span class="loc">Lesser Sunda Islands</span>, between <span class="loc">Java</span> to the west and <span class="loc">Lombok</span> to the east. Its capital of <span class="loc">Denpasar</span> is located at the southern part of the island. With a population of 3,890,757 in the 2010 census, and 4,225,000 as of January 2014, the island is home to most of <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>'s Hindu minority. According to the 2010 Census, 83.5% of Bali's population adhered to Balinese Hinduism, followed by 13.4% Muslim, Christianity at 2.5%, and Buddhism 0.5%. <span class="loc">Bali</span> is a popular tourist destination, which has seen a significant rise in tourists since the 1980s. It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in <span class="loc">Bali</span>. <span class="loc">Bali</span> is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species. In this area alone over 500 reef building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about 7 times as many as in the entire Caribbean. There is a wide range of dive sites with high quality reefs, all with their own specific attractions. Many sites can have strong currents and swell, so diving without a knowledgeable guide is inadvisable. Most recently, <span class="loc">Bali</span> was the host of the 2011 ASEAN Summit, 2013 APEC and Miss World 2013.</p>
