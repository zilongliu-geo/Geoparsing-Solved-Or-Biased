<p>Bellevue is a city in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,191 at the 2010 census. The city lies along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River (Lock and Dam No. 12), next to Bellevue State Park. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, along with <span class="loc">Jones</span> and <span class="loc">Linn Counties</span> were established in 1837 and Bellevue was the named the seat of justice for all three counties. When <span class="loc">Iowa</span> became a territory in 1838, the first census was taken and <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> had 881 people. The Bellevue War of 1840 gave the town an unsavory reputation and discouraged settlement in its aftermath. The population would double within two years. In 1838 the town of Andrew was designated as the county seat. Between 1848 and 1876, the struggle between Andrew and Bellevue for the county seat continued with the county seat being moved from one town to the other several times. As the county was settled, Maquoketa would become the dominant centrally located town when the railroad reached Maquoketa in 1873. The Town of Maquoketa then built a large city hall and offered to lease the building to <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> as a courthouse. The proposition was put to a vote and approved, and since then, Maquoketa has been the county seat.</p>
