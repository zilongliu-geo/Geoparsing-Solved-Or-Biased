  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salisbury</span> is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Nassau County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 12,093 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Many but not all are housed in Levitt style homes adjacent to <span class="loc">Eisenhower</span> Park, formerly <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> Park. The region is also known by locals as <span class="loc">South Westbury</span>, and is located within the <span class="loc">Westbury</span> postal zone. It is served by the East Meadow School District. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> is so named because it sits on a broad, flat section of the larger Hempstead Plains that reminded late 19th Century Long Islanders of the <span class="loc">Salisbury Plain</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>, where <span class="loc">Stonehenge</span> is located. The <span class="loc">Long Island</span> Motor Parkway bisected the <span class="loc">Salisbury Plains</span> running east to west across <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, later <span class="loc">Eisenhower</span> Park. The route of the motor parkway is traced by a utility easement across the park, where it serves as a rough area separating two of the <span class="loc">Nassau County</span> park's three golf courses (the <span class="per">White</span> and <span class="per">Blue</span> Courses). The park is also the former site of the <span class="org">Meadowbrook Polo Club</span>, which played host to the cream of pre-World War I <span class="loc">Long Island</span> society. The Polo Club was served by the former Central Branch of the <span class="loc">Long Island</span> Rail Road, terminating at a now-demolished station across Merrick Avenue to the immediate south of the park's main entrance.</p><br><br>
