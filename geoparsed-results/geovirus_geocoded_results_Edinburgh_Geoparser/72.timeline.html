  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>State officials say <span class="loc">Vermont</span>'s first case of <span class="loc">West Nile</span> virus has been confirmed in <span class="loc">Brattleboro</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. State officials said that nine birds tested positive for <span class="loc">West Nile</span> virus in <span class="date">2006</span>, and there have been no human cases of the <span class="loc">West Nile</span> virus since <span class="date">2003</span>. "This is the seventh year of our surveillance program and a good time to remind people that <span class="loc">West Nile Virus</span> reaches its peak <span class="date">late in the summer</span>, when the virus has had time to develop in the mosquito population," said state Health Department Epidemiologist Patsy Tassler. "Before a long holiday <span class="date">weekend</span>, it's a good reminder for Vermonters to take precautions and avoid exposure to mosquitoes especially at dusk and dawn when they are most active."</p><br><br>
