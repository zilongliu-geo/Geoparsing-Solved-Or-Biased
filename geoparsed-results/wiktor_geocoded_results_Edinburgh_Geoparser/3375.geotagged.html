<p><span class="loc">Berkeley</span> is a city-center neighborhood in <span class="loc">Denver</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, located in the area traditionally called Northwest <span class="loc">Denver</span>, on the west side of Interstate 25 and just south of Interstate 70. The neighborhood is bounded by Federal Boulevard on the east, I-70 on the north, Sheridan Boulevard on the West and 38th avenue on the south. It is bordered by the <span class="loc">West Highland</span> neighborhood on the south and is often erroneously grouped together with the Highlands. The neighborhood contains two lakes surrounded by parks, one eponymous (stretching from 46th Avenue to I-70 and Sheridan Boulevard to <span class="loc">Tennyson</span> Street) and Rocky Mountain Lake Park (stretching from <span class="loc">Lowell</span> Boulevard to Grove Street and 46th Avenue to I-70). <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> Park also contains the William Scheitler Recreation Center, run by the City and <span class="loc">County of Denver</span> and including both indoor and outdoor public pools. <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> has experienced rapid growth and rise in property values in the last 20 years and particularly since the closing of Elitch Gardens Amusement Park in October of 1994. Particularly, <span class="loc">Tennyson</span> Street has become a commercial and cultural center for Northwest <span class="loc">Denver</span>, beginning in the current decade to rival Highland Square in nearby Highland. City Congressman Rick Garcia pushed for the further development of <span class="loc">Tennyson</span> Street in the November 2011 election season and succeeded in obtaining the voters' approval for $2.5 million in public works funding.  Business owners on <span class="loc">Tennyson</span> from 48th Avenue to 38th Avenue currently collaborate in an Art Walk held on the first Friday of every month.</p>
