<p>Edison is a township in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, Edison had a total population of 99,967, retaining its position as the fifth-most populous municipality in <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. The 2010 population reflected an increase of 2,280 (+2.3%) from the 97,687 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 9,007 (+10.2%) from the 88,680 counted in 1990. What is now Edison Township was originally incorporated as Raritan Township by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on March 17, 1870, from portions of both <span class="loc">Piscataway Township</span> and <span class="loc">Woodbridge Township</span>. Portions of the township were taken to form <span class="loc">Metuchen</span> on March 20, 1900, and Highland Park on March 15, 1905. The name was officially changed to Edison Township on November 10, 1954, in honor of inventor <span class="loc">Thomas Edison</span>, who had his main laboratory in the <span class="loc">Menlo</span> Park section of the township. Edison was ranked the 28th most-livable small city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> by CNN Money Magazine, and second in <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> in 2006 in Money Magazine's "Best Places To Live". In 2008, two years later, Money Magazine ranked the township 35th out of the top 100 places to live in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In the 2006 survey of <span class="loc">America</span>'s <span class="loc">Safest Cities</span>, the township was ranked 23rd, out of 371 cities included nationwide, in the 13th annual Morgan Quitno survey. In 2009, Edison was ranked as one of "<span class="loc">America</span>'s 10 Best Places to Grow Up" by U.S. News and World Report. The rankings focused on low crime, strong schools, green spaces, and abundance of recreational activities.</p>
