  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A Marine laid to rest. A cold drizzle fell upon the hundreds of people who gathered to say goodbye to <span class="per">Cpl</span>. <span class="per">Michael Ouellette</span> <span class="date">yesterday</span>. They stood among gravestones at the New <span class="loc">Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery</span> in <span class="loc">Boscawen</span>, circling the wooden casket that held <span class="per">Ouellette</span>, the 28-year-old <span class="org">Manchester Marine</span> killed <span class="date">last week</span> in <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>. They listened as <span class="per">Alan Ouellette</span> spoke of how his older brother had lived - by reaching out to people - and proposed that friends and family do the same in his memory. They watched as two Marines held an American flag over the casket and began to fold it into crisp triangles, their hands in white gloves, their movements deliberate. Marines came from far away <span class="date">yesterday</span> to honor <span class="per">Ouellette</span>, who was a member of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, <span class="org">II Marine Expeditionary Force</span>. He was killed <span class="date">March 22</span> while supporting combat operations in <span class="loc">Helmand province</span> of southwestern <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>. Another Marine, <span class="per">Cpl</span>. <span class="per">Anthony Williams</span>, 21, of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, was killed the same day. The military hasn't disclosed additional details. <span class="per">Ouellette</span>, who was buried with full military honors, earned seven commendations since joining the Marines in <span class="date">2005</span>. <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span> was his third deployment; he previously served two tours in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>. It was during the first tour that <span class="per">Lance Cpl</span>. <span class="per">Christopher Escher</span> came to know him. "He was always a leader, even as a junior guy," <span class="per">Escher</span> said <span class="date">yesterday</span>, recalling the <span class="date">days</span> they spent together on patrol in <span class="loc">Anbar province</span>. ("Every day," he said, smiling and shaking his head slightly.) <span class="per">Ouellette</span> became a team leader and then a squad leader, he said. "He didn't even have to go on this deployment," said <span class="per">Escher</span>, who came from Camp <span class="loc">Lejeune</span>, <span class="loc">N.C.</span>, for the service. But "the guys under him didn't have combat experience." <span class="per">Ouellette</span>, he said, wanted to make sure they were taken care of. <span class="per">Ouellette</span> is the 28th person from <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> killed since <span class="date">2003</span> while serving in <span class="loc">Iraq</span> or <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>. Flags flew at half-staff across the state <span class="date">yesterday</span>. Sen. <span class="per">Judd Gregg</span> mentioned <span class="per">Ouellette</span> on the floor of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senate, saying that he'd spoken to <span class="per">Ouellette</span>'s mother, "and of course he was an exceptional individual." And Gov. <span class="per">John Lynch</span> came to <span class="date">yesterday</span>'s ceremony, standing among the mourners after taps was played. But the crowd <span class="date">yesterday</span> numbered many more than officials and Marines and members of the military. <span class="per">Tai Ahmad</span>, one of <span class="per">Ouellette</span>'s closest friends from high school, said many of their <span class="org">Manchester Memorial High School</span> classmates had come to <span class="per">Ouellette</span>'s wake and services to pay their respects. "He had no problems with anybody, not one person I can recall," <span class="per">Ahmad</span> said in a conversation <span class="date">last week</span>. "He was truly, truly, truly just genuine." Young men lingered in small circles long after <span class="date">yesterday</span>'s service had ended, giving out hugs as they patted each other on the back. They waited in line to walk past <span class="per">Ouellette</span>'s casket, under the tarpaulin where his family stood. <span class="per">Alan Ouellette</span>, the younger brother, greeted each person with a handshake and a hug. "Thank you so much for coming," he told one woman as he hugged her tightly. "I'm proud of my family. They're doing much better than I am."</p><br><br>
