  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Barracas</span> is a barrio, or district, in the southeast part of the city of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. It is located between the railroad of <span class="org">Ferrocarril General</span> <span class="per">Manuel Belgrano</span> and the <span class="loc">Riachuelo</span> River, and the streets <span class="per">Regimiento de Patricios</span>, <span class="loc">Defensa</span>, <span class="loc">Caseros</span>, Vélez Sársfield, Amancio Alcorta, <span class="loc">Lafayette</span>, and Lavardén. The name <span class="loc">Barracas</span> comes from the word barraca, which refers to a temporary construction of houses using rudimentary materials. In the 18th century, "Barracas" began to grow on the banks of the <span class="loc">Riachuelo</span> River, becoming <span class="date">a slave quarter</span>, as well as an area for leather tanneries, and abbatoirs. On <span class="date">March 24, 1791</span>, a bridge was built that gave the neighborhood an important strategic value during the British invasions of the Río de la <span class="loc">Plata</span>. In <span class="date">1858</span>, part of this bridge was destroyed by flood and was replaced by a new iron bridge in <span class="date">1871</span>. There were a series of problems with this new bridge until the inauguration of its replacement in <span class="date">1931</span> that still stands <span class="date">today</span>. Throughout most of the 19th century, the neighbourhood was home to some of the wealthiest families of the city. <span class="per">Santa Lucía</span> avenue was the principal centre of activity and contained many of the city's most famous stores at the time. However, an <span class="date">1871</span> yellow fever epidemic that swept through many southern parts of the city forced most wealthy families and the area's middle class to relocate to the north of the city, leaving the neighbourhood to become the working-class area that it remains <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
