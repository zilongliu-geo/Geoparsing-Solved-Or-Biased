  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Kendall</span> is an census-designated place and unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Miami-Dade County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the area had a total population of 75,371. While the <span class="org">US Census Bureau</span> has defined the boundaries of <span class="per">Kendall</span>, locals often include western communities, such as The Hammocks, <span class="loc">Country Walk</span>, The Crossings, <span class="loc">Kendale</span> Lakes, <span class="per">Kendall West</span>, and <span class="loc">Three Lakes</span>, as subdivisions of <span class="per">Kendall</span>. According to the census, <span class="per">Kendall</span> and neighboring communities are home to over 11,000 Cuban Americans, one of the largest populations in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="per">Kendall</span> is served by the Miami Metrorail at <span class="loc">Dadeland</span> North and <span class="loc">Dadeland</span> South stations in its northeastern end. Both stations provide metro service from <span class="loc">Dadeland</span> to <span class="loc">Miami</span> commercial centers like <span class="loc">Coral Gables</span>, Downtown Miami, and <span class="org">Miami International Airport</span>. <span class="loc">Dadeland</span> South station is a major transit depot in the area, connecting the southernmost suburbs of Homestead and <span class="loc">Florida City</span> to Metrorail via limited-stop bus rapid transit along the South Miami-Dade Busway. Much of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Kendall</span> was purchased from the State of <span class="loc">Florida</span> in <span class="date">1883</span> by the <span class="loc">Florida</span> Land and Mortgage Company. It was named for <span class="per">Henry John Broughton</span> <span class="per">Kendall</span>, a director of <span class="loc">Florida</span> Land and Mortgage who moved to the area in <span class="date">the 1900s</span> to manage the company's land. As the land was not open to homesteading, development was slow well into the 20th century. A post office opened in <span class="date">1914</span>, and the first school opened in <span class="date">1929</span>. After the end of the land boom in <span class="date">1926</span>, some residents left. Two Seminole camps were in the <span class="per">Kendall</span> area, and Seminoles continued to live there into <span class="date">the 1940s</span>.</p><br><br>
