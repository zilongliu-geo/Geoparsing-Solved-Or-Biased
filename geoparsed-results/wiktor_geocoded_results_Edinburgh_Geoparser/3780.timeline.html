  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Elgin</span> (/ˈɛlɡɪn/; Scottish Gaelic: Eilginn, Scots: Ailgin) is a former cathedral city and Royal Burgh in <span class="loc">Moray</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is the administrative and commercial centre for Moray. The town originated to the south of the <span class="loc">River Lossie</span> on the higher ground above the floodplain. <span class="loc">Elgin</span> is first documented in the Cartulary of Moray in <span class="date">1190 AD</span>. It was created a Royal Burgh in the 12th century by <span class="per">King David I</span> of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> and by that time had a castle on top of the present day <span class="loc">Lady Hill</span> to the west of the town. In <span class="date">August 1040</span>, MacBeth's army defeated and killed <span class="per">Duncan I</span> at Bothganowan (Pitgaveny), near <span class="loc">Elgin</span>. <span class="loc">Elgin</span> is first recorded in a charter of <span class="per">David I</span> in <span class="date">1151</span> in which he granted an annuity to the Priory of <span class="loc">Urquhart</span>. <span class="per">David</span> had made <span class="loc">Elgin</span> a royal burgh around <span class="date">1130</span>, after his defeat of Óengus of Moray. During <span class="per">David</span>'s reign the castle was established at the top of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Lady Hill</span>. The town received a royal charter from <span class="per">Alexander II</span> in <span class="date">1224</span> when he granted the land for a new cathedral to Andrew, <span class="per">Bishop of Moray</span>. This finally settled the episcopal see which had been at various times at <span class="loc">Kinneddar</span>, <span class="loc">Birnie</span> and <span class="loc">Spynie</span>. <span class="loc">Elgin</span> was a popular residence for the early Scottish monarchs: <span class="per">David I</span>, <span class="per">William I</span>, <span class="per">Alexander II</span> and <span class="per">Alexander III</span> all held court there and hunted in the royal forests.</p><br><br>
