<p><span class="loc">Rockville</span> is a former city in <span class="loc">Delaware County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Bordering <span class="loc">Dubuque County</span> within the North Fork Township, it was approximately 3 miles northwest of <span class="loc">Worthington</span> and 1.5 miles west of today's <span class="loc">Iowa</span> Highway 136. <span class="loc">Rockville</span> was founded in 1845 by Oliver A. Olmstead. Second only to <span class="loc">Delhi</span>, it was one of the oldest towns in <span class="loc">Delaware County</span>. The area served as an important trading point and included a sawmill, a gristmill, a blacksmith, hotel, and various stores. Slightly predating Rockville's establishment, a log schoolhouse was built in 1843. This would be rebuilt in brick after burning down ten years after its founding. During this era, <span class="loc">Rockville</span> served as a stagecoach stop for those heading west of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. The <span class="loc">Rockville</span> post office opened June 15, 1846 with Olmstead serving as postmaster, and a hotel was opened for travelers of the Western Stage Company. The town's popularity even saw Charles W. Hobbs, one of the first settlers in <span class="loc">Delhi</span>, relocating to <span class="loc">Rockville</span> in 1850. Hobbs subsequently opened a store which allegedly found great success.</p>
