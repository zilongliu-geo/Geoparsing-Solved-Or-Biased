  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Escalante</span>, officially <span class="loc">City of Escalante</span>, is a fourth class city in the province of <span class="loc">Negros Occidental</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 93,005 people. <span class="loc">Escalante</span> has a total land area of 19,276.303 hectares (47,632.78 acres). It is located on the northeastern tip of <span class="loc">Negros Occidental</span>, facing the island of <span class="loc">Cebu</span>. It is 49 kilometres (30 mi) from <span class="loc">San Carlos City</span> and 95 kilometres (59 mi) from <span class="loc">Bacolod City</span>, the Provincial Capital. It is bounded on the north and west by the <span class="loc">City of Sagay</span>, on the south by the town of <span class="loc">Toboso</span> and on the east by Ta√±on Strait. Outside the city center of <span class="loc">Escalante</span>, there is a separate region of low rolling hills, especially going to its upland barangays towards Mt. <span class="loc">Lunay</span>. The hill land section is the remnant of past volcanism and probably, represents either dormant volcanic cinder cones or outliers of a once more extensive volcanic formation. Local residents in the upland barangays of <span class="loc">Escalante</span> at the foot of Mt. <span class="loc">Lunay</span> testify to period rumblings of a volcano generally believed 'to be dead'. An indicator of the dormant character of Mt. <span class="loc">Lunay</span> is the existence to <span class="date">this day</span> of a sulphur spring at its foot. Often, the slopes of these hills as in Barangay Binaguiohan are quite steep. However, the steepness of the slope has not stopped Escalantehanons in cultivation of the hillside.</p><br><br>
