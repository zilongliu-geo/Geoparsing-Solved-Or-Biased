  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Mansa</span> is the capital of the <span class="loc">Luapula Province</span> of <span class="loc">Zambia</span>, and headquarters of <span class="loc">Mansa District</span>. It takes its name from the local Chief <span class="per">Mansa</span> and the small <span class="loc">Mansa</span> River which flows west to the <span class="loc">Luapula</span> River. During British rule the city was named <span class="loc">Fort Rosebery</span>. In a province of beautiful rivers, waterfalls, lakes and wetlands, <span class="per">Mansa</span> serves administrative and commercial functions, being situated on a relatively featureless plateau between the <span class="loc">Luapula</span> River to the west and <span class="loc">Lake Bangweulu</span> to the east. It does have the merit of being reasonably well located at the crossroads of the Copperbelt-Congo Pedicle-Chembe-Kawambwa road running south to north (partly paved), and the Serenje-Samfya-Luapula Valley road (all paved) running south-east to north-west. The main highway to the <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> via Luwingu branches off the Kawambwa road north of <span class="loc">Mansa</span>, and is paved near <span class="loc">Kasama</span>. In colonial times <span class="per">Mansa</span> was called <span class="loc">Fort Rosebery</span> and was also the headquarters of the province. The first <span class="loc">Fort Rosebery</span>, however was situated in the <span class="loc">Luapula</span> Valley around <span class="date">1900</span>, where most of the province's population live, near Mambilima. After an outbreak of sleeping sickness in the valley some <span class="date">years</span> later it was moved to the present site in the belief that the higher plateau site would be more healthy.</p><br><br>
