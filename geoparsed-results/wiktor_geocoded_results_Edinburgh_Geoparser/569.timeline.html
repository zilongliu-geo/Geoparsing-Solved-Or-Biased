  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Milton</span> is an inner suburb of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, approximately 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the central business district. The suburb is a mixture of light industry, warehouses, commercial offices, retail and single and multiple occupancy residences. The main roads are <span class="per">Milton</span> Road, which runs beside the main western rail line and Coronation Drive (formerly River Road), which runs along the <span class="loc">Brisbane River</span>. Settlement in the <span class="per">Milton</span> area by Europeans began in the 1840s, with land mostly used for farming and grazing. The suburb's name was derived from the farm name "<span class="loc">Milton Farm</span>", used from the late 1840s by <span class="per">Ambrose Eldridge</span>, chemist. <span class="per">Eldridge</span> named the farm after <span class="per">John Milton</span>, the English poet. Between <span class="date">1900</span> and <span class="date">1962</span>, <span class="per">Milton</span> was served by trams running along <span class="per">Milton</span> Road from <span class="loc">Toowong</span> and <span class="loc">Rainworth</span>, with the latter branching off at Baroona Road. The services were withdrawn after the disastrous <span class="loc">Paddington</span> tram depot fire and replaced by buses. The suburb continues to be served by most western suburb bus routes operated by <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> Transport. Between <span class="date">1927</span> and <span class="date">1969</span>, the <span class="loc">Brisbane City</span> Council's tramway workshops were located at Boomerang Street, a site formerly used as a nightsoil dump. Trams accessed the workshops from <span class="per">Milton</span> Road, under the railway line. After the closure of the tram system on <span class="date">13 April 1969</span>, the workshops continued to be used to service the City Council's bus fleet, until the workshop complex was shifted to <span class="loc">Toowong</span> in <span class="date">1979</span>. The workshops were then demolished and the site used as a successful "Park and Ride" car park, where commuters could park their cars at the edge of the CBD and continue their journey by bus. However, in <span class="date">the late 1980s</span>, a change in City Council policy saw the site sold for office development.</p><br><br>
