<p><span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Neshoba County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,477 at the 2010 census. The region of <span class="loc">Neshoba county</span> and the surrounding counties was the heart of the <span class="loc">Choctaw</span> Nation from the 17th century until removal of most of the people in the 1830s. European-American settlers began to arrive in numbers in the early decades of the nineteenth century, after French, British and Spanish traders developed business relationships with the <span class="loc">Choctaw</span>. <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> is incorporated as a municipality; it was given its current name in 1903, two years before the railroad brought new opportunities and prosperity to the town. The history of the town and its influences- social, political and economic- can be seen in the many points of interest within and beyond the city limits. These range from the large ceremonial Indian mound and cave at <span class="loc">Nanih Waiya</span>, built about 1700 years ago and sacred to the <span class="loc">Choctaw</span>; to the still thriving Williams Brothers Store, a true old-fashioned general store founded in 1907 and featured in National Geographic in 1939 as a source of anything from “needles to horse collars”, and still offering everything from bridles, butter and boots to flour, feed and fashion.</p>
