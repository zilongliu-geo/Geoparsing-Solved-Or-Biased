  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cori</span> is a town and comune in the <span class="loc">province of Latina</span>, in the <span class="loc">Lazio region</span> of central <span class="loc">Italy</span>. <span class="loc">Cori</span> was well developed in the age of the expansion of <span class="loc">Rome</span> (7th-6th century BC). It became a Roman possession after the Social War (90–<span class="date">88 BC</span>), maintaining some administrative and political autonomy. In the Middle Ages Cori, which suffered a steep decadence in the early <span class="date">centuries</span> of that age, was often allied with its neighbour <span class="loc">Velletri</span>. It was a possession of the Annibaldi until <span class="date">1234</span>, when it went back to the Papal suzerainty, under which (apart a short period under Ladislaus of <span class="loc">Naples</span> in <span class="date">1400</span>–10) remained until the unification of <span class="loc">Italy</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">province of Latina</span> since <span class="date">1934</span>. The hills around <span class="loc">Cori</span> is permitted to produce both red and white Italian DOC wine, with the region producing more white wines. Grapes are limited to a harvest yield of 16 tonnes/ha with finished white wines needing a minimum alcohol level of 11% and finished reds needing 11.5%. The white wines are a blend of up to 70% Malvasia di <span class="loc">Candia</span>, up to 40% <span class="loc">Trebbiano</span> and up to 30% of <span class="loc">Bellone</span> and <span class="loc">Giallo</span>. The reds are composed of 40-60% <span class="loc">Montepulciano</span> and 20-40% <span class="org">Nero</span> Buono, 10-30% Cesanese.</p><br><br>
