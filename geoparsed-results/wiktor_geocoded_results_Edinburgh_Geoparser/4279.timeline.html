  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bagdad</span> is a small town 37 kilometres (23 mi) <span class="loc">north of Hobart</span>, <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>. It is in the <span class="org">Southern Midlands Council</span>. In the <span class="date">days</span> of the horse and buggy, <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> was an important rest area and horse-changing place for those continuing their journey up <span class="loc">Constitution Hill</span>. It is <span class="date">now</span> an area of orchards and small mixed farms and a commuter settlement. The town was named by the explorer <span class="per">Hugh Germain</span>, a private in the Royal Marines. He was said to carry two books in his saddlebags while travelling: the Bible and the <span class="loc">Arabian</span> <span class="date">Nights</span>, which he used as inspiration when he named places. <span class="org">Bagdad Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">1 December 1878</span>. A railway line connected the town with <span class="loc">Hobart</span> from <span class="date">1891</span> until <span class="date">1947</span>. In <span class="date">April 2003</span>, during the early part of the <span class="loc">Iraq</span> war, the town's website was bombarded by confused internet users from around the world trying to contact Iraqis. The <span class="date">2006</span> Census by <span class="org">the Australian</span> Bureau of Statistics counted 996 persons in <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> on census night. Of these, 51.7% were male and 48.3% were female. The majority of residents (86.9%) are of Australian birth, with another 2.6% from <span class="loc">England</span>.</p><br><br>
