<p><span class="loc">Burbank</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cook County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 28,925 at the 2010 census. It is located at the southwest edge of the <span class="loc">city of Chicago</span>; the <span class="loc">Chicago city</span> limit – specifically that of the <span class="loc">Ashburn</span> neighborhood – is in common with Burbank's eastern city limit. Burbank shares a boundary with <span class="loc">Oak Lawn</span> to its south, <span class="loc">Bridgeview</span> to its west, and <span class="loc">Bedford Park</span> to its north; the <span class="loc">city of Hometown</span> is also adjacent to Burbank's southeast corner. <span class="loc">Burbank</span> is less than two miles south of <span class="loc">Chicago Midway International Airport</span>. The current mayor is Harry J. Klein, who took office in 1991. In 1850, the area which would become the <span class="loc">city of Burbank</span>, then largely uninhabited and agrarian, became part of Lyons Township. Over the next hundred years the area remained largely undeveloped, though several times large plans were laid out for the area, never to come to fruition. In the late 19th century a railroad investor named A. B. Stickney planned a large railroad transfer center which included what became the northern part of <span class="loc">Burbank</span>, but his ideas were never realized due to an economic depression in 1893.</p>
