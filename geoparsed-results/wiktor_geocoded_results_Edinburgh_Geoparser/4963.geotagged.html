<p><span class="loc">La Puente</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 39,816 at the 2010 census. The city lies approximately 20 miles east of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. The original inhabitants of the area now occupied by the city of <span class="loc">La Puente</span> were the Tongva. They lived in a village called Awingna, which linguists translate as "abiding place." The Awingna chief Matheo (who also held sway over several other nearby villages) was baptized at Mission <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> in 1774. In 1769, the Spanish Portol√† expedition became the first Europeans to see inland portions of Alta <span class="loc">California</span>. On July 30, the party camped on the east side of the <span class="loc">San Gabriel River</span>, in today's unincorporated area of <span class="loc">Bassett</span>. Father Juan Crespi wrote in his diary that, the next day, they had to build a bridge (Spanish "puente") to cross the miry <span class="loc">San Gabriel River</span>. With the establishment of Mission <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span>, the area encompassing Awingna and what is now the city of <span class="loc">La Puente</span> became part of <span class="loc">Rancho La Puente</span>, established as a mission outpost and ranch. The rancho was visited by the Jedediah Smith party in November 1826, the first Americans to travel overland to <span class="loc">California</span>.</p>
