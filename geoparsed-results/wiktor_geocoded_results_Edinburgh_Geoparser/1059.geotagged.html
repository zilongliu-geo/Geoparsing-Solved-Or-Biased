<p>Portland /ˈpɔːrtlənd/ is a city in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, and is the oldest European settlement in the state. It's also the main urban centre in the Shire of <span class="loc">Glenelg</span> and is located on <span class="loc">Portland Bay</span>. The bay was named in 1800 by the British navigator James Grant, who sailed in the Lady Nelson along the Victorian coast. "I also distinguished the Bay by the name of <span class="loc">Portland Bay</span>, in honour of His Grace the Duke of Portland," wrote Grant. The bay, the only deep sea port between Adelaide and Melbourne, offers a sheltered anchorage against the often wild weather of <span class="loc">Bass Strait</span>. By the early 19th century, whalers and sealers were working the treacherous waters of <span class="loc">Bass Strait</span> and <span class="loc">Portland Bay</span> provided good shelter and fresh water which enabled them to establish the first white settlement in the area. Whaling captain William Dutton is known to have been resident in the <span class="loc">Portland Bay</span> area when the Henty clan arrived and is said to have provided seed potatoes for the Henty garden. In 1834, Edward Henty and his family, who had migrated from <span class="loc">England</span> to Western <span class="loc">Australia</span> in 1829, then moved to <span class="loc">Van Diemen's Land</span>, ferried some of their stock across the Strait in search of the fine grazing land of the Western District.</p>
