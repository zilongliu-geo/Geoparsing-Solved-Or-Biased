  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Artas</span> (Arabic: أرطاس‎) is a Palestinian village located four kilometers southwest of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> in the <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> Governorate in the central <span class="loc">West Bank</span>. According to the <span class="org">Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics</span>, the town had a population of 3,663 in <span class="date">2007</span>. <span class="loc">Artas</span> and the surrounding area is characterized by the diversity of landscapes, flora and fauna due to its location at a meeting place of ecosystems. From a spring below the village an aqueduct used to carry water to Birket el Hummam by Jebel el <span class="loc">Fureidis</span>. <span class="per">Nasir Khusraw</span> wrote that: "a couple of leagues from <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> is a place where there are four villages, and there is here a spring of water, with numerous gardens and orchards, and it is called Faradis (or the Paradises), on account of the beauty of the spot." According to <span class="per">Moshe Sharon</span>, professor of early Islamic history at <span class="org">Hebrew University</span>, two inscriptions found in the village show the great interest in <span class="loc">Artas</span> from leaders in the <span class="per">Fatimid</span> and <span class="per">Mamluk</span> states, as well as the wealth of the village at that time. During the <span class="org">Crusader</span> era, the village was known as <span class="loc">Artasium</span>, or Iardium Aschas. In <span class="date">1227</span>, <span class="per">Pope Gregory IX</span> confirmed that the village had been given to the Church of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>. <span class="org">Remains of the Crusader Church</span> were torn down in the 19th century.</p><br><br>
