<p>Arlington woman ran framing shop, practiced Baha’i faith. ARLINGTON — Jahan Nazarian was born into a Jewish family in western <span class="loc">Iran</span>’s <span class="loc">Kermanshah province</span> on May 2, 1923. In her 20s, she married Noorallah Moayyad, a man of the Baha’i faith, which advocates the unity of world religious and teaches that leaders such as Jesus, Muhammad and Buddha were all divine prophets. After growing up Jewish, " she had to embrace Christianity and then embrace <span class="loc">Islam</span>, and she understood that religions come in succession and improve," said Ms. Moayyad’s daughter-in-law Nadia Moayyad of <span class="loc">Southlake</span>. Ms. Moayyad died Saturday of complications from a stroke. She was 85. After 30 years of raising a family and practicing Baha’i in <span class="loc">Iran</span>, <span class="loc">Ms.</span> Moayyad and her husband moved to <span class="loc">North Texas</span> in 1973, Nadia Moayyad said, in part to be near their five children, who were all living in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. None has been able to return since the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Khomeini supplanted the Shah of <span class="loc">Iran</span>. "All of the Baha’is had to leave <span class="loc">Iran</span> during the revolution because of the religious persecution," Nadia Moayyad said. "We don’t know when we will ever go back until there is religious freedom and then respect for all faiths." Ms. Moayyad spoke only French and <span class="loc">Farsi</span> when she moved to Arlington, Nadia Moayyad said. She soon learned English so she could get her driver’s license. The Moayyads started a business, U Frame It, in Arlington. After her husband died in 1992, she allowed two grandchildren to take over the store, although she still worked there for several years. "She was a very kind and loving lady," Nadia Moayyad said. "I think her presence there was always felt with the customers." Ms. Moayyad’s funeral will be observed by a family saddened by the loss but bolstered by the Baha’i belief that death is a new beginning. "It’s not a sad occasion," Nadia Moayyad said. "It’s really a birth to a world where our soul is going to live eternally." Other survivors include sons Parviz Moayyad of Houston, Edward Moayyad of <span class="loc">Southlake</span> and <span class="loc">Hamid</span> Moayyad of <span class="loc">Colleyville</span>; daughters <span class="loc">Parvin</span> Davari and Nasrin Sadeghan, both of <span class="loc">California</span>; 13 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</p>
