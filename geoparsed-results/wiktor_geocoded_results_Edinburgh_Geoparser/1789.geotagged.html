<p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county located along the eastern border of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. It was formed in 1811 and consists of 13 townships. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Brookville</span>. As of 2010, the population was 23,087. The county seat is <span class="loc">Brookville</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is part of the Cincinnati-Middletown, <span class="loc">OH-KY-IN Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> was formed in 1811. It was named for Benjamin Franklin. Some of the early settlers of this county were Primitive Baptists, they came with Elder William Tyner who came from Virginia in 1797. They organized the Little Cedar Grove Baptist Church, the first church in the <span class="loc">Whitewater</span> Valley. [1] The members built a log church as early as 1805, about two or three miles southeast of <span class="loc">Brookville</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. In 1812 they built a large brick church, with balcony, and rifle ports. They held the first meeting in it on August 1, 1812. It is the oldest church building standing on its original site in <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. It is open as a historic site. One further landmark in the county is the Big Cedar Baptist Church and <span class="loc">Burying Ground</span> on <span class="loc">Big Cedar</span> Creek Road, between the road to <span class="loc">Reily</span> and the <span class="loc">Oxford Pike</span>. The original church was established in 1817, as an arm of the Little Cedar Baptist church. The plain, simple brick building, but impressive in its simplicity was built in 1838. This church, like all, or nearly all of the pioneer Baptist groups in the county was originally Primitive Baptist or <span class="loc">Hardshell</span>. In the 1830s modernism came upon the scene, modernism and human inventions, like Sunday Schools, Missionary Societies, and organs. Organs were particularly anathema to the Primitive Party; an organ was Arronâ€™s golden calf. The <span class="loc">Big Cedar</span> congregation divided into two congregations, but the two groups arrived at an amicable settlement and both congregations continued to use the same building. The Primitives, or Hardshells, had church there on the first and third Sabbath of each month, and the Modernists or Missionary Baptists used the church on the second and fourth <span class="loc">Sundays</span>. Each congregation had its own wood shed. The building is now maintained in connection with the <span class="loc">Big Cedar</span> Cemetery Association.[2]</p>
