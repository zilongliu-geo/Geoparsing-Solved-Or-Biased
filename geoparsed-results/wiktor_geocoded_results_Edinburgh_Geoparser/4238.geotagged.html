<p><span class="loc">Lom</span> is a municipality in <span class="loc">Oppland county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. It is part of the traditional region of <span class="loc">Gudbrandsdal</span>. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Fossbergom. The municipality of <span class="loc">Lom</span> was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The area of Skjåk was separated from <span class="loc">Lom</span> to become a municipality of its own in 1866. <span class="loc">Lom</span> is famous for its extensive history, for having one of the few remaining stave churches in <span class="loc">Norway</span>, and for lying in the midst of the highest mountains in Northern <span class="loc">Europe</span>. An ancient trade route passed up from Sunnmøre through <span class="loc">Lom</span> and Skjåk and down the <span class="loc">Gudbrandsdal</span> into the Østlandet. The trade consisted of fish and salt heading inland, and grain heading to the coast. The Saga of Olaf Haraldson relates that St. Olaf commented as he first looked down on <span class="loc">Lom</span>, “What a pity to have to lay waste to such a beautiful valley.” In the face of such a clear motivation, the residents of the valley converted (it has since been a recurring discussion whether he looked to <span class="loc">Lom</span> or the neighbouring municipality Skjåk, at the time a part of <span class="loc">Lom</span>.) St. Olafs-stuggu, a building were St. Olaf is reported to have spent a night in 1021, can still be found here. The building is part of the <span class="loc">Presthaugen District</span> Museum.</p>
