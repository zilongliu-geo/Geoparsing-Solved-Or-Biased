<p>Parker (Mojave 'Amat Kuhwely, formerly 'Ahwe Nyava) is the county seat of La <span class="loc">Paz County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, on the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> in <span class="loc">Parker</span> Valley. The population was 3,083 at the 2010 census. Founded in 1908, the town was named after Ely Parker, the first Native American commissioner for the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> government. The original town site of Parker was surveyed and laid out in 1909 by a railroad location engineer by the name of Earl. H. Parker for the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> &amp; California Railway. The town's name and origin began when a post office called Parker was established January 6, 1871, at Parker's Landing and the site of the Parker Indian Agency, named for Ely Parker, on the <span class="loc">Colorado River Indian Reservation</span>, 4 miles down river from the site of the railroad bridge of the modern town, to serve the Indian agency. What became <span class="loc">Parkers</span> Landing was established on the river as the place to land and pick up cargo and personnel for the Indian Agency and the U. S. Army detachment that was stationed there at <span class="loc">Camp Colorado</span> from 1864 to 1869 during the first years of the Reservation. <span class="loc">Camp Colorado</span> was abandoned after wind blown sparks from the departing steamboat <span class="loc">Cocopah</span> rapidly burned down the brush huts of the officers of the garrison, and endangered its barracks and storehouses.</p>
