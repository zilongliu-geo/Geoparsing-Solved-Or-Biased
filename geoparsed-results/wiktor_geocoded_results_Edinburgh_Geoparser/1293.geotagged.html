<p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the western part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Maryland</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, the population was 147,430. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Hagerstown</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was the first county in the <span class="loc">United States</span> to be named for the Revolutionary War general (and later President) <span class="loc">George Washington</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is one of three <span class="loc">Maryland counties</span> recognized by the Appalachian Regional Commission as being part of <span class="loc">Appalachia</span>. The county borders southern <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> to the north, Northern Virginia to the south, and the Eastern Panhandle of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> to the south and west. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is included in the Hagerstown-Martinsburg, <span class="loc">MD-WV Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which is also included in the Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> has experienced a population boom, and is one of the fastest-growing counties in the country, due to an influx of people from <span class="loc">Washington</span> and <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>. The western portions of <span class="loc">Maryland</span> (including present <span class="loc">Washington County</span>) were incorporated into Prince George's County in 1696.
