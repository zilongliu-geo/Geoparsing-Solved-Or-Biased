  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Cleveland</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Bradley County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 41,285 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat and largest city in <span class="loc">Bradley County</span>, and the principal city of the <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> metropolitan area (consisting of <span class="loc">Bradley County</span> and neighboring <span class="loc">Polk County</span>), which is included in the Chattanooga-Cleveland-Dalton combined statistical area. <span class="per">Cleveland</span> is the fourteenth largest city in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> and the fifth-largest industrially with twelve Fortune 500 manufacturers. In <span class="date">1819</span>, the <span class="loc">Cherokee Agency</span>— the official liaison between the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> government and the Cherokee Nation— was moved to the Hiwassee area, a few miles north of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Cleveland</span>. The Indian agent was Colonel <span class="per">Return J. Meigs</span>. <span class="per">Charleston</span> and <span class="per">Blythe</span>'s Ferry (about 15 miles, or 24 kilometers, west of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>) would both figure prominently in the Cherokee Removal in the late 1830s. The legislative act that created <span class="loc">Bradley County</span> in <span class="date">1836</span> authorized the establishment of a county seat, which was to be named "<span class="per">Cleveland</span>" after Colonel <span class="per">Benjamin Cleveland</span>, a commander at the Battle of <span class="loc">Kings Mountain</span> during the American Revolution. The commissioners chose "<span class="per">Taylor</span>'s Place," the home of <span class="per">Andrew Taylor</span>, as the location for the county seat, due largely to the site's excellent water sources. By <span class="date">1838</span>, <span class="per">Cleveland</span> already had a population of 400, and was home to two churches (one Presbyterian, the other Methodist), and a school, the Oak Grove Academy. The city was incorporated on <span class="date">February 4, 1842</span>, and elections for mayor and aldermen were held shortly afterward.</p><br><br>
