<p><span class="loc">Exeter</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Tulare County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is situated in the <span class="loc">San Joaquin</span> Valley near the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. The population was 10,334 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Exeter</span> is located on State Highway 65, 2 miles (3.2 km) south of Highway 198 and 15 miles (24 km) east of Highway 99. <span class="loc">Exeter</span> is within a 3 to 4 hour drive of both <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>, and 30 minutes from the entrance to Sequoia National Park. The public school system in <span class="loc">Exeter</span> consists of: Exeter Union High School (9-12), Wilson Middle School (6-8), <span class="loc">Rocky Hill</span> Elementary (K-5), Lincoln Elementary (K-5) and Kaweah High School (a continuation high school). The 1999-2000 enrollment was: grades K-8, 1,936 and grades 9-12, 1101 students. Before the arrival of European settlers, Yokuts settled around an area in an oak forest two miles north of <span class="loc">Exeter</span>. This oak forest was later the site of a Spanish Jesuit Mission, and was subsequently abandoned before the 1830s. The current town site was a plain that possessed elk, antelope, frogs, and deer. <span class="loc">Rocky Hill</span>, to the east of the city, offered shelter to native tribes when the plain flooded. Several caves on the hill contain petroglyphs, though some of the most important of these were destroyed by local vandals/looters and poorly managed and unsupervised steer.</p>
