  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Biri</span> is a village in the municipality of Gjøvik, <span class="loc">Oppland county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. It was formerly classified as a municipality. The <span class="loc">parish of Biri</span> was established as a municipality on <span class="date">1 January 1838</span> (see formannskapsdistrikt). On <span class="date">1 January 1910</span>, the district <span class="loc">Snertingdal</span> was divided from <span class="loc">Biri</span> to form a municipality of its own, leaving <span class="loc">Biri</span> with 2,815 inhabitants. On <span class="date">1 January 1964</span>, <span class="loc">Biri</span> was incorporated into the neighboring municipality of Gjøvik. Prior to the merger, <span class="loc">Biri</span> had 3,274 inhabitants. <span class="loc">Biri</span> was the center of several small villages including Biri Øverbygd, <span class="per">Udahlsroa</span> and <span class="per">Klomsteinroa</span>. This has traditionally been an agricultural and forestry community. The village of <span class="loc">Biri</span> had a population of 1,389 inhabitants as of <span class="date">1 January 2009</span>. It is located at Mjøsa Bridge on the west side of Mjøsa lake, between <span class="loc">Lillehammer</span> and Gjøvik. The Vismunda river, which drains into Mjøsa, has been an important lifeline. Biri church (Biri kirke) is a cruciform church dating from <span class="date">1777</span>. Built of timber, it has 450 seats. The church was erected after the original church burned down. In <span class="date">1890</span> there was another major fire, this time at the Biri parsonage. The fire also destroyed church records for 1789-1814 and 1854-1877. In <span class="date">April 2007</span>, major damage in the church led to an extensive rehabilitation.</p><br><br>
