<p>Milton is a town in <span class="loc">Sussex County</span>, <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, on the <span class="loc">Delmarva</span> Peninsula. The population was 2,576 at the 2010 census, an increase of 55.5% over the previous decade. It is part of the rapidly growing Cape Region and lies within the <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Delaware</span> Route 5 passes through Milton. Located at the head of the <span class="loc">Broadkill River</span>, Milton was first settled in 1672 by English Colonists. The town was known by various names until 1807, when it was named for the English poet, John Milton. The Delaware General Assembly passed the charter that recognized the Town of Milton as a municipality in 1945. History and Milton's shipbuilding heritage remain very important to the town, which is home to some of the finest Victorian and Colonial architecture in <span class="loc">Delaware</span>. Many of the homes have been restored to their original form, particularly those on Union and Federal streets. Milton has 198 structures on the Federal Register Historic District and its history is preserved in the Lydia Black Cannon Museum, the Governor James Carey home, the Chestnut Street Cemetery, and the Governor David Hazzard Mansion. The Hazzard House, Hazzard House, and Gov. James Ponder House were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The Milton Historic District was added in 1982.</p>
