  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kampung Baru</span> is a Malay enclave in central <span class="loc">Kuala Lumpur</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. One of the most valuable tracts of land in the capital, it has been estimated to be worth up to US$1.4 billion. <span class="loc">Kampung Baru</span>'s elders have turned developers away, saying they want to preserve their ethnic Malay lifestyle. Colonial British administrators gazetted <span class="loc">Kampung Baru</span> as a <span class="loc">Malay</span> agricultural settlement in <span class="date">1900</span> to allow the Malays to retain their village lifestyle within the city. Since then <span class="loc">Kampung Baru</span> has held out against development and modern-city living, turning into a political symbol of Malay culture. The area held a special place for Malay politics during the pro-independence movement that grew up after World War II. Anti-colonial protests were held there, and founders of <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>'s dominant political party, the United <span class="org">Malays National Organisation</span>, held their early meetings there. New evidence revealed by the National Archives of <span class="loc">Malaysia</span> shows that UMNO has its origins at the <span class="org">Sultan Sulaiman Club</span> in <span class="loc">Kampung Baru</span>. Culture, Arts and Heritage Minister Datuk Seri Dr <span class="per">Rais Yatim</span> said the documents were unearthed recently when some work was being carried out at the club.</p><br><br>
