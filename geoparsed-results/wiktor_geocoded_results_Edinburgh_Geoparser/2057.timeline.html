  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Richland</span> was a town in southeastern <span class="loc">Shawnee County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. It is notable for being the birthplace of <span class="per">Georgia Neese</span> <span class="per">Clark Gray</span>, the first female Treasurer of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In <span class="date">October 1854</span>, <span class="per">Charles Matney</span> settled in the area that was to become <span class="loc">Richland</span>, near the confluence of <span class="loc">Camp Creek</span> with the <span class="loc">Wakarusa River</span>. In <span class="date">1857</span> a post office was opened north of town and a schoolhouse was constructed, out of logs, on the northeast corner of <span class="per">Matney</span>'s land. <span class="loc">Richland</span> eventually became the center of a rich agricultural region and its businesses included a bank, a barber shop, a church, two blacksmiths, two doctors, a pharmacy, several lodges, a hotel and a general store. in the early 1870s, <span class="loc">Richland</span> became a station on the St. <span class="per">Louis, Lawrence</span> and <span class="per">Denver</span> Railroad however the railroad would be short lived and the railroad stopped running in <span class="date">1894</span>. By the 1890s the population had come close to 300 with more businesses including a lumber yard, two millinery shops and an ice cream parlor, among others. <span class="loc">Richland</span> also established a newspaper, <span class="loc">Argosy</span>, in <span class="date">1893</span> and it included local news but also news about nearby communities including <span class="loc">Twin Mound</span>, <span class="loc">Overbrook</span> and Clinton. In the <span class="date">summer of 1894</span>, <span class="per">Laura Ingalls Wilder</span> passed through <span class="loc">Richland</span> with her husband and daughter. Wilder noted in her diary, based on the friendliness of the townspeople, that "[we] may come back here if we do not like it there [in Missouri]."</p><br><br>
