<p>Bedford is a city in <span class="loc">Taylor County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,440 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Taylor County</span>. Lake of Three Fires State Park is located a few miles northeast of Bedford. The community is believed to have gotten its name from Thomas J. Bedford who was the first west bound <span class="loc">Pony Express</span> rider to deliver the mail on its final leg from <span class="loc">Benicia</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> to <span class="loc">Oakland</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> on April 23, 1861. Bedford is believed to have operated Bedfords Store and Trading Post in 1848 within the city limits. He moved to <span class="loc">California</span> later that year in the <span class="loc">California</span> Gold Rush. The community was called "Grove" when a post office was established on June 30, 1855. On June 24, 1856 it was changed to <span class="loc">Bedford</span>. Other histories have noted possible other sources of the name: <span class="loc">Bedford</span> in <span class="loc">England</span> (possible original home of early settlers) <span class="loc">Bedford</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> (reputed home of the surveyor) <span class="loc">Bedford</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> (reputed home of a "government engineer") The community was formally established as the county seat of <span class="loc">Taylor County</span> by a legislative act in 1853. The town was formally laid out on lots sold on July 4, 1853 (which at the time identified the community as "Bedforde"). According to town legend a barrel of whiskey was placed on the grounds and lots sold for $10 to $20 - although none of the lots were paid for at the time.</p>
