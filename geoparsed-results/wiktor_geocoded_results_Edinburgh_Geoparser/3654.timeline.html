  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Caro</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Tuscola County</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,229 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census and 4,145 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census (an increase of about 2%). <span class="loc">Caro</span> is located northeast of Flint and east of <span class="loc">Saginaw</span> in <span class="loc">Michigan</span>'s Thumb region. <span class="loc">Caro</span> began as a logging camp on the <span class="loc">Cass River</span> established by <span class="per">Curtis Emerson</span> in <span class="date">1847</span>. Later <span class="per">Samuel P. Sherman</span>, who purchased 63 acres (250,000 m2) in the north half of the northwest quarter of section 3 in Indianfields Township on <span class="date">September 8, 1852</span>. Prior to this, only two land sales had been recorded, both for lumbering or speculative purposes. His son, <span class="per">William E. Sherman</span>, had worked in the lumber industry nearby on the <span class="loc">Cass River</span> for some time prior to <span class="date">1852</span> and <span class="per">William</span>'s favorable report persuaded his father to visit in <span class="date">1851</span> and afterwards purchased several tracts of land in addition to his initial purchase. In the 1856-57 session of the <span class="loc">Michigan</span> Legislature, construction of a road was authorized from <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span> in <span class="loc">Saginaw County</span> northeast to <span class="loc">Forestville</span> in <span class="loc">Sanilac County</span>, with a route that would pass through what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Caro</span>. Once the road was cleared, commercial interests began to locate here. <span class="per">Melvin Gibbs</span>, who had been keeping a hotel in an old log house, in <span class="date">1858</span> put up a new frame building, known as the <span class="org">Gibbs House</span>. In <span class="date">1859</span>, <span class="per">William E. Sherman</span> built another hotel, which he named the <span class="org">Centerville House</span>, based on the location being near the center of the county. The name <span class="loc">Centerville</span> became associated with the developing community.</p><br><br>
