  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Truro</span> (postcode 5356, altitude 311m) is a town in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>, 80 km northeast of Adelaide. It is situated in an agricultural and pastoral district on the Sturt Highway, east of the <span class="loc">Barossa</span> Valley, where the highway crosses somewhat lofty and rugged parts of the Mount Lofty Ranges. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Truro</span> had a population of 395. <span class="loc">Truro</span> is in the <span class="org">Mid Murray Council</span> local government area, the South Australian <span class="loc">House of Assembly</span> electoral <span class="loc">district of Schubert</span> and <span class="org">the Australian House of Representatives</span> <span class="org">Divisions of Barker</span> and <span class="loc">Wakefield</span>. The town was established on <span class="loc">Truro Creek</span> (<span class="loc">White Hut Creek</span>) in <span class="date">1848</span> by <span class="per">John Howard</span> Angas, the son of <span class="per">George Fife Angas</span> who had bought the land in <span class="date">1842</span>. The survey was conducted by <span class="per">Thomas Burr</span>, assisted by his (eventual) son in law <span class="per">Frederick Sinnett</span>, during a period when both were freed from their usual commitments in order to pursue private contracts. It is named after the <span class="loc">city of Truro</span> in <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. It is somewhat uncertain whether the name <span class="loc">Truro</span> was given by Angas, or the first settlers in the town, but with the Wheal Barton mine nearby, many of those settlers were Cornish miners, so it is quite likely that if they were not the namers of the town, they were certainly the inspiration thereof.</p><br><br>
