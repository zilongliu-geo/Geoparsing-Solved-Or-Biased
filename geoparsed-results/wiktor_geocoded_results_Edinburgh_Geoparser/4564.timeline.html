  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Bluff is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Juan County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 320 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. Bluff is located at 37°17′1″N 109°33′10″W (37.283696, -109.552871), in the scenic and very sparsely populated southeastern <span class="loc">Utah</span> canyonlands of the <span class="loc">Colorado Plateau</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 22.6 square miles (58.7 km²), of which, 22.1 square miles (57.2 km²) of it is land and 0.6 square miles (1.4 km²) of it (2.43%) is water. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Bluff has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated "BSk" on climate maps. Under the direction of <span class="per">John Taylor</span>, <span class="per">Silas S. Smith</span> and <span class="per">Danish</span> settler Jens Nielson led about 230 Mormons on expedition to start a farming community in southeastern <span class="loc">Utah</span>. After forging about 200 miles (320 kilometers) of their own trail over difficult terrain, the settlers arrived on the site of Bluff in <span class="date">April 1880</span>. (The trail followed went over and down the "Hole In the Rock", which <span class="date">now</span> opens into one of the tributaries of <span class="loc">Lake Powell</span>.) The town was named for the bluffs near the town site. The town’s population had declined to seventy by <span class="date">1930</span> but rebounded during a uranium prospecting boom in <span class="date">the 1950s</span>. With the uranium decline in <span class="date">the 1970s</span> Bluff again declined and <span class="date">now</span> remains a small town with about 300 residents.</p><br><br>
