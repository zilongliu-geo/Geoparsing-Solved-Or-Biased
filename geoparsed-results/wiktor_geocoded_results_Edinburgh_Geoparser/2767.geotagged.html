<p><span class="loc">Atlanta</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cass County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 5,675. <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> was established in 1871 with the building of the <span class="loc">Texas</span> and Pacific Railway and was named for <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, former home of many early settlers. A post office opened in 1871, and by 1885 the community had 1,500 residents, three white and two black churches, two schools, a bank, several sawmills, a number of general stores, and a weekly newspaper, the Citizens' Journal. Lumbering was the chief industry. The lumber boom reached its peak around 1890, when the population was 1,764. The community was incorporated in 1929, when it had 1,900 residents and 105 businesses. The onset of the Great Depression forced many businesses to close, and in 1936 <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> had only 85 rated businesses. The opening of the Rodessa oilfield in 1935, however, helped mitigate the worst effects of the Depression, and by 1940 the town had modern canneries, lumber mills, wholesale houses, a brick plant, a hospital, and a population of 2,453. Subsequently, <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> grew steadily, topping the 4,000 mark for the first time in the early 1960s. In 1990 the population was 6,118. By 2000 the population had dropped to 5,745. Principal industries include farming, forestry, oil, and tourism.</p>
