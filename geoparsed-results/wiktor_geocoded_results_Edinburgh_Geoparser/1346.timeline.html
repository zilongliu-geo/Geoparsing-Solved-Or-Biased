  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lake County</span> is one of the 64 counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 7,310. The county seat and the only municipality in the county is <span class="loc">Leadville</span>. The highest natural point in <span class="loc">Colorado</span> and the entire <span class="loc">Rocky Mountains</span> is the summit of <span class="loc">Mount Elbert</span> in <span class="loc">Lake County</span> at 14,440 feet (4401.2 meters) elevation. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> was one of the original 17 counties created by the <span class="loc">Colorado</span> legislature on <span class="date">November 1, 1861</span>. As originally defined, <span class="loc">Lake County</span> included a large portion of western <span class="loc">Colorado</span> to the south and west of its present boundaries. The county was named for <span class="loc">Twin Lakes</span>. Placer gold was found at <span class="loc">Colorado</span> Gulch in <span class="date">1863</span> as part of the <span class="loc">Colorado</span> Gold Rush. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> slowly lost territory over the succeeding <span class="date">decades</span>, losing land in its southeast to <span class="loc">Saguache County</span> in <span class="date">1866</span> and <span class="loc">Hinsdale County</span> in <span class="date">1874</span>; in its southwest to La <span class="loc">Plata County</span> in <span class="date">1874</span> and <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Juan County</span> in <span class="date">1876</span>, and in its west to <span class="loc">Ouray</span> and <span class="loc">Gunnison</span> counties in <span class="date">1877</span>. With its many reductions in size, <span class="loc">Lake County</span>'s designated county seat also changed multiple times within just <span class="date">a few years</span>, residing successively in <span class="loc">Oro City</span> (from <span class="date">1861</span>), Lourette (from <span class="date">1863</span>), Dayton (from <span class="date">1866</span>), and Granite (from <span class="date">1868</span>).</p><br><br>
