<p><span class="loc">Ostrov</span> (Russian: О́стров, lit. island) is a town and the administrative center of <span class="loc">Ostrovsky District</span> in <span class="loc">Pskov Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Velikaya</span> River, 55 kilometers (34 mi) south of <span class="loc">Pskov</span>, the administrative center of the oblast. Population: 21,668 (2010 Census); 25,078 (2002 Census); 29,060 (1989 Census); 27,000 (1974). The name of the town, which means "island" in Russian, originates from the island on the <span class="loc">Velikaya</span>, on which the Ostrov fortress was originally built. It was founded as a fortress in the end of the 13th century and first mentioned in 1342. It had been an important military outpost throughout the 15th-16th centuries. The only time it was conquered was in 1501, by the Livonian Order after the Battle of the <span class="loc">Siritsa</span> River. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, it was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). <span class="loc">Ostrov</span> is specifically mentioned as one of the towns making the governorate. In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off and in 1772, <span class="loc">Pskov</span> Governorate (which between 1777 and 1796 existed as <span class="loc">Pskov</span> Viceroyalty) was established. Catherine the Great incorporated it as a town in 1777.</p>
