<p>Lima /ˈliːmə/ is the capital and the largest <span class="loc">city of Peru</span>. It is located in the valleys of the Chillón, Rímac and Lurín rivers, in the central coastal part of the country, overlooking the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. Together with the seaport of <span class="loc">Callao</span>, it forms a contiguous urban area known as the <span class="loc">Lima Metropolitan</span> Area. With a population of almost 10 million, <span class="loc">Lima</span> is the most populous metropolitan area of <span class="loc">Peru</span>, and the third largest city in <span class="loc">the Americas</span> (as defined by "city proper"), just behind São Paulo and <span class="loc">Mexico City</span>. <span class="loc">Lima</span> was founded by Spanish conquistador <span class="loc">Francisco Pizarro</span> on January 18, 1535, as Ciudad de los Reyes. It became the capital and most important city in the Spanish Viceroyalty of <span class="loc">Peru</span>. Following the Peruvian War of Independence, it became the capital of the <span class="loc">Republic of Peru</span>. Today, around one-third of the Peruvian population lives in the metropolitan area. <span class="loc">Lima</span> is home to one of the oldest higher learning institutions in the <span class="loc">New World</span>. The National University of <span class="loc">San Marcos</span>, founded on May 12 of 1551, during Spanish colonial regime, is the oldest continuously functioning university in <span class="loc">the Americas</span>.</p>
