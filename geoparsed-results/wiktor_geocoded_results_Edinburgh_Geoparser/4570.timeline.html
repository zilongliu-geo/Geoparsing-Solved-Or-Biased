  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Edinburg</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Hidalgo County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 81,029 according to the <span class="date">2012</span> census estimate. <span class="loc">Edinburg</span> is part of the McAllen–Edinburg–Mission and <span class="loc">Reynosa–McAllen metropolitan</span> areas. In <span class="date">1908</span>, <span class="per">John Closner</span>, <span class="per">William Briggs</span>, <span class="per">Argyle McAllen</span>, Plutarco de la Viña and <span class="per">Dennis B. Chapin</span> developed a new community (the town square of which is <span class="date">now</span> located at the crossroads of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 281 and State Highway 107). The town was named <span class="per">Chapin</span> in honor of one of the developers. It is a local myth that <span class="loc">Edinburg</span> became the county seat of <span class="loc">Hidalgo County</span> in a dramatic, nighttime covert operation in which the county records were removed from the previous county seat. However, historical records show more practical reasons. The original <span class="loc">Hidalgo County</span> Courthouse in the <span class="loc">City of Hidalgo</span> was under frequent danger of flooding because of the town's proximity to the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>, which sometimes encroached on the building. Additionally, <span class="loc">Texas</span> law required that the courthouse be close to the geographic center of the county. When <span class="per">Dennis Chapin</span> was involved in the shooting death of <span class="per">Oscar J. Rountree</span> at the <span class="loc">Dan</span> <span class="loc">Breen Saloon</span> in <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, the community changed its name to <span class="loc">Edinburg</span> to honor <span class="loc">John Young</span>, a prominent businessman who was born in <span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. The town was officially named in <span class="date">1911</span> and incorporated in <span class="date">1919</span>.</p><br><br>
