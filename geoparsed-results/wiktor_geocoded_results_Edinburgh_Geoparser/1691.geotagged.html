<p><span class="loc">Pandan</span> is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Catanduanes</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 19,393 people. <span class="loc">Pandan</span> is politically subdivided into 26 barangays. Formerly the town site was located some two kilometers away south of the present site. Then the people were disturbed by constant depredation of bandits coming from other places. The present site has been chosen because it was near the sea and the fishermen found it very convenient for their trade, however, being near the sea, it was vulnerable to <span class="loc">Moros</span> who always come to get their belongings or even capture some people. As a defense against such moro raids, the people planted pandan shrubs close to each other to form a formidable defense against invaders. When the Spaniards came they found the plants around the poblacion in great abundance. When asked what the name of the shrubs was, the people told them that they were pandan shrubs. Thus, the Spaniards called the place <span class="loc">Pandan</span>. The municipality lies on the northern tip of the province, 96 kilometers from the capital town of <span class="loc">Virac</span>. Bounded on the south by the municipality of <span class="loc">Caramoran</span>, on the west by the Maqueda Channel, on the east by the municipality of <span class="loc">Bagamanoc</span> and on the north by the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. It has a total land area of 11,990 hectares. This is a town of 17,096 friendly and hospitable people, to which 99% are Roman Catholic.</p>
