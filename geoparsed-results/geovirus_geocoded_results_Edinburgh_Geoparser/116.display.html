<p>The governor of the south Sudanese Warab state, Anthony Bol <span onClick="goto_name('Madut')" class="loc">Madut</span> told the Reuters news agency that at least a thousand people in the state have died of Meningitis and another unidentified disease. He said that the unknown disease had symptoms similar to Yellow fever but the patients died quickly. The governor appealed for medical assistance to diagnose and help control the outbreak. The outbreak comes as hundreds of thousands of refugees return to southern <span onClick="goto_name('Sudan')" class="loc">Sudan</span> after a peace deal ended conflict in the areas. The refugees are housed in crowded camps where the risk of infection is high. Hotspots in <span onClick="goto_name('south Sudan')" class="loc">south Sudan</span> and <span onClick="goto_name('Darfur')" class="loc">Darfur</span> are experiencing a lull in the fighting that has allowed normal life to return to these areas. Meanwhile, the NGO SOS Children's Villages <span onClick="goto_name('Sudan')" class="loc">Sudan</span> reports that despite the ceasefire among the warring factions in <span onClick="goto_name('south Sudan')" class="loc">south Sudan</span> and <span onClick="goto_name('Darfur')" class="loc">Darfur</span>, people are still worried that conflict may erupt once again. SOS is also concerned about shortages in medicine and clean water in its facilities in these areas. SOS emergency relief activities have restarted in <span onClick="goto_name('Abu Shok')" class="loc">Abu Shok</span> refugee camp in Al-Fashir, <span onClick="goto_name('Darfur')" class="loc">Darfur</span>, with most of the psychologists and social workers returning to work in the psycho-social centres, an SOS release reports. Work with the patients and beneficiaries of the three centres it maintains has started once again, the release adds. The situation in SOS Children's Village <span onClick="goto_name('Malakal')" class="loc">Malakal</span> is also stable, but cholera is still spreading among the residents of the area, especially children. SOS Children's Villages <span onClick="goto_name('Sudan')" class="loc">Sudan</span> is providing emergency medical assistance in the form of medication for the children in the SOS Children's Village, as well as those being treated in the local children's hospital. According to the SOS release, most international organisations and NGOs have returned to work in both <span onClick="goto_name('Darfur')" class="loc">Darfur</span> and <span onClick="goto_name('Malakal')" class="loc">Malakal</span>, especially the World Food Programme and other UN agencies. Several NGOs, however, have not resumed activities in the conflict areas. Airplanes are flying into <span onClick="goto_name('Darfur')" class="loc">Darfur</span> and <span onClick="goto_name('Malakal')" class="loc">Malakal</span>, but flights to <span onClick="goto_name('Darfur')" class="loc">Darfur</span> are not as regular as before the conflict and there are no scheduled flights to the area of <span onClick="goto_name('Malakal')" class="loc">Malakal</span>. Telephone communications are still unstable, and co-workers from SOS Children's Villages <span onClick="goto_name('Sudan')" class="loc">Sudan</span> in <span onClick="goto_name('Khartoum')" class="loc">Khartoum</span> are relying on satellite telephones to communicate with <span onClick="goto_name('Darfur')" class="loc">Darfur</span> and <span onClick="goto_name('Malakal')" class="loc">Malakal</span>. Mr. Ali Mahdi, director of SOS Children's Villages <span onClick="goto_name('Sudan')" class="loc">Sudan</span>, said that despite the relative quiet in both <span onClick="goto_name('Darfur')" class="loc">Darfur</span> and <span onClick="goto_name('Malakal')" class="loc">Malakal</span>, people are still worried and tense regarding the situation. Co-workers at the SOS Emergency Relief Centres in <span onClick="goto_name('Darfur')" class="loc">Darfur</span> and those in the SOS Children's Village <span onClick="goto_name('Malakal')" class="loc">Malakal</span> are afraid of conflict breaking out again in the areas. Mr. Mahdi also said that the centres in <span onClick="goto_name('Darfur')" class="loc">Darfur</span> and the SOS Children's Village in <span onClick="goto_name('Malakal')" class="loc">Malakal</span> are both suffering from shortages in clean water and medication, some of which are being sent from <span onClick="goto_name('Khartoum')" class="loc">Khartoum</span>. During a visit to <span onClick="goto_name('Darfur')" class="loc">Darfur</span> on 10 January, Mr. Ali Mahdi visited the town of <span onClick="goto_name('Nyala')" class="loc">Nyala</span>, the capital of <span onClick="goto_name('South Darfur')" class="loc">South Darfur</span>, where there is a similar refugee problem as that in Al-Fashir. SOS Children's Villages <span onClick="goto_name('Sudan')" class="loc">Sudan</span> is now considering starting an emergency relief programme similar to the one in <span onClick="goto_name('Abu Shok')" class="loc">Abu Shok</span> refugee camp in Al-Fashir.</p>
