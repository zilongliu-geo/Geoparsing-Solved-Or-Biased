<p><span class="loc">Warren County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 65,707. The county seat is <span class="loc">Queensbury</span>. The county is named in honor of General Joseph Warren, an American Revolutionary War hero of the Battle of <span class="loc">Bunker Hill</span>. <span class="loc">Warren County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Glens Falls</span>, <span class="loc">NY</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Albany-Schenectady, NY Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">When counties</span> were established in <span class="loc">New York</span> State in 1683, the present <span class="loc">Warren County</span> was part of <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. The county was enormous, covering the northern part of <span class="loc">New York</span> State, all of the present State of <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, and, in theory, extended westward to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. It was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of <span class="loc">Gloucester County</span>, both containing territory now in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. On March 12, 1772, what was left of <span class="loc">Albany County</span> was split into three parts, one remaining under the name <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. One of the other pieces, <span class="loc">Charlotte County</span> (named for Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, queen-consort of King George the Third of <span class="loc">England</span>), contained the eastern portion.</p>
