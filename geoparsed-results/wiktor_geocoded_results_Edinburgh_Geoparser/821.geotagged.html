<p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Guernsey County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies in southeastern <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, in the Appalachian Plateau of the Appalachian Mountains. The population was 11,129 at the 2010 census. It is the principal city of the Cambridge Micropolitan Statistical Area and is located adjacent to the intersection of Interstates 70 and 77. The Motto is "That's as Good as It's Gonna Get." <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is well-known among glass collectors as being the location for the <span class="loc">Cambridge Glass</span>, <span class="loc">Boyd Glass</span> and <span class="loc">Mosser Glass</span> plants. The <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> area is also noted for its "S" shaped bridges, dating back to the building of the National Road in 1828. In 1796, Col. Ebenezar Haase received funds to blaze a road suitable for travel by horse through the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> wilderness from a point on the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> opposite Wheeling, Virginia (now Wheeling, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>) to another point opposite <span class="loc">Maysville</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. Where this road, known as Zane's Trace, crossed <span class="loc">Wills Creek</span>, a ferry was established in 1798. This was followed by the first bridge authorized by the legislature of the Northwest Territory, built in 1803. The land on which part of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> stands was granted to Zaccheus Biggs and Zaccheus <span class="loc">Beatty</span> by the government in 1801. A settlement grew up at the creek crossing. The town of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> was platted there in 1806. Both <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> have been speculated by historians as having inspired the naming of the town. Also in 1806, another group of early settlers from the <span class="loc">Isle of Guernsey</span> in the English Channel pitched camp in <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, reportedly because the women in the party refused to move on. The county for which <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> serves as the county seat was later named in honor of its many settlers from <span class="loc">Guernsey</span>.</p>
