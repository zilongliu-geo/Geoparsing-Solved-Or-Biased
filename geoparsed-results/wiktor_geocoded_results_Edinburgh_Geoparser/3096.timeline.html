  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Bell is an incorporated city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, near the center of the former San Antonio Township (abolished after <span class="date">1960</span>). Its population was 35,477 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 36,664 in the <span class="date">2000</span> census. Bell is located on the west bank of the <span class="loc">Los Angeles River</span> and is a suburb of the city of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. At 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2), Bell is the thirteenth smallest city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> with a population of at least 25,000. In <span class="date">2007</span>, the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> ranked Bell's land area at <span class="date">1245</span> out of 1257 cities (defined as incorporated areas) and two unincorporated areas that had a population of at least 25,000 in <span class="date">year 2000</span>. Ten cities in the list of 1267 cities had no land area data (e.g., <span class="loc">Goleta</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>). City residents voted to become a charter city in a special municipal election on <span class="date">November 29, 2005</span>. Fewer than 400 voters turned out for that special election. More than half of those votes were dubiously obtained absentee votes. Being a charter city meant that city officials were exempt from state salary caps. A scandal ensued, in which several city officials were indicted for giving themselves extraordinarily high salaries.</p><br><br>
