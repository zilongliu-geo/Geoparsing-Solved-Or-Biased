<p><span class="loc">Jona</span> is a former municipality in the Wahlkreis (constituency) of See-Gaster in the canton of St. <span class="loc">Gallen</span> in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. <span class="loc">Jona</span> is located at the eastern shore of <span class="loc">Obersee</span>. It has been part of the municipality of Rapperswil-Jona since 2007, as before comprising the villages of <span class="loc">Bollingen</span>, <span class="loc">Busskirch</span>, Curtiberg, Kempraten-Lenggis, Wagen and Wurmsbach (<span class="loc">Wurmsbach</span> Abbey). The river <span class="loc">Jona</span> flows through the municipality in the Lake Zürich, the settlement is named after the river, first recorded in Latinized form Johanna in AD 834, as super Johannam fluvium. The Middle High German form Jonun is recorded 1243. The river name was likely adapted into Alemannic (Old High Geman) around the 8th century from a Gallo-Roman *Jauna as a weakly inflecting feminine *Jōna(n), yielding modern dialectal Jōne(n). In 1350, <span class="loc">Rapperswil</span> and its castle was widely destroyed by Rudolf Brun, and the Herrschaft <span class="loc">Rapperswil</span> – <span class="loc">Rapperswil</span> and some surrounding villages including <span class="loc">Jona</span> – was acquired by the Habsburg family. After 1803's Act of Mediation, <span class="loc">Rapperswil</span> and <span class="loc">Jona</span> joined the canton of St. <span class="loc">Gallen</span>, and the former Herrschaft <span class="loc">Rapperswil</span> was split into the municipalities <span class="loc">Rapperswil</span> and <span class="loc">Jona</span>. <span class="loc">Jona</span>, as municipality, was established in 1803 around the former boundaries of the <span class="loc">city of Rapperswil</span>, comprising the small rest of the former Herrschaft <span class="loc">Rapperswil</span> and the villages of <span class="loc">Bollingen</span>, <span class="loc">Busskirch</span>, Curtiberg, Kempraten-Lenggis, Wagen and Wurmsbach.</p>
