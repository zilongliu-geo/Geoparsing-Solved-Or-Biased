  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>, incorporated on <span class="date">July 9, 1902</span>, is a village in the towns of <span class="loc">Ramapo</span> and <span class="loc">Clarkstown</span> in <span class="loc">Rockland County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located north of Chestnut Ridge, <span class="loc">east of Airmont</span> and <span class="loc">Monsey</span>, south of <span class="loc">Hillcrest</span>, and west of <span class="loc">Nanuet</span>. The population was 31,347 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, making it the 2nd most populous community in <span class="loc">Rockland County</span>, after <span class="loc">New City</span>. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> spans the border of two towns, occupying an eastern portion of the town of <span class="loc">Ramapo</span> and a small western portion of the town of <span class="loc">Clarkstown</span>. The village is next to the <span class="loc">New York</span> State Thruway (Interstate 87) and is served by a <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Transit train station at the terminus of the Pascack Valley Line. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is 22 miles (35 km) north of Manhattan and 5 miles (8 km) north of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> border. Before the opening of the railroad, there were no homes in <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>. In <span class="date">1842</span>, the <span class="loc">New York</span> &amp; Erie Railroad called this part of the territory "Pascack", after a stream by the same name. The residents of the area decided to call the place <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> â€“ one certain large spring in the Valley Pond being responsible for the name. Prior to naming the territory <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>, it was called <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, named after their homeland, by Scotsmen who had settled in the area.</p><br><br>
