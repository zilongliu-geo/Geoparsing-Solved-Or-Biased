  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jamaica</span> (/dʒəˈmeɪkə/) is an island country situated in the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span>, consisting of the third-largest island of the <span class="loc">Greater Antilles</span>. The island, 10,990 square kilometres (4,240 sq mi) in area, lies about 145 kilometres (90 mi) south of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, and 191 kilometres (119 mi) west of <span class="loc">Hispaniola</span>, the island containing the nation-states of <span class="loc">Haiti</span> and the <span class="loc">Dominican Republic</span>. <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean. Previously inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Taíno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of <span class="per">Christopher Columbus</span> in <span class="date">1494</span>. Named Santiago, it remained a possession of <span class="loc">Spain</span> until <span class="date">1655</span>, when <span class="loc">England</span> (later <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>) conquered the island and renamed it <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>. Under British rule, <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> became a leading sugar exporter, with its plantation economy highly dependent on slaves imported from <span class="loc">Africa</span>, followed later by Chinese and Indian indentured labour. All slaves were fully emancipated in <span class="date">1838</span>, with independence from the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> achieved on <span class="date">6 August 1962</span>. With 2.8 million people, <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> is the third most populous Anglophone country in <span class="loc">the Americas</span> (after the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Canada</span>), and the fourth most populous country in the Caribbean. Kingston is the country's capital and largest city, with a population of 937,700. Jamaicans are of predominately African descent, with significant European, Chinese, Indian, and mixed-race minorities. Due to a high rate of emigration since <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> has a large diaspora around the world, particularly in <span class="loc">Canada</span>, the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, and the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p><br><br>
