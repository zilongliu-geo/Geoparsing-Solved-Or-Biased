<p><span class="loc">La Ribera</span> (Catalan pronunciation: [ɫə riˈβeɾə], 'The Shore') is one of the areas of the quarter of <span class="loc">Sant Pere</span>, <span class="loc">Santa Caterina</span> i la <span class="loc">Ribera</span> of Ciutat Vella ("the old city") of <span class="loc">Barcelona</span>. Many of the buildings date from late Medieval times. It was a well-to-do quarter during 13th–15th centuries, when it really was by the sea shore, and the area that today is named <span class="loc">Barceloneta</span> was still an island. Notable buildings are the Basilica de <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> del Mar and the palaces along Carrer de Montcada, including the Museu Picasso, the Museu Barbier-Mueller d'Art Precolombí, and part of the <span class="loc">Textile Museum</span>. Another place of interest is the Fossar de les Moreres, the site of a mass grave of Catalan soldiers fallen during the siege of 1714, which ended with the fall of <span class="loc">Barcelona</span> and the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Part of the quarter of <span class="loc">La Ribera</span> was demolished after the War of the Spanish Succession to build a military citadel to punish the defeated city. The lower section of the <span class="loc">La Ribera</span> district, just below Carrer de la Princesa, and leading to <span class="loc">Barceloneta</span> is referred to as El Born after the 19th century market on carrer del Comerç that dominates the area. This is one of the trendiest and most touristic districts in the old city. It is a popular place for expats and contains many art boutiques, bars and cafés.</p>
