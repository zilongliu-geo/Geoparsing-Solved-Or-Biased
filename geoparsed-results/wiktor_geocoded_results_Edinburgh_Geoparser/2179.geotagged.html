<p><span class="loc">Sharon</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Schoharie County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,843 at the 2000 census. The town is named after a location in <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, from where some early settlers came. The Town of <span class="loc">Sharon</span> is in the northwest corner of the county and is southwest of <span class="loc">Amsterdam</span>. The town was first settled around 1780. It was called "New Dorlach" from a location in <span class="loc">Germany</span> known to the early settlers while still in <span class="loc">Otsego County</span>. In 1781 during the American Revolution, a battle, the Battle of <span class="loc">Sharon</span>, was fought in the town between small contingents of Colonial forces and Tories. <span class="loc">Sharon</span> was created in 1797 from the Town of Schoharie during the early organization of <span class="loc">Schoharie County</span>. The opening of the <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal in 1825 reduced road traffic on a major east-west turnpike through the town, leading to the decline of several early communities. <span class="loc">Sharon</span> Springs set itself apart from the Town of <span class="loc">Sharon</span> in 1871 by incorporating as a village, and absorbed the neighboring community of <span class="loc">Rockville</span> during this process. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 39.2 square miles (102 km2), of which, 39.1 square miles (101 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) of it (0.23%) is water.</p>
