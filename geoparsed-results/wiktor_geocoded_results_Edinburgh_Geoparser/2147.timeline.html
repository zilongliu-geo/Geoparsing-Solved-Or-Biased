  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is a market town in <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is the main town in the <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> local government district and is a part of the <span class="loc">Mansfield Urban</span> Area. Nestling in a pocket within the <span class="loc">Maun</span> Valley surrounded by hills, the town is around 12 miles (19 km) north of <span class="loc">Nottingham</span>. The <span class="loc">district of Mansfield</span> is a largely urban area situated in the north west of <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span> populated by 99,600 residents, the vast majority of whom live in <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> (including <span class="loc">Mansfield Woodhouse</span>), with <span class="loc">Market Warsop</span> a secondary centre, and the remainder in the rural north of the district. Adjacent to the urban area of Sutton-in-Ashfield, <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is the only major sub-regional centre in <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span> covering an area of 30 square miles (78 sq km). The <span class="org">Centre for Cities</span> (<span class="date">2009</span>) categorises the town as a 'small city', although it does not officially hold city status. <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is the only local authority area in the county to have a directly elected Mayor and in <span class="date">October 2008</span> <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> elected its first Youth Mayor. Historically, the district has been influenced heavily by its industrial past with coal mining and textiles thriving in the district until their decline in <span class="date">the 1990s</span>, but in common with the national economy the area has seen the decline of these sectors. <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> has 20.2% (12,890) of its working age population seeking key out of work benefits (based on a 63,800 total working age population) (NOMIS).</p><br><br>
