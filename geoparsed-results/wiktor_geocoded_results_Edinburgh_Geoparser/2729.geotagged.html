<p>Columbia /kəˈlʌmbiə/ is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Boone County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Founded in 1820 as the county seat and home to the University of Missouri, it had a 2014 estimated population of 116,906, and it is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Columbia Metropolitan</span> Area, the state's fourth most populous metropolitan area. As a midwestern college town, the city has a reputation for progressive politics, public art, and powerful journalism. The tripartite establishment of Stephens College (1833), the University of Missouri (1839), and Columbia College (1851) has long made the city a center of education, culture, and athletic competition. These three schools surround Downtown Columbia on the east, south, and north; at the center is the Avenue of the Columns, which connects Francis Quadrangle and Jesse Hall to the <span class="loc">Boone County</span> Courthouse and the City Hall. Originally an agricultural town, the cultivation of the mind is Columbia's chief economic concern today. Never a major center of manufacturing, the city also depends on healthcare, insurance, and technology businesses. Several companies; such as Shelter Insurance, Carfax, and Slackers CDs and Games among them; were founded in the city. Cultural institutions include the State Historical Society of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, the Museum of Art and Archaeology, and the annual True/False Film Festival. The <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Tigers, the state's only major athletic program, play football at <span class="loc">Faurot</span> Field and basketball at Mizzou Arena as members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC).</p>
