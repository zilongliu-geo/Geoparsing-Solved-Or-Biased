<p>Warren is a city in <span class="loc">Warren County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located along the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> River. The population was 9,710 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Warren County</span>. It is home to the headquarters of the <span class="loc">Allegheny National Forest</span> and the Cornplanter State Forest. It is also the headquarters for the Chief Cornplanter Council, the oldest continuously chartered Boy Scouts of America Council, and the catalog company <span class="loc">Blair</span>. Warren is the principal city of the Warren, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. Warren was initially inhabited by Native Americans of the Seneca nation. French explorers had longstanding claims to the area which they acted to secure in an unambiguous fashion with a military-Amerindian expedition in 1749 that buried a succession of plaques claiming the territory as <span class="loc">France</span>'s in response to the formation of the colonial Ohio Company—and the first of these was buried in Warren but ultimately control was transferred to the British after the French and Indian War. After the Revolutionary War, General William Irvine and Andrew Ellicott were sent to the area to lay out a town in 1795. It was named after Major General Joseph Warren. The first permanent structure in Warren, a storehouse built by the Holland Land Company, was completed in 1796. Daniel McQuay of <span class="loc">Ireland</span> was the first permanent inhabitant of European descent. Lumber was the main industry from 1810–1840, as the abundance of wood and access to water made it profitable to float lumber down the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> River to <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>.</p>
