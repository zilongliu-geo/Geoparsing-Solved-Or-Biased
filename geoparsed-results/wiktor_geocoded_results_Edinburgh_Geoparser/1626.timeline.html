  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newport</span> is a residential suburb of the Moreton Bay Region at the north of the Redcliffe peninsula, approximately 29 kilometres (18 mi) north-northeast of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, the state capital of <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The suburb of <span class="loc">Newport</span> was gazetted as the Place Name Decision Notice (No 21) <span class="date">2008</span> in the <span class="loc">Queensland</span> Government Gazette â€“ Natural Resources and Water on <span class="date">August 15, 2008</span> (<span class="date">2008</span>-08-15), after a submission by the then <span class="loc">Redcliffe City</span> Council to the <span class="org">Queensland Government Department of Natural Resources</span> and Water in <span class="date">October 2006</span>. An earlier, unsuccessful attempt by the council to create the suburb was made in <span class="date">the 1990s</span>. Until <span class="date">2008</span>, <span class="loc">Newport</span> was made up of two areas - with that east of Albatross &amp; Walkers Creek Canal being <span class="loc">Scarborough</span>, and that on the western side being part of Kippa-Ring. Currently, new land is being cleared and canals being dug out to form the next stage of the suburb to the west of the current established area. The name <span class="loc">Newport</span> comes from the Newport Waterways housing estate that began development in <span class="date">the late 1970s</span>; the artificial canals first filled with water in <span class="date">1979</span>.</p><br><br>
