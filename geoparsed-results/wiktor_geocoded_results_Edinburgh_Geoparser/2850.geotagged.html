<p><span class="loc">Charleston</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Mississippi County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,947 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Mississippi County</span>. It is a home to a local correctional facility. <span class="loc">Charleston</span> is the biggest town on the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> side near the confluence of the <span class="loc">Mississippi River</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> at Bird's Point, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> (11 miles east on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 60). Its history has been tied to traffic on the rivers. Settlement initially occurred on the north side in what in 1805 was called <span class="loc">Matthews</span> Prairie. After purchasing 22.5 acres (91,000 m2) for $337, Joseph Moore laid out <span class="loc">Charleston</span> in 1837. It was named after <span class="loc">Charleston</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. In 1845 it was selected the county seat. On September 1, 1861, Confederate General M. Jeff Thompson robbed the Union Bank of Charleston. Thompson, who handed the cashier a note, gave the cashier an hour to get approval from superiors to give him keys to the vault. After receiving the money, he left a receipt for $57,000 and discovered later that only $56,000 was in the bags.</p>
