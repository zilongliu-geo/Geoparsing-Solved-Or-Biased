<p>Sidney is a city in <span class="loc">Shelby County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 21,229 at the 2010 census. It is named after English poet Sir Phillip Sidney and is the county seat of <span class="loc">Shelby County</span>. As well, many of the city's elementary schools are also named after famous writers, such as Emerson, <span class="loc">Longfellow</span> and <span class="loc">Whittier</span>. Sidney was the recipient of the 1964 <span class="loc">All-America City</span> Award. In 2009, it was the subject of the documentary film 45365. Sidney features some significant architecture for a small town, including the 1881 Second Empire courthouse; the 1877 Gothic revival Monumental Building, dedicated to the county's Civil War dead; the 1918 early-modern People's Federal Savings and Loan Association designed by influential architect Louis Sullivan, which has been designated a National Historic Landmark; and the "smallest house in Sidney" on Shelby Street. The Big Four Bridge is a local landmark that has carried rail traffic since 1923. CSX Transportation uses the rail line and bridge as part of the "NYC" division of Conrail, a direct descendant of the New York Central Railroad and Penn Central Transportation. CSX also operates the north-south rail line, which was better known in earlier years as the <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Railroad</span> and later as the Chessie System.</p>
