<p>Nanton is a town in <span class="loc">southern Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>.

It is located south of <span class="loc">Calgary</span>, at the junction of Highway 2 and Highway 533. Nanton was historically known as "Tap Town", after providing passing motorists with free water supplied from the foothills via a stand tap on the northbound highway. This water was one of this first to be bottled and sold in <span class="loc">Canada</span>, resulting in the creation of Nanton Water &amp; Soda Ltd, still a thriving business in the town today. Traditionally a farming and ranching community, Nanton is now a popular tourist destination.
