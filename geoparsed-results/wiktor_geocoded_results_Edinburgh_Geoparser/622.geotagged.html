<p><span class="loc">Belmont</span> is a southern suburb of Geelong, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The name means "beautiful hill". <span class="loc">Belmont</span> is geographically separated from the Geelong central business district by the <span class="loc">Barwon River</span>. The suburb is primarily residential, with some light industry along Barwon Heads Road. The suburb is part of the <span class="loc">City of Greater Geelong</span> local government area. At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Belmont</span> had a population of 13,616. The area has been inhabited by the Wathaurong people for at least 25,000 years. The first European to settle in the area was Dr. Alexander Thomson, later mayor of Geelong, who took up a pastoral run in 1836, and subsequent purchases of crown land were managed from his homestead 'Kardinia'. Early white settlement was hampered by the lack of a secure bridge over the <span class="loc">Barwon River</span>. The first wooden bridge opened early in 1848, and was tolled by the <span class="loc">South Barwon Road</span> Board. Four years later, on 23 May 1852, the bridge was swept away in a flood. From December that year a government punt operated at the site, and by late 1853 two government punts were used to form a pontoon bridge. In 1859 a secure iron bridge was opened as a replacement. By the mid-to-late 1850s a township had developed, with a general store and a number of pubs. The Post Office opened on 21 January 1860.</p>
