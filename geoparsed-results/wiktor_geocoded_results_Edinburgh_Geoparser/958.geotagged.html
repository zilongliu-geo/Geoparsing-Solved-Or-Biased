<p><span class="loc">Mari</span> (modern Tell <span class="loc">Hariri</span>), was an ancient <span class="loc">Semitic city</span> in <span class="loc">Syria</span>. Its remains constitute a tell located 11 kilometers north-west of <span class="loc">Abu Kamal</span> on the Euphrates river western bank, some 120 kilometers southeast of Deir ez-Zor. It flourished as a trade center and hegemonic state between 2900 BC and 1759 BC. As a purposely built city, the existence of <span class="loc">Mari</span> was related to its position in the middle of the Euphrates trade routes; this position made it an intermediary between <span class="loc">Sumer</span> in the south and the Levant in the west. <span class="loc">Mari</span> was first abandoned in the middle of the 26th century BC but was rebuilt and became the capital of a hegemonic East-Semitic state before 2500 BC. This second <span class="loc">Mari</span> engaged in a long war with its rival Ebla, and is known for its strong affinity with the Sumerian culture. It was destroyed in the 23rd century BC by the Akkadians who allowed the city to be rebuilt and appointed a military governor bearing the title of Shakkanakku (military governor). The governors later became independent with the rapid disintegration of the Akkadian empire and rebuilt the city as a regional center in the middle Euphrates valley. The Shakkanakkus ruled <span class="loc">Mari</span> until the second half of the 19th century BC when the dynasty collapsed for unknown reasons. A short time after the Shakkanakku collapse, <span class="loc">Mari</span> became the capital of the Amorite Lim dynasty. The Amorite Mari was short lived as it was annexed by <span class="loc">Babylonia</span> in c. 1761 BC, but the city survived as a small settlement under the rule of the Babylonians and the Assyrians before being abandoned and forgotten during the Hellenistic period.</p>
