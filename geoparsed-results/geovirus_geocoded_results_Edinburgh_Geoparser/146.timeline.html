  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Taco Bell</span> restaurants decided <span class="date">Wednesday</span> to remove green onions from all 5,800 of its continental <span class="loc">U.S.</span> stores after a <span class="date">November 29</span> outbreak of E.coli food poisonings caused the voluntary closing of 9 mid-Atlantic states stores and led health officials to investigate the chain's regional supplier. As many as 66 people reportedly became ill in New <span class="loc">York City</span>, <span class="loc">Long Island</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, and <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. The E.coli outbreak also caused <span class="org">Taco Bell</span> <span class="loc">Canada</span> to recall green onions from all 182 locations across <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Officials with the Canadian branch said <span class="date">Wednesday evening</span> that they would take precaution by removing green onions from all stores in <span class="loc">Canada</span> after hearing of the outbreak in the <span class="per">U.S. Jon Prinsell</span>, president of <span class="org">Yum</span>! <span class="loc">Canada</span>, which operates <span class="org">Taco Bell</span> <span class="loc">Canada</span> commented: As a precautionary voluntary measure, we have made the decision to take immediate action and remove green onions from all our restaurants in <span class="loc">Canada</span> until we know conclusively the root cause of the E. coli outbreak in the <span class="loc">U.S</span>. We are working closely with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency throughout this investigation. The <span class="org">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</span> are currently collecting samples of all non-meat items including cilantro, cheddar cheese, blended cheese, green onions, yellow onions, tomatoes, and lettuce. A man from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> became sick after eating at <span class="per">Taco Bell</span> and sued the owner of <span class="per">Taco Bell</span> headquarters in <span class="loc">Irvine</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. Another one includes a 11-year-old boy who ate at <span class="per">Taco Bell</span>, was hospitalized in <span class="loc">New York</span>, and also sued the owner. Most of the E. coli related sicknesses occurred in the northeast <span class="loc">USA</span>. No related sickness have occurred in <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Health officials investigating the source of the tainted green onions, also known as scallions, have traced the vegetable's food distribution chain to the <span class="loc">Texas</span> based <span class="loc">McLane</span> <span class="loc">Co.</span>, which in turn got them from <span class="loc">Irwindale</span> based Ready <span class="loc">Pac</span>. The scallions were grown by <span class="org">Boskovich Farms Inc.</span> of <span class="loc">Oxnard</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> said <span class="per">Steve Dickstein</span>, the marketing vice president for Ready <span class="loc">Pac</span>. At what point in the food distribution chain the scallions became tainted remains under investigation.</p><br><br>
