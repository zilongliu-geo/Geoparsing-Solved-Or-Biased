<p>Weston is a city in <span class="loc">Platte County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,641 at the 2010 census. Lewis and Clark Expedition camped out near the location of today's city hall. Weston was the oldest settlement in the <span class="loc">Platte Purchase</span> of 1836 and was therefore also the farthest western settlement (thus, "<span class="loc">West Town</span>") in the <span class="loc">United States</span> until the admission of <span class="loc">Texas</span> as a state in 1845. Another suggested origin is related to a story about a discharged US Army dragoon by the name of Joseph Moore. He bought the land and then had First Sergeant Tom Weston of D Company, First Dragoons, stationed at Fort Leavenworth across the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River, lay out a town plan. It is this individual the town is named for. William Buffalo Bill Cody was at one time a resident of Weston, and the town was a major "jumping off" point for the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail, the <span class="loc">Oregon Trail</span> and the <span class="loc">California Gold Rush</span>. Weston was at one time the second largest port on the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> river, surpassing both <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> and St. Joseph; however, a flood in 1881 shifted the river into an old channel some 2 miles away. In 1850 over 265 steamboats a year docked at the Port of Weston.</p>
