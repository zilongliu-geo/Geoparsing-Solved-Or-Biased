<p><span class="loc">Clovis</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Curry County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with a population of 37,775 as of the 2010 census, and a 2014 estimated population of 39,860. <span class="loc">Clovis</span> is located in the <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> portion of the <span class="loc">Llano Estacado</span>, in the eastern part of the state. A largely agricultural community, closely bordering <span class="loc">Texas</span>, it is noted for its role in early rock music history and for nearby <span class="loc">Cannon Air Force Base</span>. After the discovery of several Clovis sites in eastern <span class="loc">North America</span> in the 1930s, the Clovis people came to be regarded as the first human inhabitants who created a widespread culture in the <span class="loc">New World</span>. Clovis people are considered to be the ancestors of most of the indigenous cultures of <span class="loc">the Americas</span>. The <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span>, &amp; Santa Fe Railway system helped to establish <span class="loc">Clovis</span> over a hundred years ago, and for that railroad and its successor BNSF Railway continues to be a major hub of operations. Also notable is the Southwest Cheese Company, the largest cheddar cheese producer in <span class="loc">North America</span>. It is the principal city of the Clovis Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the larger Clovis-Portales Combined Statistical Area.</p>
