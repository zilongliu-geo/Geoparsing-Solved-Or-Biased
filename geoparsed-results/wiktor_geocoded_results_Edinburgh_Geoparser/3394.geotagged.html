<p><span class="loc">Campinas</span> (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɐ̃ˈpinɐs], Plains or Meadows) is a Brazilian municipality in São Paulo State, part of the country's Southeast Region. According to the 2010 Census, the city's population is 1,080,999, making it the fourteenth most populous Brazilian city and the third most populous municipality in São Paulo state. The city's metropolitan area, Metropolitan Region of <span class="loc">Campinas</span>, contains twenty municipalities with a total population of 2,976,433 people. The city is home to the University of Campinas, one of the most prestigious in Latin <span class="loc">America</span>. <span class="loc">Campinas</span> means grass fields in Portuguese and refers to its characteristic landscape, which originally comprised large stretches of dense subtropical forests (mato grosso or thick woods in Portuguese), mainly along the many rivers, interspersed with gently rolling hills covered by low-lying vegetation. <span class="loc">Campinas</span>' official crest and flag has a picture of the mythical bird, the phoenix, because it was practically reborn after a devastating epidemic of yellow fever in the 1800s, which killed more than 25% of the city's inhabitants. The city was founded on July 14, 1774, by Barreto Leme. It was initially a simple outpost on the way to <span class="loc">Minas Gerais</span> and Goiás serving the "Bandeirantes" who were in search of precious minerals and Indian slaves. In the first half of the 19th century, <span class="loc">Campinas</span> became a growing population center, with many coffee, cotton and sugarcane farms.</p>
