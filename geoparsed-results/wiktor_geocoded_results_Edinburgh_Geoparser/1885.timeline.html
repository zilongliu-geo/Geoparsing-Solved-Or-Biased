  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Salisbury</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Chariton County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,618 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The land where <span class="per">Salisbury</span> is <span class="date">now</span> located was first owned by Prior <span class="loc">Bibo</span>, a veteran of the War of <span class="date">1812</span>, in the late 1820s. A tract of 320 acres was granted to <span class="loc">Bibo</span> by the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> government as a bonus for his military service. Following two intermediate owners, the land was sold for $400 to <span class="per">Judge Lucius Salisbury</span> in <span class="date">1856</span>. He had surveyors lay out the town plat in <span class="date">1857</span>, and the town was founded on <span class="date">April 1, 1867</span>. The city has had a post office since <span class="date">1863</span>, when <span class="per">Judge Salisbury</span> opened it in his home. He also ran the stagecoach stop from his business, known as "Shop-A-While." By the <span class="date">1870</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, <span class="per">Salisbury</span>'s population was 626. Just <span class="date">two years later</span> the town was struck by a large tornado. Major fires damaged much of the business district in <span class="date">1877</span> and again in <span class="date">1882</span>. On <span class="date">April 4, 1882</span>, <span class="per">Salisbury</span> was organized and chartered as a fourth-class city under <span class="loc">Missouri</span> laws.</p><br><br>
