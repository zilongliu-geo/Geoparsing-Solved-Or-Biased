<p>Olinda is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 36 km east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>'s central business district. Its local government area is the Shire of Yarra Ranges. At the 2006 Census, Olinda had a population of 1568. Olinda is named after <span class="loc">Olinda Creek</span>, which begins in the township. The creek was named in 1858 after Alice Olinda Hodgkinson, the daughter of Clement Hodgkinson, Victoria's acting Surveyor General. The town was initially a logging settlement, however as land was made available for horticulture in the early 1900s, the town began to grow substantially. The Post Office opened on 21 August 1901. Berry farming, dairying, and flower growing became prosperous industries, and tourism soon flourished as the principal industry of Olinda. In 1919 the Australian artist Sir Arthur Streeton returned to <span class="loc">Australia</span> and built a house on the property called Longacres, in Olinda. Olinda is home to cafes, restaurants, antique and craft shops, and numerous art galleries, showcasing local, national, and international artists in such areas as sculpture and painting. It has a public swimming pool, a primary school, and is home to the National Rhododendron Garden and the Olinda State Forest. The Ashendene Boys Home was located in Olinda.</p>
