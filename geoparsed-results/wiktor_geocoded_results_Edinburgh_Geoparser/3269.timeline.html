  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Honghu</span> (Chinese: 洪湖; pinyin: Hónghú) is a county-level city in the municipal region of <span class="loc">Jingzhou</span>, in the south of <span class="loc">Hubei</span> province, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. The city lies on the northwest (left) bank of the <span class="loc">Yangtze River</span>, across from <span class="loc">Hunan Province</span> and <span class="loc">Xianning</span>, <span class="loc">Hubei</span>. It is named after the adjacent <span class="per">Hong Lake</span>, which since ancient times has periodically flooded. The traditional Chinese holiday Duanwu Jie (端午节, <span class="date">Dragon Boat Festival</span>), celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, features boat races which are run on <span class="per">Hong Lake</span>. By means of its famous lake, <span class="loc">Honghu City</span> produces forty kinds of fish and an abundance of plants, such as lotus, reed and a type of black algae. As of <span class="date">2000</span>, <span class="loc">Honghu City</span> had a population of 335,618 or more people. <span class="loc">Honghu</span> is celebrated as an important supporter of the Communist side during <span class="date">last century</span>'s Chinese Civil War. Westerners know it for <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> communist <span class="per">Rewi Alley</span>'s relief work and Gung-ho (共合, <span class="loc">Gonghe</span>) co-operative movement. <span class="loc">Honghu</span> and other regions around its lake were part of an important communist stronghold called the Hunan-Western <span class="loc">Hubei</span> Revolutionary Base Area (湘鄂西革命根据地, Xiang-Exi Geming Genjudi, also called the Hunan-Western <span class="loc">Hubei</span> Soviet, 湘鄂西苏维埃, Xiang-Exi Suweiai). The Hunan-Western <span class="loc">Hubei</span> Soviet was actually a collection of several isolated bases linked together by underground and guerrilla activities. The <span class="loc">Honghu</span> Base, the largest, was itself the object of four Encirclement Campaigns, the last of which was strategised as one stage of the broadly successful Encirclement Campaign against Hunan-Western <span class="loc">Hubei</span> Soviet.</p><br><br>
