<p><span class="loc">Lewiston</span> is a city in north central <span class="loc">Idaho</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Nez</span> <span class="loc">Perce County</span>. It is the second-largest city in the <span class="loc">northern Idaho region</span>, behind Coeur d'Alene, and ninth-largest in the state. <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Lewiston</span>, <span class="loc">ID</span> - <span class="loc">Clarkston</span>, <span class="loc">WA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of <span class="loc">Nez</span> <span class="loc">Perce County</span> and <span class="loc">Asotin County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population of <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> was 31,894, up from 30,904 in 2000. <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> is located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Snake River</span> and <span class="loc">Clearwater River</span>, thirty miles (50 km) southeast of the Lower Granite Dam. Because of dams (and their locks) on the Snake and <span class="loc">Columbia River</span>, <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> is reachable by some ocean-going vessels. The Port of <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> (Idaho's only seaport) has the distinction of being the farthest inland port east of the West Coast of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The Lewiston-Nez <span class="loc">Perce County</span> Airport serves the city by air. <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> was founded 155 years ago in 1861 in the wake of a gold rush which began the previous year near Pierce, northeast of <span class="loc">Lewiston</span>. In 1863, <span class="loc">Lewiston</span> became the first capital of the newly created Idaho Territory. Its stint as seat of the new territory's government was short-lived, as a resolution to have the capital moved south to <span class="loc">Boise</span> was passed by the Idaho Territorial Legislature on December 7, 1864.</p>
