<p>Brooklyn is a town in <span class="loc">Windham County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,173 at the 2000 census. The town center village is listed by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place. The district of <span class="loc">East Brooklyn</span> is also listed as a separate census-designated place. Settled in the 17th century and incorporated as its own town in 1786, Brooklyn is now one of the fastest growing towns in <span class="loc">Windham County</span>. It is home to the <span class="loc">Brooklyn Fair</span>, <span class="loc">America</span>'s oldest continuously operating agricultural fair, as well as the Brooklyn Correctional Institution, a state-run medium security prison. Brooklyn is the final resting place of Revolutionary War General Israel Putnam. Though he was originally buried in an above ground tomb in Brooklyn's South Cemetery, his remains had to be moved due to excessive visitors. In 1888, a statue of Putnam mounted on a horse was erected, and his sarcophagus placed in the foundation. The statue stands slightly south of the town green, in front of the post office. Brooklyn is also home of the Middle School Bobcats and Elementary School Bears.</p>
