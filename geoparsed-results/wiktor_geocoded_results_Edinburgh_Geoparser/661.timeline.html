  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Arlington</span> is a former town in <span class="loc">western Phelps County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along a county road that was once <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66. The town found its prosperity in the mid-19th century. Located near <span class="loc">Rolla</span> on the <span class="loc">Ozark</span> Plateau, the only remaining business at <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was a caravan park that closed permanently in <span class="date">2008</span>. <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was originally called Little Piney. It was manned at times by troops form the 5th <span class="loc">Missouri</span> State Militia Cavalry. Originally settled by <span class="per">Thomas Harrison</span> and <span class="per">James Harrison</span> and later established as a township by <span class="per">General Fremont</span> circa-1867, the town was renamed for the former <span class="per">Robert E. Lee</span> plantation (later a cemetery) at <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was once a popular resort served by the Pacific Railroad. Located on the last section of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66 in <span class="loc">Missouri</span> to be paved in <span class="date">1931</span>, the tiny community served fishermen on the <span class="loc">Gasconade</span> and Little Piney Rivers. Stony Dell Resort capitalised on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66 and the nearby Fort <span class="per">Leonard Wood</span> military base to grow in <span class="date">the 1930s and early 1940s</span> from a small group of tourist cabins to a popular oasis which included a stream-fed swimming pool, a restaurant, service station and bus stop, offering tennis, dancing, boating and fishing.</p><br><br>
