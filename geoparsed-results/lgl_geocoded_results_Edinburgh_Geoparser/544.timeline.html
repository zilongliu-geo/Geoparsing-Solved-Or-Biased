  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Fire damages <span class="per">N.W. Rochester</span> house; two dogs injured. Fire damaged a two-story house at 3537 Seventh Street Northwest tonight. The lone occupant of the house, an adult woman, evacuated safely, but two dogs in the basement had to be rescued, and their condition was questionable due to smoke inhilation, according to <span class="per">Rochester</span> Fire Department <span class="per">Capt. Mark Keefe</span>. The dogs were taken immediately to a vet clinic. Firefighters found one of the dogs under a bed, and the other in a kennel. The dogs had nearly lost consciousness, and "the guys said they looked like rag dolls when they took them out," <span class="per">Keefe</span> said. Firefighters gave the dogs oxygen once they had cleared the house, and they began to breathe better. The dogs appeared to be black cocker spaniels, a firefighter said. The fire was reported at 9:00. The occupant was out of the house when firefighters arrived. Flames were showing in the basement, and were knocked down in about 10 minutes, <span class="per">Keefe</span> said. Much of the house was damaged by smoke and water. The fire appears to have begun in the laundry room, <span class="per">Keefe</span> said. The cause is under investigation. Firefighters mop up after dousing a fire in the basement of this house at 3537 Seventh Street N.W. <span class="date">late Tuesday night</span>.</p><br><br>
