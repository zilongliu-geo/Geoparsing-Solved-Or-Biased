  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Plymouth</span> was the capital of the island of <span class="loc">Montserrat</span>, an overseas territory of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> located in the <span class="loc">Leeward Island</span> chain of the <span class="loc">Lesser Antilles</span>, <span class="loc">West Indies</span>. Constructed on historical lava deposits near the (then inactive) <span class="loc">Soufriere Hills</span> volcano, the town was evacuated when the volcano resumed erupting in <span class="date">1995</span>, and was abandoned permanently in <span class="date">1997</span> after it was burnt and mostly buried by a series of pyroclastic flows and lahars. For <span class="date">centuries</span> it had been the only port of entry to the island. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is still de jure the capital of <span class="loc">Montserrat</span>, giving it the unusual distinction of being the only ghost town which is the capital of a political territory. Beginning in <span class="date">July 1995</span>, a series of huge eruptions at the Soufri√®re Hills volcano sent pyroclastic flows and ash falls across a wide area of southern <span class="loc">Montserrat</span> including the capital, <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>. It was immediately clear that the city was in grave danger; on <span class="date">21 August 1995</span>, tephra fell on <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, and in <span class="date">December</span> residents were evacuated as a precaution. Residents were allowed back <span class="date">a few months later</span> but on <span class="date">25 June 1997</span>, a massive eruption produced pyroclastic surges that killed 19 people and reached nearly to the island's airport on the eastern side of the island. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> was again evacuated.</p><br><br>
