<p><span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> (/rioʊɡrʌndeɪ/) is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) located within Middle Township in Cape <span class="loc">May County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Though located within Middle Township, a small section at the southern edge of the community, located in Lower Township, is sometimes called <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>. It is part of the Ocean City Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the CDP's population was 2,670. According to Jeffrey M. Dorwart, <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> is a community which was founded in the mid-nineteenth century around a country store owned by the Hildreth family. The community was originally called <span class="loc">Hildreth</span> for that reason. (p. 102) George F. Boyer and J. Pearson Cunningham explain that, during the colonial period, Aaron Leaming, the <span class="loc">Hildreths</span> and the Cresses had plantations in that area. Where the King's Highway crossed the road coming from <span class="loc">Dennisville</span> and <span class="loc">Goshen</span> a stage coach terminal was set up, and the spot became the center for trade for the local farming families. Boyer and Cunningham say that the area was known as "Leamings," for the prominent landholders, or as "Hildreth," the family who ran the local store. (p. 121-122) They continue, "The name, <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>, was suggested by the seventh Aaron Leaming who thought this southern <span class="loc">United States</span> river had an attractive sound."</p>
