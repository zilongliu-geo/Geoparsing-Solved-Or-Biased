<p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 172,331. The county seat is <span class="loc">Clarksville</span>. The county was created in 1836. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Clarksville</span>, <span class="loc">TNâ€“KY Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The county was named for John Montgomery, a soldier in the American Revolutionary War and an early settler who founded the <span class="loc">city of Clarksville</span>. It was formed when <span class="loc">Tennessee County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, was split in 1796, when <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> became a state, to reduce confusion. The same year, much of the eastern portion of the county was combined with land taken from <span class="loc">Sumner County</span> to form <span class="loc">Robertson County</span>. Later acts of the Tennessee General Assembly further reduced the county to its current size and boundaries by 1871. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> was the site of several early saltpeter mines. <span class="loc">Saltpeter</span> is the main ingredient of gunpowder and was obtained by leaching the earth from several local caves. <span class="loc">Bellamy</span> Cave, located near <span class="loc">Stringtown</span>, still contains the remains of two dozen saltpeter leaching vats and apparently was a large operation. Cooper Creek Cave also shows evidence of extensive mining and contains the remains of "many saltpeter hoppers". Both were probably mined during the War of 1812. <span class="loc">Dunbar Cave</span> is reported to have been mined for saltpeter during the Mexican War, but commercial development has destroyed any evidence of this. Little mining is likely to have happened here during the Civil War, since the Union Army captured this part of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> in early 1862.</p>
