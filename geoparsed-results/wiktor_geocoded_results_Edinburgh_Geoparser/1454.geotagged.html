<p>Rochester is a city in <span class="loc">Strafford County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 29,752. The city includes the villages of <span class="loc">East Rochester</span> and <span class="loc">Gonic</span>. Rochester is home to Skyhaven Airport and the annual Rochester Fair. Rochester was once inhabited by Abenaki Indians of the Pennacook tribe. They fished, hunted and farmed, moving locations when their agriculture exhausted the soil for growing pumpkins, squash, beans and maize. <span class="loc">Gonic</span> was called Squanamagonic, meaning "the water of the clay place hill." The town was one of four granted by Colonial Governor Samuel Shute of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> during his brief term. Incorporated in 1722, it was named for his close friend, Laurence Hyde, Earl of Rochester and brother-in-law to King James II. As was customary, tall white pine trees were reserved for use as masts by the Royal Navy. But hostility with the Abenaki delayed settlement until 1728, although attacks would continue until 1748. Early dwellings clustered together for protection, beginning near <span class="loc">Haven Hill</span>. Due to warfare or disease, after 1749 Native American numbers dwindled, although many descendants remain in or around Rochester communities. The community at that time included <span class="loc">Farmington</span>, which would be incorporated in 1798, and Milton, in 1802.</p>
