  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Police shooting in <span class="loc">North Las Vegas</span> ruled justifiable. A coroner's inquest ruled <span class="date">today</span> that the fatal police shooting of Tyrise M. Bell on <span class="date">Jan. 23</span> in <span class="loc">North Las Vegas</span> was justified. <span class="loc">North Las</span> Vegas Police Officer Michael Eggers shot Bell as the two struggled over a 9mm Beretta handgun Bell pulled from inside his pants. The deadly confrontation between <span class="per">Bell</span> and <span class="per">Eggers</span> came at the end of a foot chase after Bell ran from the officer near the intersection of Revere Street and Ann Road. Eggers, dressed in full police uniform and driving a marked police car with overhead lights activated, tried to stop Bell and another man for jaywalking. The other man has not been identified. The men ran in opposite directions and the other officer chased Bell. Bell ran through two business parking lots and jumped two walls before turning on the officer and striking him in the face with his fist, according to testimony at the inquest. Eggers tackled Bell and a violent fight ensued that tired both men, already exhausted after a run of more than 100 yards. Bell removed a handgun from his pants as Eggers tried to get hold of Bell's hands in the darkness. Feeling the gun, <span class="per">Officer Eggers</span> grabbed it by the top front, just over the barrel. The two fought for control of the weapon before Eggers, beginning to fear he would lose the fight and his life, drew his own gun. <span class="per">Officer Eggers</span> gave commands for Bell to let go of the gun, pressed his own weapon into Bell's back and when that did not stop Bell, Eggers fired five shots, four of which struck Bell. <span class="per">Eggers</span> said he fired until he felt Bell's hand on the gun go limp. Eggers had <span class="date">16 months</span> experience with the <span class="loc">North Las</span> <span class="org">Vegas Police Department</span> at the time of the shooting and, prior to that, <span class="date">five years</span>' experience as a <span class="loc">Las</span> <span class="loc">Vegas City</span> Marshal.</p><br><br>
