  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Madison</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Carroll County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,502 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Madison</span> includes the village of <span class="loc">Silver Lake</span>. This area was one of the first to have land grants set aside for soldiers who had survived the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span>. The land covered by these grants, parts of <span class="loc">Eaton</span> and <span class="loc">Albany</span>, was incorporated in <span class="date">1852</span> as "<span class="per">Madison</span>," in honor of President <span class="per">James Madison</span>, who was born <span class="date">100 years earlier</span>. The town is home to the <span class="loc">Madison Boulder</span> (43°55′52″N 71°10′04″W), the largest known glacial erratic in <span class="loc">New England</span>, and among the largest in the world. <span class="loc">Madison Boulder</span> is a huge granite rock measuring 83 feet (25 m) in length, 23 feet (7.0 m) in height above the ground, and 37 feet (11 m) in width. It weighs upwards of 5,000 tons. A part of this roughly rectangular block is buried, probably to a depth of ten to twelve feet. It is located at a state park in the northwest part of town.</p><br><br>
