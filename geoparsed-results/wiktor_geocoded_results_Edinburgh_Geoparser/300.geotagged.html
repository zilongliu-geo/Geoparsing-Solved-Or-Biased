<p>Trinidad is a neighborhood located in Ward 5, in the northeast quadrant of <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span> and is a largely residential area. Trinidad is bounded to the north by Mt. Olivet Road, to the west by West Virginia Avenue, to the south by Florida Avenue, and to the east by Bladensburg Road. To the north of <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> is the more industrial (and impoverished) neighborhood <span class="loc">Ivy City</span>. To the west is Gallaudet University and the Florida Market (D.C.'s wholesale food district, also called the Capital <span class="loc">City Market</span>). To the east lies Carver <span class="loc">Langston</span>. To the south of <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> is <span class="loc">Old City</span>, so named because it was part of <span class="loc">Pierre</span> <span class="loc">L</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">Enfant</span>'s original plan for the city, and generally referred to as either Near Northeast or <span class="loc">Capitol</span> Hill North. Located immediately south of <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> is the H Street Corridor. The eastern portion of the H Street Corridor is sometimes referred to as the Atlas District, part of a neighborhood branding campaign centered on the revitalized Atlas Theater, now called the Atlas Performing Arts Center. The area got its name from 19th century speculator James Barry, who had once lived on the Caribbean island. A street in the neighborhood bears the name of Trinidad Place, N.E.</p>
