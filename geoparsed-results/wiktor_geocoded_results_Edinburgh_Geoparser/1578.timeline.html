Hayastani Hanrapetut’yun), is a sovereign state in the <span class="loc">South Caucasus region</span> of <span class="loc">Eurasia</span>. Located in Western <span class="loc">Asia</span>, it is bordered by <span class="loc">Turkey</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Georgia</span> to the north, the de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and <span class="loc">Azerbaijan</span> to the east, and <span class="loc">Iran</span> and the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. <span class="loc">Armenia</span> is a unitary, multi-party, democratic nation-state with an ancient cultural heritage. <span class="org">The Kingdom of Van</span> was established in <span class="date">860 BC</span> and by the <span class="date">6th century BC</span> it was replaced by the Satrapy of <span class="loc">Armenia</span>. In the <span class="date">1st century BC</span> the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Armenia</span> reached its height under Tigranes the Great. <span class="loc">Armenia</span> became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion.
