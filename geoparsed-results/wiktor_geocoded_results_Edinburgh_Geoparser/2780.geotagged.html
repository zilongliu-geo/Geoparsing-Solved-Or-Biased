<p><span class="loc">New Brighton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ramsey County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a suburb of the <span class="loc">Twin Cities</span>. The population was 21,456 at the 2010 census. In the 18th century, Mdewakanton Dakota tribes lived in the vicinity of <span class="loc">New Brighton</span>'s marshy lakes, harvesting wild rice. The Dakota eventually settled a village near <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> at <span class="loc">Rice Creek</span> and a smaller encampment just east of Silver Lake Road on 3rd Street NW. Immigrants from <span class="loc">Britain</span> and <span class="loc">France</span> settled a small village in 1858 which included a general store, school and mission church. As railroads were established in the area, millers in <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span> formed the Minneapolis Stockyards and Packing Company in 1888. The company supplied home, agriculture, and business needs. The venture included Minneapolis figures such as streetcar magnate Thomas Lowry, flour millers John Sargent <span class="loc">Pillsbury</span>, Senator William D. Washburn, ex-Minneapolis Mayor W.H. <span class="loc">Eustis</span>, and industrialist W.H. Dunwoody. As the village grew in prominence, it was incorporated on January 20, 1891. The city was given the name <span class="loc">Brighton</span> after <span class="loc">Brighton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The founding population was primarily English-American. Each August, a city festival celebrates this heritage, called the Stockyard Days and is held at Long Lake Park.</p>
