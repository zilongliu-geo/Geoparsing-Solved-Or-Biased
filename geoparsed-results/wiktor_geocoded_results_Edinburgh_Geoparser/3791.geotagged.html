<p><span class="loc">Peterborough</span> (/ˈpiːtərˌbᵊrəˌ -ˌbʌ-/) is a cathedral city and unitary authority area in the East of <span class="loc">England</span>, with a population estimated to be 184,500 in mid–2011. Historically part of <span class="loc">Northamptonshire</span>, for ceremonial purposes it now falls within the <span class="loc">county of Cambridgeshire</span>. Situated 75 miles (121 km) north of <span class="loc">London</span>, the city stands on the <span class="loc">River Nene</span> which flows into the <span class="loc">North Sea</span> approximately 30 miles (48 km) to the north-east. The railway station is an important stop on the East Coast Main Line between <span class="loc">London</span> and <span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>. The unitary authority borders <span class="loc">Northamptonshire</span> and <span class="loc">Rutland</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span> to the north, and non-metropolitan <span class="loc">Cambridgeshire</span> to the south and east. The local topography is flat and in some places lies below sea level, for example in the Fens that lie to the east of <span class="loc">Peterborough</span>. Human settlement in the area began before the Bronze Age, as can be seen at the <span class="loc">Flag Fen</span> archaeological site to the east of the current city centre also with evidence of Roman occupation. The Anglo-Saxon period saw the establishment of a monastery, Medeshamstede, which later became <span class="loc">Peterborough</span> Cathedral.</p>
