<p>Picton is a town in the <span class="loc">Marlborough Region</span> of <span class="loc">New</span> <span class="loc">Zealand</span>'s <span class="loc">South Island</span>. The town is located near the head of the <span class="loc">Queen Charlotte Sound</span>, 25 km (16 mi) north of <span class="loc">Blenheim</span> and 65 km (40 mi) west of Wellington. <span class="loc">Waikawa</span> lies just north-east of Picton, and is often considered to be contiguous part of Picton. Picton is a major hub in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>'s transport network, connecting the <span class="loc">South Island</span> road and rail network with ferries across <span class="loc">Cook Strait</span> to Wellington and the <span class="loc">North Island</span>. The town has a population of 4,330  (June 2015 estimate), making it the second-largest town in the <span class="loc">Marlborough Region</span> behind <span class="loc">Blenheim</span>. It is the easternmost town in the <span class="loc">South Island</span> with a population of at least 1,000 people. The town is named after Sir Thomas Picton, the Welsh military associate of the Duke of Wellington, who was killed at the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. The Main North railway line and State Highway 1 link Picton southwards to <span class="loc">Blenheim</span>, <span class="loc">Kaikoura</span>, <span class="loc">Christchurch</span> and beyond, while the scenic Queen Charlotte Drive (shorter in distance but usually slower than State Highway 1/State Highway 6 via <span class="loc">Rapaura</span>, near <span class="loc">Blenheim</span>) winds westward to <span class="loc">Havelock</span>. The completion of the highway link ended the relative isolation of this scenic area in the 1950s and encouraged modern motels, beginning with the American Luxury Motels, and many more after the ferry service to Wellington began.</p>
