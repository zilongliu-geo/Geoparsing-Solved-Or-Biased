<p><span class="loc">Bondo</span> (Romansh:  Buond ) is a former municipality in the <span class="loc">district of Maloja</span> in the Swiss canton of Graubünden. It is now part of the municipality of Bregaglia. The municipality is located near the Swiss–Italian border south of the <span class="loc">Mera River</span> in the <span class="loc">Val Bregaglia</span> (known as <span class="loc">Bergell</span> in German). It is located in the Bergell sub-district of the <span class="loc">Maloja district</span>. The valley floor is so deep that parts of the village do not receive any sunlight in winter. The Val Bondasca leads up from <span class="loc">Bondo</span> to <span class="loc">Piz</span> Badile and Piz Cengalo, two peaks of the Bregaglia Range. The municipality of <span class="loc">Bondo</span> also includes the smaller village of <span class="loc">Promontogno</span> and, above that on a rocky outcrop, the ruins of Castelmur fort. Additionally there are several abandoned settlements. <span class="loc">Bondo</span> has an area, as of 2006, of 28.2 km2 (10.9 sq mi). Of this area, 2.5% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 0.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (59.3%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).</p>
