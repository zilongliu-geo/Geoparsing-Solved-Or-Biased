  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Frankfort</span> is a village in <span class="per">Will</span> and <span class="per">Cook</span> counties, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 17,782 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 10,391 in <span class="date">2000</span>. According to Forbes.com, in <span class="date">2007</span> the village ranked as the 36th fastest growing suburb in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The name "<span class="loc">Frankfort</span>" was taken from <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> Township as designated by the governing board of <span class="loc">Will County</span>. It was commonly known as "<span class="loc">Frankfort</span> Station" after the opening of the <span class="loc">Joliet</span> &amp; Northern <span class="loc">Indiana Railroad</span> through the township in <span class="date">1855</span>, though the official plat of the community dated <span class="date">March 1855</span> shows the name as "<span class="loc">Frankfort</span>". Property deed abstracts and railroad documents also show that the name was always <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>. Local residents incorporated <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> as a village in <span class="date">1879</span>. First inhabited by Native Americans, including the <span class="per">Potawatomi</span> and <span class="per">Sac</span> and Fox tribes, <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> was used as a conduit between the <span class="loc">Des Plaines</span> and <span class="per">St. Joseph</span> rivers. Originally, the area was part of the Virginia Territory before the French signed a treaty with Manitoqua, the <span class="per">Potawatomi</span> chief, for land in the <span class="loc">Prestwick</span> area. The first pioneers came to <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> in the early 1830s by means of the <span class="loc">Des Plaines</span> River from the southwest and by wagon from the east along the <span class="loc">Sauk</span> Trail, a roadway that still exists <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
