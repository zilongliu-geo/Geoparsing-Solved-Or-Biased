  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Knox County</span> is a county located in <span class="loc">Indiana</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was one of two original counties created in the old Northwest Territory in <span class="date">1790</span> and was reduced to its present size in <span class="date">1817</span>. As of <span class="date">2010</span>, the population was 38,440. The county seat is <span class="loc">Vincennes</span>. In <span class="date">1790</span>, <span class="per">Winthrop Sargent</span>, Secretary of Northwest Territory, organized the first <span class="loc">Indiana county</span>, <span class="loc">Knox County</span>. It was named for Major General <span class="per">Henry Knox</span>, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Secretary of War. <span class="loc">Knox County</span> was one of the original counties of the Northwest Territory and was created prior to the formation of the <span class="loc">Indiana</span> Territory. When it was created, <span class="loc">Knox County</span> extended to <span class="loc">Canada</span> and encompassed all or part of the present states of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, and <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. When the <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Territory was formed in <span class="date">1809</span>, the portions of <span class="loc">Knox County</span> beyond the <span class="loc">Wabash</span> River became a part of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. Many of <span class="per">Knox</span> Country townships and lots were surveyed with the French system, which goes towards non-cardinal compass points. <span class="per">Knox</span> and <span class="per">Clark</span> counties are the only ones laid out in this fashion. The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, and by the <span class="loc">Indiana</span> Code.</p><br><br>
