<p>Basement fire kills man, 84, in <span class="loc">Scottdale</span>. A house fire in <span class="loc">Scottdale</span> was put out so quickly yesterday that fire Chief L. "Buzz" Myers and other firefighters did not expect any victims until they found the body of an elderly homeowner in the basement. The body of James Marth Sr., 84, was found in a space beneath the first-floor kitchen. He had been lying near where the blaze started sometime before 11 a.m. One neighbor said Mr. Marth's son, who was at work when he was notified of the fire at the <span class="loc">Broadway</span> Street house he shared with his father, had been hopeful as he rushed to the scene. His father had been a fixture on the bicycle trail that runs through <span class="loc">Scottdale</span>. "He spent all of his time on the bike trail," Chief Myers said. The fire chief said he would not have been surprised if Mr. Marsh Sr. was not at home when the fire started. Because of dense fog that lingered into the late morning yesterday, many residents in the vicinity of the Marsh home reported that they smelled smoke, but none reported the fire until the smoke plumes became more visible. The house, in the 400 block of <span class="loc">Broadway</span>, sits across the street and the railroad tracks from the town's municipal building and a stone's throw from the local ambulance and police stations. Within five minutes of arriving, firefighters had searched the upstairs bedrooms while hoses doused the flames. The fire nearly was out when they found Mr. Marth in the basement, the chief said. The cause of the fire does not appear to have been suspicious, though a state police fire marshal was at the scene investigating.</p>
