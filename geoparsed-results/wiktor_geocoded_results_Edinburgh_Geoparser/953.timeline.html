  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> is a green and hilly inner-southern suburb of the South Australian capital <span class="loc">city of Adelaide</span>. It is located in the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges, around 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south-east of the <span class="loc">Adelaide city</span> centre. The suburb is part of the hills-face zone, with sweeping views over the Adelaide plains. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is an affluent area containing many of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>'s most valuable residential properties. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is bounded to the North by the suburbs of <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> and <span class="loc">Netherby</span>, to the west by <span class="loc">Torrens Park</span> and <span class="loc">Mitcham</span>, to the south by <span class="per">Mitcham</span> and <span class="per">Brown</span> <span class="loc">Hill Creek</span>, and to the east by <span class="loc">Leawood</span> <span class="per">Gardens</span> and <span class="per">Urrbrae</span>. Situated on the east side of the <span class="loc">Mitcham district</span>, the land was first purchased from the crown in <span class="date">1841</span> by <span class="per">Richard F. Newland</span>, manager of the <span class="org">Bank of Australasia</span>. By <span class="date">1870</span>, Charles B. Hardy was making extensive additions to a residence named "Springfield", laying out extensive gardens and adding to the acreage of the estate. <span class="date">Fifty years ago</span>, the area was purchased from <span class="per">Mr. Frank Rymill</span> by <span class="org">Springfield Limited</span> which boasted a subdivisional design "entirely different from any previous scheme or organised suburban development in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>".</p><br><br>
