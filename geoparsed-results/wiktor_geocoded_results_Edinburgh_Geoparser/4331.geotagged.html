<p><span class="loc">Jones County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 28,669. The county seat is Gray. The county was created on December 10, 1807 and named after <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Representative James Jones. <span class="loc">Jones County</span> along with <span class="loc">Morgan County</span>, <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>, and Old Randolph were established by an act of the Georgia General Assembly passed on December 10, 1807 from land that had originally been part <span class="loc">Baldwin County</span> in 1803 and, earlier, part of the <span class="loc">Creek Nation</span>. <span class="loc">Jones County</span> was originally bounded by a line running North 56° East to <span class="loc">Commissioners Creek</span>, then North 15° West to <span class="loc">Cedar Creek</span>, then up the creek to corner <span class="loc">Randolph County</span> and <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>, then along a line to <span class="loc">Ocmulgee River</span>, and then down the river to where the old county line between <span class="loc">Wilkinson County</span> and <span class="loc">Baldwin County</span> was. It excluded parts of what is now <span class="loc">Bibb County</span> east of the <span class="loc">Ocmulgee River</span>, including the location of Fort Benjamin Hawkins, as they were part of a reserve guaranteed to the <span class="loc">Creek Nation</span>. Those areas were later added to <span class="loc">Jones County</span> after the Treaty of Indian Springs.</p>
