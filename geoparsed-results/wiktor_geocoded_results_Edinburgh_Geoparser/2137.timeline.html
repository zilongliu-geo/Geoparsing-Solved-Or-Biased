  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Troy is a town in <span class="loc">Orleans County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,677 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Troy contains two villages: the unincorporated village of Troy, and the incorporated village of <span class="loc">North Troy</span>. The town has 2 departments providing local services to residents: Water Department - providing water to residents and businesses Highway Department - maintaining local roads There are two fire department serving Troy: <span class="org">Jay Volunteer Fire Department</span> - 2 stations <span class="loc">North Troy Fire Department</span> - 1 station Troy was chartered as "Missisquoi." It once produced over 400 short tons (360 t) of cast iron annually. In the <span class="date">winter of 1799</span>, a small party of Indians, led by their chief, <span class="per">Captain Susap</span>, joined the colonists at Troy, built their camps on the river and wintered near them. These Indians were nearly starving, which probably arose from the moose and deer, which formerly abounded here, being destroyed by the settlers. Their principal employment was making baskets, birch-bark cups and pails, and other Indian trinkets. They left in the spring and never returned. One of the party was a squaw, <span class="per">Molly Orcutt</span>, who became quite noted among the settlers as a healer. She was found dead on Mount white Cap, in <span class="loc">East Andover</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, in <span class="date">1817</span>, having died, it is believed, at an age of <span class="date">140 years</span>.</p><br><br>
