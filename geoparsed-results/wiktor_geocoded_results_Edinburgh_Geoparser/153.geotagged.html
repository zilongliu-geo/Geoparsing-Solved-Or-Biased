<p><span class="loc">San Juan</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Lapog</span>) is a third class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 25,199 people. Because it produces most of the goods made of buri leaf in the province, it is sometimes called the Buri Capital of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Lapog</span> was established in 1772. The name of the municipality has gone through a series of changes. The early settlers and occupants called it "Lapo", short for "Lapo-Lapo", a tall grass which grew everywhere in the area. In the year 1772, Don Tomas Aquino, the first local leader, initiated the organization of the scattered communities into one, calling the place "Lapog", a derivative of local vernacular "Lap-Lapog" which means unirrigated land. For 189 years, "Lapog" remained in the records as the official name of the town until June 18, 1961, Republic Act No. 3386 was enacted and it was renamed to <span class="loc">San Juan</span>. Since most of the inhabitants were of the belief that religious names bring peace, happiness, and prosperity, the town was renamed "<span class="loc">San Juan</span>", after the name of its patron saint, <span class="loc">Saint John</span> the <span class="loc">Baptist</span>.</p>
