<p><span class="loc">Milford</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Oakland County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 6,175 at the 2010 census. The village is located within Milford Township. The village of <span class="loc">Milford</span> began with the building of a sawmill by Elizur and Stanley <span class="loc">Ruggles</span> in 1832. <span class="loc">Early county</span> records indicate that the mill was erected in the "Township" at that time, and that formal organization would occur in 1834. That same year, the first gristmill was erected by Luman Fuller. In 1835, the first post office was established with Aaron Phelps as postmaster. The Lower <span class="loc">Mill Pond</span> was created in 1836 to provide waterpower for the various types of mills and factories. The Upper <span class="loc">Mill Pond</span> followed in 1845. In 1911, the <span class="loc">Hubbell</span> Pond was created by a dam built on the <span class="loc">Huron</span> River to generate electricity. The village was incorporated in 1869. Hydropower made it possible for <span class="loc">Milford</span> to become one of the first communities to have electric lights, in 1892. A year later, telephone service was available in the Village. As a point of reference, nearby <span class="loc">South Lyon</span> did not have electric lights until 1932.</p>
