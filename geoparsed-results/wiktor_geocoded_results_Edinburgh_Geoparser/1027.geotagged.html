In the late 1770s, John Muhlenberg was pastor at a Lutheran church located in the heart of <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>. As a famous story of Muhlenberg has it, at conclusion of his farewell sermon on January 21, 1776, Muhlenberg threw off his clerical robes to reveal an officer's uniform beneath and shouted, "there is a time to pray and a time to fight..." With that declaration, the story says he then called for volunteers to join the 8th <span class="loc">Virginia</span> Regiment under his command.</p>
