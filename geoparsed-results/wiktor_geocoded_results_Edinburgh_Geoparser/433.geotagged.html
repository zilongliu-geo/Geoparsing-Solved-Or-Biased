<p><span class="loc">La Palma</span> is a municipality in the Chalatenango department of <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>. The municipality, located in a mountainous area of the country, covers an area of 131.89 km² and as of 2006 has an approximate population of 24,000. It has historical importance since it played a fundamental role as a site for negotiations and battles between guerrillas and the government during Civil War of <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>. Much of the municipality is mountainous and has a thriving artisan community. It is one of the most notable centres of craft in the country and the revenue generated from crafts through tourism and exports are crucial to the economy. Arising from the colonial period, the name derives from a place formerly called the <span class="loc">Palmita</span>, a small village in the area located near <span class="loc">Nonuapa</span> River. After a flood of that river in 1882, their settlers moved to the present place and founded <span class="loc">La Palma</span>. In 1959 by Legislative Decree, it became a town and municipality, consisting of the cantons of <span class="loc">Los Horcones</span>, <span class="loc">Los Planes</span>, <span class="loc">Las Granadillas</span>, <span class="loc">El Gramal</span>, <span class="loc">San</span> José Sacaré, El Túnel, <span class="loc">El Aguacatal</span> and <span class="loc">San</span> Josecalera.</p>
