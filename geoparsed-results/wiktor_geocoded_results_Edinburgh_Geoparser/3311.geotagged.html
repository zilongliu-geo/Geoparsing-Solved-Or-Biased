<p><span class="loc">La Quinta</span> is a resort city in <span class="loc">Riverside County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>, specifically in the <span class="loc">Coachella</span> Valley between <span class="loc">Indian Wells</span> and <span class="loc">Indio</span>. The population was 37,467 at the 2010 census, up from 23,694 at the 2000 census. The Robb Report credits <span class="loc">La Quinta</span> as the leading golf destination in the <span class="loc">US</span>. Among those destinations is the La Quinta Resort and Club, a resort dating to 1926, where director Frank Capra wrote the screenplay for Lost Horizon. The Tom Fazio-designed golf course at The Quarry at <span class="loc">La Quinta</span> is ranked among the top 100 golf courses in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In January 2008, the Arnold Palmer Classic Course at the city's SilverRock Golf Resort became one of the four host golf courses for the annual Bob Hope Chrysler Classic PGA golf tournament. In the late-19th century and early-20th century (1880â€“1920), agriculture developed in present-day <span class="loc">La Quinta</span> and "East Valley" by pre-modern (mountain water runoff or open water springs) and modern irrigation techniques. At the time, <span class="loc">California</span> and federal land surveyors declared the sand dunes uninhabitable, only the hard rock ground of the "Marshall Cove" held potential farming and residential development.</p>
