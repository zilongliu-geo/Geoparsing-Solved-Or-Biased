  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Utility agencies say fees even out rates. Rates charged by utilities depend a lot on the utilities themselves. VEC is a cooperative, and while it has 109,000 customers from the Kentucky border to the <span class="loc">Georgia</span> state line, it serves a mostly rural area with only 11 to 12 customers per mile on average. While <span class="loc">Athens</span> serves more densely populated areas, such as <span class="loc">Athens</span>, it has fewer than 14,000 electric customers. EUB has 4,377 electric customers. The number of customers, as well as costs on infrastructure and employees to service those customers' needs, determine the cost. "We hold seminars to help. We talk with local groups about energy efficiency. In our monthly newsletter, we try to feature different ways to cut power," <span class="loc">McCarty</span> said. "We work hard to try to help people spend less money on their power. We (the customers and distributors) are really all in this together."</p><br><br>
