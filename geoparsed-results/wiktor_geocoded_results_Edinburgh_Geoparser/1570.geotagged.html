<p>Taylor is a city in <span class="loc">Williamson County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,575 at the 2000 census; it was 15,191 in the 2010 census estimate. In 1876 the <span class="loc">Texas</span> Land Company auctioned lots in anticipation of the arrival of the International-Great Northern Railroad when Taylor was founded that year. The city was named after Edward Moses Taylor, a railroad official, under the name <span class="loc">Taylorsville</span> which officially became Taylor in 1892. Immigrants from <span class="loc">Moravia</span> and <span class="loc">Bohemia</span> (now the <span class="loc">Czech Republic</span>) and other Slavic states, as well as from <span class="loc">Germany</span> and <span class="loc">Austria</span>, helped establish the town. It soon became a busy shipping point for cattle, grain, and cotton. By 1878 the town had 1,000 residents and thirty-two businesses, twenty-nine of which were destroyed by fire in 1879. Recovery was rapid, however, and more substantial buildings were constructed. In 1882 the Taylor, Bastrop and Houston Railway reached the community, and machine shops and a roundhouse serviced both rail lines. In 1882 the town was incorporated with a mayor-council form of city government, and in 1883 a public school system replaced a number of private schools.</p>
