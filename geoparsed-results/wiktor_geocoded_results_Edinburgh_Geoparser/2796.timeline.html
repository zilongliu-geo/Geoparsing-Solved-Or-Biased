  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Established as <span class="loc">Harrisville</span> in <span class="date">1859</span>, the town was flooded by the <span class="loc">Virgin River</span> in <span class="date">1862</span>, causing the residents to move farther up <span class="loc">Quail Creek</span>. Soon after, the town's name was changed to <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>. By <span class="date">1868</span>, 200 people lived in <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>; however, over the course of the next <span class="date">few years</span>, floods, Native American raids, and a grasshopper plague caused people to relocate to the nearby towns of <span class="loc">Leeds</span> and <span class="loc">Silver Reef</span>. By <span class="date">1895</span>, <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> was abandoned. In <span class="date">1859</span>, <span class="per">Moses Harris</span>, who had previously established a Mormon colony near <span class="loc">San Bernardino</span>, moved into the area that was to become <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> and established a town near where <span class="loc">Quail Creek</span> flowed into the <span class="loc">Virgin River</span>. Several families settled in the town, which had recently been named <span class="loc">Harrisville</span>. When the <span class="loc">Virgin River</span> flooded <span class="loc">Harrisville</span> in <span class="date">1862</span>, the town's residents relocated further up <span class="loc">Quail Creek</span> and renamed the town <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, after <span class="per">Moses Harris</span>. Many of the buildings were constructed of stone because of the abundance of rocks in the area. Fences that signified the boundaries of homes were also constructed of stone. The school, however, was made of cedar posts that were inserted into the ground. The roof was constructed of cedar logs and cedar bark held together with soil. By <span class="date">1864</span>, there were 128 people living in <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>. Between <span class="date">1875</span> and <span class="date">1888</span>, the nearby mining town of <span class="loc">Silver Reef</span> purchased many agricultural goods from <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, which created a cash market.</p><br><br>
