  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Prospect is a home rule-class city in <span class="per">Jefferson</span> and <span class="per">Oldham</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> portion is a part of the <span class="loc">Louisville</span> Metro government. The population was 4,657 at the time <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is one of the wealthiest communities in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The area was first known as <span class="loc">Sand Hill</span> when it was settled by farmers in the late 18th Century. The present community grew up around the "Prospect" railroad station erected by the <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">Harrods Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Westport Railway</span> c. <span class="date">1872</span>. The name referred either to the view from the top of the hill or the expected completion of the line (which – owing to the Long Depression – never did reach <span class="loc">Westport</span> and collapsed into bankruptcy in <span class="date">1879</span>). When the post office was established in <span class="date">1886</span>, the local postmaster named it Wilhoyte in his own honor, but the community corrected this within the month. Although a few luxury residences existed in the area from the late 19th century and the <span class="org">Louisville Railway Company</span> offered hourly electrified-rail trolleys along the former LHC&amp;W line after <span class="date">1904</span>, it was largely agricultural until the mid-1960s when large, high-end subdivisions were built in the area, most notably <span class="loc">Hunting Creek</span>, which included a golf course. Prospect incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1974</span>.</p><br><br>
