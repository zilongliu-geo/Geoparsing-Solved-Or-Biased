  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Adrian is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Lenawee County</span>. The population was 21,133 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Adrian lies in Michigan's 7th congressional district. Adrian was founded on <span class="date">June 18, 1826</span> by <span class="per">Addison Comstock</span>, promoter of the <span class="loc">Erie</span> and <span class="loc">Kalamazoo Railroad</span>, and was originally named Logan. In <span class="date">1828</span> <span class="per">Addison</span>'s wife renamed the village to Adrian after the Roman Emperor Hadrian. The only remaining piece of the <span class="org">Bank</span> of Pennsylvania— one of the stone pillars — was moved to Adrian, <span class="loc">Michigan</span> and erected as the Civil War Memorial in commemoration of those in Adrian who died in the American Civil War. In the late 19th century through early 20th century Adrian was known as the "fence capital of the world," when <span class="per">J. Wallace</span> Page invented the first successful wire fence. Throughout this period, Adrian was one of the first fencing manufacturers in the world and its fences were shipped as far as <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">Berlin</span>, <span class="loc">Asia</span>, and <span class="loc">Africa</span>. The company sponsored the highly successful Page Fence Giants black baseball team. One of the first motor vehicles, the Lion automobile, was created in Adrian. Between <span class="date">1900</span> and <span class="date">1912</span>, Adrian was shaping up to be one of the motor capitals of the world, with three car models manufactured in Adrian during those <span class="date">12 years</span>. But due to some unfortunate turn of events, it never came to be.</p><br><br>
