  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Taman</span> (Russian: Тамань) is a rural locality (a stanitsa) in <span class="loc">Temryuksky District</span> of Krasnodar Krai, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the coast of the <span class="loc">Taman</span> Bay. Population: 10,027 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census); 9,297 (<span class="date">2002</span> Census). <span class="loc">Taman</span> occupies the site of the ancient <span class="loc">cities of Hermonassa and Tmutarakan</span>. From the end of the 15th century until <span class="date">1783</span>, this was a site of a Turkish fortress. Before the annexation it was a sanjak subordinate to the elayet of <span class="loc">Kaffa</span>. The modern stanitsa was founded by the Zaporozhian Cossacks under <span class="per">Anton Golovaty</span> on <span class="date">August 25, 1792</span> as the latter's residence and the first garrison of the Black Sea Cossack Host. Until <span class="date">1849</span>, <span class="loc">Taman</span> was officially considered to be a town, even though it had no local government of its own and was governed from the nearby stanitsa of <span class="loc">Akhtanizovskaya</span>. In <span class="date">1849</span>, <span class="loc">Taman</span> was re-organized as a stanitsa and established local government of its own. In <span class="date">August 2008</span>, then-Prime Minister <span class="per">Vladimir Putin</span> signed a government resolution authorizing the development of a major international cargo port several kilometers south of <span class="loc">Taman</span>. Currently, a fertilizer terminal is under construction there to link with the ammonia pipeline to <span class="loc">Odessa</span> owned by TogliattiAzot.</p><br><br>
