  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Porto</span> (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈpoɾtu]), also known as <span class="loc">Oporto</span> in English, is the second-largest city in <span class="loc">Portugal</span>, after <span class="loc">Lisbon</span>, and one of the major urban areas in Southwestern <span class="loc">Europe</span>. The urban area of <span class="loc">Porto</span>, which extends beyond the administrative limits of the city, has a population of 1.4 million (<span class="date">2011</span>) in an area of 389 km2 (150 sq mi), making it the second-largest urban area in <span class="loc">Portugal</span>. <span class="loc">Porto Metropolitan</span> Area, on the other hand, includes an estimated 1.8 million people. It is recognized as a Gamma-level  global city by the <span class="org">Globalization and World Cities</span> (GaWC) Study Group, the only Portuguese city besides <span class="loc">Lisbon</span> to be recognised as a global city. Located along the Douro river estuary in <span class="loc">Northern Portugal</span>, <span class="loc">Porto</span> is one of the oldest European centres, and its historical core was proclaimed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in <span class="date">1996</span>. The western part of its urban area extends to the coastline of the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>. Its settlement dates back <span class="date">many centuries</span>, when it was an outpost of the Roman Empire. Its combined Celtic-Latin name, <span class="loc">Portus Cale</span>, has been referred to as the origin of the name "<span class="loc">Portugal</span>", based on transliteration and oral evolution from Latin. In Portuguese, the name of the city is spelled with a definite article ("o <span class="loc">Porto</span>"; English: the port). Consequently, its English name evolved from a misinterpretation of the oral pronunciation and referred to as <span class="loc">Oporto</span> in modern literature and by many speakers.</p><br><br>
