<p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Racine County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,682 at the 2010 census. The village was located within the old Town of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. The community of <span class="loc">Honey Lake</span> was located partially in the town of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. On November 4, 2008, the village of <span class="loc">Rochester</span> voted to consolidate with the town of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. The first non-Native American settlers in <span class="loc">Rochester</span> were a group of five farming families, who all hailed from the town of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span> after which they gave their new settlement its name. These were "Yankee" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled <span class="loc">New England</span> during the colonial era. Correspondingly they were members of the Congregationalist Church and were staunch abolitionists. When they arrived in what is now <span class="loc">Rochester</span> there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. They laid out post routes, built roads, constructed farms and government buildings all within the first few months of settling in what is now <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. The old Union House hotel in the Village of <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was a part of the Underground Railroad. The trail started there, went under the <span class="loc">Fox River</span>, and ended at a house on the other side.</p>
