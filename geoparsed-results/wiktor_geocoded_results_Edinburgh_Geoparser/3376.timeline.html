  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Vermont</span> (/vərˈmɒnt/ or /vɜːrˈmɒnt/, locally: [vɚˈmɑ̟̃(ʔ)]) is the second least populous of the 50 states in the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>, containing roughly 40,000 more people than <span class="loc">Wyoming</span>. Geographically located in the northeastern part of the country, Vermont shares borders with the other <span class="loc">U.S.</span> states of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> to the south, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> to the east, <span class="loc">New York</span> to the west, and an international border with the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Quebec</span> to the north. <span class="loc">Lake Champlain</span> forms half of Vermont's western border with the state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. The <span class="loc">Green Mountains</span> run north-south the length of the state and forests cover approximately 75% of its total land area. <span class="loc">Vermont</span> is the leading producer of maple syrup in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Originally inhabited by two major Native American tribes (the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and the <span class="loc">Iroquois</span>), much of the territory that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Vermont</span> was claimed by <span class="loc">France</span> during its early colonial period. <span class="loc">France</span> ceded the territory to <span class="loc">Britain</span> after being defeated in <span class="date">1763</span> in <span class="date">the Seven Years</span>' War (referred to as the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span> in the <span class="loc">US</span>). For <span class="date">many years</span>, the nearby colonies, especially the Provinces of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span>, disputed control of the area (then called the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Grants). Settlers who held land titles granted by these colonies were opposed by the Green Mountain Boys militia, which eventually prevailed in creating an independent state, the Vermont Republic. Founded in <span class="date">1777</span> during the Revolutionary War, the republic lasted for <span class="date">fourteen years</span>. Aside from the Thirteen Colonies, <span class="loc">Vermont</span> is one of only four <span class="loc">U.S.</span> states that was previously a sovereign state (along with <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">Hawaii</span>, and <span class="loc">Texas</span>). In <span class="date">1791</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span> joined the <span class="loc">United States</span> as the 14th state, the first in addition to the original 13 colonies. <span class="loc">Vermont</span> was the first state to partially abolish slavery while still independent and played an important geographical role in the Underground Railroad, which helped American slaves escape to <span class="loc">Canada</span>.</p><br><br>
