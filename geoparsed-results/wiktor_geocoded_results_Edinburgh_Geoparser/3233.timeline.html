It lies on the border of the <span class="loc">New Forest</span>, overlooking the valley of the <span class="loc">River Avon</span>. The village is about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) north-east of the town of <span class="loc">Fordingbridge</span>, and about 8 miles (13 km) south of the <span class="loc">city of Salisbury</span>. Within the parish stands <span class="loc">Hale House</span>, a large 18th-century mansion which was the country house of architect <span class="per">Thomas Archer</span>, who also rebuilt Hale church in <span class="date">1717</span>. Hale is a village to the northeast of <span class="loc">Fordingbridge</span> in an area of woodland, to the east of the <span class="loc">River Avon</span>.

At the centre of the village is <span class="loc">Hatchet Green</span>, which is a <span class="org">Site of Special Scientific Interest</span> and a Conservation Area. It contains various tree species including oak, ash, birch, holly, lawson cypress, chestnut and hawthorn. It was taken over by the Parish Council in <span class="date">1975</span> because no owner could be traced.</p><br><br>
