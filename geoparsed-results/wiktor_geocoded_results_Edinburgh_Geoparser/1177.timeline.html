  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Nevada /nəˈveɪdə/ (local pronunciation is NevAYda) is a city and a county seat of <span class="loc">Vernon County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,386 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, and 8,171 in the <span class="date">2012</span> estimate. <span class="loc">Nevada</span> is the home of <span class="org">Cottey College</span>. Before its incorporation in <span class="date">1855</span>, the small community was known as both <span class="loc">Fair View</span> and Hog-Eye. The second name was considered to be degrading, and the first name had already been used for the name of a post office in <span class="loc">Fairview</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The town's name was changed to <span class="loc">Nevada</span> after <span class="loc">Nevada City</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> by circuit and county clerk DeWitt C. Hunter, for the city where he had been a miner. <span class="loc">Vernon County</span> suffered greatly during the Civil War. The entire town of <span class="loc">Nevada</span> was burned to the ground on <span class="date">May 23, 1863</span>, by pro-Union militiamen from nearby <span class="loc">Cedar County</span>. <span class="date">A few days</span> before that, a small force of Union militia from <span class="loc">Cedar County</span> had attacked the Nevada Courthouse. They were beaten back and all of them killed. When they failed to return home, a much larger force of militia marched on <span class="loc">Nevada</span>. They told the villagers that they had fifteen minutes to save anything they wanted; then their homes would be burned. The jail and several houses were all that escaped destruction.</p><br><br>
