  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dublin</span> is a city in <span class="org">Franklin</span>, <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, and Union counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The population was 41,751 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Dublin</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. Each year in <span class="date">late May</span> or <span class="date">early June</span>, the city hosts the Memorial Tournament, a stop on golf's PGA Tour. Consequently, numerous golf aficionados choose to make <span class="loc">Dublin</span> their home. There are also several other golf courses in <span class="loc">Dublin</span>. The <span class="org">Riviera Golf Club</span> (closed in <span class="date">2014</span>) was home to the American-Italian Golf Association. Tartan Fields Golf Club, which hosted the LPGA's <span class="org">Wendy's</span> <span class="org">Championship for Children</span> from <span class="date">2002</span> through <span class="date">2006</span>, is in the village of Tartan Fields that neighbors <span class="loc">Dublin</span>. <span class="loc">Dublin</span> also has a public golf course financed by the <span class="loc">Muirfield</span> association, as well as the <span class="per">Jack Nicklaus</span>-designed The Country Club of <span class="loc">Muirfield</span> Village. Other annual events include the <span class="date">July 4</span> music event, a <span class="date">St. Patrick's Day</span> parade, and the Dublin Irish Festival, which is one of the largest Irish-American festivals. Although its earliest settlements date back to <span class="date">1802</span>, the village that became <span class="loc">Dublin</span> did not begin to take shape until the arrival of the Sells family from <span class="loc">Huntingdon</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. Brothers <span class="per">Peter</span> and <span class="per">Benjamin</span> Sells purchased 400 acres (1.6 kmÂ²) of land on the west bank of the <span class="loc">Scioto River</span> as a gift for their brother <span class="per">John</span>. In <span class="date">1808</span>, <span class="per">John</span> Sells brought his family to the region, and by <span class="date">1810</span> he had begun to survey lots for the new village with his partner, an Irish gentleman named <span class="per">John Shields</span>. According to historians, Shields is responsible for naming the town after his birthplace:</p><br><br>
