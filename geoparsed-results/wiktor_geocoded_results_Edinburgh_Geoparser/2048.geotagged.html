<p>Hobart is a city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Kiowa County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was named for Garret Hobart, the twenty-fourth Vice President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,756 at the 2010 census, a decline of 6.0 percent from 3,997 at the 2000 census. It is served by Hobart Regional Airport. It also has 2 museums: the General Tommy Franks Museum and the Kiowa County Museum. The present town of Hobart began almost overnight on August 6, 1901, when lots on the former Kiowa-Apache-Comanche Reservation in southern <span class="loc">Oklahoma Territory</span> were put up for sale. It quickly became the residence of 2936 people, mostly living in tents. Initially, the town was nicknamed <span class="loc">Ragtown</span>. Wooden structures replaced tents as fast as possible. By 1903, Hobart had electric lights, an ice plant, and some large wholesale businesses. It also had a wooden courthouse. It developed into a town whose economy was based on the production of cotton. At statehood in November 1907, Hobart had a population of 2936. Hobart's population declined to 2936 in 1920, but resumed growing for several years afterward. In 1930, the population was 4982. In 1950, it reached a peak of 5380. Thereafter, the town population went into a long-term decline that has continued to the present. In the 1950 water supply in the area was improved with a series of reservoirs; the town is connected by aqueduct to <span class="loc">Lake Hobart</span> several kilometres to the north.</p>
