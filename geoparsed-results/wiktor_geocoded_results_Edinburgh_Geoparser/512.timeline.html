  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Jackson is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,299 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Jackson was originally called <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, and under the latter name was laid out in <span class="date">1856</span>. A post office called Jackson has been in operation since <span class="date">1858</span>. It is speculated that early trappers and explorers were the first to enter the Jackson area. The first white settlers in Jackson were brothers â€“ <span class="per">William, George</span>, and <span class="per">Charles Wood</span> of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, by way of Mankato. In <span class="date">July 1856</span>, they established a trading post and named the proposed town "Springfield" because there was a spring near where they built their cabin, a large one-room log building near the <span class="loc">Des Moines</span> River. Forty settlers followed in <span class="date">that summer</span> of <span class="date">1856</span>. The greater number were of English and Scottish descent, from <span class="loc">Webster City</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. Over a dozen log cabins were built by <span class="date">that fall</span>. The <span class="date">winter</span> of 1856-1857 was one of the most severe that was ever experienced because of its bitter cold, deep snows, and violent storms. Food was scarce as all the white settlers had come too late to raise a crop or plant gardens. Consequently, all provisions had to be hauled from the nearest settlements of <span class="loc">Webster City</span> or Mankato.</p><br><br>
