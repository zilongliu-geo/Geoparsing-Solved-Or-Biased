  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 6,472. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Waurika. The county was created at statehood and named in honor of President <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span>. In the 1750s, the Taovaya Indians, a Wichita tribe, established twin villages along the <span class="loc">Red River</span>, in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> and across the river near present-day Spanish Fort, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The village became “a lively emporium where Comanches brought <span class="org">Apache</span> slaves, horses and mules to trade for French packs of powder, balls, knives, and textiles and for Taovaya-grown maize, melons, pumpkins, squash, and tobacco.” In <span class="date">1759</span>, in response to the destruction of the <span class="org">San Saba Mission</span>, the Spanish led an expedition against the Taovaya and their allies and attacked the twin villages. The Indians defeated the Spanish army. (See <span class="org">Battle of the Twin Villages</span>) The Taovaya villages were abandoned before <span class="date">1841</span> as the Taovaya had been decimated by smallpox and encroachment by other Indians and Anglo-Americans. In the 1830s, the Choctaw tribe acquired more than two-thirds of the land <span class="date">now</span> covered by <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, and the closely related Chickasaw tribe began to relocate there. In <span class="date">1855</span>, the two tribes formally divided and this area became part of the Chickasaw Nation. The western part of the present county became part of the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Reservation, created by the <span class="date">1867</span> Medicine Lodge Treaty. That area was opened to settlement by non-Indians by the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Opening in <span class="date">1901</span>.</p><br><br>
