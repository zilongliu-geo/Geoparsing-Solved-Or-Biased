<p><span class="loc">Acton</span> is a local government community, the lowest tier of local government, part of the <span class="loc">Wrexham County</span> Borough in <span class="loc">Wales</span>. It lies in the north-eastern part of the market town of <span class="loc">Wrexham</span>. The area is largely residential and at its centre, lies <span class="loc">Acton</span> Park, the location of the former <span class="loc">Acton Hall</span>. <span class="loc">Acton</span> was originally one of the townships of the <span class="loc">parish of Wrexham</span> (in 1886, the township was transferred to the new ecclesiastical <span class="loc">parish of Rhosddu</span>). Under the civil administration, the civil <span class="loc">parish of Acton</span>, based on the old township's boundaries, was part of the <span class="loc">Wrexham Rural</span> District, but was abolished in 1935 and parts were transferred to the civil <span class="loc">parishes of Bieston and Wrexham Regis</span>. All the latter structures were abolished under the terms of the Local Government Act 1972. In 1985, a Boundary Commission review led to the creation of four new community areas within <span class="loc">Wrexham</span> itself, <span class="loc">Acton</span>, <span class="loc">Rhosddu</span>, <span class="loc">Offa</span>, and <span class="loc">Caia Park</span>, each of which would have their own community council. The community of <span class="loc">Acton</span> covers approximately 3.34 square kilometres (1.29 square miles) and comprises the electoral divisions (wards) of <span class="loc">Acton</span> (<span class="loc">Acton</span> Central &amp; <span class="loc">Acton</span> Park), <span class="loc">Borras</span> Park, Little <span class="loc">Acton</span>, Maesydre and Rhosnesni. The southernmost tip of the community area is on the corner of Chester Street and Charles Street in the town centre, and is bounded by Chester Road to the west, Holt Road to the south-east and the Llanypwll link road (A5156) to the north-east. At the 2001 census, it was the most populous community in the county borough with 12,960 people in 5,412 households.</p>
