  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Waterloo</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Southern Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is the smallest of the three cities in the <span class="loc">Regional Municipality of Waterloo</span>, and is adjacent to the <span class="loc">city of Kitchener</span>. <span class="per">Kitchener</span> and <span class="per">Waterloo</span> are often jointly referred to as "Kitchener-Waterloo", "KW", or "the Tri-City" (to include the <span class="loc">City of Cambridge</span>), although they have separate city governments. There have been several attempts to amalgamate the two cities (sometimes with the <span class="loc">city of Cambridge</span> as well), but none have been successful. At the time of the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="per">Waterloo</span> had a population of 98,780. <span class="per">Waterloo</span> started on land that was part of a parcel of 675,000 acres (2,730 km2) assigned in <span class="date">1784</span> to the Iroquois alliance that made up the <span class="org">League</span> of Six Nations. The rare gift of land from <span class="loc">Britain</span> to indigenous people took place to compensate for wartime alliance during the American Rebellion, (later known as the American Revolution). Almost immediately—and with much controversy—the native groups began to sell some of the land. Between <span class="date">1796</span> and <span class="date">1798</span>, 93,000 acres (380 km2) were sold through a <span class="org">Crown</span> Grant to <span class="per">Richard Beasley</span>, with the Six Nations Indians continuing to hold the mortgage on the lands.</p><br><br>
