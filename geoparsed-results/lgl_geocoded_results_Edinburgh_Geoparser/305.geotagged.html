<p>Furious winds, hail, fires hit Manhattan area Monday. A blustery day Monday blew in severe storms that dropped large hail, more than two inches of rain and wind speeds higher than 60 mph in and around Manhattan. High wind throughout the day blew down trees, twisted road signs and blew shingles off several houses. Mary Knapp, climatologist from the Kansas State University Weather Data Library, said the highest observed wind speed was 64 mph during the storms, observed on the <span class="loc">North Farm</span>. The wind speed reported was the average over a minute, so gusts could have reached higher speeds, Knapp said.</p>
