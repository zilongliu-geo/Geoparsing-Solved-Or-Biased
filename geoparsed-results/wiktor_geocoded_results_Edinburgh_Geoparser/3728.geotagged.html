<p><span class="loc">Taltal</span> is a Chilean commune and city in <span class="loc">Antofagasta Province</span>, <span class="loc">Antofagasta Region</span>. According to the 2012 census, the commune has a population of 11,132 and has an area of 20,405.1 km2 (7,878 sq mi). The commune is home to Paranal Observatory and includes the northern portion of Pan de Azúcar National Park. The history of <span class="loc">Taltal</span> begins with the opening of the copper mine "<span class="loc">El Cobre</span>" by José Antonio Moreno in 1850 about 20 kilometers north of <span class="loc">Taltal</span>. This brought miners and prospectors to the area. In 1855 Moreno expanded his operations to include <span class="loc">Taltal</span>. The discovery of copper in 1858 on nearby Mount Cachiyuyal increased pressure on the port, which had to utilize customs officials from <span class="loc">Copiapo</span>. So Moreno requested official recognition of the port which was granted by decree on 12 July 1858. However, the real boom began in 1876 with the opening of nitrate mines, in particular potassium nitrate. In 1879, the first nitrates were shipped from the area. In 1882 a railway was completed from <span class="loc">Cachinal de la Sierra</span> and other nitrate mining sites. It was built by the "Taltal Railway Company", a British company, sold to private investors in 1954, and dismantled in 1970 due to the end of nitrate mining. At the peak of production in the 1930s, <span class="loc">Taltal</span> had a population of over 30,000 and was the third largest nitrate port in <span class="loc">Chile</span>.</p>
