<p><span class="loc">Decatur</span>, <span class="loc">Avondale</span> Estates limit annexation plan. State legislators this week will eyeball an annexation plan for <span class="loc">Decatur</span> and <span class="loc">Avondale</span> Estates to extend their borders. But even the bill’s sponsor admits it is unclear if the idea will win over <span class="loc">DeKalb County</span> lawmakers, considering most of the businesses in the proposed annexation area along College Avenue object. State Rep. Stephanie Stuckey <span class="loc">Benfield</span> has tried and failed, twice, before in an annexation bid for <span class="loc">Avondale</span>. “I’ve never gotten the 10 signatures in the past,” the <span class="loc">Decatur</span> Democrat said of the county delegation’s rules for the needed number of sponsors for local legislation. “But it makes sense, and it’s something that is important for that area.” The latest proposal calls for the cities’ borders to meet at Sams Crossing. Both cities have backed away from larger annexations, in part because of resident objections. This plan, though, involves mostly commercial lots, 10 in <span class="loc">Decatur</span> and 22 in <span class="loc">Avondale</span>. That means the property owners would not likely be city voters or, in <span class="loc">Decatur</span>’s case, would not overburden local schools. “They’re just going for the people who can’t vote against it,” said Charles Blalock, who opposes the annexation and owns three of the lots in <span class="loc">Avondale</span>’s sights. “Don’t drag me into your town just to get more dollars,” Blalock said. Leaders in both cities say their main goal is to square their borders and provide better police service in the area. For <span class="loc">Avondale</span>, trying to redevelop its downtown, it’s also about having the power to force garages and small business in the proposed annex zone to clean up their appearance. “It’s really a gateway into <span class="loc">Avondale</span>, and we’d like to see some improvements in that corridor,” said <span class="loc">Avondale</span> Mayor Ed Rieker. The annexation bill is scheduled to go before the county delegation on Tuesday.</p>
