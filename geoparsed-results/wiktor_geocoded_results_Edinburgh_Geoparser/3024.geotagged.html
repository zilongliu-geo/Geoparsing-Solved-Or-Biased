<p>Stanton is an unincorporated community in New <span class="loc">Castle County</span>, <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, near the confluence of the <span class="loc">Red Clay</span> and White Clay Creeks. It is located in the southern end of Mill Creek Hundred. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the area around Stanton was frequented by Native American peoples. A paleo-Indian archaeology site, referred to as the <span class="loc">Clyde Farm</span> site, is located southwest of the area. Stanton is located near the Piedmont fall line along the banks of the Red <span class="loc">Clay Creek</span>. First settled around 1679, it was the first settlement in Mill Creek Hundred. Many small watermills dotted the area and a farm road from <span class="loc">Chester County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> terminated on the banks of Red <span class="loc">Clay Creek</span>. The village was originally known as "Cuckoldstown", perhaps for an inn that allegedly served as a meeting place for illicit rendezvous. The village was renamed after Stephen Stanton, a prominent landowner in the village. In August 1777, <span class="loc">George Washington</span> erected fortifications in the area, expecting to confront British troops recently landed at <span class="loc">Head of Elk</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>. <span class="loc">Washington</span> and his staff held a war council in the Hale-Byrnes House. The expected battle did not develop, though, as General Howe moved his army north towards <span class="loc">Chester County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>.</p>
