  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Florence</span> is a village in the northwestern portion of the <span class="loc">city of Northampton</span>, near <span class="loc">Westhampton</span> and <span class="loc">Williamsburg</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The name "Florence" was suggested by neurologist <span class="per">Dr. Charles Munde</span>, who also operated a hydropathic establishment there, named Florence Water-Cure. From the very early <span class="date">days</span> of <span class="loc">Northampton</span> till <span class="date">1847</span>, the locality <span class="date">now</span> called <span class="loc">Florence</span> was known as "Broughton's Meadow." Soon after <span class="date">1810</span> another name was applied commonly to this region, namely the "Warner School District." The <span class="org">Northampton Association of Education and Industry</span> was started in <span class="date">1842</span>, and while it existed, the common term given to the settlement was "The Community." In <span class="date">1848</span> these three names gave way to <span class="loc">Bensonville</span>, and when <span class="date">two years later</span> <span class="per">Mr. Benson</span> failed, and the old appellation became objectionable, the village was called <span class="loc">Greenville</span>, from the new cotton company. In the <span class="date">fall of 1852</span> a meeting of the villagers was held in the South schoolhouse to choose a name for the place. Postal communication was soon to be established and a new name was desired. "Shepherd's Hollow" with its woolen mills, had been named "Leeds" after the <span class="loc">city of Leeds</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>, and the name of the great silk emporium of <span class="loc">Italy</span> was offered by <span class="per">Dr. Munde</span> as a suitable appellation for this place. The pretty village, the clear stream, the silk mill, all suggested to his vivid imagination the proprietry of naming the village "Florence," and the stream "Arno." The citizens thought well of the neat and euphonious "Florence," and unanimously adopted it, but the "Arno" never replaced the historic term of "<span class="loc">Mill River</span>."</p><br><br>
