<p><span class="loc">Anda</span> is a fifth income class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Bohol</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 16,909. In the 2013 election, it had 11,043 registered voters. <span class="loc">Anda</span> comprises 16 barangays: The municipality of <span class="loc">Anda</span> was formerly known as Quinale and was a barrio of the municipality of <span class="loc">Guindulman</span> from the early part of its civilization up to the later decades of the 19th century. At the onset, Quinale was basically uninhabited with plenty of uncultivated lands and its shores were swampy with many mangroves and hardwood trees. Through the years the population of Quinale grew and the people sought independence from <span class="loc">Guindulman</span>. On July 8, 1856 they petitioned for independence and the petition was endorsed by the Assessor General of the Government to the Governor General of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> on September 3, 1856. Yet their petition was denied for the reason that they could not meet the required number of 500 tributes or taxpayers. Undaunted, they again petitioned to become an independent town on December 30, 1872. The petition was addressed to the Provincial Governor of <span class="loc">Bohol</span> and endorsed by him to the â€œConsejo de Administracion de <span class="loc">Filipinas</span> (Council for Administration of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>), the Father Provincial of the Recollects and the Archbishop of Manila.</p>
