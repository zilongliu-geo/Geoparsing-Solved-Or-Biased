  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bau</span> is a gold mining town in the <span class="loc">Kuching Division</span> of <span class="loc">Sarawak</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. Smuggling with <span class="loc">Kalimantan</span> is also important to the local economy. On <span class="date">1 May 1837</span>, the Skrang Ibans invaded the Jagoi-Bratak Bidayuh settlement on top of Bratak Peak, killing over 2,000 Jagoi-Bratak Bidayuh men and taking 1,000 women captive. <span class="per">Panglima Kulow</span>, head of Jagoi-Bratak Bidayuh community, and a handful of his followers survived the massacre. In <span class="date">1841</span> <span class="per">James Brooke</span>, who was then the newly installed White Rajah of <span class="loc">Sarawak</span>, was able to rescue some of the women taken captive. Each year on <span class="date">1 May</span>, descendants of the survivors of the <span class="date">1837</span> massacre hold Jagoi-Bratak Day on top of Bratak Peak in <span class="loc">Bau</span> in memory of their ancestors. A memorial stone was erected on <span class="date">1 May 1988</span>, to mark the day. Gold began being mined in <span class="loc">Bau</span> in the 1840s. It was discovered by Chinese miners from <span class="loc">Pangkalan Tebang</span>. After the Chinese uprising in <span class="date">1857</span>, the mining operations were gradually taken over by The <span class="org">Borneo Company</span> with the last Chinese syndicate being bought out in <span class="date">1884</span>. In <span class="date">1898</span>, The <span class="org">Borneo Company</span> introduced the cyanide process for extracting the gold, which led to increased environmental pollution. The mines were closed in <span class="date">1921</span> because most of the easily reachable minerals had been removed. But during the Great Depression Chinese miners continued to work the mines. The mines were reopened in <span class="date">the late 1970s</span> when world gold prices soared, but closed again in <span class="date">1997</span> when the Asian financial crisis started. However, by <span class="date">2002</span>, <span class="org">Preston Resources</span> began developing the mining operations formerly held by <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>'s Oriental Peninsula Gold. In <span class="date">2006</span>, Zedex Minerals purchased the controlling interest.</p><br><br>
