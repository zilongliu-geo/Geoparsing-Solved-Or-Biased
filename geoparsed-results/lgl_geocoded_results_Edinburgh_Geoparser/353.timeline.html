  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>City council's goal planning under way. Does the <span class="loc">City of Norfolk</span> need a brand - a moniker of sorts that sums up its core? The city council <span class="date">Monday</span> heard from representatives of a <span class="loc">Denison</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>-based firm called bluespace creative that does branding for companies across the country. "A brand, in a nutshell, is perception,' said <span class="per">Scott Winey</span>, creative director. Councilman <span class="per">Karl Reeder</span> said a lot of work has been done and money spent on the effort under way to write a plan to develop the <span class="loc">North Fork River</span> corridor through downtown <span class="loc">Norfolk</span>. He asked what the <span class="loc">Iowa</span> company would do. <span class="per">Winey</span> said the work includes interviewing community leaders, drafting an assessment and recommendations, a brand standards guide, visitors guide and logos and work on the city's Web site. The council is taking the idea under consideration.</p><br><br>
