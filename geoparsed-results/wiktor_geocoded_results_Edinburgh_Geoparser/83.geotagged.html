The story was that one day a group of Spaniards searching for flourishing communities came upon a group of natives harvesting rice. The Spaniards approached the natives and asked the name of the place while pointing to the ground filled with piles of rice chaffs. The natives thought they were asked for the name of the pile and answered "Inoquitan". From then on, the Spaniards called the place "Inoquitan". In time, the name "Ayuquitan" was adapted from the phrase "may inoquitan". In 1902 Governor Demetrio Larena considered the place as a pueblo. <span class="loc">San Jose</span> is the home of the old Spanish families settled since 1871 like the <span class="loc">Patero</span>, Amiscaray, <span class="loc">Larena</span>, <span class="loc">Pareja</span>, Siglos, Remollo, Renacia, Remata, Araco and Remoto.</p>
