  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. As of <span class="date">2010</span>, the population was 38,124. The county seat is <span class="loc">Crawfordsville</span>. The county is divided into 11 townships which provide local services. The earliest known inhabitants of the area that would become <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> were the Mound Builders, Native Americans who built large earthen mounds, two of which were constructed in southeastern <span class="org">Franklin</span> Township. (Note: Research in <span class="date">the late 1900s</span> has shown these mounds were natural mounds not man made. Subsequent Native American tribes occupied the area until as late as <span class="date">1832</span>. The first white settler in the area that would become <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> was <span class="per">William Offield</span>, earlier of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, who arrived in <span class="date">1821</span> with his wife <span class="per">Jennie</span> (n√©e <span class="loc">Laughlin</span>) and one child and settled near the confluence of <span class="loc">Offield</span> Creek and <span class="loc">Sugar Creek</span>, about five miles (8 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Crawfordsville</span>. The first land in the county to be purchased from the government was a tract in Scott Township sold to John Loop on <span class="date">July 23, 1822</span>; many more tracts were entered in subsequent <span class="date">months</span>, most in Union Township. The area's settlers mostly came from <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, with others arriving from <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span> and the <span class="loc">Carolinas</span>.</p><br><br>
