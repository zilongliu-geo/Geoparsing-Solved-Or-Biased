  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sandala</span> (Arabic: صندله‎; Hebrew: צַנְדַלָה, סַנְדַלָה) is an Arab village in the <span class="loc">North District</span> of <span class="loc">Israel</span>. Located near <span class="loc">Afula</span>, it falls under the jurisdiction of <span class="loc">Gilboa Regional Council</span>. In <span class="date">2006</span> it had a population of 1,500. According to a local tradition, the present village was (re-)established in the 18th-century in the Ottoman era by two brothers from the nearby village <span class="loc">Arranah</span>, which is <span class="date">today</span> part of the <span class="loc">West Bank</span>. When <span class="per">Edward Robinson</span> passed by <span class="loc">Sandala</span> in <span class="date">1838</span>, he described it as a "small site of ruined foundations," while Victor Guérin, who passed by in <span class="date">1870</span>, noted it as "a hamlet, situated on a mound." In <span class="date">1882</span> the <span class="org">Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey</span> of Western <span class="loc">Palestine</span> described it as a "small village on the edge of the plain, built of stone and mud, supplied by cisterns, and surrounded by plough-land." In the <span class="date">1922</span> census of <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, <span class="loc">Sandala</span> had a population of 146, all Muslims, increasing in the <span class="date">1931</span> census to 189, still all Muslim, in a total of 36 houses.</p><br><br>
