  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Columbus</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Lowndes County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> that lies primarily east, but also north and northeast of the <span class="loc">Tombigbee</span> River, which is also referred to as the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway [3]. It is approximately 146 miles (235 km) northeast of Jackson, 92 miles (148 km) north of <span class="org">Meridian</span>, 63 miles (101 km) south of <span class="loc">Tupelo</span>, 60 miles (97 km) northwest of Tuscaloosa, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, and 120 miles (193 km) <span class="loc">west of Birmingham</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. The population was 25,944 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census and 23,640 in <span class="date">2010</span>. The population in <span class="date">2012</span> was estimated to be 23,452. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Lowndes County</span> and the principal city of the <span class="org">Columbus Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which is part of the larger Columbus-West Point Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Columbus</span> is also part of the area of northeast <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> called The <span class="loc">Golden Triangle</span>, consisting of <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">West Point</span> and <span class="loc">Starkville</span>, in the <span class="loc">counties of Lowndes</span>, <span class="per">Clay</span> and <span class="per">Oktibbeha</span>. The first record of the site of <span class="loc">Columbus</span> in Western history is found in the annals of the explorer <span class="per">Hernando de Soto</span>, who is reputed to have crossed the nearby <span class="loc">Tombigbee</span> River on his search for <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>. However, the site does not enter the main continuity of American history until <span class="date">December 1810</span>, when <span class="per">John Pitchlynn</span>, the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> interpreter for the Choctaw Nation, moved to <span class="loc">Plymouth Bluff</span> where he built a home, established a farm and transacted <span class="loc">Choctaw Agency</span> business.</p><br><br>
