<p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Alamance County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. It is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area which encompasses all of <span class="loc">Alamance County</span>, in which most of the city is located, and is a part of the Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point CSA. The population was 49,963 at the 2010 census, which makes <span class="loc">Burlington</span> the 17th largest city in <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. The Metropolitan Statistical Area population was over 150,000 in 2010. <span class="loc">Alamance County</span> was created when <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was partitioned in 1849. Early settlers included several groups of Quakers, many of which remain active in the Snow Camp area, German farmers, and Scots-Irish immigrants. The need of the <span class="loc">North Carolina Railroad</span> in the 1850s to locate land where they could build, repair and do maintenance on its track was the genesis of <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. The company selected a piece of land slightly west of present day Graham. On January 29, 1856, the last spikes were driven into the final tie of the <span class="loc">North Carolina Railroad</span> project, uniting the <span class="loc">cities of Goldsboro and Charlotte</span> by rail. The next day, the first locomotive passed along the new route. When the iron horse arrived in <span class="loc">Alamance County</span>, locals referred to it as "the eighth wonder of the world".</p>
