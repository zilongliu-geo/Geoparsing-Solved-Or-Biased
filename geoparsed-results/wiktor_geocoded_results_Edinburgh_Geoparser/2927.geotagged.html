<p><span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> is a rural town in <span class="loc">Loudoun County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 96 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> is located at 39°11′54″N 77°43′28″W (39.198347, -77.724391). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span>, originally spelled <span class="loc">Hillsborough</span>, lies in the Hillsboro Gap of the <span class="loc">Short Hill Mountain</span>, which is part of the <span class="loc">Blue Ridge Mountains</span> in northwestern <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. The town is about 55 miles northwest of downtown <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span> and 10 miles southeast of Harpers Ferry, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. <span class="loc">Virginia</span> State Route 9 is the main road through town. Until 2000 there were no street addresses for the buildings in town; the 60-odd buildings in <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> were referred to by their owners' names or their purposes. Author Byron Farwell was mayor of the town for many years; other mayors included Sandy Muir and Alix Spaith. A central feature of the town is its affectionately named "Old Stone School" which is located next to the newer elementary school, Hillsboro Elementary, which opened in 1966. The Old Stone School's original name was Locust Grove Academy. The oldest part of the building, the east wing, was built in 1874. The Academy's first principal was Mrs. J.B. White. The Old Stone School, as it is referred to now, is situated just outside the eastern town limits on Route 9. The stone structure was completed in 1917 with the addition of more rooms on the west side. A junior high school was established there in 1918, and operated for 17 years, until 1935. The brick auditorium was added in 1929. Classes for Grades One through Seven were taught there until the spring of 1966. The school was the hub of the community in the early 1900s. Community plays were frequently held there with a local orchestra that played during intermission.</p>
