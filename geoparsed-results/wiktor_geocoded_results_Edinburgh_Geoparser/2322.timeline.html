  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dayton is a city and county seat in <span class="loc">Rhea County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 7,191. The <span class="loc">Dayton Urban</span> Cluster, which includes developed areas adjacent to the city and extends south to <span class="loc">Graysville</span>, had 10,174 people in <span class="date">2010</span>. Dayton was the site of the Scopes Trial in <span class="date">1925</span> dealing with the creationâ€“evolution controversy. The community was originally settled circa <span class="date">1820</span> as Smith's Crossroads. In <span class="date">1877</span>, the town was renamed Dayton, after Dayton, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The town was incorporated in <span class="date">1903</span>. Early industry included manufacture of pig iron. In <span class="date">1925</span>, the famous Scopes Trial was held in Dayton and, for a period of time, filled the town with hucksters of every description and journalists from around the world. The participants included <span class="per">William Jennings Bryan</span> in the role of prosecutor and <span class="per">Clarence Darrow</span> as the principal defense counsel. The trial was over the issue of whether evolution should be taught in public schools. <span class="per">John T. Scopes</span>, the defendant in the trial, was a local science teacher who was recruited by <span class="per">George Rappleyea</span> to begin to teach evolution in his science class, despite it being against <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> law at that time. <span class="per">Rappleyea</span> believed that this conflict would create an enormous amount of publicity for the town, and he was absolutely right. The town bustled with activity as people began to flock from near and far to hear the verdict on this controversial issue.</p><br><br>
