  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rock Island</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Colorado County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. According to the Handbook of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, the community had an estimated population of 160 in <span class="date">2000</span>. <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> is situated along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 90A in <span class="loc">Colorado County</span>, approximately 12 miles southwest of <span class="loc">Columbus</span> and 15 miles west of Eagle Lake The area was settled in <span class="date">1896</span> as part of a land promotion scheme on the <span class="loc">Texas</span> and New Orleans Railroad. The survey and map of the community was completed on <span class="date">February 19, 1896</span>. Initially known as Crasco, after nearby <span class="loc">Crasco Creek</span>, citizens petitioned the post office department to change the name to <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> in <span class="date">1897</span>. The petition was granted and <span class="per">Charles Petersen</span> was appointed the first postmaster of <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> on <span class="date">August 9, 1897</span>. Dueling realtors' intent on outselling each other recruited land-buyers from <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, and <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, promising a "tropical paradise" near the <span class="loc">Gulf of Mexico</span>. By <span class="date">1904</span>, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> had a population of 367. In <span class="date">July of 1909</span> a hurricane made landfall near present-day <span class="loc">Freeport</span>. The storm passed over <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> with winds estimated to be around 75 mph. Several downtown structures, including a bank, were destroyed. The population of <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> peaked in <span class="date">1925</span> at around 500. In <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, the community suffered several fires that left large gaps in the former downtown. The number of inhabitants had fallen to 160 by the mid-1980s. It remained at that level through <span class="date">2000</span>.</p><br><br>
