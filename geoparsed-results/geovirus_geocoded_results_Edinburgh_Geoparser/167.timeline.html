  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>According to the <span class="org">World Health Organisation</span> (WHO), a cholera epidemic in the African country of <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span> has <span class="date">now</span> infected over 80,200 people. The epidemic is the worst cholera outbreak in <span class="loc">Africa</span> for <span class="date">fifteen years</span>. The United Nations agency stated that approximately half of all the patients that died of the disease did not reach any of the 365 cholera treatment centers located in the country. Since the outbreak began in <span class="date">August of last year</span>, over 80,000 people have been infected and 3,759 people have died from the disease in <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span> as of <span class="date">February 19</span>. That compared with 3,172 deaths out of 78,882 cases that were recorded as of <span class="date">Tuesday</span>. <span class="org">The WHO</span> said that the epidemic has spread to nearby states, with significant numbers of cases reported in <span class="loc">Zambia</span>, <span class="loc">Malawi</span>, and <span class="loc">Mozambique</span>. <span class="loc">South Africa</span>, which is <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>'s neighbor to the south, also reported incidents of cholera, but has managed to limit the number of fatalities to less than 1% out of all people infected.</p><br><br>
