  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Yana</span> (Kannada: ಯಾಣ) is a village located in forests of the Uttara <span class="loc">Kannada district</span> of <span class="loc">Karnataka</span>, <span class="loc">India</span> which is known for the unusual rock formations (Karst) or (Asteroid). It is located in the Sahyadri mountain range of the <span class="loc">Western Ghats</span>, about 60 kilometres (37 mi) from <span class="loc">Karwar</span> port, 40 kilometres (25 mi) from <span class="loc">Sirsi</span>, and 31 kilometres (19 mi) from <span class="loc">Kumta</span>. The two unique rock outcrops near the village are a tourist attraction and easily approachable by a small trek through 0.5 kilometres (0.31 mi) of thick forests from the nearest road head. <span class="loc">Yana</span> is famous for these two massive rock outcrops known as the Bhairaveshwara Shikhara and the Mohini Shikhara ("Shikhara" means "hill"). The huge rocks are composed of solid black, crystalline Karst limestone. Bhairaveshwara Shikhara is 120 metres (390 ft) in height, while the Mohini Shikhara, which is smaller, is 90 metres (300 ft) in height. <span class="loc">Yana</span> is also well known as a pilgrimage centre because of the cave temple below the Bhairaveshwara Shikhara where a <span class="loc">Swayambhu</span> ("self manifested", or "that which is created by its own accord") linga has been formed. Water drips from the roof over the linga, adding to the sanctity of the place.</p><br><br>
