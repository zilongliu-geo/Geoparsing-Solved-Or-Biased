<p><span class="loc">Sabah</span> (Malay pronunciation: [saˈbah]) is <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>'s easternmost state, one of two Malaysian states on the island of <span class="loc">Borneo</span>. It is also one of the founding members of the Malaysian federation alongside <span class="loc">Sarawak</span>, <span class="loc">Singapore</span> (expelled in 1965) and the Federation of Malaya. Like <span class="loc">Sarawak</span>, this territory has an autonomous law especially in immigration which differentiates it from the rest of the Malaysian Peninsula states. It is located on the northern portion of the island of <span class="loc">Borneo</span> and known as the second largest state in the country after <span class="loc">Sarawak</span>, which it borders on its southwest. It shares a maritime border with the <span class="loc">Federal Territory of Labuan</span> on the west and with the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> to the north and northeast. The state's only international border is with the <span class="loc">province of North Kalimantan</span> of <span class="loc">Indonesia</span> in the south. The capital of <span class="loc">Sabah</span> is <span class="loc">Kota Kinabalu</span>, formerly known as <span class="loc">Jesselton</span>. <span class="loc">Sabah</span> is often referred to as the "Land Below The Wind", a phrase used by seafarers in the past to describe lands south of the typhoon belt. The origin of the name <span class="loc">Sabah</span> is uncertain, and there are many theories that have arisen. One theory is that during the time it was part of the Bruneian Sultanate, it was referred to as <span class="loc">Saba</span> because of the presence of pisang saba, a type of banana, found on the coasts of the region. Due to the location of <span class="loc">Sabah</span> in relation to <span class="loc">Brunei</span>, it has been suggested that <span class="loc">Sabah</span> was a Bruneian Malay word meaning upstream or the northern side of the river. Another theory suggests that it came from the Malay word sabak which means a place where palm sugar is extracted. <span class="loc">Sabah</span> ('صباح') is also an Arabic word which means sunrise. The presence of multiple theories makes it difficult to pinpoint the true origin of the name.</p>
