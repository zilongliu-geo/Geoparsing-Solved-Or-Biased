  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Harrison</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,730 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. A historic resort area, <span class="per">Harrison</span> straddles <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> and <span class="loc">Crystal Lake</span>. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> statistical area. The <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> granted <span class="per">Otis</span> Field Plantation in <span class="date">1771</span> to <span class="per">James Otis</span> and other heirs of Captain <span class="per">John Gorham</span> and his company for their service in the <span class="date">1690</span> Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. It replaced a <span class="date">1736</span> grant which had been ruled invalid. In <span class="date">1797</span>, the plantation was incorporated as <span class="loc">Otisfield</span>. On <span class="date">March 8, 1805</span>, <span class="per">Harrison</span> was set off and incorporated from portions of <span class="loc">Otisfield</span> and <span class="loc">Bridgton</span>. It was named after a principal landowner, <span class="per">Harrison Gray Otis</span> of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, the heir of <span class="per">James Otis</span>. In the <span class="date">autumn of 1792</span>, two brothers from <span class="per">Gorham, John</span> and <span class="per">Nathan Carsley</span>, built a camp and cleared land in <span class="per">Harrison</span>. During the <span class="date">winter</span> they returned to <span class="per">Gorham</span>, coming back in <span class="date">March 1793</span> with their wives. Because <span class="per">John Carsley</span> and his wife remained in <span class="per">Harrison</span> when <span class="per">Nathan Carsley</span> and his wife resumed living in <span class="per">Gorham</span> until <span class="date">1796</span>, he is considered the town's first permanent settler. More pioneers arrived, living in log houses chinked with moss. The outlet of <span class="loc">Crystal Lake</span> into <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> provided water power for industry, and <span class="per">James Sampson</span> erected at <span class="per">Harrison</span> village the first sawmill and gristmill. Over the <span class="date">years</span> other industries followed, including a wire-making business, blacksmithy, shingle mill, harness-maker, foundry, carriage maker, clothing maker and shoe shop. Scribner's Mill (<span class="date">now</span> a museum) was built in <span class="date">1847</span> on the <span class="loc">Crooked River</span>. On the <span class="loc">Bear River</span>, in <span class="date">1867</span> the <span class="per">Harrison</span> Water Power Company established the <span class="loc">Bear River</span> <span class="loc">Woolen</span> Mill, destroyed by fire in <span class="date">1872</span>.</p><br><br>
