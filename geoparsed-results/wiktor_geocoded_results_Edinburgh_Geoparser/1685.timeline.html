If the city was threatened with a typhoon, it would move close to shore, fill the pontoons with sea water and sit on the ocean floor for more stability. The city was self sufficient, and used the ocean floor for cultivating seaweed and other edible plants. <span class="loc">Nago</span> also hosted the 26th G8 summit in <span class="date">2000</span>.</p><br><br>
