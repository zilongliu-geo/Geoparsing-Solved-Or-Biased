  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Columbia</span> will have to pay firm for hotel. A judge ruled <span class="date">Monday</span> that <span class="loc">Columbia</span> taxpayers owe design firm <span class="loc">Stevens</span> &amp; Wilkinson money for a publicly funded hotel the city never built. The <span class="loc">Columbia</span>-based design firm says the city owes it $1.6 million for work it completed on a publicly funded convention center hotel project from <span class="date">December 2003</span> to <span class="date">April 2004</span>. <span class="date">Two weeks ago</span>, city attorneys rejected a $1.6 million settlement offer from <span class="loc">Stevens</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Wilkinson</span>, saying the two entities never had a contract. <span class="date">Monday</span>, Circuit Court Judge <span class="per">Casey Manning</span> ruled the city did have a contract with <span class="loc">Stevens</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Wilkinson</span> but did not rule if or how much money the city had to pay. That question will be settled later, in front of either a jury or a judge. But it means city taxpayers likely will have to pay something at a time when the city is furloughing its employees and cutting $4 million in order to make its budget <span class="date">this year</span>. It’s unclear if the city will appeal the decision. <span class="per">Kathleen McDaniel</span>, an attorney with Callison Tighe &amp; <span class="loc">Robinson</span>, which represents the city, said <span class="date">Monday night</span> she had not had time to review the order and declined to comment. “This ruling is a dramatic development on behalf of <span class="loc">Stevens</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Wilkinson</span>,” said attorney <span class="per">Dick Harpootlian</span>, who represents the design firm. “They owe us something, the amount to be determined.” Manning’s order, known as a partial summary judgment, is rare for a plaintiff, the party who brings the lawsuit, said <span class="per">John Nichols</span>, past president of the S.C. Trial Lawyers Association, <span class="date">now</span> known as the S.C. Association for Justice. “The plaintiff always has the burden of proof and the burden of production to start a lawsuit off,” <span class="per">Nichols</span> said. It’s more likely that a defendant would win summary judgment, he said. In issuing his order, Manning cited the deposition testimony of three people: interim city manager <span class="per">Steve Gantt</span>, Councilwoman Tameika <span class="per">Isaac Devine</span> and <span class="per">Charles Phillips</span>, an expert hired by the city. Further testimony is expected before it is determined what the city owes. <span class="per">Devine</span>, an attorney, is the only council member to give a deposition so far. Attorneys for the city have asked Manning to prevent other council members from testifying on the grounds of legislative privilege — the legal doctrine that prevents public officials from being asked to explain their votes. In <span class="date">2003</span>, the city decided it would build and operate a hotel across from the <span class="loc">Columbia Metropolitan</span> Convention Center. City Council hired <span class="loc">Stevens</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Wilkinson</span>, Turner Construction, <span class="org">Gary Realty and Garfield Traub Development</span> to work on the project. All the parties signed a memorandum of understanding. However, in <span class="date">April 2004</span>, after considerable public opposition to the project, City Council voted to give $4.5 million for a private developer — <span class="per">Bo Aughtry</span> — to build the hotel, a <span class="loc">Hilton</span>, which opened in <span class="date">August 2007</span>. In <span class="date">2005</span>, the four companies that had worked on the public hotel project sued the city, saying the city’s memorandum of understanding was a contract, and by going with a privately developed hotel, the city broke that contract. The companies are asking for the money the city would have paid them had the public hotel project gone forward. <span class="date">Monday</span>’s ruling does not affect the status of the other companies; their portion of the lawsuit is still pending. “This is the first of what we hope will be a lot of dominoes to fall,” said attorney Brink Hinson, who represents <span class="org">Gary Realty and Garfield Traub Development</span>. <span class="loc">Stevens</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Wilkinson</span> is asking for an additional $1.6 million for work it says it completed on the project from <span class="date">December 2003</span> to <span class="date">April 2004</span>. In <span class="date">July 2003</span>, after working <span class="date">three months</span> on the project, <span class="loc">Stevens</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Wilkinson</span> said they were stopping their work until the city could borrow the money to pay for the hotel. <span class="loc">Stevens</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Wilkinson</span> offered to continue working on the hotel project for $650,000 through <span class="date">Oct. 15, 2003</span>, and $75,000 <span class="date">a week</span> after that. City Council members approved this deal, and on <span class="date">Dec. 13, 2003</span>, paid <span class="loc">Stevens</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Wilkinson</span> $697,084.79 — which lead Manning to write: “Thus the three tenants of contract have been established: offer, acceptance and valuable consideration.”</p><br><br>
