  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Four homes burglarized in <span class="date">one week</span>. The police are asking the public to be alert after four Hopkinton homes were burglarized during daylight hours <span class="date">this week</span>. Three residences were broken into <span class="date">Wednesday</span> on Farrington Corner Road, just off Jewett Road. The residents were not home at the time of the burglaries, and the thief or thieves made off with electronics and other "household items," according to Hopkinton police Chief <span class="per">David Wheeler</span>, who declined to detail what specific items were taken. Another house was burglarized on Elizabeth Road <span class="date">Thursday</span>, again during the daytime. <span class="per">Wheeler</span> said the police "definitely" believe the robberies are connected, and they are stepping up patrols on the town's back roads, as well as communicating with police departments in the region. <span class="loc">Hopkinton</span> is the latest town hit in a string of residential burglaries that have occurred over <span class="date">the last several weeks</span>, which Wheeler, in part, attributed to poor economic times. The police in <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> <span class="date">this week</span> arrested two men for allegedly receiving stolen property, and investigators said they believe the men were likely responsible for thefts in several nearby towns. Wheeler asked people to report anything out of the ordinary and to pay special attention to their routines. "Don't leave keys hidden outside of your homes. Make sure your homes are always locked, and if you go away for a while, call the police and let them know," <span class="per">Wheeler</span> said. "It's the common sense stuff. Don't make it easy for these people." Anyone with information about the burglaries is asked to call the <span class="org">Hopkinton Police Department</span> at 746-5151, or the <span class="org">Concord</span> Regional Crimeline at 226-3100.</p><br><br>
