<p>The Dutch government has confirmed its first H5N1 bird flu case in the country. The case was found in 2 dead young owls in a zoo in <span class="loc">Rotterdam</span>. A lab in <span class="loc">Lelystad</span> confirmed that the bird flu was first discovered after a routine test by the Wild Life Health Centre and found traces of H5N1. Further tests will be carried out due to be released in a few days. <span class="loc">Netherlands</span> has never had a reported case of H5N1 before. As bird flu can only spread by close contact, the zoo will remain open, but restrictions will be in place to protect visitors, staff and other animals. The source of the bird flu is unknown. Staff have been given prophylactic medication.</p>
