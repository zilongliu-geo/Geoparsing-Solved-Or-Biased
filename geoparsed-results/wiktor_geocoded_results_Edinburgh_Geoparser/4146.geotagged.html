<p><span class="loc">Truro</span> (/ˈtrʊəroʊ/; <span class="loc">Cornish</span>: Truru) is a city and civil parish in <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. <span class="loc">Truro</span> is <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>'s county town and only city, its centre for administration, leisure and retail and had a population recorded in the 2011 census of 18,766. It is the most southern city in mainland <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>. People from <span class="loc">Truro</span> are known as Truronians. <span class="loc">Truro</span> grew as a centre of trade from its port and then as a stannary town for the tin mining industry. The city's cathedral was completed in 1910. Places of interest include the Royal Cornwall Museum, the Hall for <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> and <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>'s Courts of Justice. The origin of Truro's name is debated. It is said to be derived from the Cornish tri-veru meaning "three rivers," but references such as the Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names reject this theory. The "tru" part might mean "three", though this is doubtful. An expert on Cornish place-names, Oliver Padel, in his book A Popular Dictionary of Cornish Place-names wrote that the 'three rivers' meaning is "possible." Alternatively the name may derive from *tre-uro or similar, i.e. the settlement on the river *uro</p>
