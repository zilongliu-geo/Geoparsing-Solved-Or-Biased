  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hubei</span> (Chinese: 湖北; pinyin:  Húběi; Wade–Giles: <span class="loc">Hu-pei</span>) is a <span class="loc">province of China</span>, located in the easternmost part of <span class="loc">Central China</span>. The name of the province means "north of the lake", referring to its position north of <span class="loc">Dongting Lake</span>. The provincial capital is <span class="loc">Wuhan</span>, a major transportation thoroughfare and the political, cultural, and economic hub of <span class="loc">Central China</span>. <span class="loc">Hubei</span> is officially abbreviated to "鄂" (È), an ancient name associated with the eastern part of the province since the Qin dynasty, while a popular name for <span class="loc">Hubei</span> is "楚" (Chǔ), after the powerful State of <span class="loc">Chu</span> that existed here during the Eastern <span class="loc">Zhou</span> dynasty. It borders <span class="loc">Henan</span> to the north, Anhui to the east, <span class="loc">Jiangxi</span> to the southeast, <span class="loc">Hunan</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Chongqing</span> to the west, and Shaanxi to the northwest. The high-profile Three Gorges Dam is located at <span class="loc">Yichang</span>, in the west of the province. The <span class="loc">Hubei region</span> was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures. By the Spring and <span class="date">Autumn</span> Period (770–476 BC), the territory of <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="loc">Hubei</span> was part of the powerful State of <span class="loc">Chu</span>. <span class="loc">Chu</span> was nominally a tributary state of the <span class="loc">Zhou</span> dynasty, and it was itself an extension of the Chinese civilization that had emerged some <span class="date">centuries</span> before in the north; but it was also a culturally unique blend of northern and southern culture, and was a powerful state that held onto much of the middle and lower <span class="loc">Yangtze River</span>, with power extending northwards into the <span class="loc">North China Plain</span>.</p><br><br>
