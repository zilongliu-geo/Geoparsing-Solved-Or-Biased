<p><span class="loc">Liverpool</span> was the original county seat of <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> and one of the oldest towns in the area. Today, it is a neighborhood of Lake Station, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. At the start of 1836, the land that <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> would occupy was still owned by Potawatomi Amerinds. However, under the Treaty of <span class="loc">Tippecanoe</span>, some of the Potawatomi were given certificates that allowed them to claim parcels of land. John Chapman bought one of these certificates, giving him ownership of section 24 of township 36 north of range 8 west. At the time, <span class="loc">Chicago</span> was a small but rapidly growing harbor town, and Chapman intended to make a city large enough to rival it. It joined the other four cities then competing to be the metropolis of Lake <span class="loc">Michigan</span>: <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan City</span>, City West, and <span class="loc">Indiana City</span>. Chapman platted <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> near the confluence of the <span class="loc">Little Calumet River</span> and <span class="loc">Deep River</span>, both of which were navigable at the time. An article from 1929 describes the original plan for the town, enumerating central streets and blocks: "Of the streets thereon they had their <span class="loc">Broadway</span>, their Market Street, their <span class="loc">Chestnut Street</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, and others of like dignity and rank, some of which were 100 feet in width. One block was designated "Public Square;" another "Market Square;" another "Church Square." Then there were 40 blocks subdivided into lots, 435 in number. Through this city to be, flowed the waters of <span class="loc">Deep River</span>, then described upon the plat as being 14 feet in depth, there being 18 blocks north of the river and 23 south."</p>
