  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gonda</span> is a city and municipal board of <span class="loc">Gonda district</span> in the Indian state of <span class="loc">Uttar Pradesh</span>. It is situated 125 km north east of the state capital <span class="loc">Lucknow</span>. <span class="loc">Gonda</span> is divided into four tahsils named <span class="loc">Gonda</span>, <span class="loc">Colonelganj</span>, <span class="loc">Tarabganj</span> and <span class="loc">Mankapur</span>. <span class="loc">Gonda</span> is located at 27.13°N 81.93°E﻿ / 27.13; 81.93. The name of this district comes from the Sanskrit - Hindi word of Goshala, meaning cowshed. The cowsheds of the royal lineage of Ayodhya viz. Ikshavaku (Raghukul) of the Solar dynasty were located here. The territory covered by the present <span class="loc">district of Gonda</span> is a part of the ancient Kosala Kingdom. After the departure of <span class="per">Lord Rama</span> to Saket dham, the celebrated sovereign of the Solar line who ruled Kosala, the kingdom was divided into two portions defined by the Ghaghara river. The northern portion was then ruled by his son, <span class="per">Lava</span> with the <span class="loc">city of Sravasti</span> as his capital. <span class="loc">Sravasti</span> was prosperous and progressive during Buddhas time. More recently, ancient Buddhist remains dating to the early <span class="date">days</span> of Buddhism have been found throughout the region, including <span class="loc">Sravasti</span>.</p><br><br>
