<p><span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Benton County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. First established in 1965 as a summer resort town, the community evolved into a retirement community, and continues to change following incorporation in 2006. The city's struggle with incorporation began in 1977 and periodically returned as the community grew rapidly. Following the change, municipal government replaced the Property Owners Association as primary government; entering a new era for <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span>. The community is located on the <span class="loc">Springfield</span> Plateau of the <span class="loc">Ozark</span> Mountains. Valleys, creeks, and steep rises characterize the city's topography. <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> is located north of <span class="loc">Bentonville</span> and Rogers and is the northernmost city in the <span class="loc">Northwest Arkansas metropolitan</span> statistical area. The city has been experiencing a population and building boom in recent years, as indicated by a 60% growth in population between the 2000 and 2010 censuses. The rapid growth of the Northwest <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> area, including <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span>, has expedited the need for a fully controlled access highway in the area. <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> is the northern terminus of Interstate 49 (I-49) in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> Bypass, currently a two-lane freeway that is ultimately planned to route I-49 to the south and west of <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span>, is under construction.</p>
