<p><span class="loc">Eastern Province</span> is one of <span class="loc">Zambia</span>'s ten provinces. The province lies between the <span class="loc">Luangwa River</span> and the border with <span class="loc">Malawi</span>, from <span class="loc">Isoka</span> in the northeast to just north of <span class="loc">Luangwa</span> in the south. The provincial capital is <span class="loc">Chipata</span>. The province's population was 1,592,661 in the 2010 census - about 6.84% of <span class="loc">Zambia</span>'s total population. For more details see <span class="loc">Eastern Province</span> in the Wildlife of <span class="loc">Zambia</span> <span class="loc">South Luangwa National Park</span> (although most of it lies outside the province, its management and the only public road access is from the province). <span class="loc">North Luangwa National Park</span> is in <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> but access and management is from <span class="loc">Eastern Province</span>. Luambe National Park Lukusuzi National Park Game Management Areas cover most of the <span class="loc">Luangwa</span> Valley outside the national parks, and many animals migrate through <span class="loc">Eastern Province</span> between the valley and game reserves in the highlands of neighbouring <span class="loc">Malawi</span>. <span class="loc">Eastern Province</span> was formerly divided into 9 districts: <span class="loc">Chadiza District</span> <span class="loc">Chipata District</span> <span class="loc">Katete District</span> <span class="loc">Lundazi District</span> <span class="loc">Mambwe District</span> <span class="loc">Nyimba District</span> <span class="loc">Petauke District</span> <span class="loc">Sinda District</span> <span class="loc">Vubwi District</span> However, <span class="loc">Chama District</span> was transferred to the new <span class="loc">Muchinga Province</span> when the latter was created in 2011.</p>
