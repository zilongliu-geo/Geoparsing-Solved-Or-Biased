  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Alhambra</span> is a populated place in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a subdivision about a mile <span class="loc">South Clancy</span> and shares a postal code (59634) with <span class="loc">Clancy</span>. <span class="per">Alhambra</span> is part of the <span class="org">Helena Micropolitan Area</span>. <span class="per">Alhambra</span> was a resort town situated South of Helena and relied on the heavy traffic during the golden <span class="date">days</span> of mining in the area. <span class="per">Alhambra</span> and <span class="per">Sunnyside</span> Hot Springs were the two hotels in the town, together composing a medical and recreational resort that flourished the 1860s until <span class="date">the 1950s</span>. The hot water is <span class="date">now</span> used to heat a retirement home on the site of one of the hotels. <span class="per">Alhambra</span> Hot Springs consists of four main springs and a number of hot water seeps located along Warm <span class="loc">Springs Creek</span>. The water temperature averages 138 degrees F. The slightly radioactive hot water flows 0.25 mile downhill to the rehabilitation center, where the water is piped through the concrete floor for heating. In <span class="date">1959</span>, disaster struck when a fire destroyed the <span class="per">Sunnyside</span> Hotel, which was never rebuilt. Although the water in the area was bottled and sold commercially and considered therapeutic in earlier <span class="date">years</span> it was eventually found to be naturally radioactive and unfit for use. The <span class="date">days</span> of <span class="per">Alhambra</span> as a resort came to an end, though the area had been in progressive decline as mining production tapered.</p><br><br>
