  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Lipa [ˈlipa] is a village in the administrative <span class="loc">district of Gmina Jednorożec</span>, within <span class="loc">Przasnysz County</span>, Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central <span class="loc">Poland</span>. <span class="loc">Lipa</span> was originally a royal village, first noted in historical documents dated <span class="date">1475</span>. Because of its special royal status it became a trading post for knights seeking goods for trade. In <span class="date">1795</span> <span class="loc">Lipa</span> was established as a governmental village, and, by <span class="date">1827</span>, there were 38 houses and 252 inhabitants. <span class="loc">Lipa</span> was thus, for the times, a relatively large and successful village with craftsmen, beekeepers, the peasants, and a tavern. During the late nineteenth center, <span class="loc">Lipa</span> prospered and grew, and <span class="date">now</span> included two windmills and an inn, 71 homes and 618 residents, who cultivated 1,587 hectares of land and maintained 324 hectares of forest. During World War I, villagers fought for their liberation from tsarist occupation. A resistance group, called “Polish Military Organisation” (Polska Organizacja Wojskowa) was formed and included a number of the village’s residents, including Aleksander Gwiazda, Gwiazda (brother of <span class="per">Aleksandra</span>), Ignacy Pokorski, Wacław Połomski, Aleksander Przybyłek and Wacław Szmytkowski.</p><br><br>
