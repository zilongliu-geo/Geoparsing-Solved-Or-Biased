  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Des</span> <span class="loc">Moines County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 25,663 in the <span class="date">2010</span> census, a decline from the 26,839 population in the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is the center of a micropolitan area including <span class="loc">West Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span> and <span class="loc">Middletown</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span> and <span class="loc">Gulfport</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is the home of Snake Alley, once labelled the crookedest alley in the world. Prior to European settlement, the area was neutral territory for the <span class="per">Sac</span> and <span class="per">Fox</span> Indians, who called it Shoquoquon (Shok-ko-kon), meaning <span class="loc">Flint Hills</span>. In <span class="date">1803</span>, President <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span> organized two parties of explorers to map the Louisiana Purchase. The <span class="per">Lewis</span> and <span class="per">Clark</span> Expedition followed the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River, while Lt. <span class="per">Zebulon Pike</span> followed the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. In <span class="date">1805</span>, Pike landed at the bluffs below <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and raised the <span class="loc">United States</span> Flag for the first time on what would become <span class="loc">Iowa</span> soil and recommended construction of a fort. The recommendation went unheeded. The American Fur Company of <span class="per">John Jacob Astor</span> established a post in the area in <span class="date">1829</span>. Settlement began in <span class="date">1833</span>, shortly after the Black Hawk Purchase, when Samuel (aka <span class="per">Simpson</span>) White, Amzi Doolitle, and <span class="loc">Morton</span> <span class="per">M. McCarver</span> crossed the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River from <span class="loc">Big Island</span> and staked claims there. According to an account <span class="per">A.T. Andreas</span> wrote in <span class="date">1875</span>, White erected a cabin in the area later platted to be Front Street between Court and High streets. <span class="per">Andreas</span> called <span class="per">White</span> and <span class="per">Doolittle</span> the <span class="loc">Romulus</span> and <span class="loc">Remus</span> of their settlement, referring to the mythic heroes who founded <span class="loc">Rome</span>, a city surrounded by hills. <span class="date">A few weeks later</span>, <span class="per">William R. Ross</span> joined them and established a general store. In <span class="date">November</span> and <span class="date">December</span>, he surveyed the settlement for <span class="per">White</span> and <span class="per">Doolittle</span>.</p><br><br>
