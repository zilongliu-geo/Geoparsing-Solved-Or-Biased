According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 38,523 people. It is located at the southern part of the province approximately 520 km. south of <span class="loc">Metro Manila</span>. It also has a distance of about 55 km. from <span class="loc">Naga City</span> and 45 km. away from the town of Pili, the capital town of the province. The history of the town of <span class="loc">San Jose</span> dates back to <span class="date">1601</span> when this town was a barrio of <span class="loc">Lagonoy</span> under the name <span class="loc">Danlog</span>. The old Parish Priest of <span class="loc">Lagonoy</span>, Fr. <span class="per">Salvador Mendoza</span>, decided to build a church in a place called "Cabayawasan" because of the presence of so many guava trees in the area. The construction of the church began in <span class="date">1818</span>. It was a cooperative effort of the people of <span class="loc">Lagonoy</span> who worked on the northern part and the people of <span class="loc">Danlog</span> on the southern part. Most of the materials and labor were either free or as payment for weddings and baptism. In <span class="date">1813</span>, the town of <span class="loc">San Jose</span> was officially established under the name "Patrocinio" derived from the word "Patron", meaning model. Then it was changed to <span class="loc">Patrocinio</span> de <span class="loc">San Jose</span> in honor of its Patron Saint, <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> the Patriarch. <span class="date">Later in 1883</span>, it was shortened to "<span class="loc">San Jose</span>" which is <span class="date">now</span> the official name. Its founders were Fr. <span class="per">Salvador Mendoza</span>, then the Parish Priest of <span class="loc">San Jose</span> and <span class="per">Don Macario Agustin, the first Captain Municipal</span> of the town.</p><br><br>
