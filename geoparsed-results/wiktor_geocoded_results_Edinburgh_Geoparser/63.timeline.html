  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>For the village in <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, see <span class="org">Aurora</span>, <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> <span class="org">Aurora</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Erie County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,782 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is one of the "Southtowns" of <span class="loc">Erie County</span> and is also erroneously called "<span class="loc">East Aurora</span>", the name of its principal village. The town is centrally located in the county, southeast of Buffalo. <span class="loc">Christ the King Seminary</span> is located in the north part of the town. The town was created in <span class="date">1818</span> from the (<span class="date">now</span> defunct) town of <span class="per">Willink</span>, which once contained all the southern part of <span class="loc">Erie County</span>. By a close vote, citizens voted to change the name to "<span class="org">Aurora</span>" in a display of their growing dissatisfaction with the Holland Land Company and its stockholders, which included <span class="per">Willem Willink</span>. <span class="per">Horace Boies</span>, Governor of <span class="loc">Iowa</span> <span class="per">Millard Fillmore</span>, <span class="loc">US</span> President, practiced law in <span class="org">Aurora</span> and lived in a house on Main Street (<span class="date">now</span> a National Historic Landmark on Shearer Avenue) before he became president. <span class="per">Millard Powers Fillmore</span>, son of <span class="per">President Fillmore</span></p><br><br>
