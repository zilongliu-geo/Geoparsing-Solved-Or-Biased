<p><span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is a large village in Highland and Ross counties, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 4,639. Since the population declined to under 5,000, the Census Bureau may still call it a city, but by <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s laws it is technically deemed a village. Since the change from city to village there is no longer a mayor of the town but a city manager; the current city manager is Ron Coffey, who was born and raised in <span class="loc">Greenfield</span>. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is most well known because of its rich history, including its community members helping in the underground railroad, new industries, and a school. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> was named for its rural appearance. General Duncan McArthur founded the town in 1799. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> has had many innovators, such as Edward Lee McClain who was well known for his detachable horse collar. The American Pad and Textile Company was created by McClain later in life. This company provided job opportunities for <span class="loc">Greenfield</span>, and created products such as the life vest used in World War II. His memory will never be forgotten by <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> however because he donated a great gift to the town. Edward Lee McClain High School which opened on September 23, 1915, was named after him. People who wished to attend paid a fee of 15 cents for admission. Located in the center of town and serving as a focal point for the town, the school has many sculptures, paintings and murals, making it a well known school in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. It was the first school in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> to have an indoor swimming pool, which is still there today, with minor construction revisions.</p>
