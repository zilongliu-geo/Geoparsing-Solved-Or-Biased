<p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 18,125. The county has two county seats, <span class="loc">Charleston</span> and <span class="loc">Ozark</span>. The county was formed on December 19, 1837, and named for Benjamin Franklin, American statesman. To the north of the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River, which bisects <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, the county is wet and alcohol is sold in liquor stores, bars and local vineyards. To the south of the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River, the county is dry. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> was carved out of <span class="loc">Crawford County</span> in December 1837. At that time, Franklin was significantly larger than it is at present, encompassing part of present-day <span class="loc">Logan County</span> which was formed in 1871. Initially, the county had a single courthouse at <span class="loc">Ozark</span>. Later, after complaints about how difficult it was to cross the river at times, a second courthouse was established at <span class="loc">Charleston</span>, sometime in the 1890s. The reality television show, The Simple Life, starring Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton was filmed in <span class="loc">Altus</span> in 2003. Townships in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> are the divisions of a county. Each township includes unincorporated areas; some may have incorporated cities or towns within part of their boundaries. <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> townships have limited purposes in modern times. However, the United States Census does list <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> population based on townships (sometimes referred to as "county subdivisions" or "minor civil divisions"). Townships are also of value for historical purposes in terms of genealogical research. Each town or city is within one or more townships in an <span class="loc">Arkansas county</span> based on census maps and publications. The townships of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> are listed below; listed in parentheses are the cities, towns, and/or census-designated places that are fully or partially inside the township.</p>
