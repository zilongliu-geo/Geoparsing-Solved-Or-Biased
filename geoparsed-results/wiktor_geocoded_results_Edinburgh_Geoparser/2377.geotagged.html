<p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Bond County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, 43 miles (69 km) east of St. Louis. The population as of the 2010 census was 7,000. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Bond County</span>. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> is part of the St. <span class="loc">Louis Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is also considered part of the Metro East region of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> is celebrating its Bicentennial in 2015 and is one of the oldest communities in <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. It is home to Greenville College, the Richard Bock Museum, the American Farm <span class="loc">Heritage Museum</span>, the Armed Forces Museum and the Demoulin Museum and a federal prison, <span class="loc">Federal Correctional Institution</span>, <span class="loc">Greenville</span> (FCI <span class="loc">Greenville</span>). It is also home to internationally known companies, including Nevco Scoreboard, the largest privately owned scoreboard company in the world, and DeMoulin Brothers, the world's oldest and largest manufacturer of band uniforms. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was founded by George Davidson in 1815 in what was then the <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Territory, when he purchased 160 acres (65 ha) along the bluff overlooking Little <span class="loc">Shoal Creek</span>, in what was then still part of <span class="loc">Madison County</span>. Davidson built a tavern near the present-day intersection of Main and Sixth streets, and by 1816 he was selling individual lots. The federal government established its first federal post office in <span class="loc">Greenville</span> in 1819. It was incorporated as a town in 1855 and as a city in 1872. At one time, it had neighborhoods called <span class="loc">New Jerusalem</span>, Piety Hill, Cobtown, and <span class="loc">Buzzard Roost</span>. A few possible reasons have been put forth for the naming of the town. Some think the town was named after <span class="loc">Greenville</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, which had been named after Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene. Others say that <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was named by early settler Thomas White because it was "so green and nice". A third possibility is that <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was named after Green P. Rice, the town's first merchant.</p>
