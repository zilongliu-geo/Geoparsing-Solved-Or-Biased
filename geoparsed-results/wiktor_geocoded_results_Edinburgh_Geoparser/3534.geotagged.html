<p><span class="loc">Wilmington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> was first settled in 1665 and was officially incorporated in 1730, from parts of <span class="loc">Woburn</span>, <span class="loc">Reading</span>, and <span class="loc">Billerica</span>. The first settler is believed to have been Will Butter, Richard Harnden or Abraham Jaquith. Butter was brought to <span class="loc">Woburn</span> as an indentured captive. Once he attained his freedom, he fled to the opposite side of a large swamp, in what is now <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>. Harnden settled in <span class="loc">Reading</span>, in an area that is now part of <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>. Jaquith settled in an area of <span class="loc">Billerica</span> that became part of <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> in 1737. Minutemen from <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> responded to the alarm on April 19, 1775 and fought at Merriam's Corner in Concord. The <span class="loc">Middlesex Canal</span> passed through <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>. Chartered in 1792, opened in 1803, it provided freight and passenger transport between the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span> and <span class="loc">Boston</span>. One important cargo on the canal was hops. From the middle of the 18th century until the early 19th century, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> was the acknowledged leader in hop production in <span class="loc">North America</span>. <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span> in particular was famous for its hop yards, and <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> was the first place where the culture grew to a fever pitch.</p>
