  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sabana Grande</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [saˈβana ˈɣɾande]) is a municipality of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> located north of <span class="loc">Lajas</span> and Guánica; south of <span class="loc">Maricao</span>; east of <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="per">Germán</span>; and west of <span class="loc">Yauco</span>. <span class="loc">Sabana Grande</span> is spread over seven wards and <span class="loc">Sabana Grande</span> Pueblo (The downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the <span class="per">San</span> Germán-Cabo <span class="loc">Rojo Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The municipality's name comes from the extensive plain that occupies the southern part of the municipality, better known as <span class="loc">Sabana Grande Abajo</span>. According to historian <span class="per">Mario Villar</span> <span class="loc">Roces</span>, before <span class="date">1808</span> there was a community with its own church on the land <span class="date">today</span> known as <span class="loc">Sabana Grande Arriba</span>. <span class="org">Evidence</span> of this is the oldest baptismal registry preserved from the area, as <span class="loc">Sabana Grande</span> was originally a sector of the municipality of <span class="per">San Germán</span>. Because the community was so far from the center of <span class="per">San Germán</span>, residents felt a need to build a church, which was established as an auxiliary to the <span class="per">San Germán</span> parish. The church was built and was devoted to <span class="loc">San Isidro Labrador</span> and <span class="per">Santa María</span> de la <span class="loc">Cabeza</span>.</p><br><br>
