  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hempstead</span> is a settlement near <span class="loc">Gillingham</span>, <span class="loc">Kent</span>, part of the urban area of the Medway Towns. It is located on the southern edge of the <span class="loc">borough of Medway</span> adjacent to <span class="loc">Wigmore</span> and <span class="loc">Lordswood</span> and linked to <span class="loc">Gillingham</span> and the M2 by the A278 trunk road. Most of <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> is in a valley, with <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> Valley Drive running along the length of the bottom of it, with housing on both sides. The settlement of <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> dates back to at least the mid-1600s. Within the records of the Hundred of <span class="loc">Chatham</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Gillingham</span>, a hamlet then known as "Hemsted" denoted a few houses along <span class="date">today</span>'s still-extant <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> Road. The hamlet's original farmhouse still stands; lands owned by this farm bequeathed to regional administration have become <span class="date">today</span>'s "<span class="loc">Hempstead</span> Playing Fields". The <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> Field currently supports football; once it fielded a winning cricket team, since disbanded. By <span class="date">the early 1980s</span>, significant areas of legacy woodland and orchard ranging from <span class="loc">Gillingham</span> Link Road (A289) to the <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> Valley Shopping Centre, across to Capstone Road and back to the border of <span class="loc">Wigmore</span> Business Park were developed by Wards Construction. More recent planning applications made to <span class="org">Medway Council</span> for the development of areas west of <span class="loc">Hempstead</span>, around Capstone and towards <span class="loc">Princes Park</span>, have at present been staved off.</p><br><br>
