<p>Not to be confused with the Sena dynasty or <span class="loc">Sana</span>'a, the capital of <span class="loc">Yemen</span>. Sena (Arabic), sometimes spelled Senna, <span class="loc">Sanaw</span> or Sanāw (the latter three names also Arabic), is an abandoned ancient town in <span class="loc">Yemen</span> located in the remote eastern <span class="loc">Hadramaut</span> valley. This village is distinct from the capital of <span class="loc">Yemen</span>, <span class="loc">San</span>'a (Arabic), and the town of Sanāw in <span class="loc">Oman</span>. Sena was a thriving Jewish city at the time of the Babylonian empire around 500 BC, and is believed to have been dominated by Israelites who had fled <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> during the Babylonian invasion. They crossed the <span class="loc">Jordan</span> into <span class="loc">Yemen</span>, believing they were safe in the valley in the east, crossing the <span class="loc">Masilah</span> River. According to hydrologists, agriculture in the dry valley was only made possible by a dam; when this broke leaving no water, the inhabitants of the city were forced to move or face starvation. British anthropologist Tudor Parfitt, who specializes in Jewish studies, believes the Ark of the Covenant was kept in the town for some time before it was taken across to <span class="loc">Africa</span>, where the Israelites leaving Sena settled along the <span class="loc">Limpopo River</span> in <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>. The town of Sena is frequently mentioned in the history of the Lemba tribe; more recently genetic studies have found they are descendants of the Israelites.</p>
