  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Nome</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located 20 miles west of <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> at the intersection of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 90, State Highway 326 and Farm to Market Road 365. The population was 588 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the Beaumont–Port <span class="loc">Arthur Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Nome</span> is located at 30°2′9″N 94°24′46″W (30.035878, -94.412661). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.1 km2), all of it land. Initially called <span class="loc">Congreve</span> Station, this location was a stop on the <span class="loc">Texas</span> and New Orleans Railroad in the early 1860s. The name for the town came from the influx of people due to the discovery of oil in <span class="date">the early 1900s</span> (similar to the gold strikes at <span class="loc">Nome</span>, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>), hence the name became <span class="loc">Nome</span> in <span class="date">1903</span>. Although rice farming would still be the foremost activity of the town, the discovery of natural gas and oil would create a new industry for the region in <span class="date">1936</span>. <span class="date">Many years later</span>, <span class="loc">Nome</span> would become incorporated in <span class="date">1971</span>.</p><br><br>
