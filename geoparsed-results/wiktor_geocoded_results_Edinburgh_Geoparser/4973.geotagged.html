<p>Seaside is a city in <span class="loc">Clatsop County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The name Seaside is derived from Seaside House, a historic summer resort built in the 1870s by railroad magnate Ben Holladay. The city's population was 6,457 at the 2010 census. About January 1, 1806, a group of men from the Lewis and Clark Expedition built a salt-making cairn at the present site of Seaside. The Native American name for the Clatsop village near the cairn was Ne-co-tat. The city was incorporated on February 17, 1899. In 1912, Alexandre Gilbert (1843â€“1932) was elected Mayor of Seaside. Gilbert was a French immigrant, a veteran of the Franco Prussian War. After living in <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> and <span class="loc">Astoria</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, Gilbert moved to Seaside where he had a beach cottage (built in 1885). Gilbert was a real estate developer who donated land to the City of Seaside for its one and a half mile long Promenade, or "Prom," along the Pacific beach. In 1892 he added to his beach cottage. The Gilbert House, since the mid-1980s operated commercially as the Gilbert Inn, still stands at Beach Drive and A Avenue. Gilbert's "Gilbert Block" office building on <span class="loc">Broadway</span> also survives.</p>
