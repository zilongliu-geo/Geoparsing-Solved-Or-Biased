  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Scientists have discovered the possible presence of the H5N1 Bird Flu virus in wild mute swans in <span class="loc">Michigan</span> on the coast of <span class="loc">Lake Erie</span> near the Mouillee state game area in <span class="loc">Monroe County</span>. The swans were sampled on <span class="date">August 8, 2006</span> and the initial testing was done at <span class="org">Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health</span> and at the National Veterinary Services laboratories in <span class="loc">Ames</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. White House Press Secretary <span class="per">Tony Snow</span> says that "They (the scientists) believe it is a strain of low pathogenicity, similar to strains that have been seen before in <span class="loc">North America</span>." Snow also added that "this [case] is not what we're accustomed to hearing about from <span class="loc">Asia</span>." "Test results thus far indicate this is low pathogenicity avian influenza, which poses no threat to human health. Routine surveillance has indicated the presence of H5 and N1 avian influenza subtypes in samples from two wild mute swans in <span class="loc">Michigan</span>," said a statement on the <span class="loc">United States Department of Agriculture</span>'s (USDA) website. The statement also went on to say that the swans "did not show signs of sickness" and that the swans were infected with "two separate" strains of Avian Flu. "It is possible that these birds were not infected with an H5N1 strain, but instead with two separate avian influenza viruses, one containing H5 and the other containing N1," said the statement. "This is not the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that has spread through much of other parts of the world. We do not believe this virus represents a risk to human health," said <span class="org">USDA's Animal and Plant Health</span> inspector, Ron DeHaven. Health officials are remaining "remaining vigilant and prepared," said Department of Health and Human Services science advisor, <span class="per">Dr. William Raub</span>. Further tests will be done to confirm that there is in fact a virus there and what type and are expected sometime <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
