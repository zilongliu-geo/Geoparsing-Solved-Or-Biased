<p><span class="loc">Bago</span>, officially <span class="loc">City of Bago</span>, is a second class city in the province of <span class="loc">Negros Occidental</span> in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, some 21 kilometres (13 mi) south of the provincial capital <span class="loc">Bacolod</span>. With a total of 163,045 people based on the 2010 census, <span class="loc">Bago City</span> comprises the 6.63% of the population of the entire <span class="loc">Province of Negros Occidental</span>. It sets a land area of 389 square kilometres, which is 5% of the entire <span class="loc">Negros Occidental</span> and 10% of the total land area of component cities. It is also tagged as the “Home of Historical and Natural Treasures”, owing to its contribution in the colourful history of the province of <span class="loc">Negros Occidental</span> and country, and its beautiful scenery and abundance in flora and fauna making it a good eco-tourism destination as well as the “Boxing Capital of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>” title, owing to the great names it produced in boxing. The community was named after a large tree called “Bágo” under which a native prince Mapagic died according to the writings of a Spanish historian, Diego de Povedano. Another version, however, noted that the name came from the shrub, bago-bago that grew abundantly in the riverbanks. Around the 17th and 18th Centuries, settlers from <span class="loc">Molo</span>, <span class="loc">Iloilo</span> formed a little village at the mouth of <span class="loc">Bago River</span>, presently a rich source of sand and gravel. The village grew into a large settlement prompting its elders to pass a petition for its conversion into a town or pueblo, which was granted in 1800.</p>
