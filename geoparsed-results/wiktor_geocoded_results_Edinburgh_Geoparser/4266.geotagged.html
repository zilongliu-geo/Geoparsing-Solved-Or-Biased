<p><span class="loc">Motala</span> is a locality and the seat of Motala Municipality, Östergötland County, <span class="loc">Sweden</span> with 29,823 inhabitants (41,956 in the entire municipality) in 2010. It is the third largest city of Östergötland, following Linköping and Norrköping. <span class="loc">Motala</span> is situated on the eastern shore of Lake Vättern and is regarded as the main centre of both the Göta Canal and the surrounding lake region. Motala Church dates from the 13th century. For several centuries, <span class="loc">Motala</span> remained a small village, mainly regarded as a stopping post on the road to the nearby town of <span class="loc">Vadstena</span>, one of cultural centres of medieval <span class="loc">Sweden</span>. However, King Gustav Vasa had a manor house built at <span class="loc">Motala</span> and later Queen Kristina had a summer residence built at the spa resort of <span class="loc">Medevi</span>, 20 km north of the town. When the Göta Canal was built in the early 19th century, <span class="loc">Motala</span> became an important town for the trade on the canal. The builder of the canal, Baltzar von Platen has his grave beside it. The town received the minor privilege status of köping in 1823, while full city rights were granted as of April 1, 1881. With the Swedish municipal reform of 1971, <span class="loc">Motala</span> became the seat of Motala Municipality.</p>
