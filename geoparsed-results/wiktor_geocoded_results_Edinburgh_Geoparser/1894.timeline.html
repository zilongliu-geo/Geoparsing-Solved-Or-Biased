  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Corral is a town, commune and sea port in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Ríos Region</span>, <span class="loc">Chile</span>. It is located south of Corral Bay. Corral is best known for the forts of Corral Bay, a system of defensive batteries and forts made to protect <span class="per">Valdivia</span> during colonial times. Corral was the headquarters of the system. Economic activities in Corral revolve around forestry, aquaculture, fishing, port services and both heritage and eco tourism. The settlement of Corral grew out from the headquarters of the forts of Corral Bay that were built in <span class="date">1645</span> to protect the <span class="loc">city of Valdivia</span>. By that time Spanish ships sailed through <span class="loc">Valdivia</span> River all the way to <span class="loc">Valdivia</span> but Corral soon took over the role of receiving major ships. With the Spanish king's Decree of <span class="loc">Free Trade</span> of 1778 cities in Spanish <span class="loc">America</span> were allowed to have direct commerce with <span class="loc">Spain</span>, which greatly stimulated commerce in Corral that benefited from trade routes across <span class="loc">Cape Horn</span>. During the Chilean Independence War <span class="per">Corral</span> and <span class="per">Valdivia</span> functioned together with Chiloé as a prominent royalist strongholds. In <span class="date">1820</span> <span class="per">Thomas Cochrane</span>, commanding the newly created Chilean Navy, took <span class="per">Corral</span> and <span class="per">Valdivia</span> by an amphibious attack. From the times of <span class="loc">Chile</span>'s independence until the early 20th century Corral gained prominence as an important port for traffic between the Pacific and the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>, as Chilean port were declared open to ships sailing under any state flag. After being incorporated into <span class="loc">Chile</span> the forts in Corral fell gradually into disuse. Since late colonial times Corral became not only the main port of entrance to the interior of <span class="per">Valdivia</span> but also of <span class="loc">Osorno</span> that was founded in <span class="date">1796</span>.</p><br><br>
