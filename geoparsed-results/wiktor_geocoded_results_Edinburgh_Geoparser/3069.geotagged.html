<p>Trenton is a town in <span class="loc">Oneida County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,498 at the 2010 census. The town is reportedly named after Trenton, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. The first settlement was developed in 1793 by Gerrit Boon in Barneveldt, as an agent of the Holland Land Company. Boon went back to Holland after a few years. His successor was Adam Gerard Mappa a Dutch typesetter. At the end of his life Mappa's friend Francis Adrian Vanderkemp moved to <span class="loc">Barneveld</span>. The town was formed in 1797 from the Town of <span class="loc">Schuyler</span> (in <span class="loc">Herkimer County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>). The name may have been selected because some local soldiers fought at the Battle of Trenton. The town includes areas form the Holland and Servis Patents. The Wethersfield Stone Schoolhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 43.7 square miles (113 km2), of which, 43.3 square miles (112 km2) of it is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2) of it (0.89%) is water.</p>
