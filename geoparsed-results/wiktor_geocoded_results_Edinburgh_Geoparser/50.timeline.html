  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Francisco</span> (sometimes colloquially shortened to "<span class="per">San Franz</span>" or "<span class="per">San Frans</span>") is a first class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Agusan del Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 70,986 people. The municipality's land area is 39,253 ha. In <span class="date">2013</span>, <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> topped first as the "Most Competitive Municipality in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>" according to the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) from out of the 163 first-class municipalities covered by their index. The protected area of the Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary can also be reached in <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> thru the Barangays <span class="loc">Caimpugan</span> and <span class="loc">New Visayas</span>. The birth of <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> has always been associated with the history of the <span class="loc">provinces of Agusan</span> and <span class="loc">Surigao del Sur</span>. Before <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> became the municipality that it is <span class="date">now</span>, it was part of the <span class="loc">District of Gibong</span>, which was then governed by the late Deputy Governor <span class="per">Francisco Cataylo</span>. During this period, the district comprised the barrios of <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span>, <span class="loc">Caimpugan</span>, <span class="loc">Ebro</span>, <span class="loc">Borbon</span>, <span class="loc">La Caridad</span>, <span class="loc">Prosperidad</span>, <span class="loc">Azpetea</span> and <span class="loc">Los Arcos</span>, with <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> the seat of government. Like other barrios, <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> comprised several sitios, including Sitio Hagpa, which was the site of the present day <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>. Hagpa was coined from a Manobo word for “swampy” as the sitio was a small village nestled along the <span class="loc">Adlayan</span> River and inhabited by Manobo tribes.</p><br><br>
