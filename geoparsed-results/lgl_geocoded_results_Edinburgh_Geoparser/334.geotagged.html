<p>Regional Water Group meets in <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>. The <span class="loc">North East Texas Regional Water Planning</span> Group (NETRWPG) held a meeting Wednesday afternoon at the <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> Civic Center. Engineering Consultant Ray Flemons reviewed the status of draft reports on regional water supply planning for the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) Regional Water Plan to be completed in 2011. There was considerable discussion on the population projections. Flemons said that, while the TWDB at this date would not allow any change in the population figures for each county, his firm recommended changing the estimates within counties. He said the Texas State Demographer feels population is shifting from rural areas into cities above the 5,000 level. Board members decided that, rather than change the methodology of making population estimates, they would stay with the current figures until revised by the 2010 federal census. Another report being prepared is on the utilization of the region's brackish water, reported Flemons. The draft reports will be ready by mid-May, he said, in time for board members to read them before the next meeting. The board also heard a presentation from the City of Canton, which is planning to build a new city reservoir to meet it projected population needs. The city's representatives asked that their water system expansion be incorporated into the regional water plan. The next planning group meeting will be May 27, at 1 p.m., at the <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> Civic Center.</p>
