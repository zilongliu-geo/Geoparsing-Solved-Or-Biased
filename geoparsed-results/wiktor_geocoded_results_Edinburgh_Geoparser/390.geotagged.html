<p>Lincoln is a town in the historic area of <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,362 at the 2010 census, including residents of Hanscom Air Force Base that live within town limits. Lincoln was settled by Europeans in 1654, as a part of Concord. It was split from Concord, and incorporated as a separate town in 1754. Due to their "difficulties and inconveniences by reason of their distance from the places of Public Worship in their respective Towns," local inhabitants petitioned the General Court to be set apart as a separate town. The new town comprised parts "nipped" off from the adjacent towns of Concord, Weston and Lexington, it was sometimes referred to as "Niptown." Chambers Russell, a Representative in the Court in Boston, was influential in the town's creation. In gratitude, Russell was asked to name the new town. He chose Lincoln, after his family home in <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. His homestead in Lincoln was later known as the Codman House property, which was occupied after his death by his relatives, the Codman family.</p>
