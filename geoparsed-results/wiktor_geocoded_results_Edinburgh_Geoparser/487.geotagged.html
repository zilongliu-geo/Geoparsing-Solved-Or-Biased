<p><span class="loc">Dover</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Dutchess County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,699 at the 2010 census. The town was named after <span class="loc">Dover</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>, the home town of an early settler. The town of <span class="loc">Dover</span> is located on the eastern boundary of the county, north of <span class="loc">Pawling</span>, south of <span class="loc">Amenia</span>, and west of the state of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. In 1637, the Pequot people had been driven from their former homes in <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> and settled in what is now <span class="loc">Dover</span>. They were led by Gideon Mauwee for part of their time in this location. The town was formed in 1807 from part of the town of <span class="loc">Pawling</span>. The first town meeting took place in the home of John Preston, an early settler. That home, built circa 1730, is now an inn and restaurant known as Old Drovers Inn. The Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center (1924â€“1994) was a major source of employment for <span class="loc">Dover</span> and the surrounding areas. When the center was closed in 1994, many businesses in the area were hit hard. Many of the brick and marble buildings on the grounds still stand. The property and buildings were purchased in 2003 by the Benjamin Development Corporation, and the eastern portion was sold to Olivet Management in 2013.</p>
