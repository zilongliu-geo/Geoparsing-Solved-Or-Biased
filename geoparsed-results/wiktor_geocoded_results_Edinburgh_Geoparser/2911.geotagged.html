<p><span class="loc">Berlin</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> which includes its own historical Berlin Commercial District. The population was 4,485 at the 2010 census, and has since grown in population. It is part of the <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The town of <span class="loc">Berlin</span> had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name <span class="loc">Berlin</span> is believed to be derived from a contraction of "Burleigh Inn", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and <span class="loc">Sinepuxent Road</span> (<span class="loc">Tripoli Street</span>). This may be why the traditional pronunciation of the town's name is /ˈbɜːrlən/ BUR-lən, as opposed to the more modern pronunciations /ˈbɛərlᵻn/ BAIR-lin and /bɛərˈlɪn/ bair-LIN. <span class="loc">Berlin</span> incorporated as a town in 1868. In the early 20th century, <span class="loc">Berlin</span> was known as a rest stop for travelers on their way to the coastal resort of <span class="loc">Ocean City</span>, as well as a stop for tourists who enjoyed hunting and fishing on the lower <span class="loc">Eastern Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Maryland</span>. Just to the north of the town center of <span class="loc">Berlin</span> is <span class="loc">Ocean Pines</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, a waterfront census-designated place (CDP) that shares the same zipcode as <span class="loc">Berlin</span>.</p>
