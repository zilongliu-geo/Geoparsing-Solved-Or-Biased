<p>Douglas is a city in <span class="loc">Cochise County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Douglas has a border crossing with <span class="loc">Mexico</span> and a history of mining. The population was 17,378 at the 2010 census. The Douglas area was first settled by the Spanish in the 18th century. Presidio de <span class="loc">San Bernardino</span> was established in 1776 and abandoned in 1780. It was located a few miles east of present-day Douglas. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Army established Camp <span class="loc">San Bernardino</span> in the latter half of the 19th century near the presidio, and in 1910 <span class="loc">Camp Douglas</span> was built next to the town. Douglas was founded as an American smelter town, to treat the copper ores of nearby <span class="loc">Bisbee</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. The town is named after mining pioneer Dr. James Douglas and was incorporated in 1905. Two copper smelters operated at the site. The <span class="loc">Calumet</span> and Arizona Company Smelter was built in 1902. The <span class="loc">Copper Queen</span> operated in Douglas from 1904 until 1931, when the Phelps Dodge Corporation purchased the <span class="loc">Calumet</span> and <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Company and took over their smelter. The <span class="loc">Calumet</span> and <span class="loc">Arizona</span> smelter then became the Douglas Reduction Works. Douglas was the site of the Phelps-Dodge Corporation Douglas Reduction Works until its closure in 1987. The smoke stacks of the smelter were not taken down until January 13, 1991. The town was a site of the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Copper Mine Strike of 1983.</p>
