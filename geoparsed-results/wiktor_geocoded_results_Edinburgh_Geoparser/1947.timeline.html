  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Yalu</span> is a large village in the <span class="loc">Markham</span> Valley of <span class="loc">Morobe Province</span>, <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span>. It lies along the Highlands Highway 21.5 kilometres (13.4 mi) north-west of <span class="loc">Lae</span>, 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) southeast of <span class="loc">Nadzab</span>. The landscape is typically lowland rainforest.

The report to the <span class="org">Council of the League of Nations</span> states: "The Yalu natives had recently abandoned their old village, and have established themselves nearby in a more accessible position. I inspected the village and saw 120 natives, none had complaints" During World War 2, Number 3 Platoon, 2/1 Forestry Company, Royal Australian Engineers established a forestry camp at <span class="loc">Yalu</span> to provide timber and the New Guinea <span class="org">RAAF Training School</span> was located in and around <span class="loc">Yalu</span>.

Many farms and homes in <span class="loc">Yalu</span> have been washed away.</p><br><br>
