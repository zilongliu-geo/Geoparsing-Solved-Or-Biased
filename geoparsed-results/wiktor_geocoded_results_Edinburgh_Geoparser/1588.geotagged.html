<p><span class="loc">Farah</span> (Pashto/Dari: فراه) is the capital of <span class="loc">Farah Province</span>, located in western <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>. It has a population of about 108,400, and is mainly ethnic Pashtun people. It is about the 16th largest city of the country in terms of population. The Farah Airport is located in the area. <span class="loc">Farah</span> is located in western <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>, close to <span class="loc">Herat</span> and <span class="loc">Iran</span>, although it lacks a direct road connection with the latter. <span class="loc">Farah</span> has a very clear grid of roads distributed through the higher density residential areas. However barren land (35%) and vacant plots (25%) are the largest land uses and combine for 60% of total land use. The Citadel at <span class="loc">Farah</span> is probably one of a series of fortresses constructed by Alexander the Great, the city being an intermediate stop between <span class="loc">Herat</span>, the location of another of Alexander's fortresses, and <span class="loc">Kandahar</span>. The ‘Alexandria’ prefix was added to the city’s name when Alexander came in 330 BC. Under the Parthian Empire, <span class="loc">Farah</span> fell under the satrapy of Aria, and was one of its key cities. It is thought to be <span class="loc">Phra</span>, mentioned by Isidorus Characenus in the 1st century AD. In the 5th century CE <span class="loc">Farah</span> was one of the major strongholds on the eastern frontier of the Sassanid Empire.</p>
