  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Longtime bus driver retires. <span class="per">Megan Gildow</span> brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, Ohio — After <span class="date">32 years</span> driving the same bus route, <span class="per">Jerry Purdin</span> knows the riders by name. "Instead of riders, they felt more like a family, each and every one of them," he said. <span class="per">Purdin</span>, 71, drove the <span class="loc">Springfield City</span> Area Transit Villa Road route for the last time on <span class="date">Thursday, March 26</span>, joined by his family. He will retire effective <span class="date">today</span>, march 31, after <span class="date">35 years</span> working for the <span class="org">Springfield Bus Co</span>. In his time, <span class="per">Purdin</span> has seen a lot of changes. The first buses he drove lacked wheelchair lifts, window defrosters and air conditioners. In <span class="date">summer</span>, drivers kept the doors open to stay cool. He enjoyed his relationship with the riders and his colleagues. "I got to talk to people every day and I like people," he said. "Throughout the <span class="date">years</span>, I met all kinds of people." <span class="per">Purdin</span> once drove presidential candidate and former <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Sen. <span class="per">Bob Dole</span> around <span class="loc">Ohio</span> when he chartered a bus. "Every time we stopped the bus, you had guys standing there from D.C. and they had these big guns," <span class="per">Purdin</span> said. <span class="per">Rhonda Moore</span> has worked with <span class="per">Purdin</span> for <span class="date">18 years</span>. She didn't know if she would like him. On her first day driving alone, he yelled at her for a bad parking job. "But he's a big softy, he's been fun," she said. "He's like a big kid." <span class="per">Purdin</span> likes to go all out and dress up for holidays, said Michelle Taber, SCAT operations manager. "He was always on time, always here and always had a smile on his face," she said. He intends to travel to <span class="loc">Hawaii</span> and drive to <span class="loc">Florida</span>. "I love driving," <span class="per">Purdin</span> said. "That's a bus driver's holiday — to drive."</p><br><br>
