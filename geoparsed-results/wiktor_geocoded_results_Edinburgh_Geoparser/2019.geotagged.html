<p>Burton is a city in <span class="loc">Genesee County</span> in the state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span> and a suburb of Flint. The population was 29,999 at the 2010 census, making Burton the second largest city in <span class="loc">Genesee County</span>. Although there were Native Americans and trappers whom lived on land earlier, and even some who attempted to settle by there, many of the original settlers of Burton came from the towns of <span class="loc">Adams</span> and <span class="loc">Henderson</span> in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. For 20 years, this area was known as the <span class="loc">Atherton</span> settlement, after brothers Shubael and Perus <span class="loc">Atherton</span> and nephew <span class="loc">Pliny</span> <span class="loc">Atherton</span> <span class="loc">Skinner</span> (and later joined by another brother, Adonijah), who settled on the <span class="loc">Thread Creek</span> in 1835. <span class="loc">Atherton</span> descendants still live in Burton in 2014. The <span class="loc">City of Burton</span> was organized as Burton Township, in 1855. Burton Township had first been a part of who got what taxable land. The North part of Burton was part of Kearsley Township along with the Southern part of Genesee Township from 1839 until 1843 when the township was merged back (for school purposes) into Flint Township. When the City of Flint incorporated, Burton Township was separated from Flint Township by the Genesee County Board of Supervisors on October 12, 1855, although the first township meeting did not take place until April 7, 1856, which is sometimes taken as the actual date of organization. Over the years, large portions of the northern and western sides of the township were annexed by the City of Flint for revenues. On May 16, 1972, township residents voted to incorporate and the <span class="loc">City of Burton</span> was officially formed July 1 of that year.</p>
