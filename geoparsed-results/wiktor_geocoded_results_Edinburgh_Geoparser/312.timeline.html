  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Wellington is a town in the unitary authority of <span class="per">Telford</span> and <span class="per">Wrekin</span> and ceremonial <span class="loc">county of Shropshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> and <span class="date">now</span> forms part of the new town of <span class="per">Telford</span>, with which it has gradually become contiguous. The total town population of Wellington was 25,554 in <span class="date">2011</span> making it by far the largest of the borough towns and the third largest town in <span class="loc">Shropshire</span> when counted independently from <span class="per">Telford</span>. However the town centre serves a greater area of approximately 60,000. Its name is most likely derived from that of a Saxon settler - Weola - whose farmstead would have been located somewhere in the centre of town, possibly near The Green. A church has stood near that site for <span class="date">almost 1000 years</span> and a priest is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The original churchyard still remains. A new church, designed by <span class="per">George Steuart</span>, was built in <span class="date">1789</span>. Wellington's first market charter was granted to Giles of <span class="loc">Erdington</span>, lord of the manor, and is dated <span class="date">1244</span> (See citation in external links) and a market still exists <span class="date">today</span>. The market had an open-sided market hall by <span class="date">1680</span> - and possibly much earlier - but this was dismantled c.1805 (See Citation in external links). In <span class="date">1841</span>, a market company formed to purchase the market rights from <span class="per">Lord Forester</span> in <span class="date">1856</span>. <span class="date">Several years later</span> in <span class="date">1848</span>, the company built a town hall with the butter market below, creating a permanent covered home for traders.</p><br><br>
