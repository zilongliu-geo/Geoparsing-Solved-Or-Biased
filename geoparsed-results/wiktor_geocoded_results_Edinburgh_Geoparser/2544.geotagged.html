<p><span class="loc">Shanxi</span> (Chinese: 山西; pinyin:  Shānxī; postal: <span class="loc">Shansi</span>) is a <span class="loc">province of China</span>, located in the <span class="loc">North China region</span>. Its one-character abbreviation is "晋" (pinyin: Jìn), after the state of <span class="loc">Jin</span> that existed here during the Spring and Autumn Period. The name <span class="loc">Shanxi</span> means "West of the Mountains", a reference to the province's location west of the <span class="loc">Taihang</span> Mountains. Shanxi borders <span class="loc">Hebei</span> to the east, Henan to the south, Shaanxi to the west, and <span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span> to the north and is made up mainly of a plateau bounded partly by mountain ranges. The capital of the province is <span class="loc">Taiyuan</span>. In the Spring and Autumn Period (722–403 BC), the state of <span class="loc">Jin</span> was located in what is now <span class="loc">Shanxi</span>. It underwent a three-way split into the states of <span class="loc">Han</span>, <span class="loc">Zhao</span> and <span class="loc">Wei</span> in 403 BC, the traditional date taken as the start of the Warring States period (403–221 BC). By 221 BC, all of these states had fallen to the state of Qin, which established the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC).</p>
