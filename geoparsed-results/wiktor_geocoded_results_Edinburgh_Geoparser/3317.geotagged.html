<p><span class="loc">Navarro</span> (formerly known as Wendling) is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Mendocino County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span>. It is located 18 miles (29 km) west of <span class="loc">Ukiah</span>, at an elevation of 269 feet (82 m). It may be reached via California State Route 128, which connects it to the Pacific coast to the west and to the <span class="loc">Anderson</span> Valley to the southeast. A former town of approximately 1000 people named <span class="loc">Navarro</span> was founded in the 1860s, located approximately 14 miles to the west of the present town, at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Navarro River</span> in what is now <span class="loc">Navarro River</span> Redwoods State Park. A post office opened there in 1867. In 1902, the mill at the mouth of the river burned down, and the post office closed. A new mill was built in that year by G. C. Wendling on the north fork of the <span class="loc">Navarro River</span>, at the present location of <span class="loc">Navarro</span>, and in 1905 the town of Wendling was founded around the mill; a post office was opened there in 1914. However, in 1916 the Wendling mill was bought by the Navarro Lumber Company, at which point Wendling became known as <span class="loc">Navarro</span> Mill or more simply <span class="loc">Navarro</span>. To reduce confusion, the dwindling seaside town of <span class="loc">Navarro</span> became known as Old <span class="loc">Navarro</span>, <span class="loc">Navarro</span> Ridge, or Navarro-by-the-sea.</p>
