<p><span class="loc">Buxton</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">Demerara-Mahaica Region</span> of <span class="loc">Guyana</span>, standing about midway between <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> and <span class="loc">Enmore</span>. <span class="loc">Buxton</span> Village was founded in 1840 by a group of freed Afro-Guyanese, who purchased the former Plantation <span class="loc">Orange Nassau</span>. Friendship, its sister village was founded in 1841 after the purchase of Plantation Friendship. The two were later joined to form the village of Buxton-Friendship, which is commonly called <span class="loc">Buxton</span>. <span class="loc">Buxton</span> Village was founded when a group of 128-132 former slaves from <span class="loc">Annandale</span> purchased the 580 acre plantation for 50,000 dollars. The 700 acre Friendship plantation was purchased by 168 former slaves for 80,000 dollars. <span class="loc">Buxton</span>, Friendship, Victoria along with other Guyanese were all collectively purchased by groups of former slaves after emancipation was enacted in 1838. The Buxton-Friendship local authority was established to interact with plantation owners, in addition to building roads, trenches and other similar infrastructure they also formed an elected village council. In 1856, the <span class="loc">British Guiana</span> legislature gave the government the right to enact improvement taxes on the properties of the villagers, this led to a stalemate between the government and the purchasers of <span class="loc">Buxton</span>.</p>
