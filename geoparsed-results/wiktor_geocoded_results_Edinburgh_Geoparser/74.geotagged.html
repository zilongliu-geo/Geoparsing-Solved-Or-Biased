<p><span class="loc">San Miguel</span>, <span class="loc">Bulacan</span> (Filipino: Bayan ng <span class="loc">San Miguel</span>; Kapampangan: <span class="loc">Balen</span> ning <span class="loc">Mayumu</span>) is a first class, urban municipality located in the third district of the <span class="loc">province of Bulacan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It was the 2nd largest municipality (area) in <span class="loc">Bulacan</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 142,854 people. The municipality of <span class="loc">San Miguel</span> de Mayumo was established in 1763 with Carlos Agustin Maniquiz, Maria Juana <span class="loc">Puno</span> - wife of Carlos Agustin Maniquiz and Miguel Pineda as the first town mayor of <span class="loc">San Miguel</span>. Miguel Pineda was a native of <span class="loc">Angat</span>, <span class="loc">Bulacan</span> who decided to settle permanently in the barrio of <span class="loc">San Bartolome</span> (now named Barangay Tartaro). He found the place ideal for hunting and was later chosen as the leader of other settlers. He formed an alliance with Mariano Puno, the recognized leader of the adjacent prosperous village called <span class="loc">Sto</span>. <span class="loc">Rosario</span> (now named Barangay Mandile). The two leaders decided to form a town named Miguel De Mayumo after the name of Miguel Pineda and Mayumo, a Kapampangan word for sweets, for the goodwill and generosity of Mariano Puno. The town was supposed to be part of <span class="loc">Pampanga</span>. <span class="loc">San Miguel</span>’s culture drifted from Kapampangan influence. <span class="loc">San Miguel</span> used to be the biggest town in <span class="loc">Bulacan</span> but when <span class="loc">San Ildefonso</span>, <span class="loc">Bulacan</span> was proclaimed a town during the 1900s and during the Marcos Regime, he made Doña Remedios Trinidad a town (named after his wife's mother), <span class="loc">San Miguel</span> was right as the 2nd.</p>
