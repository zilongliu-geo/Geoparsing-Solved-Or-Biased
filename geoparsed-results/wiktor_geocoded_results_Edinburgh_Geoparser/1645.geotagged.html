<p>The parish of <span class="loc">Saint James</span> ("<span class="loc">St. James</span>") is an area located in the western central part of the country of <span class="loc">Barbados</span>. Increasingly <span class="loc">St. James</span> is becoming known as the playground of the rich and famous, and a haven for sun-starved tourists. In local colloquium, <span class="loc">St. James</span> was known as the "<span class="loc">Gold Coast</span>", but due to its ongoing popularity it is now referred to as the "Platinum Coast", reflective of the parishes many glitzy beach-front mansions, pristine beaches, luxury hotels and consistently high land prices. Many Barbadians say within the Platinum Coast there are billionaires such as the deceased Sathya Sai Baba and others own property somewhere within a 6-mile stretch of beach on the island. The parish also has great historic significance, as it was here that the first British settlers landed in 1625. Under the authority of King James, the British claimed <span class="loc">Barbados</span> upon landing in <span class="loc">St. James</span>' present-day <span class="loc">city of Holetown</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Jamestown</span>, named after the King himself); this settlement turned <span class="loc">Barbados</span> into what would later be known as "<span class="loc">Little England</span>".</p>
