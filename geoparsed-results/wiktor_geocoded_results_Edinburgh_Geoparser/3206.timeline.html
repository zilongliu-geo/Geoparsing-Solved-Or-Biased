  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Warren is a town in <span class="loc">Bristol County</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 10,611 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Warren was the site of the Indian village of Sowams on the peninsula called Pokanoket (the near parts <span class="date">now</span> called Mount Hope Neck), and was first explored by Europeans <span class="per">Edward Winslow</span> and <span class="per">Stephen Hopkins</span> in <span class="date">1621</span>. By <span class="date">the next year</span>, <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span> had established a trading post at Sowams. In <span class="date">1623</span>, <span class="per">Winslow</span> and <span class="per">John Hampden</span> saved the life of Wampanoag Sachem Massasoit with medicine, gaining an important native ally. In <span class="date">1636</span>, <span class="per">Roger Williams</span> was banished from <span class="loc">Salem</span> and fled to Sowams, where he was sheltered by <span class="loc">Massasoit</span> until he settled at Providence, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. Permanent English settlement began east of the Indian village. In <span class="date">1653</span>, <span class="loc">Massasoit</span> and his oldest son sold to certain <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span> settlers what is <span class="date">now</span> Warren and parts of <span class="loc">Barrington</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, <span class="loc">Swansea</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, and <span class="loc">Rehoboth</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. After the death of <span class="loc">Massasoit</span>, relations became strained between the Indians and the settlers, leading to <span class="per">King Philip</span>'s War in <span class="date">1675</span>. The English settlement at Sowams was destroyed during the war but was rebuilt.</p><br><br>
