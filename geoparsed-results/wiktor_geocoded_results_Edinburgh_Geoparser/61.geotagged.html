<p>Aurora is a city in <span class="loc">Sevier County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 947 at the 2000 census. Aurora is predominantly supported by agriculture, coal mining, and the service sector. Most residents commute to one of the neighboring communities to work. Children are schooled in Salina at one of the three public schools. Current growth in the community is attributed to the growth of business and industry in the region. This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the KÃ¶ppen Climate Classification system, Aurora has a humid continental climate, abbreviated "Dfb" on climate maps. Aurora was founded in 1875 by Ezra White (or Ezra Curtis, according to some accounts) and three other families along the banks of the <span class="loc">Sevier River</span>. Aurora's settling came under the direction of Brigham Young. He called on families to settle South Central <span class="loc">Utah</span>. Originally named <span class="loc">Willow Bend</span>, the name was changed to Aurora due to the presence of the Northern Lights. The city was moved west two to three miles along the Rocky Ford Canal to avoid the spring flooding accompanied life along the <span class="loc">Sevier</span>. This location also enabled significant cultivation of the foothills. Those families that settled the region often left comfortable surroundings of Northern <span class="loc">Utah</span> to settle what one original resident described as a desolate region without a green tree in sight. Over time however, settlers planted crops, trees, and utilized irrigation to create a very beautiful and livable community.</p>
