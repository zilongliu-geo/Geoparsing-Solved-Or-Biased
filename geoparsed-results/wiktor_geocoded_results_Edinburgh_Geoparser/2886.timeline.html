In <span class="date">1858</span> the Sixth Texas Legislature formed <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>, named after <span class="per">James Hamilton Jr.</span>, from parts of <span class="loc">Comanche</span>, <span class="loc">Bosque</span>, and <span class="loc">Lampasas counties</span>. In <span class="date">1858</span>, <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> was named the county seat.</p><br><br>
