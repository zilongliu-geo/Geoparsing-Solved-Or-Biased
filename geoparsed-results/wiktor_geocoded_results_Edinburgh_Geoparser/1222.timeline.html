  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Jamestown</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Fentress County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Fentress County</span>. The population of the city was 1,959 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The <span class="loc">City of Jamestown</span> was established in <span class="date">1823</span> as a county seat for <span class="loc">Fentress County</span>. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1837</span>. Both <span class="loc">Fentress County</span> and the <span class="loc">City of Jamestown</span> are named for prominent local politician <span class="per">James Fentress</span> (<span class="date">1763</span>â€“<span class="date">1843</span>), who made the appeal for the new county to be carved out of <span class="per">Overton</span> and <span class="per">Morgan</span> counties. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was built upon the site of a semi-permanent Cherokee village, which probably made use of the many natural rock shelters in the area. Before the founding of <span class="loc">Jamestown</span>, the area was known as "Sand Springs" for the many bubbling springs located within the city. The last remaining spring is located in the <span class="per">Mark Twain</span> City Park, just northeast of the county courthouse. <span class="date">This spring</span> provided water to the family of <span class="per">John M. Clemens</span>, father of <span class="per">Samuel L. Clemens</span> (<span class="per">Mark Twain</span>), before they moved to <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. <span class="per">John Clemens</span> served as the first circuit court clerk. He also drew the plans for the first courthouse and jail.</p><br><br>
