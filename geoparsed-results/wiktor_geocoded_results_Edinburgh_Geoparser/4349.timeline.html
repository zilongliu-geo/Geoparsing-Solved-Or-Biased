Harrow has organized and hosted an annual agricultural fair every <span class="date">Labour Day</span> <span class="date">weekend</span> for over <span class="date">150 years</span>, and many people from <span class="loc">Essex County</span> and other parts of <span class="loc">Ontario</span> attend. Highlights of the fair include a mom calling contest, a pie auction, "bossy" bingo and a tractor pull.
