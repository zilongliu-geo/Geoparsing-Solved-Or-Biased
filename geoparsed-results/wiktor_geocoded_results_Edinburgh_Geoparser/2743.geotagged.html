<p>Par (Cornish: An <span class="loc">Porth</span>, meaning creek or harbour) is a village and fishing port with a harbour on the south coast of <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. The village is situated in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Tywardreath and Par</span>, although West Par and the docks lie in the <span class="loc">parish of St Blaise</span>. Par is approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km) east of <span class="loc">St Austell</span>. Par has a population of around 1,600 (in 2012). It became developed in the second quarter of the nineteenth century when the harbour was developed, in order to serve copper mines and other mineral sites in and surrounding the <span class="loc">Luxulyan</span> Valley; china clay later became the dominant traffic as copper working declined, and the harbour and the china clay dries remain as distinctive features of the industrial heritage; however the mineral activity is much reduced. Par Harbour and the beach at <span class="loc">Par Sands</span> are south of the village, and the latter includes a large static caravan holiday park; another small beach is at <span class="loc">Spit Point</span> west of the harbour. Between these two beaches the <span class="loc">South West Coast Path</span> takes an inland diversion through the village.</p>
