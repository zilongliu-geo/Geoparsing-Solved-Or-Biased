<p><span class="loc">Dora</span> is an unincorporated community in northeastern <span class="loc">Ozark County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. A school, post office, a couple of businesses, five churches and several homes are located there. The Dora Reorganized (R-3) School District provides an education for approximately 360 students in grades 1-12. The Dora Falcons basketball team competes with other single-A schools in <span class="loc">Ozark</span>, <span class="loc">Douglas</span>, <span class="loc">Wright</span> and <span class="loc">Howell</span> <span class="loc">counties of SW Missouri</span>. <span class="loc">Dora</span> is located at the junction of Route 181 and Highway CC about thirty miles northeast of <span class="loc">Gainesville</span>. On June 10, 1875, James K.P. Dobbs received a deed from the <span class="loc">United States</span> government to the 40 acres (160,000 m2) of land he had homesteaded. That was the beginnings of the town of <span class="loc">Dora</span>. On December 7, 1875, Dobbs and his wife, Margaret, sold this 40 acres (160,000 m2) to Nellie Maupin. On May 17, 1878, <span class="loc">Nellie</span> Maupin and James P. Maupin sold the 40 acres (160,000 m2) to Anton Fisher. Fisher built the first store in <span class="loc">Dora</span>, acquired the post office and named it <span class="loc">Dora</span> after his daughter. He built a two-story dwelling and joined it to the log house already there. He operated the store until his death.</p>
