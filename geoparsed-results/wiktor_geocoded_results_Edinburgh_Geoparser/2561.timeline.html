  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Vega</span> is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Oldham County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 936 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. In <span class="date">1879</span>, the area was opened by the state for homesteading. The first settler, <span class="per">N.J. Whitfield</span>, arrived in <span class="date">1899</span>. On <span class="date">October 17, 1899</span>, he purchased an area of <span class="loc">Oldham County</span> known as 'Section 90' for $1.00 per acre. In <span class="date">1903</span>, <span class="per">Whitfield</span> sold a 100-foot strip of land that extended across the southern part of <span class="loc">Oldham County</span> to the <span class="loc">Choctaw</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, and <span class="loc">Texas</span> (later <span class="loc">Rock Island</span>) Railroad as a right-of-way. He then sold portions of land on the south side of the right-of-way to other settlers. A.M. <span class="per">Miller</span> and <span class="per">Howard</span> <span class="loc">Trigg</span> surveyed the town site that eventually became <span class="loc">Vega</span> in <span class="date">May 1903</span>. The name <span class="loc">Vega</span>, which is Spanish for "meadow," was chosen because it reflected the vast prairie and surrounding countryside of the area. Soon after, Miller opened a store, and a post office, saloon, and a school that doubled as a Masonic Lodge were built in the community. In <span class="date">1907</span>, ranchers <span class="per">Patrick</span> and <span class="per">John</span> <span class="loc">Landergin</span> purchased a part of the LS Ranch from <span class="org">Swift &amp; Company</span>. Working in association with the <span class="loc">Amarillo</span>-based Pool Land Company, the <span class="org">Landergin brothers</span> brought more prospective settlers to the community. <span class="date">The following year</span>, they established a bank in <span class="loc">Vega</span>. When the railroad was completed, <span class="loc">Vega</span> began to thrive. There were several stores, a blacksmith, two churches, and a newspaper – the <span class="org">Vega Sentinel</span> – operating in the community by <span class="date">early 1909</span>.</p><br><br>
