  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Roseville</span> is a suburb on the Upper <span class="loc">North Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) north-west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district. It is within the local government areas of Ku-ring-gai and <span class="loc">Willoughby</span>. <span class="loc">Roseville</span> Chase is a separate suburb to the east. <span class="per">William Henry</span> was one of Ku-ring-gai's first European settlers, who used the area for farming. There were a few fruit orchards and market gardens in the area. Other significant settlers were <span class="per">David Mathew</span>, who owned a property called <span class="loc">Clanville</span>, and <span class="per">Richard Archbold</span>, who was granted an area of 600 acres (2.4 km2) adjacent to <span class="loc">Clanville</span>. <span class="per">Archbold</span> later acquired <span class="loc">Clanville</span> and set up an orchard on the property. <span class="per">Archbold</span>'s son-in-law had a stone cottage called <span class="loc">Rose Villa</span>, which was later demolished to make way for the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> railway line. <span class="loc">Roseville</span> eventually derived its name from <span class="loc">Rose Villa</span>. <span class="org">Roseville Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">8 July 1901</span>. <span class="loc">Roseville</span> East Post Office opened on <span class="date">1 December 1937</span>. <span class="per">Babbage</span> Road was named for <span class="per">Eden Herschel</span> <span class="per">Babbage</span> (a grandson of <span class="per">Charles Babbage</span>), a retired banker who lived in "Rawhiti" on Clanville Road. Dubbed the "Father of <span class="loc">Roseville</span>", he was largely responsible for developing <span class="loc">Roseville Park</span>, <span class="loc">Davidson Park</span> and <span class="loc">Roseville</span> Chase. His brother-in-law, <span class="per">Francis Robert Burton</span>, donated the large pavilion in <span class="loc">Roseville</span> Park, following the death in <span class="date">1913</span> of brother <span class="per">William Burton</span>, of "Woodlands" on Bancroft Avenue.</p><br><br>
