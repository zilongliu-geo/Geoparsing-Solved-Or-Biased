  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jones County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 67,761. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seats are <span class="per">Laurel</span> and <span class="per">Ellisville</span>. <span class="loc">Jones County</span> is part of the <span class="per">Laurel</span>, <span class="org">MS Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. Less than <span class="date">a decade</span> after <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> became the country's 20th state, settlers carved out a 700-square mile of pine forests and streams for a new county in <span class="date">1826</span>. They named it <span class="loc">Jones County</span> after <span class="loc">John Paul Jones</span>, the early American Naval hero who rose from humble Scottish origin to military success during the American Revolution. <span class="per">Ellisville</span>, the county seat, was named for <span class="per">Powhatan Ellis</span>, a member of the Mississippi Legislature who claimed to be a direct descendant of <span class="loc">Pocahontas</span>. During the economic hard times in the 1830s and 1840s, there was an exodus of population from <span class="loc">South Mississippi</span>, principally to <span class="loc">Texas</span>, and the slogan "GTT" ("Gone to <span class="loc">Texas</span>") came into currency. Soon after the election of <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span> as <span class="loc">United States</span> president in <span class="date">November 1860</span>, slave-owning planters led <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> to join <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> and secede from the <span class="org">Union</span> in <span class="date">January 1861</span>. Other Southern states would follow suit. Mississippi’s <span class="org">Declaration of Secession</span> reflected the planters’ interests in its first sentence: “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery…” However, the yeoman farmers and cattle herders of <span class="loc">Jones County</span> had little use for a war over a “state’s right” to maintain the institution of slavery. By <span class="date">1860</span>, slaves made up only 12% of the total population in <span class="loc">Jones County</span>, the smallest percentage of any county in the state.</p><br><br>
