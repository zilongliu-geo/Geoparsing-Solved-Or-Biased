  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greenwich</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="per">Prince William County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> in the American Revolution In <span class="date">January, 1779</span> captured British and Hessian troops were led through <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> on their way to prisoner of war camps located near <span class="loc">Charlottesville</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> in the Civil War Although several engagements occurred nearby, <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> escaped unscathed, in part because of the creative actions of resident <span class="per">Charles Green</span>, an Englishman. Green flew the British flag over his <span class="org">Carpenter's Gothic Home</span>, The Lawn, built in <span class="date">1855</span> (burned <span class="date">1924</span>). <span class="date">Three years later</span>, he donated land for Greenwich Presbyterian Church. During the war, when Union troops threatened to appropriate it for a hospital, Green claimed it was neutral British property for use only as a church. The Federals relented and left it untouched. Both Union and Confederate forces passed by here several times in 1862-63. On <span class="date">August 27, 1862</span>, just before the Second Battle of <span class="loc">Manassas</span>, Federal divisions under Gens. <span class="per">Jesse Reno</span> and <span class="per">Isaac Stevens</span>, as well as Col. <span class="per">Orlando Poe</span>'s brigade, bivouacked here. They marched to <span class="loc">Manassas</span> Junction <span class="date">the next day</span> in pursuit of Confederate <span class="per">Gen. Thomas</span> J. "Stonewall" Jackson's force.</p><br><br>
