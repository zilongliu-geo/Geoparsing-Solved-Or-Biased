  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newport</span> (Welsh: <span class="loc">Trefdraeth</span>, meaning: "town by the beach") is a community, town and ancient port (Parrog) on the Pembrokeshire coast in south-west <span class="loc">Wales</span>, at the mouth of the River Nevern (Welsh: <span class="loc">Afon Nyfer</span>) in the <span class="loc">Pembrokeshire Coast National Park</span>. A popular tourist destination, <span class="loc">Newport</span> town straddles the A487 <span class="loc">Fishguard</span> to Cardigan road, while the old port area hosts many beach, water and other activities. <span class="loc">Newport</span> is twinned with the village of <span class="loc">Plouguin</span> in Finist√®re, <span class="per">Brittany</span> and <span class="per">Annapolis</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The town was founded by the <span class="loc">Norman</span> <span class="per">William FitzMartin</span> (c.1155-1209) in about <span class="date">1197</span>. He was a son-in-law of the <span class="per">Lord Rhys</span>, who nevertheless expelled him from his former base at nearby <span class="loc">Nevern</span>, which had been established by his father Robert fitz <span class="per">Martin</span>. <span class="per">William</span> founded <span class="loc">Newport</span> as the new capital of the Marcher Lordship of Cemais and it was a busy port founded primarily on the growing medieval wool trade. Despite seizure from the native Welsh, it remained within the <span class="per">FitzMartin</span> family until the death of <span class="per">William</span>, the 2nd <span class="per">Lord Martin</span>, who died without male heir in <span class="date">1326</span>.</p><br><br>
