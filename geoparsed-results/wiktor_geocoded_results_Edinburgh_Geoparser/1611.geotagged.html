<p>Newport is a home rule-class city at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and Licking rivers in <span class="loc">Campbell County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 15,273 at the 2010 census. Historically, it was one of four county seats of <span class="loc">Campbell County</span>. Newport is part of the <span class="loc">Cincinnati Metropolitan</span> Area, which includes over 2 million inhabitants. Newport was settled c.â€‰1791 by James Taylor Jr. on land purchased by his father James Sr. from George Muse, who received it as a grant. It was not named for its position on the river but for Christopher Newport, the commander of the first ship to reach <span class="loc">Jamestown</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, in 1607. Newport was established as a town on December 14, 1795, and incorporated as a city on February 24, 1834. In 1803, the Ft. <span class="loc">Washington</span> military post was moved from <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span> to become the Newport Barracks. A bridge first connected Newport to <span class="loc">Covington</span> in 1853, and the first bridge spanning the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> to <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>, the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge, opened in 1866. Newport experienced large German immigration in the 1880-90s.</p>
