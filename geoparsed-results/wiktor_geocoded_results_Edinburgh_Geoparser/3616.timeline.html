  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Queenstown</span>, named after <span class="per">Queen Victoria</span>, is a town in the middle of the Eastern Cape Province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>, roughly half way between the smaller towns of <span class="loc">Cathcart</span> and <span class="loc">Sterkstroom</span>. It is currently the commercial, administrative, and educational centre of the prosperous surrounding farming district. The nickname of the town, 'Rose Capital of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>', comes from the large gardens and open places for flowers (especially roses) in and around town. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="loc">Queenstown</span>. Churches of all faith denominations are to be found in and around <span class="loc">Queenstown</span>. The town was founded in <span class="date">early 1853</span> under the direction of Sir <span class="per">George Cathcart</span>, who named the settlement, and then fort, after <span class="per">Queen Victoria</span>. Work on its railway connection to <span class="loc">East London</span> on the coast was begun by the Cape government of <span class="per">John Molteno</span> in <span class="date">1876</span>, and the line was officially opened on <span class="date">19 May 1880</span>. The town prospered from its founding up to the worldwide depression of <span class="date">the 1930s</span>, and again thereafter. In <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, the majority of the Black population were moved east to the township of Ezibeleni, as part of the attempt to move African people to so-called "homelands". The area has in <span class="date">the past</span> had very severe weather problems, luckily, often only affecting the surrounding areas. In <span class="date">2002</span>, heavy snowfall around <span class="loc">Queenstown</span> caused a severe disaster, especially since the area was not funded or ready for such a disaster. Then, in <span class="date">2004</span>, the surrounding areas of the Eastern Cape were affected by strong winds and heavy rainfall, although <span class="loc">Queenstown</span> once again escaped much flooding and some wind damage, power shortages soon followed. Other natural disasters include droughts and veld fires (wild fires).</p><br><br>
