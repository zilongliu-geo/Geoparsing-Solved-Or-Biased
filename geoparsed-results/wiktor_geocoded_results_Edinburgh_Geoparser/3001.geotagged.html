<p>Beaufort which was named after former British Governor L.P. Beaufort is a town and also a district located in Interior Division of <span class="loc">Sabah</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. Its population was estimated to be around 64,350 in 2010. It is a quiet provincial town about 90 kilometres south of <span class="loc">Kota Kinabalu</span>, with shophouses built high above the roads to avoid the periodic floods of the <span class="loc">Padas River</span> (<span class="loc">Sungai Padas</span>). The population of Beaufort is composed mainly of <span class="loc">Brunei</span> Malays, Bisaya, Kadazans, Lun Bawang/Lun Dayeh and Chinese (mainly <span class="loc">Hakkas</span>). Like <span class="loc">Papar</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>, <span class="loc">Beaufort</span> was one of the major initial Hakka population centres in <span class="loc">Sabah</span> and boasts a large Hakka minority to this day. Originally set up to help economic development of the interior of <span class="loc">Sabah</span>, <span class="loc">Beaufort</span>'s early prosperity was closely linked to rubber cultivation. During World War II, it was the site of a battle between Japanese and Australian forces in late June 1945. Beaufort is a stop of the <span class="loc">Sabah</span> State Railway (Jabatan Keretapi Negeri <span class="loc">Sabah</span>) line from <span class="loc">Tanjung Aru</span> to <span class="loc">Tenom</span>. Beaufort is usually visited by tourists for white-water rafting through the nearby Padas Gorge on the <span class="loc">Padas River</span> which is rated as a Grade 2 to 4 river.</p>
