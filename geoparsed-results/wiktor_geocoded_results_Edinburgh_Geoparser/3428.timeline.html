  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Austin is an unincorporated community, considered a ghost town, in <span class="loc">Grant County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located north of <span class="loc">Oregon Route</span> 7, near the <span class="loc">Middle Fork John Day River</span> in the <span class="loc">Malheur National Forest</span>. Austin was named for <span class="per">Minot</span> and <span class="per">Linda</span> Austin, early settlers of the area. The <span class="loc">Austins</span> operated a small store and hotel, <span class="org">Austin House</span>. <span class="org">Austin House</span> was started as a hotel and stagecoach station by a <span class="per">Mr. Newton</span>. Austin post office was established in <span class="date">1888</span> and closed in <span class="date">1950</span>. The tracks of the Sumpter Valley Railway reached Austin in <span class="date">1905</span>. The railway was built by <span class="org">Oregon Lumber Company</span> and Austin became an important railroad logging community. Austin was the hub of the area until Bates, a company town of the <span class="org">Oregon Lumber Company</span>, was built 1 mile (1.6 km) to the west. Austin was also a supply depot for local mining towns, including <span class="loc">Susanville</span> and <span class="loc">Galena</span>. Austin sawmills supplied lumber for places such as Greenhorn and the Bonanza Mine, higher up in the <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span>. At its height, the population was about 500 (some estimates say it was high as 5,000) and the community had three sawmills. The town also had a substantial jail and the offices of several doctors, lawyers and real estate operators. As the neighboring mining towns disappeared, however, Austin also went into decline.</p><br><br>
