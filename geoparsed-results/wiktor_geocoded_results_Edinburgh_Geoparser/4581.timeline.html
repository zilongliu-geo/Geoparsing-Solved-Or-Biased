  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newstead</span> is the most northeastern town in <span class="loc">Erie County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,594 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The name is reportedly derived from <span class="loc">Newstead Abbey</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Newstead</span> is northeast of Buffalo, and its principal community is the village of <span class="loc">Akron</span>. The town was first settled around <span class="date">1801</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Newstead</span> was established in <span class="date">1823</span> as the "Town of <span class="loc">Erie</span>" from the eastern part of the town of Clarence. In <span class="date">1831</span>, the town's name was changed to "Newstead", reportedly on the advice of <span class="per">Abigail Fillmore</span>, who was fond of the poetry of <span class="per">Lord Byron</span>. A fire in the 1870s destroyed town records, leaving little historical information about the town between <span class="date">1823</span> and <span class="date">1870</span>. The discovery of gypsum and the growth of the related cement industry helped promote the area. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 51.05 square miles (132.21 km2), of which 50.76 square miles (131.46 km2) is land and 0.29 square miles (0.74 km2), or 0.56%, is water.</p><br><br>
