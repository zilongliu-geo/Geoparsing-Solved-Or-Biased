  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Newmarket is an inner north-western suburb of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located approximately 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from the <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> central business district (CBD) and is surrounded by the suburbs of <span class="loc">Alderley</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Ashgrove</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Kelvin</span> Grove to the south, and Wilston to the east. It is an older, mostly residential suburb containing pre-war and post-war homes, including many fine examples of the Queenslander style of home. Over <span class="date">the last few years</span>, some medium-density townhouses and unit blocks have appeared as well. Newmarket was originally known as "The Three Mile Scrub" due to its distance from the city, and Ashgrove Avenue, which links Enoggera Road with <span class="per">Waterworks Road</span> to the west, was known as Three Mile Scrub Road. As settlement continued northward along <span class="loc">Kelvin</span> <span class="per">Grove Road</span> in the late 19th Century, livestock saleyards opened in the area bordered by Enoggera Road, <span class="per">Newmarket Road</span>, Wilston <span class="per">Road</span> and <span class="per">Alderson</span> Street, and were serviced by Newmarket train station after the rail line was extended from <span class="loc">Mayne</span> Junction in <span class="date">1899</span>. As urban development continued in Newmarket the saleyards were moved to <span class="loc">Cannon Hill</span> in <span class="date">1931</span>. <span class="org">Evidence</span> of the saleyards can still be seen in a number of narrow laneways, most likely old cattle tracks between stockyards, that still exist in this neighbourhood.</p><br><br>
