  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Yablonovka</span> (Russian: Яблоновка) is a rural locality (a selo) in <span class="loc">Rovensky District</span> of <span class="loc">Saratov Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located about 50 kilometers (31 mi) south of the <span class="loc">city of Engels</span> on the left bank of the <span class="loc">Volga River</span>. It was founded by <span class="loc">Volga</span> Germans in <span class="date">1767</span> and until <span class="date">1941</span> was known as <span class="loc">Lauwe</span>; other German names for the settlement were <span class="loc">Laube</span> and Schönfeld. It was founded on <span class="date">August 19, 1767</span> by the colonial agency <span class="per">LeRoy</span> and <span class="per">Pictet</span> and 169 Lutheran immigrants from <span class="loc">Germany</span>, following Catherine the Great's manifesto of <span class="date">July 22, 1763</span>, which guaranteed settlers in the Russian Empire free transport and monetary support in reaching their new colonies, free choice of settlement location, freedom of trade, freedom from taxation for <span class="date">thirty years</span>, interest-free loans for <span class="date">ten years</span>, freedom of religion, freedom from conscription in perpetuity, and freedom of return to their homelands, but at their own expense. The settlement was named <span class="loc">Lauwe</span> after the first elder of the village. Its original demarcation consisted of 4,455 desiatinas. The first forty-seven settler families came from <span class="loc">Bavaria</span> (<span class="loc">Nuremberg</span>), <span class="loc">Baden</span>, <span class="loc">Hesse</span> (<span class="per">Darmstadt</span> and <span class="per">Neu-Isenburg</span>), the Palatinate, the <span class="loc">Rhineland</span>, <span class="loc">Saxony</span>, and <span class="loc">Brandenburg</span>. It was one of the ten colonies established by <span class="per">LeRoy</span> and <span class="per">Pictet</span> south of <span class="loc">Saratov</span> on the "meadow" (eastern) side of the <span class="loc">Volga</span> and along its eastern tributary, the Terlyk. In later <span class="date">years</span>, it was also known under the German names of <span class="loc">Laube</span> and Schönfeld.</p><br><br>
