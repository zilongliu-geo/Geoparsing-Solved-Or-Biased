<p><span class="loc">Marshalltown</span> is a city in, and the county seat of, <span class="loc">Marshall County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 27,552 in the 2010 census, compared to 26,009 in 2000. Henry Anson was the first European settler in what is now called <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span>. In April 1851, Anson found what he described as “the prettiest place in Iowa.” On a high point between the <span class="loc">Iowa River</span> and <span class="loc">Linn Creek</span>, Anson built a log cabin. A plaque at 112 West Main Street marks the site of the cabin. In 1853 Anson named the town Marshall, after <span class="loc">Marshall</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, a former residence of his. The town became <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span> in 1862 because another Marshall already existed in <span class="loc">Henry County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span> (In 1880, Marshall's name changed to <span class="loc">Wayland</span>). With the help of Potawatomi chief Johnny Green, Anson persuaded early settlers to stay in the area. In the mid-1850s, Anson donated land for a county courthouse. Residents donated money for the building’s construction. In 1863 the title of county seat transferred from the village of <span class="loc">Marietta</span> to <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span>. The young town began growing. By 1900, <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span> had 10,000 residents. Many industries began developing in <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span>, like Fisher Controls, <span class="loc">Lennox International</span> and <span class="loc">Marshalltown</span> Company.</p>
