  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Sale is a city situated in the <span class="loc">Gippsland region</span> of <span class="org">the Australian</span> state of Victoria. It has a population (<span class="date">2011</span>) of 13,186. Sale has seen much development and redevelopment in <span class="date">the past decade</span>, one example being the multimillion-dollar redevelopment of the city's <span class="org">Port of Sale</span>. Two famous Gippsland explorers, <span class="per">Paul Strzelecki</span> and <span class="per">Angus McMillan</span>, passed through the immediate area around <span class="date">1840</span>. The first white settler was Archibald <span class="loc">McIntosh</span> who arrived in <span class="date">1844</span> and established his '<span class="loc">Flooding</span> Creek' property on the flood plain country which was duly inundated soon after his arrival. In the 1840s, drovers heading south to <span class="loc">Port Albert</span> crossed <span class="loc">Flooding</span> Creek and were confronted with the difficult marsh country around the <span class="loc">Thomson</span> and <span class="loc">Latrobe</span> rivers. A punt operated across the <span class="loc">Latrobe</span> River until a toll bridge was erected. A Post Office named <span class="loc">Flooding</span> Creek opened here on <span class="date">30 September 1848</span> being renamed, somewhat belatedly, as Sale on <span class="date">1 January 1854</span>. The first town plots went on sale in <span class="date">1850</span>. When the new settlement was gazetted in <span class="date">1851</span> it was named 'Sale' â€” a tribute to <span class="per">General Sir Robert Sale</span>, a British army officer who won fame in the first Afghan war before being killed in battle in <span class="loc">India</span> in <span class="date">1845</span>. An SBS TV documentary "<span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>: The Great Game"  claims that it is actually named after his wife, <span class="per">Lady Florentia Sale</span> (<span class="date">1790</span>-<span class="date">1853</span>), who wrote a famous journal of her experiences during the First Afghan War which became a best seller in the 1840s and was serialised in <span class="org">The Times</span> (<span class="loc">UK</span>) and possibly in <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Certainly, her letters to her husband were enthusiastically published in Australian papers.</p><br><br>
