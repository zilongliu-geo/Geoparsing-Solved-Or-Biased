<p><span class="loc">Monte Cristo</span> is a ghost town northwest of <span class="loc">Monte Cristo</span> Peak, in eastern <span class="loc">Snohomish County</span> in western <span class="loc">Washington</span>. Prospecting in the region began in the <span class="loc">Skykomish River</span> drainage with the Old <span class="loc">Cady</span> Trail used for access. In 1882 Elisha Hubbard improved the trail up the North Fork <span class="loc">Skykomish</span>, from Index to <span class="loc">Galena</span>, then north up the tributary <span class="loc">Silver Creek</span>. A boom shortly followed at <span class="loc">Mineral City</span>. The mineral belt was traced in various directions, including north over the divide between the <span class="loc">Skykomish</span> and <span class="loc">Sauk River</span> drainages. In the early summer of 1889 Joseph Pearsall saw glittering deposits and traced them north to Seventysix Gulch and the area that became <span class="loc">Monte Cristo</span>. A frenzy of claim staking quickly followed. In 1890 many miners hiked to <span class="loc">Monte Cristo</span> from the south by way of Index, <span class="loc">Galena</span>, and <span class="loc">Mineral City</span>, crossing the divide at first via <span class="loc">Wilmans</span> Pass and later via <span class="loc">Poodle Dog Pass</span>. In the fall of 1891 a narrow wagon road called the <span class="loc">Wilmans</span> or Pioneer Trail was completed from <span class="loc">Sauk City</span> on the <span class="loc">Skagit River</span> to <span class="loc">Monte Cristo</span>, allowing access from the north. A key stop on this road was the trading post at Orient, at the forks of the <span class="loc">Sauk</span> River. Today this area is known as <span class="loc">Bedal</span>. In the summer of 1891 it was discovered that <span class="loc">Monte Cristo</span> could be accessed via the <span class="loc">South Fork Stillaguamish River</span>. A surveyor named M.Q. Barlow blazed a route from <span class="loc">Silverton</span> to <span class="loc">Monte Cristo</span>. Mining interests Thomas Ewing and George W. Grayson, then Judge Edward Blewett, Judge Hiram G. Bond of Denver and New <span class="loc">York City</span>, and Seattle publisher <span class="loc">Leigh S. J</span>. Hunt, funded further work and soon a wagon road was built over <span class="loc">Barlow</span> Pass to join the <span class="loc">Sauk</span> wagon road. Later a railroad would be built over the same route.</p>
