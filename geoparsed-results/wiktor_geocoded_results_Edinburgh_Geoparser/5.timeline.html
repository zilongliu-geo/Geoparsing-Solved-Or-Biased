  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span> is a Chilean city and commune, located in the Colchagua valley, in the <span class="loc">O'Higgins Region</span>, located on the southern shore of the Tinguiririca river, 110 miles from Santiago, <span class="loc">Chile</span>'s capital city and 27 miles from <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>. There is no exact data about the founding of the city, although there is an official date when the city became a municipality in the <span class="date">year 1891</span>, the same year that <span class="loc">Pichilemu</span> did. From its beginnings, the town was a center of handcrafted artifacts and agricultural development, with wheat, tomatoes, and wine being the main products of the area. Because of the relation with countryside traditions from its beginning, <span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span> offers an authentic look at the rural traditions of Chilean culture expressed in the wine, the food, and the traditional sports such as the rodeo. The city of <span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span> was among those affected by the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">Chile</span> earthquake. According to the <span class="date">2002</span> census of the National Statistics Institute, <span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span> spans an area of 419.5 km2 (162 sq mi) and has 32,387 inhabitants (16,160 men and 16,227 women). Of these, 18,603 (57.4%) lived in urban areas and 13,784 (42.6%) in rural areas. The population grew by 10.7% (3,129 persons) between the <span class="date">1992</span> and 2002 censuses.</p><br><br>
