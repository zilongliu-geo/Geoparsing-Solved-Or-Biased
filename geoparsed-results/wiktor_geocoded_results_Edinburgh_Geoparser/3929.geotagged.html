<p>Chandler is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. and is part of the <span class="loc">Oklahoma City</span> Metropolitan Area. The population was 3,100 at the 2010 census, an increase from 2,842 at the 2000 census. Chandler is located northeast of <span class="loc">Oklahoma City</span> on SH-66 and I-44, and north of <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> on SH-18. Chandler was named after Judge George Chandler, a member of Congress and Assistant Secretary of the Interior. The site of Chandler was opened by a land run on September 28, 1891. The town had been planned to be opened on September 22, (the date of the Land Run of 1891) but the site survey had not been completed. The Chandler Post Office had opened September 21, the day before the planned run. When <span class="loc">Oklahoma county</span> A (<span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>) was organized, Chandler became the county seat. On May 30, 1897, a tornado destroyed most of the fledgling town and killed 14 residents. In 1891 the county government operated out of an office building until the original courthouse was built. The courthouse was destroyed by the tornado of 1897, and a two-story frame building was erected as a temporary courthouse was erected on the present site. This building was removed in 1907 to make way for a stone courthouse. This third courthouse burned down on December 23, 1967 and the current courthouse was set in its place.</p>
