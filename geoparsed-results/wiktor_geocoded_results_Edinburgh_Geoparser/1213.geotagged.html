<p><span class="loc">Bedford</span> is a suburban community of <span class="loc">Halifax</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It was an independent town from 1980-1996. <span class="loc">Bedford</span> lies on the northwestern end of <span class="loc">Bedford Basin</span>, an extension of the <span class="loc">Halifax Harbour</span> and ends just before <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> Highway 102 and Bedford Bypass next to Lower Sackville . <span class="loc">Bedford</span> is located at the junctions of Trunks 1, 2, and 7. Father Le Loutre's War began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish <span class="loc">Halifax</span> with 13 transports on June 21, 1749. By unilaterally establishing <span class="loc">Halifax</span> the British were violating earlier treaties with the Mi'kmaq (1726), which were signed after Father Rale's War. The British quickly began to build other settlements. To guard against Mi'kmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in <span class="loc">Halifax</span> (1749), <span class="loc">Bedford</span> (Fort Sackville) (1749), <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> (1750), <span class="loc">Lunenburg</span> (1753) and <span class="loc">Lawrencetown</span> (1754). The history of <span class="loc">Bedford</span> began when Governor Edward Cornwallis organised his men and began the construction of a road leading to <span class="loc">Minas Basin</span> on the <span class="loc">Bay of Fundy</span> after establishing the garrison at <span class="loc">Halifax</span>. To protect it, he hired John Gorham and his Rangers to erect a fort on the shore of <span class="loc">Bedford Basin</span>. It was named Fort Sackville after Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset. The area around the fort became known as Sackville until the mid-1850s when it became <span class="loc">Bedford</span>.</p>
