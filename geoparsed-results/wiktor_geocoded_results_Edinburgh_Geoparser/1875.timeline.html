  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Moscow</span> /ˈmɒskoʊ/ is a city in <span class="loc">Stevens County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 310. The settlement of <span class="loc">Moscow</span> was established in <span class="date">1887</span>. One tradition says, the community was named for a member of de Soto's expedition, the maestro de campo (field commander) <span class="per">Luis de Moscoso</span> (the source mistakenly indicates <span class="per">Francisco Coronado</span> southwest expedition, but at this time <span class="per">Moscoso</span> was a member of de Soto's expedition, furthermore he took command of the expedition after de Soto's death). During the settlement name registration there were a series of mistakes. The residents, in their application for a post office, had shortened it to <span class="loc">Mosco</span>. A postal clerk in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, upon receipt of their petition, being in a helpful spirit, and thinking the hay-seeds in the west didn't know their spelling, added a "w" to the name, changing it to <span class="loc">Moscow</span>. The first post office in <span class="loc">Moscow</span> was established on <span class="date">April 28, 1888</span>, when it was moved from <span class="loc">Valparaiso</span> (<span class="date">now</span> ghost town), which was located approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Moscow</span>.</p><br><br>
