  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>City woman fined for false assault accusation. <span class="loc">COLUMBUS</span> -- A 27-year-old Columbus woman who admitted to falsely accusing a Meadow Grove man of sexual assault in <span class="date">May 2008</span> has been fined and ordered to pay restitution for lying about the incident. <span class="per">Janae McMahon</span> was fined $150 and ordered to pay $1,671 restitution on <span class="date">Wednesday</span> in <span class="org">Platte County Court</span> for her conviction of attempted false reporting. <span class="per">McMahon</span> pleaded no contest to the reduced charge in connection with the <span class="date">May 28</span> incident after recanting her story of a sexual assault stemming from an encounter with the man she met over the Internet. The defendant, who was initially charged with false reporting, successfully completed court-ordered mental health counseling prior to her sentencing. <span class="per">McMahon</span> paid the restitution for the police and medical expenses of the assault investigation <span class="date">late last year</span>. <span class="loc">Platte County</span> Attorney <span class="per">Sandra Allen</span> said she hoped the sentence imposed on <span class="per">McMahon</span> didn’t make law enforcement investigators “gun-shy” about making sexual assault arrests in <span class="date">the future</span>. “On the face of it, (a fine and restitution) is not much of a deterrent to someone making a false accusation,’’ <span class="per">Allen</span> said. On the other hand, people who falsely accuse others of crimes probably aren’t deterred by the threat of punishment, she said. Defense attorney <span class="per">Denise Kracl</span> said <span class="date">Thursday</span> <span class="per">McMahon</span>’s successful completion of counseling, which her client began even before being ordered to by the court, was a factor at sentencing. The judge checked <span class="per">McMahon</span>’s progress and compliance with counseling requirements over <span class="date">several months</span> and was “very fair” in giving her that opportunity, <span class="per">Kracl</span> said. “This has been a really unfortunate situation for everyone involved,’’ the defense attorney said. “<span class="per">Janae</span> is resuming her life and doing the best she can to put the whole incident behind her. This is as good of an outcome as she could have expected.” False reporting is a Class I misdemeanor is punishable by a maximum of <span class="date">one year</span> imprisonment, $1,000 fine or both and no minimum sentence. Attempted false reporting is a Class II misdemeanor is punishable by a maximum of <span class="date">six months</span> in jail, $1,000 fine or both and no minimum sentence. The county attorney’s office dismissed a first-degree sexual assault charge against 38-year-old <span class="per">Richard Pehrson</span> II of Meadow Grove in late-June. The man faced <span class="date">up to 50 years</span> in prison if convicted. <span class="per">McMahon</span> later recanted her story after <span class="per">Pehrson</span> underwent a polygraph examination, and she was brought in by law enforcement authorities for further questioning. <span class="per">Pehrson</span> was held for about <span class="date">a week</span> in the <span class="loc">Platte County</span> Detention Facility following his arrest. His bond was set at 10 percent of $150,000 and he was placed on unpaid administrative leave from his job as a psych tech at <span class="org">Faith Regional Center</span> in <span class="loc">Norfolk</span>. <span class="per">Pehrson</span>, who also served as a volunteer firefighter, got his job back when <span class="per">McMahon</span>’s lie came to light. <span class="per">Allen</span> sent letters to <span class="per">Pehrson</span>’s employer and the fire department explaining how he had been falsely accused in the case. “He was not terribly angry,’’ said <span class="per">Allen</span> recalling a telephone conversation with the Meadow Grove man. “He was happy to have his name cleared.” <span class="per">Pehrson</span> could not be reached <span class="date">this week</span> for his reaction to his accuser’s sentencing. The Meadow Grove man and city woman, according to court documents, met over the Internet in early-May and were corresponding by e-mail for <span class="date">three weeks</span> before the incident. The two met once in a public park in <span class="loc">Norfolk</span>. <span class="date">Later in May</span>, <span class="per">Pehrson</span> was invited by <span class="per">McMahon</span> to <span class="loc">Columbus</span> late the <span class="date">night of May 27</span> to watch a movie. In the early-morning hours of <span class="date">May 28</span>, <span class="per">Pehrson</span> said the two had consensual sex. In the <span class="date">days</span> following the incident, <span class="per">McMahon</span> sent <span class="per">Pehrson</span> e-mails saying how much she missed talking to him. That’s not the story <span class="per">McMahon</span> initially told authorities. According to the arrest affidavit filed in the case by Columbus Investigator <span class="per">Gregory Sealock</span>, the woman did invite <span class="loc">Pehrson</span> over to her home to watch a movie, but she later got tired and wanted to go to bed. The woman said she allowed <span class="per">Pehrson</span> to sleep on her couch because he had been drinking beer and didn’t want to drive to his Meadow Grove home, <span class="per">Sealock</span> stated. The woman later “awoke to find <span class="per">Pehrson</span> in bed with her” and described a sexual assault in graphic detail. Defense attorney <span class="per">Donna Tonderum</span>, who represented <span class="per">Pehrson</span> while serving as a deputy in the <span class="loc">Platte County</span> Public Defender’s Office, said her former client felt “humiliated by the whole experience.” <span class="per">Tonderum</span> said <span class="per">Pehrson</span> was expecting <span class="per">McMahon</span> to spend some time in the county lockup. “I think he’d be very disappointed by the outcome,” she said.</p><br><br>
