<p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> (/ˈkæmbrɪdʒ/ ) is a hamlet in the <span class="loc">district of Stroud</span>, in the <span class="loc">county of Gloucestershire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies on the A38 road between <span class="loc">Bristol</span> and <span class="loc">Gloucester</span>. It is about 3 miles (5 km) from <span class="loc">Dursley</span> and about 11 miles (18 km) from <span class="loc">Gloucester</span>. The hamlet lies in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Slimbridge</span> and takes its name from the <span class="loc">River Cam</span> which flows through it. It has one public house, the George Inn. A second, the <span class="loc">White Lion</span>, closed and became a private residence. There are regular buses to <span class="loc">Bristol</span>, <span class="loc">Gloucester</span>, <span class="loc">Stroud</span> and <span class="loc">Thornbury</span>. In nearby <span class="loc">Slimbridge</span> is the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, that was founded by Peter Scott. In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of <span class="loc">England</span> and <span class="loc">Wales</span> described <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> like this: <span class="loc">CAMBRIDGE</span>, a hamlet in <span class="loc">Shinbridge parish</span>, <span class="loc">Gloucester</span>; on the river Cam, 4 miles NNW of <span class="loc">Dursley</span>. It has a post office under <span class="loc">Stonehouse</span>. It was known to the Saxons as Cwatbriege; and was the scene of a battle, in the time of Edward the Elder, between the Saxons and the Danes.</p>
