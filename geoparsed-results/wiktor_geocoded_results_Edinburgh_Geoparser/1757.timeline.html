  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Nelson</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Pickens</span> and <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a total population of 1,314. It is part of the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> metropolitan area. The city is named for <span class="per">John Nelson</span>, early landowner, farmer, and rifle maker. A railroad line built in <span class="date">1883</span> from <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, through the valleys and mountain passes of <span class="loc">Cherokee County</span> to <span class="per">Nelson</span> and <span class="per">Tate</span>, made possible the development of large marble quarries. One of the largest marble veins in the world is in <span class="loc">Pickens County</span>, running at least 4 miles (6 km) long. It is a half-mile deep and almost that wide in places. Over 60 percent of the monuments in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span> are made from <span class="loc">Pickens County</span> marble. The Marble Museum is located in the <span class="loc">Nelson City</span> Hall and features a year-round exhibit that includes "examples of fine marble and shows the history of marble mining in <span class="loc">Pickens County</span>." Many stone cutters and other workers who migrated from either <span class="loc">Italy</span> or <span class="loc">Scotland</span> in the early <span class="date">years</span> of the industry settled in <span class="per">Nelson</span> to work in the area's marble industry. <span class="date">Today</span> the <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Northeastern Railroad operates between <span class="per">Tate</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, and the CSX interchange at Elizabeth (Marietta) <span class="date">five days</span> <span class="date">a week</span>. The <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Marble rail lines at <span class="per">Tate</span> and <span class="loc">Marble Hill</span>, and the Blue Ridge Scenic Railroad at Blue Ridge, <span class="loc">Georgia</span> are also operated by GNRR. Their website also states the "GNRR runs through a <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Marble facility that no is no longer served by rail" at <span class="per">Nelson</span>.</p><br><br>
