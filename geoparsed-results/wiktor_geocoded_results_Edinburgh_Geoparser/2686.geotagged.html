<p><span class="loc">Norwich</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Chenango County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Surrounded on all sides by the town of <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, the city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Chenango County</span>. The name is taken from <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Its population was 7,190 at the 2010 census. Lt. Warren Eaton Airport (OIC), serving the area, is located north of the city in the town of <span class="loc">North Norwich</span>. The first settlers arrived around 1788. The town of <span class="loc">Norwich</span> was formed in 1793 from the towns of Union (now in <span class="loc">Broome County</span>) and <span class="loc">Bainbridge</span>. Afterwards, <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, as a "mother town" of the county, lost substantial territory in the formation of new towns. In 1806, <span class="loc">Norwich</span> gave up territory to form the towns of <span class="loc">Pharsalia</span>, <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> and Preston. More of <span class="loc">Norwich</span> was lost in 1807 to form parts of the towns of <span class="loc">New Berlin</span> and <span class="loc">Columbus</span>. In 1808 and 1820, <span class="loc">Norwich</span> exchanged territory with the town of Preston. The central community of <span class="loc">Norwich</span> set itself off from the town in 1816 by incorporating as a village, later becoming the <span class="loc">city of Norwich</span> in 1914.</p>
