<p><span class="loc">Iba</span> is a community in the Ifelodun Local Government Area of Ọṣun State, <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. <span class="loc">Iba</span> is in the Ifelodun Local Government Area in the northeast of Ọṣun State a few kilometers northeast of <span class="loc">Ikirun</span>, east of <span class="loc">Inisa</span> and southeast of <span class="loc">Okuku</span>. The Jalumi War of 1 November 1878 took place in the hilly country of the northeast of Osun State in the area that includes <span class="loc">Ikirun</span>, <span class="loc">Iba</span>, <span class="loc">Inisa</span>, <span class="loc">Okuku</span> and Eko-Ende. It was one of the series of civil wars in Yorubaland between 1793 and 1893. The town is mentioned in a report of 1911 of a visit by the resident Captain Cyril Hammond Elgee and the Ibadan chiefs to hear a boundary dispute between <span class="loc">Iba</span> and nearby <span class="loc">Okuku</span>. The dispute was unresolved until the late 1930s. The ruling house of <span class="loc">Iba</span> claims that they came from <span class="loc">Ife</span> long before the people of <span class="loc">Ikuku</span> came to the region. In 2011, a dispute over which ruling house should become the next traditional ruler, or <span class="loc">Eburu</span> of <span class="loc">Iba</span>, became a subject of litigation after the demise of <span class="loc">Oba</span> Ibrahim Bamigbade. <span class="loc">Olugbuyi</span> ruling house claimed that the title should alternate between the <span class="loc">Olugbuyi</span> and <span class="loc">Okiti</span> ruling houses, and that the Ijadunoye and Alamu were families in the <span class="loc">Okiti</span> ruling house. Alamu and Ijadunoye ruling houses claimed that the Ijadunoye and Alamu were separate ruling houses and there had never been any <span class="loc">Okiti</span> ruling house in <span class="loc">Iba</span> history, and the stool should rotate to them too. in 2014, Justice Afolabi of High Court of Osogbo ruled in favor of Alamu Ruling House and ordered the installation of Prof. Adekunle Okunoye of Alamu Ruling House having been duly nominated by his ruling house and unanimously approved by the kingmakers.</p>
