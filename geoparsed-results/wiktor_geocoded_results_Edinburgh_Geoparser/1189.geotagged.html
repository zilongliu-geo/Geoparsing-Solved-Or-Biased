<p><span class="loc">Milan</span> /ˈmaɪlən/ is a city in Monroe and Washtenaw counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 5,836 at the 2010 census. About 60% of the city's area and 75% of its residents are located on the <span class="loc">Washtenaw County</span> side adjacent to <span class="loc">York Township</span> in <span class="loc">Washtenaw County</span>; while 40% percent of the city's area and 25% of its residents are located on the <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> side adjacent to <span class="loc">Milan</span> Township. The city was founded in 1831 by John Marvin, Bethuel Hack, and Harmon Allen. Hack was the first postmaster, and he named the community "Farmer" since everyone there was a farmer. Drug store owner Henry Tolan took over as postmaster and renamed the community "Tolanville" after himself. Next, David <span class="loc">Woodard</span> became the post master, with the post office in his flour mill. He renamed the community "Woodard's Mills." The postmaster in <span class="loc">Washington</span> <span class="loc">D.C.</span> noticed the confusion caused by this swift change in names and decreed that it would henceforth be called "<span class="loc">Milan</span>" after the neighboring <span class="loc">Milan</span> Township. French settlers in the area named the township "<span class="loc">Milan</span>" because they once hoped to produce grapes and wine in the area, so the Italian city by that name seemed appropriate, given <span class="loc">Italy</span>'s reputation for wine-making. The river going through <span class="loc">Milan</span> and <span class="loc">Milan</span> township is the Saline River, part of the <span class="loc">River Raisin</span> watershed. "<span class="loc">River Raisin</span>" refers to Raisin, the French word for grape. Small wild grapes were growing on the banks of the river, so early French settlers in the Monroe area hoped that this area would be wine country. Just southeast of <span class="loc">Milan</span>, along Plank road, is an old community by the name of "Grape" which is a reflection of this desire to create a wine producing area. <span class="loc">Milan</span> became a village in 1885. It continued as a village until 1967, when it was incorporated as a city.</p>
