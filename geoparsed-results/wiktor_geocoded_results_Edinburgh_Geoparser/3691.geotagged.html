<p><span class="loc">Denton</span> is a small village inside the town boundary of <span class="loc">Newhaven</span>, <span class="loc">East Sussex</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It adjoins the suburbs of <span class="loc">South Heighton</span> and <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> and backs onto the South Downs The Manor of <span class="loc">Denton</span> was held in Saxon times by Earl Godwin, Father of King Harold. It seems likely that <span class="loc">Denton</span> was destroyed during the Saxon rebellion of 1068. It does not appear in the Doomsday book of 1086. The name <span class="loc">Denton</span> comes from Old English and means farmstead or village in a valley. Denton's church, St. Leonard's, was first built around 1288, later extended and carefully restored during the Decorated Period. The walls are of flint and stone and the Vestry was added during the 20th Century. The remains of what is thought to have been a Priest's House in the west end of the churchyard, dating from about 1280, have recently been partly restored. The village has a junior school and one pub, the "<span class="loc">Flying Fish</span>" (originally named the "Kicking Donkey") which dates back to the 18th Century. Ralph Reader who created the Gang Show for the Boy Scout movement was from the village and the local Scout pack are known as "The 2nd <span class="loc">Denton</span> &amp; <span class="loc">South Heighton</span> (Ralph Reader's Own)".</p>
