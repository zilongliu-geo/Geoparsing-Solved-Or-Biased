<p><span class="loc">Dingle</span> (known locally as the <span class="loc">Dingle</span>) is an inner-city area of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>, <span class="loc">Merseyside</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is located to the south of the city, bordered by the adjoining <span class="loc">districts of Toxteth and Aigburth</span>. At the 2001 Census, the population was recorded at 13,246. <span class="loc">Dingle</span> is an area entirely within the boundaries of the old <span class="loc">Toxteth</span> Park. It is named after <span class="loc">Dingle Brook</span> (<span class="loc">Dingle</span> meaning a wooded valley), which rose at High <span class="loc">Park Street</span> and roughly followed Park Road, towards the Old <span class="loc">Toxteth</span> Chapel, just south of <span class="loc">Dingle</span> Lane and entered the <span class="loc">River Mersey</span> at Knott's Hole, which was a narrow bay or inlet next to where the <span class="loc">Dingle</span> flowed out to the <span class="loc">Mersey</span>. On either side were steep rocky cliffs, with <span class="loc">Dingle Point</span> to the south west. In the 1850s the <span class="loc">Dingle</span> area was purely rural. <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> lay to the north west, but this was an area of large houses, vast gardens, babbling streams and a long beach. It was a mainly Protestant area which developed from the influx of Welsh settlers, whilst the north end of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> such as <span class="loc">Everton</span> and <span class="loc">Vauxhall</span> was settled by Irish immigrants, and became mainly Catholic.</p>
