<p><span class="loc">Bradford</span> /ˈbrædfərd/ is in the Metropolitan Borough of the City of <span class="loc">Bradford</span> in <span class="loc">West Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, in the foothills of the <span class="loc">Pennines</span> 8.6 miles (14 km) west of <span class="loc">Leeds</span>, and 16 miles (26 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Wakefield</span>. <span class="loc">Bradford</span> became a municipal borough in 1847, and received its charter as a city in 1897. Following local government reform in 1974, city status was bestowed upon the wider metropolitan borough. <span class="loc">Bradford</span> forms part of the <span class="loc">West Yorkshire Urban</span> Area conurbation which in 2001 had a population of 1.5 million and is the fourth largest urban area in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> with the <span class="loc">Bradford</span> subdivision of the aforementioned urban area having a population of 528,155. Historically a part of the <span class="loc">West Riding</span> of <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">Bradford</span> rose to prominence during the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture, particularly wool. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the earliest industrialised settlements, rapidly becoming the "wool capital of the world". The area's access to a supply of coal, iron ore and soft water facilitated the growth of <span class="loc">Bradford</span>'s manufacturing base, which, as textile manufacture grew, led to an explosion in population and was a stimulus to civic investment; <span class="loc">Bradford</span> has a large amount of listed Victorian architecture including the grand <span class="loc">Italianate City</span> Hall.</p>
