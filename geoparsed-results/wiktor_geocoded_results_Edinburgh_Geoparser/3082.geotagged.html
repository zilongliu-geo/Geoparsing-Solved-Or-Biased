<p>The <span class="loc">City of Monterey</span> in <span class="loc">Monterey County</span> is located on the southern edge of <span class="loc">Monterey Bay</span>, on Central California's Pacific coast in <span class="loc">California</span>. It stands at an elevation of 26 feet (8 m) above sea level, on a land area of 8.466 sq mi (21.927 kmÂ²). The 2010 census recorded a population of 27,810. <span class="loc">Monterey</span> was the capital of Alta California under both <span class="loc">Spain</span> and <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. It was the only port of entry for taxable goods in <span class="loc">California</span>. In 1846 the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> flag was raised over the Customs House, and <span class="loc">California</span> became part of the <span class="loc">United States</span> after the ensuing Mexican-American War. The city had California's first theater, public building, public library, publicly funded school, printing press, and newspaper. The city and surrounding area have attracted artists since the late 19th century and many celebrated painters and writers have lived there. Until the 1950s, there was an abundant fishery. Among <span class="loc">Monterey</span>'s notable present-day attractions are the <span class="loc">Monterey Bay Aquarium</span>, <span class="loc">Cannery Row</span>, <span class="loc">Fisherman's Wharf</span> and the annual <span class="loc">Monterey</span> Jazz Festival. Long before the arrival of Spanish explorers, the Rumsen Ohlone tribe, one of seven linguistically distinct Ohlone groups in <span class="loc">California</span>, inhabited the area now known as <span class="loc">Monterey</span>. They subsisted by hunting, fishing and gathering food on and around the biologically rich <span class="loc">Monterey</span> Peninsula. Researchers have found a number of shell middens in the area and, based on the archaeological evidence, concluded the Ohlone's primary marine food consisted at various times of mussels and abalone. A number of midden sites have been located along about 12 miles (19 km) of rocky coast on the <span class="loc">Monterey</span> Peninsula from the current site of Fishermans' Wharf in <span class="loc">Monterey</span> to <span class="loc">Carmel</span>.</p>
