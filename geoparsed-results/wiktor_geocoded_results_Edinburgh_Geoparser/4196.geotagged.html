<p><span class="loc">Dundee</span> (29°33′S 151°51′E) is a rural locality about 40 kilometres north of <span class="loc">Glen Innes</span> on the Northern Tablelands, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is situated on the New <span class="loc">England</span> Highway at the <span class="loc">Severn River</span> in <span class="loc">Severn</span> parish, <span class="loc">Gough County</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>. The elevation is 985 metres. In 1838 John Baker and several others left <span class="loc">Sydney</span> to seek land and setup stations on the Northern Tablelands. After the others selected their land Baker continued north to secure the lease of 40,000 acres (160 km2), which he called "Dareel Plains", later to become <span class="loc">Dundee</span>. By 1844 the property had been sold several times before Major Archibald Clunes Innes took it over that year. At one stage Innes was one of the wealthiest men in the Colony, but suffered heavily during the 1840s depression and was declared bankrupt in 1852. In 1845 the newly established <span class="loc">Dundee</span> flour mill was the first flour mill <span class="loc">north of Aberdeen</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>. Major Innes built the ‘<span class="loc">Golden Fleece</span>’ Hotel at <span class="loc">Dundee</span> in 1847, to become one of the first three hotels built in <span class="loc">New England</span>. The large colonial style brick building was the first important building to be erected near the shallow river crossing.</p>
