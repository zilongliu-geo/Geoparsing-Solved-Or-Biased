<p>Milton is a borough in <span class="loc">Northumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, on the <span class="loc">West Branch Susquehanna River</span>, 50 miles (80 km) north of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>. It is about 10 miles upriver from the mouth of the <span class="loc">West Branch Susquehanna River</span> and about 30 miles downriver of <span class="loc">Williamsport</span>. Settled in 1770, it was incorporated in 1817, and is governed by a charter that was revised in 1890. Formerly, its extensive manufacturing plants included car and woodworking machinery shops; rolling, flour, knitting, planing, and saw mills; washer, nut, and bolt works; and furniture, shoe, couch, nail, fly net, bamboo novelty, and paper-box factories. In 1900, 6,175 people lived in Milton. In 1940, 8,313 people lived there. The population was 6,650 at the 2000 census, and 7,042 at the 2010 census. The <span class="loc">Milton Historic District</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Canal and Limestone Run Aqueduct, <span class="loc">Milton Armory</span>, and <span class="loc">Milton Freight Station</span> are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At the turn of the 20th century, several industrial and manufacturing companies were located within the borough. The six principal industries were Samuel J. Shimer &amp; Sons, the Milton Manufacturing Company, the American Car and Foundry Company, the F.A. Godcharles Company, the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> H. Souter Silk Company, and the West Branch Novelty Company. Many smaller businesses flourished in parallel with the large manufacturing companies during this early period, which made the borough an industrial center in the region at the time.</p>
