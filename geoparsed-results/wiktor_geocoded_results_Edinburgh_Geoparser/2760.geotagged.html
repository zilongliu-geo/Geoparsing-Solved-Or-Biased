<p>La Marina is a coastal village administered by the <span class="loc">city of Elche</span>, in the <span class="loc">province of Alicante</span> on <span class="loc">Spain</span>'s <span class="loc">Costa Blanca</span>. Nearby inland is a large urbanisation built from the mid-1980s onwards confusingly also called La Marina: more correctly called Urbanisation La Marina. The village is on the <span class="loc">Costa Azul</span> bus route providing access northwards to <span class="loc">Alicante</span> and southbound to <span class="loc">Torrevieja</span> and ultimately <span class="loc">Cartagena</span>. La Marina is a district in the municipality of <span class="loc">Elche</span>, <span class="loc">province of Alicante</span>. It is located by the Mediterranean sea, by the mountain range of <span class="loc">Sierra del Molar</span>, very close to <span class="loc">Guardamar del Segura</span> and by the salt pans (Salinas) of <span class="loc">Santa Pola</span>. The 1'5 km long beach receives the same name. The main access to La Marina is through national road N-332. La Marina has non-urban beaches, systems of dunes and large pine woods. The main beach (Las Pesqueras) is over 1100 metres long, although it continues towards the south and is connected to the Tusales beach of <span class="loc">Guardamar del Segura</span>. The history of La Marina is very influenced by the disappearance of the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> de As√≠s village in <span class="loc">Sierra del Molar</span> mountain range, as it was after the abandonment of the settlement when La Marina started to constitute a town.</p>
