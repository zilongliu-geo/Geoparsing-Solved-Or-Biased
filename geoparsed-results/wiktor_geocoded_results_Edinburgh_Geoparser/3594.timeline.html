  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Goshen</span> is an unincorporated community located within Middle Township, in Cape <span class="loc">May County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> (08218). Route 47, also known as Delsea Drive, runs directly through the center of the community. The area was first settled by <span class="per">Aaron Leaming</span> who began raising cattle in here in <span class="date">1693</span>. By <span class="date">1710</span> there was a settlement. Goshen’s first industry was a king crab mill and a canning factory, but shipbuilding and lumbering industries flourished. The Garrison shipyard on <span class="loc">Goshen Creek</span> had stocks for the simultaneous construction of two vessels, which, upon being launched, were slipped into the water sideways. Between <span class="date">1859</span> and <span class="date">1898</span>, twenty-five ships of record were built there, along with many smaller craft. Around <span class="date">1900</span>, Cape <span class="loc">May County</span>'s shipbuilding industry was shut down. The last ship launched by <span class="loc">Goshen</span> shipyard was the “<span class="org">Diamond</span>” in <span class="date">1898</span>. Due to the lasting effects of the brackish water there, the remains of the docks are still visible at the end of Goshen Landing Road during low tide. The Tavern House (circa <span class="date">1725</span>), located on the corner of Route 47 and Goshen Landing Road is one of the oldest original homes in Cape <span class="loc">May County</span>. It was at different period through the <span class="date">years</span>, a tavern, hotel, dentist office and residence. While significant changes were made over the <span class="date">years</span>, much of the original workmanship is still evident. Rough hewn logs still support the house and wooden pegs can be found holding the rafters in place.</p><br><br>
