<p><span class="loc">Chalai Bazaar</span> (<span class="loc">Chala Market</span>) is an old shopping area in Thiruvananthapuram, <span class="loc">Kerala</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>. The market is spread through the narrow 2 km road connecting Killippalam and East Fort, which runs from East to West. The by-lanes too have an array of shops. There is virtually nothing that is not available in <span class="loc">Chala</span>, from fruits and vegetables, gold and silver to paint and hardware. Most shops are open from 9 am to 8 pm daily except <span class="loc">Sundays</span>. The place gets very crowded in the evenings. A number of good eateries also dot the area. Chalai Market was officially established towards the end of 18th century by Raja Kesavadas, <span class="loc">Dewan</span> of Travancore. The idea was to make <span class="loc">Chalai</span> bazar the central point for the supply of commodities to the Travancore kingdom. The <span class="loc">Killi</span> and Karamana rivers nearby was used to transport goods to the market. Chalai market is located opposite to the East fort central bus stand where all the city buses terminate. The main entrance is located at the junction between Gandhi park and KSRTC bus garage.The approach from East Fort is right in the city centre. It is well connected to all parts of the city.</p>
