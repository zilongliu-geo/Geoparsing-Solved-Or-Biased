<p><span class="loc">Albany</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Ocean View</span>) is a city in <span class="loc">Alameda County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 18,539 at the 2010 census. In 1908, a group of local women protested the dumping of <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> garbage in their community. Armed with two shotguns and a twenty-two-caliber rifle, they confronted the drivers of the wagons near what is now the corner of San Pablo Avenue and Buchanan Street. The women told the drivers of the horse-drawn garbage wagons to go home, which they did quickly and without complaint. Shortly thereafter, the residents of the town voted to incorporate as the City of <span class="loc">Ocean View</span>. In 1909, voters changed the name of the city, primarily to distinguish the city from the adjacent section of <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> which had previously been named <span class="loc">Ocean View</span>. On a vote of 38 to 6 the city was renamed in honor of <span class="loc">Albany</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, the birthplace of the city's first mayor, Frank Roberts. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.5 square miles (14 km2), of which 1.8 square miles (4.7 km2) is land and 3.7 square miles (9.6 km2) (67.28%) is water.</p>
