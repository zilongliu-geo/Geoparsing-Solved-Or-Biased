  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>An extensive vaccination campaign across 19 West and Central African countries is to begin <span class="date">today</span> in an attempt to stem a year-long polio epidemic in the region. The United Nations and international aid agencies plan to immunize 85 million children under five. More than 400,000 volunteers and health workers will take part in the campaign, visiting children in their homes. The current polio epidemic has been going on for <span class="date">a year</span> and there have been outbreaks in <span class="date">the last six months</span> in <span class="loc">Burkina Faso</span>, <span class="loc">Cameroon</span>, <span class="loc">Chad</span>, <span class="loc">Guinea</span>, <span class="loc">Liberia</span>, <span class="loc">Mali</span>, <span class="loc">Mauritania</span>, <span class="loc">Senegal</span> and <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span>. These countries will be the focus of the campaign, along with <span class="loc">Benin</span>, <span class="loc">Cape Verde</span>, <span class="loc">Central African Republic</span>, CÃ´te d'<span class="loc">Ivoire</span>, <span class="loc">Gambia</span>, <span class="loc">Ghana</span>, <span class="loc">Guinea-Bissau</span>, <span class="loc">Niger</span>, <span class="loc">Nigeria</span> and <span class="loc">Togo</span>. Efforts <span class="date">last year</span> failed to halt the disease because not enough children were vaccinated. The program failed in part because local religious leaders told parents that the vaccines would sterilize their children, or cause AIDS. As well as targeting more children, <span class="date">today</span>'s campaign features better training for volunteers. Vaccinations will be repeated on <span class="date">26 March</span> in the six key countries, and again on <span class="date">24 April</span> for all 19 countries involved. The campaign is funded by Rotary International who have provided $30 million. In <span class="date">2009</span> the World Health Organization reported that approximately 1,600 children were paralysed by the virus worldwide.</p><br><br>
