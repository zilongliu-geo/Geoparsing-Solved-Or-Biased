<p>Waterloo is a city in <span class="loc">Southern Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is the smallest of the three cities in the <span class="loc">Regional Municipality of Waterloo</span>, and is adjacent to the <span class="loc">city of Kitchener</span>. Kitchener and Waterloo are often jointly referred to as "Kitchener-Waterloo", "KW", or "the Tri-City" (to include the <span class="loc">City of Cambridge</span>), although they have separate city governments. There have been several attempts to amalgamate the two cities (sometimes with the <span class="loc">city of Cambridge</span> as well), but none have been successful. At the time of the 2011 census, Waterloo had a population of 98,780. Waterloo started on land that was part of a parcel of 675,000 acres (2,730 km2) assigned in 1784 to the Iroquois alliance that made up the League of Six Nations. The rare gift of land from <span class="loc">Britain</span> to indigenous people took place to compensate for wartime alliance during the American Rebellion, (later known as the American Revolution). Almost immediately—and with much controversy—the native groups began to sell some of the land. Between 1796 and 1798, 93,000 acres (380 km2) were sold through a Crown Grant to Richard Beasley, with the Six Nations Indians continuing to hold the mortgage on the lands.</p>
