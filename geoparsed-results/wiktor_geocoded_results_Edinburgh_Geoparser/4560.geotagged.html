<p>Anton is a city in <span class="loc">Hockley County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,200 at the 2000 census. Anton was founded in 1924 near the center of the north pasture of the former Spade Ranch when ranch owner William Leonard Ellwood contracted with the Anton Townsite Company to plat a town at the site of Danforth Switch, a spur of the <span class="loc">Pecos</span> and Northern <span class="loc">Texas Railway</span>. The town was named in honor of J.F. Anton, a <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> railroad executive. Anton's first mayor was Paul Grover <span class="loc">Whitfield</span>, who was born in July of 1908 so in 1924 was only 16 or 17 years old, but told everyone he was 18 and so was able to accept the position. He's therefore on record as being the youngest mayor ever in the state of <span class="loc">Texas</span> at the time and since he was under the age of 18 it's likely that record stands to this day and will for all time. It's unclear if there was an election or if he simply volunteered for the position. In those days an ID was not required because most things were done with a handshake.</p>
