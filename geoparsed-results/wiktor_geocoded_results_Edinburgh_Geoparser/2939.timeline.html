  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Auburn is a city in <span class="loc">King County</span> and additionally <span class="loc">Pierce County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>; with the majority of spatial land area within <span class="loc">King County</span>. The population was 70,180 at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. Auburn is a suburb in the <span class="loc">Seattle metropolitan</span> area. Auburn is currently ranked the fourteenth largest city in the state of <span class="loc">Washington</span>. Auburn is bordered by the cities of <span class="loc">Federal Way</span>, <span class="loc">Pacific</span>, and <span class="loc">Algona</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Sumner</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Kent</span> to the north, and unincorporated <span class="loc">King County</span> to the east. The Muckleshoot Indian Reservation is in or near the southern city limits. Auburn was originally incorporated as Slaughter, <span class="loc">Washington</span> after <span class="per">Lt. William Slaughter</span>, who died in a skirmish fighting Native Americans which are <span class="date">now</span> apart of the modern day Muckleshoot tribe in <span class="date">1855</span>. At the time, the main hotel in town was called the "Slaughter House." In <span class="date">1893</span>, a large group of settlers from Auburn, <span class="loc">New York</span>, moved to Slaughter, and renamed the town to "Auburn." Due to this history, when Auburn was building its second high school in the mid-1990s, there was a grass-roots effort to name the high school "Slaughter High School," but it was eventually decided that the name would be "<span class="org">Auburn Riverside High School</span>," whose mascots are the Ravens.</p><br><br>
