<p><span class="loc">Headington</span>: Mum jailed for fake passport. A FAILED asylum seeker was jailed for 11 months yesterday after using a fake passport to work as a carer. Pauline Munene, 49, used a fake Kenyan passport to gain work with Chrysalis Community Care, formerly known as Blue Arrow, while living in <span class="loc">Gladstone Road</span>, <span class="loc">Headington</span>, <span class="loc">Oxford</span>. She was caught after a raid on her home last November. Oxford Crown Court heard <span class="loc">Munene</span> arrived in the <span class="loc">UK</span> from <span class="loc">Nairobi</span> in 2002 but her asylum application was rejected two years later. <span class="loc">Munene</span> admitted two charges of deception, two of possessing false identity documents with intent and one of fraud. Stephen Parker, defending, said <span class="loc">Munene</span> had been funding her 15-year-old daughter’s education back in <span class="loc">Kenya</span>. Judge Julian Hall said: “You have played fast and loose with the immigration rules in this country but simultaneously you have been a useful person to have here, doing work that a lot of people would not do. “But rules are rules and I have to punish you for breaking them.”</p>
