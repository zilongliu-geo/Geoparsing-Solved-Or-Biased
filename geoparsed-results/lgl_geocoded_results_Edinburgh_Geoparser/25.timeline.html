  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Rethinking Egypt-US relations. Since <span class="loc">Obama</span> took office, hopes for better times spread over <span class="loc">the Middle East</span>. <span class="loc">Egypt</span>, which often had trouble communicating with the administration of <span class="per">George Bush Jr</span>, is <span class="date">now</span> hoping for improved bilateral ties. At least since <span class="date">the 1970s</span>, three main themes dominated Egyptian-US relations: the peace process, the situation in the Gulf, and financial assistance. These themes may offer us some guidance as to how <span class="date">the future</span> will look. Egyptian-US partnership regarding the peace process started in earnest with <span class="per">Jimmy Carter</span>, who sponsored the Camp David Accords and the subsequent Egyptian- Israeli Peace Treaty. The sense of mutual commitment to peace survived throughout the administration of <span class="per">George Bush Sr</span> and his secretary of state <span class="per">James Baker</span>, culminating in the Madrid Conference for peace in <span class="loc">the Middle East</span> in <span class="date">1991</span>, the international gathering that endorsed the "land-for-peace" formula. The second theme of cooperation was Gulf security. During <span class="loc">Iraq</span>'s invasion of <span class="loc">Kuwait</span>, <span class="loc">Egypt</span> was instrumental in forming the international coalition to roll back the invasion. The third theme was <span class="loc">US</span> assistance to <span class="loc">Egypt</span> which, despite what its detractors may say, has helped rebuild <span class="loc">Egypt</span>'s infrastructure for <span class="date">the past few decades</span>. During <span class="date">the 1990s</span>, economic assistance began to be phased out. And certain efforts were made through the Mubarak-Gore partnership to create a free trade zone as an option to help the Egyptian economy. But the <span class="per">Clinton</span> and <span class="per">Bush</span> Jr administrations didn't pursue that option in earnest. Cooperation on all three of these issues diminished during the presidency of <span class="per">George Bush Jr.</span> The Palestinian problem, in particular, suffered as a result. The Bush administration started out by blaming the <span class="per">Clinton</span> administration for involving the <span class="loc">US</span> too greatly in the Arab-Israeli conflict. <span class="loc">US</span> indifference concerning the Palestinian problem continued until the Bush administration finally admitted that something needed to be done. Subsequently, the administration said that it favoured a two-state solution. <span class="loc">US</span> rhetoric, however, was not matched by action. On the contrary, the <span class="per">Bush Jr</span> administration undermined the concept of a geographically-connected Palestinian state when, during a visit by <span class="loc">Israel</span>'s prime minister to the <span class="loc">US</span> in <span class="date">July 2004</span>, it said that <span class="loc">Israel</span> may hold on to major settlements in the <span class="loc">West Bank</span> and <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>. And for all the visits by <span class="loc">US</span> Secretary of State <span class="per">Condoleezza Rice</span> to the region, the Bush administration failed to come up with cohesive policy on the Palestinian issue and largely ignored the question of settlements. It was only recently, and timidly, that Rice admitted during her last visit to the region that the building of settlements was not helping the cause of peace. As for cooperation over Gulf security, this cooperation receded when the Bush administration ignored the warnings and advice of <span class="loc">Egypt</span> and invaded <span class="loc">Iraq</span>. The invasion, as we know <span class="date">now</span>, sowed only turmoil in the region. It damaged the <span class="loc">US</span>'s image, increased terror, and turned <span class="loc">Iran</span> into a key regional power. Another thing that marred Egyptian relations with the previous <span class="loc">US</span> administration was the latter's misguided ideas on democratisation. American arguments were often viewed in <span class="loc">Egypt</span>, even by civil society organisations, as interference in Egyptian internal affairs. This brief survey of Egyptian-US relations shows that <span class="loc">Egypt</span> cooperated closely with <span class="loc">Washington</span> at times when <span class="loc">US</span> policies were positive, as in the times of <span class="per">Carter</span> and <span class="per">George</span> <span class="per">Bush Sr</span>. But tensions were unavoidable during the time of <span class="per">Bush Jr.</span> Much <span class="date">now</span> hinges on the <span class="loc">US</span> taking a fresh view of the Arab- Israeli conflict, one that casts away the conventional bias towards <span class="loc">Israel</span> that has so far undermined the quest for an acceptable solution. Much depends also on what the Obama administration does about extracting itself from the <span class="loc">Iraq</span> morass, restoring peace and stability there and the Gulf, and handling the Iranian nuclear issue. This analysis may seem to suggest that responsibility for moving forward on Egyptian-US relations rests solely with the <span class="loc">US</span>. Of course, this cannot be true. <span class="loc">Egypt</span>, for its part, needs to build its credibility in the region. If anything, this would persuade the Americans that <span class="loc">Egypt</span> is a country one should listen to, even when one doesn't totally agree with what it says. <span class="loc">Egypt</span> needs also to embrace democracy, revitalise its economy, stamp out corruption, and pursue an enlightened cultural course. Former <span class="loc">US</span> ambassador to <span class="loc">Egypt</span> Dan Kurtzer recommended in a recent paper that <span class="loc">Washington</span> and <span class="loc">Cairo</span> should realise the importance of their bilateral relations and listen carefully to what each other has to say. I cannot agree more.</p><br><br>
