  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Plata</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Macon County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,366 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The beginnings of <span class="loc">La Plata</span> can be traced back to <span class="date">March 17, 1827</span> when Drury Davis established a trading post near the town's current location. The ensuing <span class="date">few years</span> saw Davis joined by family and friends to create a small village that included a blacksmith shop, an inn, and stagecoach station. <span class="loc">La Plata</span> was platted in <span class="date">1855</span>. It was named after the city of <span class="loc">La Plata</span>, in <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. The name is of Spanish origin meaning "Silver". Two men, <span class="per">Louis Gex</span> and <span class="per">Thomas Saunders</span>, were the primary force behind the town's platting, and drew straws to choose the community's name. <span class="per">Saunders</span> wanted to name the town <span class="loc">Charlottesville</span> to honor a favorite sister, while <span class="per">Gex</span> pushed for the name <span class="loc">La Plata</span>. <span class="per">Gex</span> won out and the town is believed to have been first incorporated on <span class="date">September 29, 1856</span>. Another of the early settlers who helped in creating the town was <span class="per">Dr. W. W. Moore</span>, who erected <span class="loc">La Plata</span>'s first hotel. The <span class="loc">North Missouri</span> (later known as the Wabash Railroad) came to town in <span class="date">1867</span>, and the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Railroad <span class="date">twenty years later</span>, passing through <span class="loc">La Plata</span> on its route from <span class="loc">Chicago</span> to <span class="loc">Kansas City</span>. The combination of the two railroads made <span class="loc">La Plata</span> an ideal shipping point for timber, livestock, grains, and other goods for <span class="loc">northern Macon county</span> and southern portions of neighboring <span class="loc">Adair county</span> as well. As part of this growth, the town was incorporated as a fourth-class city on <span class="date">April 4, 1881</span> with <span class="per">Jacob Gilstrap</span> serving as first mayor. <span class="loc">La Plata</span>'s first major industry, a creamery, was established in <span class="date">1883</span>. The facility had the capacity to produce up to 1.25 tons of butter per day. However, fire destroyed the creamery and it was never rebuilt. Other light agriculture-related industry has existed in the town over the <span class="date">years</span>, including a large chicken hatchery and turkey hatchery. Two major oil pipelines pass through <span class="loc">La Plata</span> as well, the Prairie Pipeline being the first in <span class="date">1912</span>. A "tank farm" of large storage tanks was located for <span class="date">many years</span> on the city's northern edge. The Wabash railroad no longer exists, but the Amtrak station is still running on the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> rail system, and the town is served by the Southwest Chief. A small but active business community still exists in the town.</p><br><br>
