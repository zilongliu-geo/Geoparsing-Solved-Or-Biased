<p><span class="loc">Mandu</span> or Mandavgad is a ruined city in the present-day Mandav area of the <span class="loc">Dhar district</span>. It is located in the <span class="loc">Malwa region</span> of <span class="loc">western Madhya Pradesh</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>, at 35 km from the <span class="loc">Dhar city</span>. In the 11th century, <span class="loc">Mandu</span> was the sub division of the Tarangagadh or Taranga kingdom . This fortress town on a rocky outcrop about 100 km (62 mi) from <span class="loc">Indore</span> is celebrated for its fine architecture. The earliest reference to <span class="loc">Mandu</span> is available in the Sanskrit inscription of 555 AD, which tells that <span class="loc">Mandu</span> was a fortified city even in the 6th century BC. It gained prominence in 10th and 11th century under the Parmars (who called it Mandavgarh), from whom control was snatched by the Khiljis of <span class="loc">Delhi</span> in 1305. Then ruler Allauddin Khilji named Mandav as "Shadiabad" meaning the city of happiness (Anand Nagari), after the name of princess Mandvi Chouhan of <span class="loc">Khandwa</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Mandu</span>, situated at an elevation of 633 metres (2079 feet),is perched on the Vindhya Range extending for 13 km (8.1 mi) while overlooking the plateau of <span class="loc">Malwa</span> to the north and the valley of the <span class="loc">Narmada</span> River to the south, which acted as natural defences for the fort-capital of Rajput Parmara rulers of <span class="loc">Malwa</span>,who originally built it. Towards the end of the 11th century, it came under the sway of the Taranga kingdom.</p>
