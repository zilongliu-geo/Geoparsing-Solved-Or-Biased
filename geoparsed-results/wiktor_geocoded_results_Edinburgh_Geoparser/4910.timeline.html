  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 118,572. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Anniston</span>. Its name is in honor of <span class="per">John C. Calhoun</span>, famous member of the <span class="loc">United States</span> Senate from <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Anniston-Oxford Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Benton County</span> was established on <span class="date">December 18, 1832</span>, named for <span class="per">Thomas Hart Benton</span>, a member of the <span class="loc">United States</span> Senate from <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, with its county seat at <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span>. <span class="per">Benton</span>, a slave owner, was a political ally of <span class="per">John C. Calhoun</span>, another slaveholder and a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> senator from <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. Through the 1820s-1840s, however, <span class="per">Benton</span>'s and <span class="per">Calhoun</span>'s political interests diverged, with <span class="per">Calhoun</span> increasingly using secession as a weapon to maintain and expand slavery throughout the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="per">Benton</span>, on the other hand, was slowly coming to the conclusion that slavery was wrong and that preservation of the union was paramount. On <span class="date">January 29, 1858</span>, Alabama supporters of slavery, objecting to <span class="per">Benton</span>'s change of heart, renamed <span class="loc">Benton County</span> as <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span>. The county seat was moved to <span class="loc">Anniston</span> after <span class="date">years</span> of controversy and a State <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> ruling in <span class="date">June 1900</span>. An F4 tornado struck here on <span class="date">Palm Sunday</span> <span class="date">March 27, 1994</span>. It destroyed <span class="org">Piedmont's Goshen United Methodist Church</span> twelve minutes after the National Weather Service of <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> issued a tornado warning for northern <span class="loc">Calhoun</span>, southeastern <span class="loc">Etowah</span>, and southern <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>.</p><br><br>
