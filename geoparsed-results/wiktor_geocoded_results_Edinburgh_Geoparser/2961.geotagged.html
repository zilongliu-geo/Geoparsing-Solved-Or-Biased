<p>Hope is a city in <span class="loc">southern Dickinson County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 368. The motto of Hope is "There Will Always Be Hope In <span class="loc">Kansas</span>", which is also the name of a song. In 1802, <span class="loc">Spain</span> returned most of the land to <span class="loc">France</span>. In 1803, most of the land for modern day <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was acquired by the <span class="loc">United States</span> from <span class="loc">France</span> as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1854, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in 1861 <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In 1857, <span class="loc">Dickinson County</span> was established within the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory, which included the land for modern day Hope. In 1871, a group of about forty people, led by Newell Thurstin, began planning a town site in Hope. The town is said to be named after one of Thurstin's sons. The first post office in Hope was also established in July 1871. David Jacob Eisenhower, the father of <span class="loc">US</span> President Dwight David Eisenhower, lived in a 160-acre (0.65 km2) ranch near Hope from 1878 to his enrollment at Lane University. He and his partner, Milton Good, operated a general store here in 1885.</p>
