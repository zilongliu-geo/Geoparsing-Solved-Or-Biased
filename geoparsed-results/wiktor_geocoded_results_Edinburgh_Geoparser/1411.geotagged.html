The Town of <span class="loc">Augusta</span> is in the southwest part of the county. <span class="loc">Augusta</span> was settled in 1793 by a man named Gunn, whose son, Peter Smith Gunn, was the first child born in the town.

Organization was successful the next year and <span class="loc">Augusta</span> was created as a town simultaneously with the creation of <span class="loc">Oneida County</span> on March 15, 1798. It was created from part of the town of <span class="loc">Whitestown</span>. The first town meeting was held on April 3, 1798. The following positions were filled: Town supervisor, Town Clerk, Assessors (4), Commissioner of Highways (3), Overseers of the Poor (2), Constable and Collector, Inspectors of Schools (3), Fence viewers (3).</p>
