  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Salma (Arabic: سلمى‎) is a village in northwestern <span class="loc">Syria</span>, administratively part of the <span class="loc">Latakia</span> Governorate, located northeast of <span class="loc">Latakia</span>. Nearby localities include <span class="loc">Mashqita</span> and <span class="loc">Ayn</span> al-Bayda to the west, al-Haffah to the southwest, <span class="loc">Aramo</span> and <span class="loc">Slinfah</span> 12 km to the south, and Kinsabba to the north. According to the <span class="org">Syria Central Bureau of Statistics</span>, Salma had a population of 2,131 in the <span class="date">2004</span> census. Its inhabitants and those of the <span class="loc">Jabal</span> al-Akrad area are predominantly Sunni Muslims, although about 80% of the <span class="loc">Latakia District</span>'s residents are Alawites. Salma is well known for its dry climate and its plentiful clean water. It is situated about 800 meters above sea level. Prior to the Baathist takeover of <span class="loc">Syria</span> in <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, Salma was one of the few places in the coastal mountain region to be electrified and connected to a grid. During the Syrian civil war, as of <span class="date">late July</span> <span class="date">2012</span> the FSA controlled the town, whose population has mostly left (part to <span class="loc">Latakia city</span> and part to <span class="loc">Turkey</span>). <span class="org">The FSA</span> said that they were able to hold on to Salma thanks to its mountainous nature and the fact that it is surrounded by Sunni villages. It was on the front line of fighting in <span class="loc">Latakia</span> Governorate between rebels and government forces for a lengthy period of time. In <span class="date">November 2013</span>, reporter <span class="per">Jonathan Steele</span> claimed that the town was the <span class="loc">Latakia</span> governorate headquarters of both al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of <span class="loc">Iraq</span> and the Levant.</p><br><br>
