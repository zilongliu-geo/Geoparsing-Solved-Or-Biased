  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Longmen</span> (simplified Chinese: 龙门镇; traditional Chinese: 龍門鎮; pinyin: Lóngmén Zhèn) is a town of 7000 in <span class="loc">northwestern Zhejiang province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, located 17 kilometres (11 mi) south of the <span class="loc">city of Fuyang</span>, which administers it. The town lies south of the <span class="loc">Fuchun</span> River, at the foothills of the Xianxia Range, and oversees 11 administrative villages. Over 90% of its people are surnamed Sun. According to tradition, the Suns of <span class="loc">Longmen</span> are descendants of the third century warlord <span class="per">Sun Quan</span>, who became emperor of the Three Kingdoms state of Wu. <span class="per">Sun Quan</span> himself is said to have been born a short distance from <span class="loc">Longmen</span>, on an islet in the <span class="loc">Fuchun</span> River. A <span class="date">1939</span> genealogy traces their lineage continuously back twenty six generations to a Song Dynasty official. In <span class="date">the past</span>, the Suns of <span class="loc">Longmen</span> were divided into ten sub-lineages and held joint grand ceremonies honouring their ancestors every spring and <span class="date">autumn</span>, but this practice stopped after <span class="date">1949</span>. <span class="date">Fifty years ago</span> there were some sixty heritage buildings in <span class="loc">Longmen</span>, and about half of those are still standing <span class="date">today</span>. Among them are ancestral halls, homes, pagodas and memorial arches - most of which have a history of over <span class="date">three hundred years</span>. These structures are good examples of classical southern architecture and feature intricate wood carvings from <span class="loc">Zhejiang</span> folklore. The favourite decorative motifs used are from Three Kingdoms stories popular since the Song Dynasty. ` The local theatrical performances, called the "Bamboo Horse Dance" are unique for their portrayal of <span class="per">Sun Quan</span> as a hero. In traditional Three Kingdoms folklore, <span class="per">Sun Quan</span> is normally seen as an ambivalent and often frustrated leader who is time and again bested by <span class="per">Liu Bei</span> and his cunning strategist <span class="per">Zhuge Liang</span>. At <span class="loc">Longmen</span>, the favourite plays are "Burning <span class="loc">Red Cliffs</span>", showing <span class="per">Sun Quan</span>'s defeat of <span class="loc">Cao Cao</span> at the Battle of <span class="loc">Red Cliffs</span> and "Burning the Linked Encampments", showing <span class="per">Sun Quan</span>'s defeat of <span class="per">Liu Bei</span> at the Battle of <span class="loc">Yiling</span>.</p><br><br>
