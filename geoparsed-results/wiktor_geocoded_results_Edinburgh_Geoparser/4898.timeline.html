  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Oak Park is a village adjacent to the <span class="loc">West Side</span> of the <span class="loc">city of Chicago</span> in <span class="loc">Cook County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the 29th largest municipality in <span class="loc">Illinois</span> as measured by population in the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">US</span> Census, and has easy access to downtown <span class="loc">Chicago</span> (the <span class="loc">Chicago Loop</span>) via public transportation including the <span class="org">CTA Blue and Green</span> lines, buses, and Metra commuter rail. Pace buses serve the Village for travel within its borders and connecting to neighboring suburbs. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census the Village had a total population of 51,878. Oak Park was settled beginning in the 1830s, with rapid growth later in the 19th century and early 20th century. It incorporated in <span class="date">1902</span>, breaking off from Cicero. Development was spurred by railroads and street cars connecting the village to jobs in <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. Famed architect <span class="per">Frank Lloyd Wright</span> and his wife settled here in <span class="date">1889</span>. Population peaked at 66,015 in <span class="date">1940</span>. Smaller families led to falling population in the same number of homes and apartments. In <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, Oak Park faced the challenge of racial integration, devising many strategies to integrate rather than re-segregate the village, which so far are successful. Oak Park includes three historic districts for the historic homes: <span class="loc">Ridgeland</span>, <span class="per">Frank Lloyd Wright</span> and <span class="per">Seward Gunderson</span>, reflecting the focus on historic preservation. Many people of national fame have been born here, or lived here while building their own families and careers, including <span class="per">Frank Lloyd Wright</span>, <span class="per">Ernest Hemingway</span>, <span class="per">Ray Kroc</span>, <span class="per">Bob Newhart</span>, <span class="per">Betty White</span> and <span class="per">Dan Castellaneta</span>.</p><br><br>
