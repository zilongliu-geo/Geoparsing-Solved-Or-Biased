  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Swansea</span> is a village in St. <span class="loc">Clair County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The population was 13,430 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, an increase from 10,579 in <span class="date">2000</span>. In the late 19th century the area that is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Swansea</span> was a mix of farming and commerce. It was home to underground coal mines, foundries, brickyards, and the Gundlach Drill Works, manufacturers of the most efficient grain drills of that era. The early residents were fiercely independent and bent on conducting their own affairs. When the municipality that sat on their doorstep reached out to annex their lands and businesses they decided to start their own community. On <span class="date">November 27, 1886</span> a group of 35 area residents petitioned the county government "that they are desirous of having said territory organized as a village...That the name of the proposed village shall be New <span class="loc">Swansea</span>." The residents voted on <span class="date">December 16, 1886</span>, to form their own community and name it “New Swansea”. A petition for annexation to the <span class="loc">city of Belleville</span> was being circulated in the territory. Establishing an independent community was a quick and effective method of avoiding annexation. And so a new municipality was incorporated on <span class="date">December 20, 1886</span>. In <span class="date">1898</span> the lot at the corner of <span class="loc">Brackett</span> and <span class="loc">Illinois Streets</span> was purchased for $300. The Village Hall was completed shortly thereafter at a cost of $619.50.</p><br><br>
