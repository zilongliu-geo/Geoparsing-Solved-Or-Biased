  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Belmont</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, a suburb of <span class="loc">Boston</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Boston</span> metropolitan area. Its population was 24,729 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Belmont</span> was established on <span class="date">March 10, 1859</span>, by former citizens of, and land from the bordering towns of <span class="loc">Watertown</span>, to the south; <span class="loc">Waltham</span>, to the west; and <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, then known as <span class="loc">West Cambridge</span>, to the north. The town was named after <span class="loc">Bellmont</span>, the 200 acre (0.8 kmÂ²) estate of one of the leading advocates of and largest donor to its creation, <span class="per">John Perkins Cushing</span>. The easternmost section of the town, including the western portion of Fresh Pond, was annexed by <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> in <span class="date">1880</span> in a dispute over a slaughterhouse licensed in <span class="date">1878</span> on Fresh Pond, so that <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> could protect Fresh Pond, a part of its municipal water system. Preceding its incorporation, <span class="loc">Belmont</span> was an agrarian based town, with several large farms servicing <span class="loc">Boston</span> for produce and livestock. It remained largely the same until the turn of the twentieth century, when trolley service and better roads were introduced, making the town more attractive as a residential area, most notably for the building of large estates.</p><br><br>
