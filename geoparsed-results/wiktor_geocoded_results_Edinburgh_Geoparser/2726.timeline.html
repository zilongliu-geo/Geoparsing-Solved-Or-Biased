  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Columbia</span>, formerly Wright's Ferry, is a borough in <span class="loc">Lancaster County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, 28 miles (45 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> on the left (east) bank of the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span>, across from <span class="loc">Wrightsville</span> and <span class="loc">York County</span> and just south of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 30. The settlement was founded in <span class="date">1726</span> by Colonial English Quakers from <span class="loc">Chester County</span> led by entrepreneur and evangelist <span class="per">John Wright</span>. Establishment of the eponymous Wright's Ferry, the first commercial <span class="loc">Susquehanna</span> crossing in the region, inflamed territorial conflict with neighboring <span class="loc">Maryland</span> but brought growth and prosperity to the small town, which was briefly considered as a candidate for the new <span class="loc">United States</span>' capital. Though besieged for a short while by Civil War destruction, <span class="org">Columbia</span> remained a lively center of transport and industry throughout the 19th century, once serving as a terminus of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Canal. Later, however, the Great Depression and 20th-century changes in economy and technology sent the borough into decline. It is notable <span class="date">today</span> as the site of one of the world's few museums devoted entirely to horology. The area around present-day <span class="loc">Columbia</span> was originally populated by Native American tribes, most notably the Susquehannocks, who migrated to the area between <span class="date">1575</span> and <span class="date">1600</span> after separating from the Iroquois Confederacy. They established villages just south of <span class="loc">Columbia</span> in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Washington Boro</span>, as well as points as far south as <span class="loc">Maryland</span>. <span class="per">Captain John Smith</span> estimated their numbers to be about 2,000 in the early 1600s.</p><br><br>
