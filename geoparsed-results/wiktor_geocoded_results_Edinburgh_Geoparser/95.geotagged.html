<p><span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> /ˌsæntə ˈænə/ (Spanish for "<span class="loc">Saint Anne</span>") is the county seat and second most populous city in <span class="loc">Orange County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau estimated its 2011 population at 329,427, making <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> the 57th most-populous city in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> is located in Southern <span class="loc">California</span>, adjacent to the <span class="loc">Santa Ana River</span>, about 10 miles (16 km) away from the <span class="loc">California</span> coast. Founded in 1869, the city is part of the Greater Los Angeles Area, the second largest metropolitan area in the <span class="loc">United States</span> with almost 18 million residents in 2010. <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> is a very densely populated city, ranking fourth nationally in that regard among cities of over 300,000 residents (trailing only New <span class="loc">York City</span>, <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>, and <span class="loc">Boston</span>).

It also shares its name with the nearby <span class="loc">Santa Ana Mountains</span>, and the <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> winds, which have historically fueled seasonal wildfires throughout Southern <span class="loc">California</span>. The current Office of Management and Budget (OMB) metropolitan designation for the Orange County Area is Santa Ana–Anaheim–Irvine, <span class="loc">California</span>.</p>
