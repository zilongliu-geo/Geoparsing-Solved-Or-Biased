<p><span class="loc">Hunan Province</span> (Chinese: 湖南; pinyin:  Húnán; Hunanese: <span class="loc">Shuangfeng</span>, [ɣəu˩˧læ̃˩˧]; <span class="loc">Changsha</span>, [fu˩˧lã˩˧]) is a province of the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. It is located in <span class="loc">South Central China</span>, south of the middle course of the <span class="loc">Yangtze River</span>, and south of Lake Dongting (hence the name <span class="loc">Hunan</span>, which means "south of the lake"). <span class="loc">Hunan</span> is sometimes called for short and officially abbreviated as "湘" (pinyin: Xiāng), after the <span class="loc">Xiang</span> River which runs through the province. Hunan borders <span class="loc">Hubei Province</span> in the north, <span class="loc">Jiangxi Province</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Guangdong Province</span> to the southeast, <span class="loc">Guangxi Province</span> to the southwest, <span class="loc">Guizhou Province</span> to the west, and <span class="loc">Chongqing</span> to the northwest. The provincial capital is <span class="loc">Changsha</span>. Hunan's primeval forests were first occupied by the ancestors of the modern <span class="loc">Miao</span>, <span class="loc">Tujia</span>, <span class="loc">Dong</span> and <span class="loc">Yao</span> peoples. It entered the written history of <span class="loc">China</span> around 350 BC, when under the kings of the Zhou Dynasty, it became part of the State of <span class="loc">Chu</span>. After Qin conquered the Chu heartland in 278 BC, the region came under the control of Qin, and then the Han dynasty. At this time, and for hundreds of years thereafter, it was a magnet for migration of Han Chinese from the north, who displaced or assimilated the indigenous people, cleared forests and began farming rice in the valleys and plains. The agricultural colonization of the lowlands was carried out in part by the Han state, which managed river dikes to protect farmland from floods. To this day many of the small villages in <span class="loc">Hunan</span> are named after the Han families who settled there. Migration from the north was especially prevalent during the Eastern <span class="loc">Jin Dynasty</span> and the Southern and Northern Dynasties Periods, when nomadic invaders pushed these peoples south.</p>
