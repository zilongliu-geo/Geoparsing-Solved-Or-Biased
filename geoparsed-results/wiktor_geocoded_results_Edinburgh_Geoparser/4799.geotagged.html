<p><span class="loc">Toco</span> is the most northeasterly village on the island of <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> in the County of <span class="loc">Saint David</span> at the point where the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span> and the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> meet. <span class="loc">Tobago</span> lies only some 35 kilometers to the northeast which renders <span class="loc">Toco</span> the closest point in <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> to the sister island. The name <span class="loc">Toco</span> was ascribed to the area by its early Amerindian inhabitants. The meaning of the name is uncertain, yet its historical significance and value to the country is well noted. <span class="loc">Punta Galera</span> (now <span class="loc">Galera Point</span>) is one of the sights of <span class="loc">Toco</span>. <span class="loc">Galera</span> is a slight corruption of the word "galea", the name originally given to the southeastern point, <span class="loc">Galeota Point</span>, by Christopher Columbus. The name was accidentally given to this point as well. The name stuck and it remains a popular tourist destination. The <span class="loc">Galera Point Lighthouse</span> in <span class="loc">Toco</span> was built in 1897 and today is surrounded by a park and picnic area. Not much activity took place in <span class="loc">Toco</span> after the Spanish colonized <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> in 1531 until 1631, when Sir Henry Colt and English forces entered the territory without the knowledge of the Spanish. In 1637, the British were expelled by the Dutch, who had formed an alliance with the Amerindians in the area and were, not too long after, expelled by the Spanish.</p>
