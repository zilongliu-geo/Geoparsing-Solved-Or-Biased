  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Chatham</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Barnstable County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="loc">Barnstable County</span> being coextensive with Cape Cod. First settled by the English in <span class="date">1664</span>, the township was originally called Monomoit based on the indigenous population's term for the region. The population was 6,125 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Chatham</span> is home to the <span class="loc">Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge</span>, located on <span class="loc">Monomoy Island</span>, For geographic and demographic information on specific parts of the town of <span class="loc">Chatham</span>, please see the articles on <span class="loc">Chatham</span> (CDP) and <span class="loc">West Chatham</span>. Native American tribes who lived in the area before European colonization included the <span class="loc">Nauset</span>, specifically the Manomoy or Monomoy people. The expansive lands over which they roamed were known to them as <span class="loc">Manamoyik</span> or Monomoit. <span class="per">Explorer Samuel de Champlain</span> landed here in <span class="date">October of 1606</span> at a place he christened "Port Fortun√©", where he contacted (and skirmished with) the <span class="loc">Nauset</span>. <span class="date">Twelve years later</span> another group of Europeans gave it the name "Sutcliffe's Inlets". Neither name stuck, and the location was not permanently occupied by Europeans until English settlers reached Monomoit in <span class="date">1664</span>. The town was incorporated on <span class="date">11 June 1712</span>, at which point it was renamed after <span class="loc">Chatham</span>, <span class="loc">Kent</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Its territory expanded with the annexation of Strong Island and its vicinity on <span class="date">7 February 1797</span>.</p><br><br>
