<p><span class="loc">Gulu</span> is a city in Northern <span class="loc">Uganda</span>. It is the commercial and administrative centre of <span class="loc">Gulu District</span>. The coordinates of <span class="loc">Gulu</span> Municipality are: 2°46'54.0"N 32°17'57.0"E. The distance from <span class="loc">Gulu</span> to <span class="loc">Kampala</span>, <span class="loc">Uganda</span>'s capital and largest city, is approximately 340 kilometres (210 mi) by road. The town is served by <span class="loc">Gulu</span> Airport and a railway line. During British colonial rule in the 18th and 19th centuries, northern <span class="loc">Uganda</span> was less developed than the rest of the country. The people were conscripted into the army and the police, as a source for the security. Many were sent to fight in the First World War and in the Second World War. <span class="loc">Uganda</span> gained independence in 1962, but this did not improve the situation for the people in the north. Several rebel groups were formed by the end of 1986. However, these rebel groups were ex soldiers, i.e., the UNLA from the government prior to Museveni. By 1987 most of these rebels had joined Museveni's force. Then came another rebel group led by Alice "Lakwena" <span class="loc">Auma</span> from 1988 to 1989. The Lord's Resistance Army sprang up in the 1990s after Alice Lakwena left <span class="loc">Uganda</span> and went to <span class="loc">Kenya</span>. The LRA became increasing violent in <span class="loc">Gulu</span> and the surrounding communities. The UPDF government army has equally been accused of brutality against the civilian population.</p>
