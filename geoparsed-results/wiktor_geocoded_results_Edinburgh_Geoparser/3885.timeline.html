  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Linton</span> is a village 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south-west of <span class="loc">Wetherby</span> in <span class="loc">West Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, in the <span class="loc">parish of Collingham</span> and the <span class="loc">City of Leeds</span> metropolitan borough. At the <span class="date">2011</span> Census the village fell within the <span class="loc">Harewood ward</span> of the <span class="loc">City of Leeds Council</span>. It is situated between <span class="loc">Wetherby</span> and <span class="loc">Sicklinghall</span>, on the north bank of the <span class="loc">River Wharfe</span>. <span class="loc">Collingham</span> lies to the south on the opposite side of the river. Little is known of the early history of the village, but archaeologists have dated more than 8000 local flints to between 10,000 and <span class="date">2000 BC</span>, and crop marks around the village point to ditched enclosures and field systems in the Iron Age and Roman period (<span class="date">800 BC</span> â€“ AD 410). Roman artifacts have been found and in <span class="date">1936</span>, a Roman burial site was identified to the north of the village. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book, where it has a higher value than <span class="loc">Wetherby</span>. The Anglo-Saxon place name means "flax farm". There was a now-vanished medieval chapel in the village, possibly founded by the Percy family, once the landowners.</p><br><br>
