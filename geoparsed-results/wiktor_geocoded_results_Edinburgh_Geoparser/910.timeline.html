  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hampton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Bradford County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 500 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Hampton</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1925</span>. In the <span class="date">mid 1990s</span>, <span class="loc">Hampton</span> annexed a short stretch of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 301 west of the city in order to get revenue from traffic tickets issued to motorists driving on that highway. In <span class="date">November 2013</span>, the city's mayor was arrested for selling Oxycodone. On <span class="date">February 10, 2014</span> auditors from the <span class="org">Florida Joint Legislative Auditing Committee</span> presented 31 violations of state law, city charter and federal tax requirements to state legislators. The city made $211,328 ticketing people driving its 1,260 feet of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 301 during <span class="date">2012</span>, giving the city an unenviable reputation as a "speed trap". The committee asked State Attorney Bill Cervone to investigate any potential criminal activity, and a number of state representatives and senators pursued the dissolution of <span class="loc">Hampton</span>. In the wake of the controversy, many city officials resigned. State legislators visited <span class="loc">Hampton</span> on <span class="date">March 28, 2014</span> to see if the issues had been solved. They agreed to let <span class="loc">Hampton</span> stay incorporated, because the city retracted the annexation of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 301 and decommissioned its police force. <span class="loc">Hampton</span> also accounted for budget shortfalls, and reformed its city council proceedings.</p><br><br>
