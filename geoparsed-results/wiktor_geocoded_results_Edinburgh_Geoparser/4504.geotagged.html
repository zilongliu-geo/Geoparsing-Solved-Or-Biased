<p>Tok /ˈtoʊk/ is a census-designated place (CDP) in Southeast <span class="loc">Fairbanks Census Area</span>, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,258 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Tok</span> lies on a large, flat alluvial plain of the <span class="loc">Tanana</span> Valley between the <span class="loc">Tanana River</span> and the <span class="loc">Alaska Range</span> at an important junction of the <span class="loc">Alaska</span> Highway with the Glenn Highway. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 132.3 square miles (343 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Tok</span> has a dry-winter continental subarctic climate (Köppen Dwc). There have been Athabascan Indian settlements in the region of what is now <span class="loc">Tok</span> for many centuries. The town at the present location of <span class="loc">Tok</span> began in 1942 as an Alaska Road Commission camp used for construction and maintenance of the <span class="loc">Alaska</span> Highway. So much money was spent in the camp's construction and maintenance that it earned the nickname "Million Dollar Camp" from those working on the highway. In 1947 the first school opened, and in 1958 a larger school was built to accommodate the many newcomers. In 1995 a new school was opened to provide for the larger community. A U.S. Customs Office was located in <span class="loc">Tok</span> between 1947 and 1971, when it was moved to the Canadian border.</p>
