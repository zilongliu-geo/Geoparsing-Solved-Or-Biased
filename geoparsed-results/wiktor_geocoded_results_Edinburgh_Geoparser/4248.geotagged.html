<p>Compton is a former village and today a semi-rural suburb centred 1 mile (1.6 km) ESE of <span class="loc">Farnham</span> in the <span class="loc">Waverley</span> <span class="loc">district of Surrey</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> and connected to <span class="loc">Farnham</span> by two direct urban single carriageways and green space footpaths along the <span class="loc">Wey</span> (North Branch) which in part marks the northern boundary of the area together with the A31. The area relies on <span class="loc">Farnham</span> for most of its modern amenities and its eastern part is rural whereas its western part is urban, with a divide where the <span class="loc">Wey</span> flows between the two south-eastwards. Compton has given its name to the local roads Compton Way and Old Compton Lane, and is most formally, though on few modern maps, considered to include (being a medieval-founded tything and manor) <span class="loc">Moor Park</span>, <span class="loc">Farnham</span> on the left bank of the <span class="loc">Wey</span>, further east. <span class="loc">Moor Park</span> takes its recent name from Moor <span class="loc">Park House</span> the former mansion of Sir William Temple, where Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels lived and worked which is a listed building in the mid category, Grade II*. The house dates from 1307 when it was <span class="loc">Compton Hall</span>. Compton Woods is an area of woodland with public access.</p>
