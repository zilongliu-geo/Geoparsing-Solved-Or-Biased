<p><span class="loc">Union City</span> is a village in Branch and Calhoun counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. Located mostly within Union Township in <span class="loc">Branch County</span>, it sits at the junction of the <span class="loc">Coldwater</span> and St. Joseph rivers; the <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> portion lies within that county's Burlington Township. It is part of the <span class="loc">Battle Creek</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,599 at the 2010 census. M-60 passes just north of the village. <span class="loc">Union City</span> is located on the northern border of <span class="loc">Branch County</span>, about ten miles (16 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Coldwater</span>. This is a small picturesque and historic town that functions primarily as an adjunct community to the greater <span class="loc">Coldwater</span> and <span class="loc">Battle Creek</span> areas. It has a striking turn-of-the-century look architecturally, with well–preserved downtown buildings and several Victorian style homes. A Civil War monument can be seen on the north end of the main street area in the churchyard, while a veteran’s memorial along the riverbank to the south end commemorates those who fought in more recent wars. <span class="loc">Union City</span> was first settled by Justin Goodwin in 1833, when he built a mill here and became the first postmaster, calling it "Goodwinville". A year later, he sold several hundred acres to E. W. Morgan, who officially platted the site, renaming it from the "union" of the <span class="loc">Coldwater</span> and St. Joseph Rivers, which join there. A consortium of four proprietors bought the site in 1837. It was eventually incorporated as a village in 1866.</p>
