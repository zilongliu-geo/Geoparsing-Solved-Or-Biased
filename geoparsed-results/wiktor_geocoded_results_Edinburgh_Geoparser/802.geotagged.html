<p><span class="loc">Fortuna</span> (formerly, Slide, <span class="loc">Springville</span>) (Wiyot: Vutsuwitk Da'l, "ashes stay") is a city the northeast shore of the <span class="loc">Eel River</span> (approximately 9 miles (14 km) from where it enters the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>), and is on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 101 in western-central <span class="loc">Humboldt County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 11,926 at the 2010 census, up from 10,497 at the 2000 census. The settlement was originally called "Slide," for Slide Hill, in 1874, named for the slide that was a fixture on the northeast side of the <span class="loc">Eel River</span> and the southwest portion of Christian Ridge just to the northwest, near the edge of town. In 1875, the name was changed to <span class="loc">Springville</span> during the construction of the <span class="loc">Springville</span> Mill, a lumber mill for the nearby redwood forests, named so because of the numerous springs in the area. The mill's owners were Henry Rohner (namesake of neighboring <span class="loc">Rohnerville</span>), Alexander Masson, M. N. Weber and G. F. Gushaw. <span class="loc">Springville</span> was originally a company town belonging to the mill, and the few people that resided there all worked at the mill. By the late 1870s <span class="loc">Springville</span> had grown enough to warrant a post office, but a town called <span class="loc">Springville</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> (now part of <span class="loc">Camarillo</span>, in <span class="loc">Ventura County</span>) already existed in the state. The post office was named Slide on May 24, 1876. In 1884 the residents petitioned the state legislature for the name <span class="loc">Fortuna</span>, Spanish for "fortune" and Latin for "chance," and by July 3, 1888 the name was changed to <span class="loc">Fortuna</span>. The name was chosen when settlers saw the proximity of the forests, the river and its valley, and the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>, as ideal for enjoying a good quality of life, and felt "fortunate" to live there. It is believed that a local minister and real estate agent, desiring to sell lots to newcomers, devised the name as a marketing tool.</p>
