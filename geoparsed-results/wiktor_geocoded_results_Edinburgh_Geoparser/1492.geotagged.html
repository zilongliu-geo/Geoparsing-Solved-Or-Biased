<p><span class="loc">Claremont</span> is a suburb of Cape Town, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It is situated six miles south of the city, and is one of the so-called "Southern Suburbs". It is an important commercial and residential area, which is currently experiencing significant growth and development. Until the arrival of Dutch colonists in 1652, the uncultivated veld of the <span class="loc">Cape Peninsula</span> was used by the nomadic Khoisan to grazed their cattle. The Dutch established an outpost on the shore of <span class="loc">Table Bay</span>, and in 1657 they established a number of farms south of the outpost. The most southerly of those original farms, named Louwvliet and Questenburg, are today covered by the suburbs of <span class="loc">Claremont</span> and <span class="loc">Newlands</span>. The area was agricultural for about 150 years. Other estates that were established included Veldhuyzen in 1676, <span class="loc">Stellenberg</span> in 1697, <span class="loc">Weltevreden</span> (originally part of <span class="loc">Stellenberg</span>) in 1730, <span class="loc">Sans Souci</span> (originally part of Questenburg) in 1786, and The Vineyard in 1798. They produced grain and grapes, and some farmers made wine. After the colony had been taken over by the British in 1814, the area gradually changed its character. British settlers and officials bought the farms, renamed some of them, and turned them into country residences. <span class="loc">Weltevreden</span> was subdivided in 1822, and it was a portion of it that was later to be renamed <span class="loc">Claremont</span>. The distinguished British astronomer Sir John Herschel put the area on the map by living at <span class="loc">Feldhausen</span> (formerly Veldhuyzen) from 1834 to 1838.</p>
