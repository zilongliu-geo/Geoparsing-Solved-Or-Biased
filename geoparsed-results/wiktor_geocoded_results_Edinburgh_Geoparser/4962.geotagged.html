<p><span class="loc">Al Hamriyah</span> is the name of a coastal settlement of <span class="loc">Sharjah</span> on the northern perimeter of <span class="loc">Ajman</span> in the <span class="loc">United Arab Emirates</span>. It is notable for its lagoon popular with pleasure boaters and jet skiers as well as local fishermen who moor here, as well as storing and repairing both rope and wire mesh fishing nets. The village is not to be confused with the <span class="loc">Hamriyah Port</span> and <span class="loc">Free Zone</span>, which lie immediately to the south of it. It is traditionally home to families belonging to the Darawishah section of the Al Bu Shamis Na'im, linked through this relationship to the area of <span class="loc">Sharjah</span> bounding immediately to the south of <span class="loc">Ajman</span>, Al Heera. These would be associated with the modern Emirati family name Al Shamsi. Going un-noted in early 19th-century British coastal surveys, <span class="loc">Al Hamriyah</span> struggled for independence in the late 19th century as a result of alleged negligence by the rulers of <span class="loc">Sharjah</span>, which held suzerainty over <span class="loc">Al Hamriyah</span>, in protecting the pearling families of the town from absconding debtors - a duty of the ruler who imposed a 'wali' over <span class="loc">Al Hamriyah</span>. Although it was never formally recognised by the British as a Trucial emirate (it came close in 1903, the British only failing to recognise Hamriyah's Sheikh Saif bin Abdulrahman out of deference to Sharjah's ruler, <span class="loc">Saqr</span> bin <span class="loc">Khalid</span> <span class="loc">Al</span> Qasimi), <span class="loc">Hamriyah</span> was granted its independence by the Ruler of <span class="loc">Sharjah</span>, Sheikh Khalid bin <span class="loc">Saqr</span> <span class="loc">Al</span> Qasimi, on 9 August 1923. Khalid bin <span class="loc">Saqr</span>'s letter of that date granting independence to Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Saif of <span class="loc">Hamriyah</span> renounced all claims by <span class="loc">Sharjah</span> to taxes or revenues from <span class="loc">Hamriyah</span>.</p>
