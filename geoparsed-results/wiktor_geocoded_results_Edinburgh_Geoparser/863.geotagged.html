Soon, the village of <span class="loc">Tortosa</span> was founded by two Christian pioneers, Innocentes Paler and Marcelo Dalaguida, who were later on joined by Luis Gupana and a handful of <span class="loc">Manobo</span>. Credited with a name to the village were a group of natives and Spaniards who visited the place to trade with the villagers and found the place to be abundant with the sea tortoise. The fame of <span class="loc">Tortosa</span> as a good fishing was heard by the people of the neighboring <span class="loc">Butuan</span>. Thus a fresh wave migrants came to settle. Notable of these new settlers were: <span class="loc">Valeriano</span> Farol, Mateo <span class="loc">Bustillo</span>, Anecito Sanchez, Sabas Galinato, <span class="loc">Macario</span> Sanchez, Lucas <span class="loc">Yonson</span>, Demetrio Ontong, Lino Danuco, Vicente Ebarle, Nicanor Beltran, Demetrio Mendoza, <span class="loc">Teodoro</span> Paculba, Marcelo Abad, Leon <span class="loc">Manla</span>, Marciano Bantolinao, and Matias Micabalo.</p>
