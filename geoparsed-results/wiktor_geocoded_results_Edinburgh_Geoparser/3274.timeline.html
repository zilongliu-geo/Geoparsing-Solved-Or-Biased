  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Inglewood</span> is a town situated on the southern <span class="loc">Darling Downs</span> in <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 150 km (93 mi) south-west of <span class="loc">Toowoomba</span>. <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> is the second largest town in the <span class="loc">Goondiwindi Region</span> as well as being part of the Border Rivers region of waterways. The town was the council seat of the former Shire of <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> until its amalgamation to form part of the larger <span class="loc">Goondiwindi Region</span>. The current slogan for the town is 'Catch the country spirit'. English botanist and explorer <span class="per">Allan Cunningham</span> has been credited with being the first European to discover the <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> area. He passed through east of the present township in <span class="date">May 1827</span>. The first settlement in the area was known as Browns Inn and was an important watering point for bullock teams moving west. The inn opened in the late 1850s on the south side of <span class="loc">Macintyre</span> Brook, and in <span class="date">1862</span> a town was surveyed on the higher, northern side. Plans were drawn up for the present site and the name changed to <span class="loc">Inglewood</span>. <span class="org">Inglewood Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">16 September 1866</span>. Most of the hinterland consisted of station holdings which were selected as early as <span class="date">1848</span> and were the start of the wool, cattle and wheat base of the region. A school was opened in <span class="date">1872</span> and a hospital was built in <span class="date">1921</span>. <span class="loc">Anglican</span>, Catholic and Presbyterian churches opened in <span class="date">1894</span>, <span class="date">1902</span> and <span class="date">1906</span> respectively.</p><br><br>
