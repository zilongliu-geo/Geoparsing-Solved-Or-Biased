  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Berlin</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Green Lake</span> and <span class="loc">Waushara counties</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. The population was 5,524 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Of this, 5,435 were in Green <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, and only 89 were in <span class="loc">Waushara County</span>. The city is located mostly within the Town of <span class="loc">Berlin</span> in Green <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, with a small portion extending into the Town of <span class="org">Aurora</span> in <span class="loc">Waushara County</span>. In <span class="date">1845</span>, Nathan H. Strong (<span class="date">1813</span>–<span class="date">1852</span>) became the first resident of what is <span class="date">today</span> <span class="loc">Berlin</span>. He was joined by <span class="per">Hugh G. Martin</span>, <span class="per">Hiram Barnes</span>, and <span class="per">William Dickey</span>. Their settlement was known as Strong's Landing. In <span class="date">1848</span> a post office was established. It was named <span class="loc">Berlin</span> after the capital of <span class="loc">Prussia</span>, <span class="date">now</span> the capital of <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The first school house was built in <span class="date">1850</span> and the first church in <span class="date">1851</span>. <span class="loc">Berlin</span> was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1857</span>. Area residents put the accent on the first syllable of Berlin /ˈbɜːrlɪn/ rather than on the second. It has been said that this was in reaction to the anti-German sentiment that swept across the <span class="loc">United States</span> during World War I, and that the accent was previously on the second syllable.</p><br><br>
