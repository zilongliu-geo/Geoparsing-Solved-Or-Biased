<p>Auburn is a city in <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located at the north end of <span class="loc">Owasco Lake</span>, one of the Finger Lakes, in Central <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 27,687. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span>, and the site of the maximum-security Auburn Correctional Facility, as well as the William H. Seward House Museum and the house of abolitionist Harriet Tubman. The region around Auburn had been Haudenosaunee territory for centuries before European contact and historical records. Auburn was founded in 1793, during the post-Revolutionary period of settlement of western <span class="loc">New York</span>. The founder, John L. Hardenbergh, was a veteran of the Sullivan-Clinton campaign against the <span class="loc">Iroquois</span> during the American Revolution. Hardenbergh settled in the vicinity of the <span class="loc">Owasco</span> River with his infant daughter and two African-American slaves, Harry and Kate Freeman. After his death in 1806, Hardenbergh was buried in Auburn's North Street Cemetery, and was re-interred in 1852 in Fort Hill Cemetery â€“ the first burial in the city's newly opened burial ground. The community grew up around Hardenbergh's gristmill and sawmill.</p>
