  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Panay</span> (/pəˈnaɪ/; <span class="loc">Tagalog</span>: [pɐˈnaj]) is an island in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> located in the western part of the <span class="loc">Visayas</span>. It is about 160 kilometres (100 mi) across. Politically, it is divided into four provinces: <span class="loc">Aklan</span>, <span class="loc">Antique</span>, <span class="loc">Capiz</span>, and <span class="loc">Iloilo</span>, all in the <span class="loc">Western Visayas Region</span>. It is located southeast of the island of <span class="loc">Mindoro</span> and northwest of <span class="loc">Negros</span>, separated by the <span class="loc">Guimaras Strait</span>. Between <span class="loc">Negros</span> and <span class="loc">Panay Island</span> lie the island-province of Guimaras. To the north is the <span class="loc">Sibuyan Sea</span> and the islands of <span class="loc">Romblon</span>; to the southwest is the <span class="loc">Sulu Sea</span> and the <span class="loc">Panay Gulf</span>. The island has many rivers including Akean, <span class="loc">Sibalom River</span> in <span class="loc">Antique</span>, <span class="loc">Jalaur River</span>, <span class="loc">Jaro River</span> (inc. <span class="per">Ticud</span> and <span class="per">Aganan</span> tributaries), <span class="loc">Banica</span>, <span class="loc">Iloilo</span>, and <span class="loc">Panay</span>. <span class="loc">Panay</span> was the seat of the ancient Confederation of Madja-as—the first pre-Hispanic Philippine state within the <span class="loc">Visayas</span> islands region, and the second Srivijayan colony in the Philippine Archipelago, next to the <span class="loc">Sulu Archipelago</span>. The island is purportedly named after the state of Pannai which was a militant-country fronting the strait of <span class="loc">Malacca</span> and responsible for policing the shipping of the area as well as expelling invasions from Arabs, Indians and Chinese until the state was felled by a surprise attack from the back-flank emanating from the <span class="loc">Tamil</span> occupied capital of <span class="loc">Sri Vijaya</span>. Madja-as was established by nine rebel datus or high officials connected with the court of <span class="loc">Brunei</span>, who were forced to leave that are on account of enmity of the Rajah at that time ruling the land. The datus, together with their wives and children, as well as few faithful servants and followers were secretly escorted out of the country by the Rajah's Chief Minister, whose name was Datu Puti. The local folklore says that the name of the Bornean Rajah was Makatunao.</p><br><br>
