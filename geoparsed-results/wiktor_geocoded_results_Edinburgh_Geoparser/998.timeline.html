  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Linden is the second largest town in <span class="loc">Guyana</span> after <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>, and capital of the Upper <span class="loc">Demerara-Berbice region</span>, located at 6°0′0″N 58°18′0″W, altitude 48 metres (160 feet). It was declared a town in <span class="date">1970</span>, and includes the communities of <span class="per">MacKenzie</span> and <span class="per">Wismar</span>. It lies on the <span class="loc">Demerara River</span> and has a population of roughly 29,298 (Bureau of Statistics, <span class="per">Population</span> and <span class="per">Housing</span> Census - <span class="date">2002</span>, <span class="loc">GUYANA</span>). It is primarily a bauxite mining town, containing many mines 60–90 metres deep, with many other pits <span class="date">now</span> in disuse. Commercial bauxite mining started in Linden, <span class="date">eighty years ago</span>. In <span class="date">1916</span> the <span class="org">Demerara Bauxite Company Limited</span>, known as <span class="loc">DEMBA</span>, a subsidiary of the Aluminum Company of <span class="org">Canada Limited</span>, was established with the objective of mining, processing and selling bauxite. The site chosen for this preliminary venture was on the <span class="loc">Demerara River</span>, 105 kilometres (65 mi) south of the capital city <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>. At that time there was no settlement in the area, except for the <span class="loc">wards of Wismar</span>, <span class="loc">Guyana</span> <span class="per">Wismar</span> and <span class="per">Christianburg</span>. Mackenzie, the center of the company's operations, takes its name from an American geologist of <span class="org">Scottish</span> descent, <span class="per">George Bain</span> Mackenzie, who first visited and explored the area for bauxite in <span class="date">1913</span>. He returned in <span class="date">1914</span>, bought lands for mining, and built several 45-ton wooden barges for use at the riverside near Three Friends Mine, which was the first mine to be worked.</p><br><br>
