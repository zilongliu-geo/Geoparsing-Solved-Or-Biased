  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Grafton</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Auckland City</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. The suburb is named for the <span class="per">Duke of Grafton</span>, a patron of the first Governor of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, <span class="per">William Hobson</span>, and the grandfather of a subsequent Governor, <span class="per">Robert FitzRoy</span>. Once known as '<span class="loc">Grafton Heights</span>', denoting its history as a well-off suburb in Auckland's earliest <span class="date">decades</span>. According to the <span class="date">2001</span> census, <span class="per">Grafton</span> has a population of 2,052. The suburb is characterised by its many historic buildings, many of them essentially unchanged from the early <span class="date">decades</span> of the 20th century. While the extents of the suburb have shrunk with the motorway and arterial road construction of the middle 20th century, the remaining smaller suburb thus has a highly cohesive structure, which is recognised, for example, in the residential zoning which discourages demolition of existing buildings. <span class="per">Grafton</span> has a local resident's association, abbreviated as the GRA. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> Bridge: Spanning <span class="loc">Grafton</span> Gully and connecting the Auckland CBD with <span class="per">Grafton</span> and parts further east this was the largest piece of Civil Engineering in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. When it was completed in <span class="date">1910</span> it was the largest reinforced concrete arched bridge in the world, spanning almost 300 metres.</p><br><br>
