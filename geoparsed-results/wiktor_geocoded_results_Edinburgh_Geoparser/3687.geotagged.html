<p><span class="loc">Denton</span> is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">South Kesteven district</span> of <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is situated approximately 3 miles (5 km) both south-west from the market town of <span class="loc">Grantham</span>, and west from the A1 road. The <span class="loc">Denton</span> name derives from the Old English 'dene+tun', meaning "village in a valley," but in Domesday it is written as "Dentune". <span class="loc">Denton</span> is the site of an ancient Roman settlement. It may also be a site of the Beaker culture, based on some archeological finds made. <span class="loc">Denton</span> is situated just north off the main A607 road between <span class="loc">Grantham</span> and <span class="loc">Melton Mowbray</span>. Nearby villages include <span class="loc">Harlaxton</span>, <span class="loc">Barrowby</span> and <span class="loc">Woolsthorpe</span>. <span class="loc">Denton</span> is a 3 miles east from <span class="loc">Belvoir Castle</span>. The civil parish covers approximately 2,600 acres (11 km2). In 1984 <span class="loc">Denton</span> held its first street market, proceeds from which were equally divided between the Church, the School and the Village Hall. The street market is now held every year on the first Bank holiday Monday in May. The 2013 event was the 27th, (the 2001 and 2012 markets being cancelled because of foot and mouth and bad weather respectively) with over 150 stalls, food outlets, children's entertainment, and traditional village sports.</p>
