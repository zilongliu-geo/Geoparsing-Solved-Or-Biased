<p>City Hall Digest . <span class="loc">London city</span> council will hire outside experts to defend itself and its rejection of a proposed medical clinic and pharmacy in north <span class="loc">London</span>. Developers who wanted to build the project on Richmond Street along the <span class="loc">Uplands</span> have appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board. City staff supported the development as did a minority on council, who pointed to new jobs, doctors, tax assessment and construction but they were out-voted by council members who said the development would betray the nearby community and a neighbourhood plan that placed retail across busy <span class="loc">Richmond Street</span>, <span class="loc">London</span> city council rejected creating a formal policy to seek partnerships with “sister cities” around the world. Advocates argues the relationship would put <span class="loc">London</span> in a better position to benefit from the global economy. But those opposing that step argued it would create unnecessary costs and bureaucracy and would place the city in a position of not being able to meet its obligations &#x97; the city has done little to sustain a previous “sister city” relationship with <span class="loc">Quebec City</span> and <span class="loc">Nanjing</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>. The issue of sister cities surfaced last year when Controller Gord Hume asked for $1,200 to visit <span class="loc">Nanjing</span> while on a personal trip to <span class="loc">Beijing</span>. Facing a backlash from some council members, Hume withdrew his request. <span class="loc">Londoner</span> will get a chance in May to weigh in on the future of the cit’s board of control. A public participation meeting will be held at 4 p.m. May 14 at Centennial Hall. Council has already recommended scrapping the board and dividing its functions after the 2010 civic election between two new committees of ward councillors.</p>
