  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Darlington</span> is a small city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Darlington County</span>, in the northeastern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. It is a center for tobacco farming. The population was 6,289 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 6,720 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Florence Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Darlington</span>, theorized to be named for the Revolutionary War Colonel Darlington, is known for its Darlington Oak and Spanish moss. <span class="loc">Darlington County</span> was named thus by an Act in <span class="date">March 1785</span>. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is best known for <span class="loc">Darlington Raceway</span>, a speedway that is home to the annual NASCAR Southern 500 race. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is also the site of the National <span class="org">Motorsports Press Association</span> (NMPA) <span class="org">Hall of Fame</span>. This area was settled in the mid-18th century by Welsh, Scotch-Irish, and English farmers, who grew cotton primarily. The settlement of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Darlington County</span> began in earnest after <span class="date">1736</span> and <span class="date">1737</span> when the province of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> set aside a vast area of land for the Welsh Baptists of <span class="loc">Delaware</span>. This Welsh Tract bordered both sides of the <span class="loc">Pee Dee River</span>. Soon after the first settlers began to arrive they constituted the Welsh Neck Baptist Church. This church was first located on the north side of the <span class="loc">Pee Dee River</span>, opposite present-day Society Hill. For <span class="date">almost thirty years</span> settlers concentrated on the banks and small tributaries of the <span class="loc">Pee Dee River</span>. Beginning in the 1760s and continuing into the 1770s other groups slowly made their way into present-day <span class="loc">Darlington</span> and were granted lands on the Lynches River, <span class="loc">Jeffries Creek</span>, and a host of other watercourses. These later settlers included descendants of French Huguenots, Scots-Irish, and the English.</p><br><br>
