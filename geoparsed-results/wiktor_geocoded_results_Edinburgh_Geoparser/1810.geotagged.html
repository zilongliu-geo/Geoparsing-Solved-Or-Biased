<p><span class="loc">Littleton</span> (historically Nipmuc: <span class="loc">Nashoba</span>) is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,924 at the 2010 census. For geographic and demographic information on the neighborhood of <span class="loc">Littleton Common</span>, please see the article <span class="loc">Littleton Common</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. <span class="loc">Littleton</span> was first settled by white settlers in 1686 and was officially incorporated by act of the Massachusetts General Court on November 2, 1714. The town was also the location of the sixth Praying Indian village established by John Eliot called <span class="loc">Nashoba</span> Plantation, on the land between Lake Nagog and Fort Pond. Daniel Gookin, in his Historical Collections of the Indians in <span class="loc">New England</span>, (1674) chapter vii. says: Nashobah is the sixth praying Indian town. This village is situated, in a manner, in the centre, between <span class="loc">Chelmsford</span>, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, <span class="loc">Groton</span> and Concord. It lieth from <span class="loc">Boston</span> about twenty-five miles west north west. The inhabitants are about ten families, and consequently about fifty souls. At the time of King Philip's War, the General Court ordered the Indians at <span class="loc">Nashoba</span> to be interned in Concord. A short while later, Concordians who were hostile to the <span class="loc">Nashoba</span> solicited some Militia to remove them to <span class="loc">Deer Island</span>. Around this time, fourteen armed men of <span class="loc">Chelmsford</span> went to the outlying camp at Wameset (near Forge Pond) and opened fire on the unsuspecting <span class="loc">Nashoba</span>, wounding five women and children and killing outright the only son of John Tahattawan, a boy twelve years old. For much of the war, Praying Indians were rounded up and sent to <span class="loc">Deer Island</span>. When increasing numbers of <span class="loc">Massachusetts Bay</span> officers began successfully using Praying Indians as scouts in the war, sentiment of the white settlers turned. In May, 1676, the Massachusetts General Court ordered that Praying Indians be removed from <span class="loc">Deer Island</span>. Still, many perished of starvation and disease. Upon their release, most survivors moved to <span class="loc">Natick</span> and sold their land to white settlers.</p>
