  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Santiago is a fourth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it had a population of 17,958 people. Santiago Cove is dubbed as the "Boracay of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span>" because of its white sands. Santiago is the headquarters of the <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span> Electric Cooperative (ISECO), which distributes electricity to the entire province. Santiago is politically subdivided into 24 barangays. Before the Spanish Conquest of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, <span class="loc">Moro</span> raiders were in control, so one of the tasks of the Spanish was to pacify and clear the country of these pirates. Coastal communities (Northern <span class="loc">Luzon</span>, and, thus, Ilocos) were prone to piratical attacks. For these, watchtowers were erected all over the Ilocos coast. The Spanish started patrols of sea lanes, stopping these pirates for a while, only for them to resurface in <span class="date">1772</span>. But in the place <span class="date">now</span> known as Santiago, as the Spanish engaged the pirates, all church bells ringing and trumpets sounded (to signal their attacks), the Augustinians stationed in the place held a statue of Santiago (<span class="loc">Saint James</span>) facing the sea and with many natives praying the rosary for safety and victory. The <span class="loc">Moros</span> fled, never to return, thus sparing the pueblo. The place was since then named Santiago.</p><br><br>
