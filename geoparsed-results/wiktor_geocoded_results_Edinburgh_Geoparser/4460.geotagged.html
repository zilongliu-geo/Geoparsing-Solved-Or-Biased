<p><span class="loc">Bambang</span> is a first class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 47,657 people. The municipality is known for its salt springs at the Salinas Natural Monument. <span class="loc">Bambang</span> has its beginning in the early period of Spanish colonization. The name "<span class="loc">Bambang</span>" is an Isinay word meaning "to dig". The first mission that dared to penetrate the dangerous wilderness and insect-infested jungles of what is southern <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span> today was by the Dominican Order in 1607. However, it was only two years later (1609) when a Dominican missionary come from <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>. Father Tomas Gutierez arrived to establish the first missionary settlement. This settlement was subsequently called Ytuy which today actually comprises the towns of <span class="loc">Aritao</span>, <span class="loc">Dupax</span>, <span class="loc">Bambang</span> and a part of the Igorot tribal lands to the west (now <span class="loc">Kayapa</span>). Originally these places were inhabited by the Aetas and Panuypuyes (<span class="loc">Aritao</span>), the <span class="loc">Ilongots</span> (<span class="loc">Dupax</span> and <span class="loc">Bambang</span>) and the lgorot in the area west from the present native population of <span class="loc">Dupax</span>, <span class="loc">Aritao</span>, and <span class="loc">Bambang</span> came about by the inter-marriages of the tribes mentioned above.</p>
