  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Murmansk</span>'s <span class="per">Governor Resigns</span>. <span class="loc">Murmansk</span> <span class="per">Governor Yury Yevdokimov</span> resigned abruptly <span class="date">Saturday</span> after enduring <span class="date">a week</span> of harsh criticism from United <span class="loc">Russia</span> over the loss of the <span class="loc">Murmansk</span> mayoral election to an independent candidate. <span class="per">President Dmitry Medvedev</span> welcomed <span class="per">Yevdokimov</span>'s resignation and appointed Federal Fisheries Agency deputy head <span class="per">Dmitry Dmitriyenko</span> as the acting governor, the <span class="loc">Kremlin</span> said. Political analysts said it was the first instance that a regional leader had been forced out of office for supporting a non-United <span class="loc">Russia</span> candidate in an election. Independent candidate Sergei Subbotin, a former <span class="loc">Murmansk</span> deputy governor, was elected mayor with 61 percent of the vote in a runoff election on <span class="date">March 15</span>, well over the 35 percent collected by the United <span class="loc">Russia</span> candidate, incumbent Mayor Mikhail Savchenko. After the election, the new mayor refused to join United <span class="loc">Russia</span> but declared himself a supporter of Prime Minister <span class="per">Vladimir Putin</span>, who heads United <span class="loc">Russia</span>. <span class="per">Yevdokimov</span>, a United <span class="loc">Russia</span> member, had served as <span class="loc">Murmansk</span> governor since <span class="date">1996</span> and was appointed by then-President <span class="loc">Putin</span> to a fourth term in <span class="date">2007</span>. In an interview with <span class="loc">Gazeta</span>. ru on <span class="date">Thursday</span>, he denied speculation that he would step down. But on <span class="date">Saturday</span>, he said he thought that it would be best for the country if he quit. "I've always been ready to bear responsibility for my actions," he said, Interfax reported. Senior United <span class="loc">Russia</span> officials had accused him of violating election law by offering support for the non-United <span class="loc">Russia</span> candidate on local television and threatened to throw him out of the party. United <span class="loc">Russia</span> said in <span class="date">a weekend</span> statement on its web site that <span class="per">Yevdokimov</span> had resigned on his own accord. The acting governor, <span class="per">Dmitriyenko</span>, 46, served in submarine units of the Navy from <span class="date">1980</span> to <span class="date">1992</span> and was appointed as deputy head of the Federal Fisheries Agency <span class="date">last year</span>. United <span class="loc">Russia</span> welcomed Dmtiriyenko's appointment. "There is a need for professionals able to work in new ways during crisis conditions," party official <span class="per">Sergei Neverov</span> said in the web site statement. <span class="per">Dmitriyenko</span> will be sworn in as governor on <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, pending confirmation by the regional legislature, which is controlled by United <span class="loc">Russia</span>. <span class="per">Dmitriyenko</span> flew to <span class="loc">Murmansk</span> on <span class="date">Saturday</span> to meet with regional United <span class="loc">Russia</span> officials. In his first official statement as acting governor, <span class="per">Dmitriyenko</span> said he would focus on ways to make regional spending more effective. Alexei Titkov, regions analyst at the <span class="org">Institute of Regional Politics</span>, said the shuffle was the first time that a governor has been replaced after a conflict with United <span class="loc">Russia</span> over support of a candidate in elections. "<span class="per">Yevdokimov</span>'s resignation will become an example for the other governors," <span class="loc">Titkov</span> said. The resignation follows a series of replacements started when <span class="per">Medvedev</span> dismissed four governors in <span class="date">February</span>. The president has the right to appoint and dismiss governors under a law proposed by <span class="per">Putin</span> in <span class="date">2004</span>. Meanwhile, the State <span class="loc">Duma</span> on <span class="date">Friday</span> approved in a final third reading a bill that would give the party that holds the most seats in a regional legislature the right to propose gubernatorial candidates. Under the existing procedure, this right belongs to the presidential envoys to the federal districts. The bill, which <span class="date">now</span> must be approved by the <span class="org">Federation Council</span> and then the president, says the party should propose at least three candidates to the president no later than <span class="date">90 days</span> before the incumbent governor's term expires. If the president doesn't select anyone from this group within <span class="date">a month</span>, the party must propose three more candidates. If the party doesn't do this, the president can select the candidate himself. Also, the president is not obliged to select a candidate from those proposed by the party. The bill was sent to the <span class="loc">Duma</span> in <span class="date">December</span> by <span class="per">Medvedev</span>. United <span class="loc">Russia</span> controls nearly all the regional legislatures in <span class="loc">Russia</span>. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just <span class="date">weeks</span> before the financial crisis struck.</p><br><br>
