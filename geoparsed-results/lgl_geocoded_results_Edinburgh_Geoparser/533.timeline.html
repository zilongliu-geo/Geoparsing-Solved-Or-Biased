  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Lebanon</span> establishes embassy in <span class="loc">Syria</span>. A Lebanese parliamentarian praised the opening of his county's first-ever embassy in <span class="loc">Syria</span> on <span class="date">Monday</span> but warned that much remained to be done to improve bilateral relations between the two countries. In addition, he said a number of agreements that have been previously signed between <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> and <span class="loc">Syria</span> that should be revised or even annulled as the two countries embark on a new era of diplomatic relations, particularly the Lebanon-Syria <span class="org">Treaty of Brotherhood</span>, <span class="per">Cooperation</span> and <span class="per">Coordination</span> Agreement. That <span class="date">1991</span> agreement effectively legalized the presence of Syrian troops in <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> and suggested the two countries closely coordinate their foreign policies to reflect "the shared destiny and interests of the two countries." <span class="loc">Syria</span> first sent its troops into <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> in <span class="date">the 1970s</span> while the country was engulfed in civil war.</p><br><br>
