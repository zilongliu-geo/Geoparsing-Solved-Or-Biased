<p>Milton is a village just <span class="loc">north of Cambridge</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> with a population of approximately 4,679 (2011 census), up from 4,275 in the 2001 census. Milton grew from a population of 31 peasants in 1086, growing slowly up to 170 people making up 40 families in 1728. The population expanded to around 740 then remained fairly static in the period of the 1910s to the 1950s, the parish then grew more rapidly to greater than 1,700 in 1971. Milton expanded considerably in the late 1980s when two large housing estates were built between the bypass and the village. This resulted in a doubling of the population between the 1981 and 1991 censuses. The latest expansion started in 2012 with the development of the <span class="loc">North Lodge Park</span> consisting of 88 homes, two football pitches, pavilion and car park, with the first residents moving in April 2014. The A10 bypass was built between 1976 and 1978 around the west edge of village, splitting <span class="loc">Butt Lane</span> into two parts. As part of the Great Eastern Railway the Cambridge-Ely line was opened in 1845 bypassing the village to the east but with no station. The nearest station is to the north in the village of <span class="loc">Waterbeach</span>, until the Cambridge Science Park railway station opens (due to be operational by 2016).</p>
