  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Reading (/ˈrɛdɪŋ/ RED-ing), is the county seat of <span class="loc">Berks County</span> and with a population of 87,812 is the fifth-largest city in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, Reading has the highest share of citizens living in poverty in the nation. Located in southeastern <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, it is the principal city of the <span class="org">Greater Reading Area</span>. The city, approximately halfway between <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and the state capital at <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, is strategically situated along a major transportation route from Central to Eastern <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, and lent its name to the now-defunct Reading Railroad, which transported anthracite coal from the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Coal Region to the eastern <span class="loc">United States</span> via the Port of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>. Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic <span class="loc">United States</span> version of the Monopoly board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as "The <span class="loc">Pretzel City</span>", because of numerous local pretzel bakeries. Currently, <span class="loc">Bachman</span>, <span class="loc">Dieffenbach</span>, <span class="per">Tom Sturgis</span>, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. Lenni Lenape people, also known as "Delaware Indians", were the original inhabitants of the Reading area.</p><br><br>
