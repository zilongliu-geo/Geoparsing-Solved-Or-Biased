  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Monroe</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 121 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. By area, population and population density, it is the smallest town in the county; and is the second-smallest town by population in the Commonwealth, with only Gosnold having fewer residents. <span class="per">Monroe</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="per">Monroe</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1800</span> and was officially incorporated in <span class="date">1822</span>. The town was named for President <span class="per">James Monroe</span>, who was in office at the time of incorporation. The town was mostly rural, with dairy farming taking up much of the town's economic activity. During the mid-19th century, the town did get some business from the building of the Hoosac Tunnel, just south of town in <span class="loc">Florida</span>. In <span class="date">1885</span>, however, a railroad line was built between neighboring <span class="loc">Readsboro</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, and <span class="loc">Holyoke</span> to haul wood pulp to a paper factory. This, in turn, enticed the Ramage family to establish the <span class="org">James Ramage Paper Company</span> in <span class="date">1887</span>. The company was the main industry well into the 20th century, before closing in <span class="date">1984</span>.</p><br><br>
