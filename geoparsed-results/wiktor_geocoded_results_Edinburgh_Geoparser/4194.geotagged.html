<p><span class="loc">Dundee</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Tunica County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> is 12 miles (19 km) south-southwest of Tunica. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> has a post office with ZIP code 38626. The village was founded in 1884 after the <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> and <span class="loc">Texas Railway</span> was built, and was originally called <span class="loc">Carnesville</span>, for Captain J.B. Carnes, a principal landowner in the county. A post office was established in 1887, though a similarly-named <span class="loc">Carnesville</span> required a change of names. "Dundee" was selected from a list. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> was incorporated in 1920 by Gubernatorial (Governor's) Proclamation. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> served as a transportation hub, and a railroad depot was built around 1895. Blues musician W. C. Handy once played on the depot's wooden platform as crowds danced. In 2011, the depot—the last in Tunica County—was moved to <span class="loc">Robinsonville</span>, where it was restored and made into a visitors center. The "Highway 61 North" <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Blues Trail marker is located in front of the depot. Residents are a part of the <span class="loc">Tunica County</span> School District. Zoned schools include Dundee Elementary School, Tunica Middle School, and Rosa Fort High School.</p>
