<p>Wellington is a township in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> on the <span class="loc">Murray River</span> (<span class="loc">River Murray</span> in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>) just upstream of where it empties into <span class="loc">Lake Alexandrina</span>. Its postcode is 5259. Wellington is in the Rural City of <span class="loc">Murray</span> Bridge. At the 2006 census, Wellington had a population of 295. Because of its geographical similarities, the first European colonists likened the development potential of the site of Wellington to that of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. In 1839 the <span class="loc">London</span>-based Secondary Towns Association, represented in Adelaide by John Morphett and John Hill, authorised expenditure on the special survey a proposed town to be named Wellington, with prior consent of the Duke of Wellington himself. Despite never having seen the land except on a map, the directors of the Association had great hopes for Wellington becoming an important town. The survey eventually provided for 700 lots in Wellington (west side of the <span class="loc">Murray</span>) and 300 lots in <span class="loc">Wellington East</span> (east side of the <span class="loc">Murray</span>), as well as rural sections. Messrs Cannan and Henderson carried out the survey in November 1840 and the first lots were sold in July 1841.</p>
