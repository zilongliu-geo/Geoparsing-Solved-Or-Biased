  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Authorities across <span class="loc">Europe</span> have issued restrictions on commercial poultry farms, following the outbreak of bird flu in eight previously unaffected nations. The virus has been found in migratory birds much earlier than had been expected. Tests have confirmed that wild swans in <span class="loc">Greece</span>, <span class="loc">Bulgaria</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>, <span class="loc">Austria</span> and <span class="loc">Germany</span> had died from the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus. Other suspected cases of the virus have been detected in <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>, <span class="loc">Croatia</span> and <span class="loc">Denmark</span>. European health officials had expected wild birds migrating from <span class="loc">Africa</span> to <span class="loc">Europe</span> in spring to carry the disease into Western <span class="loc">Europe</span>. It is thought that swans were migrating from <span class="loc">Russia</span> and <span class="loc">Ukraine</span> to the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> driven by unusually cold weather. Globally, 91 people have died after contracting the virus from close contact with diseased birds, but the greatest concern for European authorities is that an outbreak will occur among domesticated fowl, destroying local poultry industries. The H5N1 strain of bird flu is highly contagious, and lethal to birds. A single outbreak can kill tens of thousands of birds, and all birds must be culled across a wide region to prevent the spread of the disease.</p><br><br>
