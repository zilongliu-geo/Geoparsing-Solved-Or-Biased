  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> (/rioʊɡrʌndeɪ/) is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) located within Middle Township in Cape <span class="loc">May County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Though located within Middle Township, a small section at the southern edge of the community, located in Lower Township, is sometimes called <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>. It is part of the Ocean City Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the CDP's population was 2,670. According to <span class="per">Jeffrey M. Dorwart</span>, <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> is a community which was founded in the mid-nineteenth century around a country store owned by the Hildreth family. The community was originally called <span class="loc">Hildreth</span> for that reason. (p. 102) <span class="per">George F. Boyer</span> and <span class="per">J. Pearson</span> <span class="per">Cunningham</span> explain that, during the colonial period, <span class="per">Aaron Leaming</span>, the <span class="loc">Hildreths</span> and the Cresses had plantations in that area. Where the King's Highway crossed the road coming from <span class="loc">Dennisville</span> and <span class="loc">Goshen</span> a stage coach terminal was set up, and the spot became the center for trade for the local farming families. <span class="per">Boyer</span> and <span class="per">Cunningham</span> say that the area was known as "Leamings," for the prominent landholders, or as "Hildreth," the family who ran the local store. (p. 121-122) They continue, "The name, <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>, was suggested by the seventh <span class="per">Aaron Leaming</span> who thought this southern <span class="loc">United States</span> river had an attractive sound."</p><br><br>
