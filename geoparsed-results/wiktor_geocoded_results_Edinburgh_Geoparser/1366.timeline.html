  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Concord</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> as a historic district, the <span class="org">Concord</span> Village Historic District. The <span class="loc">United States</span> <span class="org">Geographic Names Information System</span> classifies <span class="org">Concord</span> as a populated place. It is located in western <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, east of <span class="loc">Farragut</span> and west of <span class="loc">Knoxville</span>. Mail destined for <span class="org">Concord</span> is <span class="date">now</span> addressed to <span class="loc">Knoxville</span> or <span class="loc">Farragut</span>. <span class="org">The Village of Concord</span> began to develop in <span class="date">1854</span>. Before that time, the area was sparsely settled. Large farms were centered on the <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> River, and relied on a nearby settlement, Campbellâ€™s Station (modern <span class="loc">Farragut</span>), for trade and other urban needs. In <span class="date">1853</span>, construction of the <span class="loc">East Tennessee</span> and <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Railroad along the north bank of the <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> River caused a population and development shift to the area that became <span class="org">Concord</span>. <span class="org">Concord</span> was founded and platted in <span class="date">1854</span> on land owned by <span class="per">James M. Rodgers</span>. <span class="per">Mr. Rodgers</span> laid out 55 lots, and gave the new town the name <span class="org">Concord</span>. It is believed the name was inspired by the nearby <span class="org">Concord</span> Cumberland Presbyterian Church, of which <span class="per">Rodgers</span> was a member ("<span class="org">Concord</span>" being a common name for churches at the time). He began to sell lots in <span class="date">1855</span>, but later moved to <span class="loc">California</span>. Shortly before he moved, he several large tracts of land, some which are still intact in some sections of the village.</p><br><br>
