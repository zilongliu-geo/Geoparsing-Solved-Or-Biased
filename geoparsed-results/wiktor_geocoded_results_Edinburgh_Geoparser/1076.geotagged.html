Franklin is a city in <span class="loc">Warren County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 11,771 at the 2010 census.

The canal followed the Great <span class="loc">Miami River</span> through Franklin, and the boat traffic led to new commerce. The town soon had a pork slaughterhouse, barrel making factory, sawmill, and whiskey distillery.</p>
