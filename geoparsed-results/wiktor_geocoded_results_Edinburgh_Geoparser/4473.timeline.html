  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gloucester</span> (/ˈɡlɒstər/) is a city, district and county town of <span class="loc">Gloucestershire</span> in the South West region of <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> lies close to the Welsh border, and on the <span class="loc">River Severn</span>, approximately 32 miles (51 km) north-east of <span class="loc">Bristol</span>, and 45 miles (72 km) south-southwest of <span class="loc">Birmingham</span>. A cathedral city, capital of its county which was built on a flat spot of land, <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> is situated on the <span class="loc">River Severn</span> and the <span class="loc">Bristol</span> and <span class="loc">Birmingham Railway</span>. <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> was founded in AD 97 by the Romans under Emperor Nerva as Colonia Glevum Nervensis, and was granted its first charter in <span class="date">1155</span> by King <span class="per">Henry II</span>. Economically, the city is dominated by the service industries, and has a strong financial and business sector, being home to the bank <span class="loc">Cheltenham</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> and historically was prominent in the aerospace industry. The origins of the name <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> can be traced to Caerloyw in the modern Welsh. There are various appellations in history such as Caer Glow, Gleawecastre, Gleucestre as an early British settlement is not confirmed by direct evidence. However, <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> was the Roman municipality of Colonia Nervia Glevensium, or Glevum, built in the reign of <span class="loc">Nerva</span>. Parts of the walls can be traced, and a number of remains and coins have been found, though inscriptions are scarce. In <span class="loc">Historia</span> Brittonum, a fabled account of the early rulers of <span class="loc">Britain</span>, Vortigern's grandfather, Gloiu (or Gloyw Wallt Hir: "Gloiu Long-hair"), is given as the founder of <span class="loc">Gloucester</span>. In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> is shown as part of <span class="loc">Wessex</span> from the Battle of <span class="loc">Deorham</span> in 577 until 584, when it came under the control of Mercia. The name <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> derives from the Anglo-Saxon for fort (Old English ceaster) preceded by the Roman stem Glev- (pronounced glaiw).<span class="per">Claudia Castra</span> is mentioned in the 18th Century as possible Latin name related to the city.</p><br><br>
