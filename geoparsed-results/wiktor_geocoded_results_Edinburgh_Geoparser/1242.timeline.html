  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Hartford</span> is a city in <span class="per">Washington</span> and <span class="per">Dodge</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a population of 14,223. All of this population resided in the <span class="loc">Washington County</span> portion of the city. <span class="per">John Thiel</span> and <span class="per">Nicolas Simon</span> first surveyed the area that would become <span class="loc">Hartford</span> in <span class="date">1843</span>. <span class="per">James</span> and <span class="per">Charles</span> <span class="loc">Rossman</span> accompanied <span class="per">Nicolas Simon</span> back to <span class="loc">Hartford</span> in <span class="date">1844</span>, and soon bought 40 acres around the rapids of the <span class="loc">Rubicon River</span>. After constructing a dam across rapids in the river, the Rossmans built a sawmill that harnessed the power of the water to make lumber for the growth of the area. Rails were laid in <span class="date">1855</span> that linked <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Milwaukee</span>, <span class="loc">La Crosse</span> and <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span> until <span class="date">the early 1900s</span>. The town was named after <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. <span class="loc">Hartford</span> was a <span class="loc">New England</span> settlement. The original founders of <span class="loc">Hartford</span> consisted entirely of settlers from <span class="loc">New England</span>. Most of whom were from <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> and <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, though some came from rural <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> and the region of downeast <span class="loc">Maine</span>. These people were "Yankees", that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled <span class="loc">New England</span> in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of <span class="loc">New England</span> farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal and the end of the Black Hawk War. When they arrived in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Hartford</span> there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. They laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their <span class="loc">Yankee</span> <span class="loc">New England</span> values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian. Due to the second Great Awakening some of them had converted to Methodism and some had some had become Baptists before moving to what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Hartford</span>. <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, like much of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, would be culturally very continuous with early <span class="loc">New England</span> culture for most of its early history. The first church in <span class="loc">Hartford</span> was the First Congregational Church, constructed by <span class="loc">Yankee</span> <span class="loc">New England</span> migrants. The Church was built in <span class="date">1847</span>. German and Irish immigrants began arriving after <span class="date">1842</span>, though initially in small numbers. In the late 1870s the number of German immigrants increased.</p><br><br>
