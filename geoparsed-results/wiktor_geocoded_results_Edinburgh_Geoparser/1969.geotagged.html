<p><span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Dinkletown</span> and <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span>) is an incorporated town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,644 at the 2010 census. It is included in the <span class="loc">Harrisonburg</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> is also home to Bridgewater College, a private, coeducational, four-year liberal arts college founded in 1880, historically associated with the Church of the Brethren. Among the first families of European descent in the area was the Dinkle family. Around 1810, John Dinkle built a sawmill and a grist mill on the <span class="loc">North River</span>, a tributary of the South Fork of the <span class="loc">Shenandoah River</span>. The tiny community was first called <span class="loc">Dinkletown</span>. The area was known as McGill's Ford before the Dinkles moved here. The name was changed to <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span>, because it was a flatboat port at a bridge. Even after it was no longer a port, the bridge was still there, hence the final renaming as <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span>. During the American Civil War, some troop transit and skirmishes happened nearby. The Valley Campaigns of 1864 involved the region. In the late 19th century, the world's longest single-span wooden covered bridge stood where Main Street crosses the <span class="loc">North River</span>; representations of the long-gone bridge still appear in the town emblems.</p>
