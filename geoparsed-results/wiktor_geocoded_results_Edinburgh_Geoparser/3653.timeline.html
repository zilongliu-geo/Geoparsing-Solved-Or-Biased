  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tempel</span>, also known as <span class="loc">De Tempel</span>, is a former municipality and former manorial estate in the Dutch province of <span class="loc">South Holland</span>. It was located about 3 km southwest of the center of the current village of <span class="loc">Berkel</span> en <span class="loc">Rodenrijs</span>. According to the 19th-century historian A.J. van der Aa, <span class="loc">Tempel</span> was named after a manor house that used to be located in the area. around the beginning of the 19th century, the house was long gone. In nearby <span class="loc">Overschie</span> an estate can be found where in the 18th century the owner of <span class="loc">Tempel</span> used to live. He acquired it in <span class="date">1715</span>, after which the house Berkeloord was renamed to <span class="loc">De Tempel</span>. The manorial rights of <span class="loc">Tempel</span> were also applicable at the estate, even though it was located outside of its territory. After the introduction of the municipal system by the French in <span class="date">1812</span>, the area belonged to the municipality of <span class="loc">Pijnacker</span>, even though it was completely surrounded by the territory of <span class="loc">Berkel</span> en <span class="loc">Rodenrijs</span>. In <span class="date">1817</span>, the manorial rights were restored, and <span class="loc">Tempel</span> became a separate municipality, although it was very small (only 0.109 kmÂ²) and had no inhabitants. This was not a problem, as long as the lord of the area was prepared to pay for the municipal government. In <span class="date">1855</span>, the municipality became part of <span class="loc">Berkel</span> en <span class="loc">Rodenrijs</span>. Since <span class="date">2007</span>, <span class="loc">Tempel</span> is a part of Lansingerland, when <span class="loc">Berkel</span> en <span class="loc">Rodenrijs</span> merged with <span class="loc">Bergschenhoek</span> and <span class="loc">Bleiswijk</span>.</p><br><br>
