  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greenwich</span> is a suburb on the lower <span class="loc">North Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> is located 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) north-west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district, in the local government area of the Municipality of Lane Cove. The suburb occupies a peninsula on the northern side of <span class="loc">Sydney Harbour</span>, at the opening of the <span class="loc">Lane Cove River</span>. The suburb features harbour views, a few pockets of bushland, shops, restaurants and cafes, a harbour swimming pool with shark net. The suburb's name is derived from its namesake <span class="loc">Greenwich</span>, by the banks of the <span class="loc">Thames</span> in <span class="loc">London</span>. <span class="loc">Parramatta River</span> had been known as the '<span class="loc">Thames</span> of the Antipodes' and other nearby suburbs were also named after <span class="loc">Thames</span> localities of <span class="loc">Putney</span>, <span class="loc">Woolwich</span> and <span class="loc">Henley</span>. The Cammeraygal clan of the Guringai people were the first inhabitants of the Greenwich area, and lived along the foreshores of the harbour, hunting in the hinterland and trading with other clans. The first known occasion when a European went to the area was in <span class="date">1788</span>, when <span class="per">Lieutenant Henry Ball</span> passed through the area while returning from a trip to the <span class="loc">Middle Harbour</span> area. Land grants began in <span class="date">1794</span> and industries developed in the area during the 1830s.</p><br><br>
