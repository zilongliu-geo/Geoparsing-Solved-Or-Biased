<p><span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> (<span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> German: Harrisbarig) is the capital city of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Dauphin County</span>. With a population of 49,673, it is the tenth-largest city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. It lies on the east bank of the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span>, 105 miles (169 km) west-northwest of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and 204 miles (328 km) east of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. The <span class="loc">Harrisburg-Carlisle Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which includes Dauphin, <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, and Perry counties, had a population of 509,074 in 2000 and grew to 549,850 in 2010. A July 1, 2007 estimate placed the population at 528,892, making it the fifth largest Metropolitan Statistical Area in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> after <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>, <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Allentown</span>−Bethlehem−Easton (the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley), and Scranton−Wilkes Barre. The Harrisburg-Carlisle-Lebanon Combined Statistical Area, including both the Harrisburg-Carlisle and <span class="loc">Lebanon Metropolitan</span> Statistical Areas, had an estimated population of 656,781 in 2007 and was the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the state. <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> played a notable role in American history during the Westward Migration, the American Civil War, and the Industrial Revolution. During part of the 19th century, the building of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Canal and later the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Railroad allowed <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> to become one of the most industrialized cities in the Northeastern <span class="loc">United States</span>. The <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Navy ship USS <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, which served from 1918 to 1919 at the end of World War I, was named in honor of the city.</p>
