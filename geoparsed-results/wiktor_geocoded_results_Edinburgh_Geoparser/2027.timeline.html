  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Burton</span> is a Canadian rural community in <span class="loc">Sunbury County</span>, <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span>. Located on the <span class="loc">Saint John River</span> immediately downstream (southeast) of <span class="loc">Oromocto</span> on <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span> Route 102, <span class="loc">Burton</span> is the shire town of the county and is the location of the <span class="loc">Sunbury County</span> court house. <span class="loc">Burton</span> has an elementary school for children from Kindergarten to grade 2, <span class="org">Burton Elementary School</span> (<span class="loc">New Brunswick</span>), but older children go to various other <span class="loc">Anglophone</span> West schools located in <span class="loc">Oromocto</span>. <span class="loc">Burton</span> also has a court house and a general store, Ultramar. The first gas station in <span class="loc">Burton</span> was opened by the late <span class="per">Mr. Bonnar</span>, eventually run by his son and sold to <span class="per">Mr. Finnan</span> in <span class="date">the 1970s</span>. It remained a full-service Petro-Canada until its closure in <span class="date">2003</span>. Located adjacent to the Canadian Forces Combat Training Centre at CFB <span class="loc">Gagetown</span>, noises from artillery, helicopters, and other military equipment are common aspects of daily life in <span class="loc">Burton</span>, especially near Hamilton Road which becomes a dirt trail leading into the training area, across a former military rail line <span class="date">now</span> used as a tank run. In addition to the <span class="loc">Sunbury County</span> Courthouse, of historical interest is an old homestead near the <span class="loc">Burton</span> Bridge, about which further information is required. Local accounts of the history mention a tree near the homestead used for an extrajudicial hanging in the mid-19th century. Several other aged buildings can be found in the area, including <span class="date">a mid-19th century</span> house which stands across from the <span class="loc">Burton</span> trailer park on <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span> Route 102.</p><br><br>
