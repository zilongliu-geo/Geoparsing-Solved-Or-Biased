<p>Burgos (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈburgos], <span class="loc">UK</span> /ˈbʊərɡɒs/, <span class="loc">US</span> /ˈbʊərɡoʊs/) is a city in northern <span class="loc">Spain</span> and the historic capital of <span class="loc">Castile</span>. It is situated on the confluence of the Arlanzón river tributaries, at the edge of the Iberian central plateau. It has about 180,000 inhabitants in the actual city and another 20,000 in the metropolitan area. It is the capital of the <span class="loc">province of Burgos</span>, in the autonomous community of <span class="loc">Castile</span> and León. Burgos was once the capital of the Crown of <span class="loc">Castile</span>, and the <span class="loc">Burgos Laws</span> or Leyes de Burgos which first governed the behaviour of Spaniards towards the natives of <span class="loc">the Americas</span> were promulgated here in 1512. It has many historic landmarks, of particular importance; the Cathedral of Burgos (declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984), seat of the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Burgos, the Las Huelgas Reales Monastery and Miraflores Charterhouse. A large number of churches, palaces and other buildings from the medieval age remain. The city is surrounded by the Fuentes Blancas and the Paseo de la Isla parks. Castilian nobleman, military leader and diplomat El Cid Campeador is a significant historical figure in the city, as he was born a couple of kilometres north of <span class="loc">Burgos</span> and was raised and educated here.</p>
