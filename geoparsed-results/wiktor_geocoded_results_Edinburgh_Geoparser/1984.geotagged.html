<p><span class="loc">Cortes</span> is a rural settlement in the <span class="loc">Banff</span> and <span class="loc">Buchan</span> area of <span class="loc">Aberdeenshire</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, situated in the <span class="loc">parish of Rathen</span>, 7.8 kilometres (4.8 mi) south of <span class="loc">Fraserburgh</span>. The area stretches from the grounds of Cortes House in the west to <span class="loc">Cortes</span> Village in the east on the border with the adjacent <span class="loc">parish of Lonmay</span>. <span class="loc">Cortes</span> lies at the northern end of the A952 road at its junction with the A90 road. Regular bus services connect the area to <span class="loc">Fraserburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Peterhead</span> and <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span>, and an on-demand Dial-a-bus service is also available. The nearby Lonmay railway station closed in 1979, and now offers an access point to the <span class="loc">Formartine and Buchan Way</span>, the long-distance path that follows the route of the former railway. To the south lies <span class="loc">Mormond Hill</span>, on the slopes of which a hill figure known as the White Stag of Mormond, marked with quartz stones, was first laid out by Mr F. W. Cordiner of Cortes to mark his wedding in 1870. The name <span class="loc">Cortes</span> is said to derive from a Gaelic word meaning circle, in reference to a structure that was described as a Druid temple in the New Statistical Account of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> (1845), but is now believed to be the remains of a recumbent stone circle.</p>
