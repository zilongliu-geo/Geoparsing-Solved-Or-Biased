<p><span class="loc">Pella</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 10,352 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Pella</span> is the home of Central College, as well as several manufacturing companies, including Pella Corporation and Vermeer Manufacturing Company. <span class="loc">Pella</span> was founded in 1847 when 800 Dutch immigrants led by Dominee (Minister) Hendrik (Henry) P. Scholte settled the area. The name "<span class="loc">Pella</span>" is a reference to <span class="loc">Pella</span> in the <span class="loc">Perea</span>, where the Christians of <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> had found refuge during the Roman-Jewish war of 70; the name was selected because the Dominee and the rest were also seeking religious freedom. It was the childhood home of Wyatt Earp, whose father Nicholas Porter Earp had settled on a farm near <span class="loc">Pella</span>. His brothers Warren and Morgan were born in <span class="loc">Pella</span>. Today, it features a number of local events and architectural sights. The <span class="loc">Vermeer</span> Mill is a fully functional 1850s-style windmill, reaching 134 ft (41 m) high. The <span class="loc">Vermeer</span> Mill grinds wheat into flour using only wind power and is the tallest working windmill in the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p>
