  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Valdez</span> /vælˈdiːz/ (Alutiiq: Suacit) is a city in Valdez-Cordova Census Area in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alaska</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">US</span> Census, the population of the city is 3,976. The city is one of the most important ports in <span class="loc">Alaska</span>. The port of <span class="loc">Valdez</span> was named in <span class="date">1790</span> after the Spanish Navy Minister Antonio Valdés y Fernández Bazán. <span class="loc">Valdez</span> is a fishing port, both for commercial and sport fishing. Freight moves through <span class="loc">Valdez</span> bound for the interior of <span class="loc">Alaska</span>. Sightseeing of the marine life and glaciers, together with both deep-sea fishing, and heli skiing support a tourist industry in <span class="loc">Valdez</span>. The oil from the Trans-Alaska pipeline is loaded onto ships at the <span class="loc">Valdez</span> oil terminal. <span class="org">Alyeska Pipeline Service Company</span> is one of the biggest employers in town but it started to move several positions to its headquarters in Anchorage since the town council passed a resolution charging a tax to all the tankers coming into the port to be loaded with oil. This has had an impact in the population size and the economy. <span class="loc">Valdez</span> is connected to the interior of <span class="loc">Alaska</span> by the Richardson Highway, and is a port of call in the <span class="org">Alaska Marine Highway</span> ferry system. Just north of <span class="loc">Valdez</span> on the highway is <span class="loc">Thompson</span> Pass, which has spectacular waterfalls and glaciers next to the highway. <span class="loc">Thompson</span> Pass is also known for treacherous driving conditions during the <span class="date">winter</span>.</p><br><br>
