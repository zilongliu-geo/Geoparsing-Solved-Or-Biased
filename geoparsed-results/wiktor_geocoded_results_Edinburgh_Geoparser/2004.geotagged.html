<p><span class="loc">Arak</span> (Arabic: آراك‎, also spelled <span class="loc">Urak</span> or Araq) is a village in eastern <span class="loc">Syria</span>, administratively part of the Homs Governorate. It is situated on an oasis in the <span class="loc">Syrian Desert</span> along the road between Palmyra which is 28 kilometers to the southwest and al-Sukhnah to the northeast. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics of <span class="loc">Syria</span> (CBS), <span class="loc">Arak</span> had a population of 111 in the 2004 census. Settlement in <span class="loc">Arak</span> existed at least from the Roman Empire-era in <span class="loc">Syria</span> when it was known "Aracha." Milestones were found in the village dating back to 75 CE and indicated that the Roman governor of <span class="loc">Syria</span> at the time, Marcus Ulpius Traianus, was ordering the construction of a road connecting Palmyra with Sura on the <span class="loc">Euphrates River</span>. An altar in <span class="loc">Arak</span> during this era was dedicated to Yarhibol, the local deity of pagan Palmyra who was worshiped as the patron of the Efqa spring in that city since the Amorite period. The altar, which was built in 209 CE, read "The altar which Maliku son 'mrbn erected to Yarhibol, to the one who irrigates <span class="loc">Arak</span>, to the Gad of the locality, the bountiful god."</p>
