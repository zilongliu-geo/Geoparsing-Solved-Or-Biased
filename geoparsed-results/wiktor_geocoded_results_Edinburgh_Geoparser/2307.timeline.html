  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Stanford</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is one of the oldest settlements in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, having been founded in <span class="date">1775</span>. Its population was 3,487 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>. <span class="loc">Stanford</span> is part of the <span class="org">Danville Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Stanford</span> was founded in <span class="date">1775</span> by <span class="per">Benjamin Logan</span> as <span class="per">Logan</span>'s Fort, alternately known as <span class="loc">St. Asaph</span>, the name given it by <span class="per">Logan</span>. The site of the fort is about one mile west of the courthouse at the center of town. The name "<span class="loc">Fort Logan</span>" is still used to <span class="date">this day</span> by local businesses, including the Fort <span class="org">Logan Hospital</span> and Standing Fort Collectibles. The main street was built on what was originally a buffalo trail. The name <span class="loc">Stanford</span> may have come from "Standing Fort", which <span class="loc">Fort Logan</span> became known as because it survived multiple attacks by British-led Native Americans during the American Revolution. Alternately, it may have been named for <span class="loc">Stamford</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Although it was one of the smaller pioneer forts, it never fell to an attack. In <span class="date">1781</span>, the original settlement expanded when <span class="per">Benjamin Logan</span> donated part of his own land as the site for a courthouse.</p><br><br>
