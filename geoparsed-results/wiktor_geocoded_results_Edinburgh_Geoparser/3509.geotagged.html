<p>Greenfield (formerly, Clarke Colony) is a city in <span class="loc">Monterey County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Greenfield is located in the Salinas Valley, 33 miles (53 km) southeast of Salinas, at an elevation of 289 feet (88 m). The city was the fastest growing in the county during the 2000s, the population was 12,583 in 2000, increasing to 16,330 in the 2010 census. Its most well-known public event is the annual Harvest Festival. Greenfield is a member of the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments. John S. Clarke and other promoters laid out the town from 1902 to 1905 on part of the Rancho Arroyo <span class="loc">Seco</span> Mexican land grant, created by a subdivision of 4,000 acres. The <span class="loc">Clark Colony</span> Water Company, which became the organization for water distribution, filled the city with water from the nearby Arroyo <span class="loc">Seco</span> AVA was formed in April 1905. The organized water canal system and ideal growing conditions attracted people of Danish, Swiss and other nationalities from surrounding areas to settle in Greenfield. Today, the <span class="loc">Clark Colony</span> Water Company still holds 1916 Prior Rights guaranteeing delivery to its members a certain amount of water from the Arroyo <span class="loc">Seco</span> River before any other agencies. In 1906, the district purchased a lot from Edward Greenfield along with two adjacent to the Arroyo Seco Development Company. <span class="loc">Clark Colony</span> evolved into <span class="loc">Clark City</span> and was eventually renamed Greenfield, in honor of Mr. Greenfield., after the <span class="loc">United States</span> Postal Service informed the City that there were too many "<span class="loc">Clark Cities</span>" in the state. Greenfield was recognized as a municipality by the State legislature and incorporated on January 7, 1947. Greenfield's first Mayor was Tom Rogers.</p>
