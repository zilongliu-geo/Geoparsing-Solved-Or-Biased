<p><span class="loc">Medford</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, on the <span class="loc">Mystic River</span>, 3.2 miles northwest of downtown <span class="loc">Boston</span>. In the 2010 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, Medford's population was 56,173. It is the home of Tufts University. <span class="loc">Medford</span> was settled in 1630 as part of <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>. The area was originally called "Mistick" by Thomas Dudley (a name which persisted for many decades), which his party renamed "Meadford". In 1634, the land north of the <span class="loc">Mystic River</span> became the private plantation of former Governor Matthew Cradock; across the river was Ten <span class="loc">Hills Farm</span>, which belonged to John Winthrop, Governor of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts Bay</span> colony. The name may have come from a description of the "meadow by the ford" in the <span class="loc">Mystic River</span>, or from two locations in <span class="loc">England</span> that Cradock may have known: the hamlet of <span class="loc">Mayford</span> or Metford in <span class="loc">Staffordshire</span> near <span class="loc">Caverswall</span>, or from the <span class="loc">parish of Maidford</span> or <span class="loc">Medford</span> (now <span class="loc">Towcester</span>, <span class="loc">Northamptonshire</span>). In 1637, the first bridge (a toll bridge) across the <span class="loc">Mystic River</span> was built at the site of the present-day <span class="loc">Cradock</span> Bridge, which carries Main Street into Medford Square. It would be the only bridge across the Mystic until 1787, and as such became a major route for traffic coming into <span class="loc">Boston</span> from the north (though ferries and fords were also used). The bridge would be rebuilt in 1880 and 1909.</p>
