<p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> (2011 population 126,748) is a city located in Southern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> at the confluence of the Grand and Speed rivers in the <span class="loc">Regional Municipality of Waterloo</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is an amalgamation of the <span class="loc">City of Galt</span>, the towns of Preston and Hespeler, and the hamlet of Blair. <span class="loc">Galt</span> covers the largest portion of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, making up the southern half of the city. Preston and Blair are located on the western side of the city, while Hespeler is in the most northeasterly section of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> began as a composite city in 1973, when the <span class="loc">City of Galt</span>, Towns of Preston and Hespeler, and the hamlet of Blair were amalgamated. There was considerable resistance among the local population to this "shotgun marriage" arranged by the provincial government and a healthy sense of rivalry had always governed relations among the three communities. Even today, though many residents will tell the outside world that they call Cambridge home, they will often identify themselves to each other as citizens of <span class="loc">Galt</span> or Preston or Hespeler. Each unique centre has its own history that is well documented in the <span class="loc">Cambridge City</span> Archives.</p>
