<p><span class="loc">Filadelfia</span> is the capital of Boquerón Department in the <span class="loc">Gran Chaco</span> of western <span class="loc">Paraguay</span>. It is the centre of the Fernheim Colony. It is about a 5 hour drive from the capital of Asunción. With a population of about 10,000, it is the largest town for 400 kilometres (250 mi). <span class="loc">Filadelfia</span> was founded in 1930 by Russian Mennonites who fled from the Soviet Union. <span class="loc">Filadelfia</span> lay near the front of the Chaco War, but was little affected. It became divided in the Second World War, with some of the original German colonists supporting <span class="loc">Germany</span> and later being expelled. <span class="loc">Filadelfia</span> has developed into an important cattle herding settlement.. Today the town is home to a museum, a library, a radio station and a hospital. The museum displays objects from the town's Mennonite past, such as Russian overcoats, as well as the local wildlife, such as stuffed armadillos, anteaters, and toads.. The colony's villages lie around <span class="loc">Filadelfia</span>, as do several native reserves, home to much of the area's native population, from the Chulupí, <span class="loc">Lengua</span>, Toba-Pilaga, Sanapaná and Ayoreo groups. A modern supermarket is located in the centre of the town, which is the last place to get groceries before heading farther out into the <span class="loc">Chaco</span>. Most of the town's potable water supply is drawn from underground cisterns, being replenished by intermittent rainfall; the underground water is too salty to drink. A small commemorative park known as Parque Trebol lies about 5 km (3 mi) to the east of town. It now serves as a place for visitors to camp for the night.</p>
