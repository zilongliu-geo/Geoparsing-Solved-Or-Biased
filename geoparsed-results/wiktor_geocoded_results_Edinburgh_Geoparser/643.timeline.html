  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Brandon is a village in <span class="loc">County Durham</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is situated a short distance to the southwest of <span class="loc">Durham</span>. Brandon was originally one of the seven townships within the ancient <span class="loc">parish of Brancepeth</span>. It grew from a sparsely populated agricultural area into a populous mining district after the establishment of collieries and later coke and fireclay works. Until the 19th century Brandon village, formerly known as East Brandon, was one of the larger settlements in <span class="loc">Brancepeth Parish</span>. Brandon was also a manor of the medieval lordship of <span class="loc">Brancepeth</span> and as such was possessed by the Neville family, the Earls of <span class="loc">Westmoreland</span>, while <span class="loc">Holywell</span>, <span class="loc">Langley</span>, <span class="loc">Littleburn</span> and other such localities were the sites of large freehold gentry houses. After the Northern Rising of <span class="date">1569</span>, <span class="per">Elizabeth I</span> confiscated <span class="loc">Brancepeth</span> Castle and its territories. These were administered as <span class="loc">Crown Lands</span> until the 1620s and plundered by a series of courtiers and Royal lessees. In 1628-29 these lands were conveyed to the <span class="loc">City of London</span>, when <span class="per">Charles I</span> was forced to redeem his debts to the city. The <span class="loc">Brancepeth</span> lands were broken up in a series of sales to <span class="loc">London</span> merchants and financiers who in turn resold to local buyers at high profits. The one exception to this fate was Brandon manor, which remained in the hands of its <span class="loc">London</span> buyer. A silk merchant, <span class="per">Edward Cropley</span>, bought the whole estate of Brandon manor for Â£1,700 in <span class="date">1630</span>, and his family held onto the property till <span class="date">1710</span>. It was then conveyed to the <span class="per">Earl of Shaftesbury</span> and remained in his family until the 1800s.</p><br><br>
