  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Berkeley</span> (/ˈbɑːrkliː/) is a small town and parish in <span class="loc">Gloucestershire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies in the <span class="loc">Vale of Berkeley</span> between the east bank of the <span class="loc">River Severn</span> and the M5 motorway, within the Stroud administrative district. The town is noted for <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> Castle, where the imprisoned <span class="per">Edward II</span> was murdered. <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> lies mid-way between <span class="loc">Bristol</span> and <span class="loc">Gloucester</span>, on a small hill in the <span class="loc">Vale of Berkeley</span>. The town is on the <span class="loc">Little Avon River</span>, which flows into the <span class="loc">Severn</span> at <span class="loc">Berkeley Pill</span>. The Little Avon was tidal, and so navigable, for some distance inland (as far as <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> itself and the <span class="loc">Sea Mills</span> at Ham) until a 'tidal reservoir' was implemented at <span class="loc">Berkeley Pill</span> in <span class="date">the late 1960s</span>. An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches from <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> in the south to <span class="loc">Hinton</span> in the north. The total ward population taken at the <span class="date">2011</span> census was 4,181. <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> was first recorded in 824 as Berclea, from the Old English for "birch lee". <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> was a significant place in medieval times. It was a port and market-town, and the meeting place of the hundred of <span class="loc">Berkeley</span>. After the <span class="per">Norman Conquest</span>, a Flemish noble named <span class="per">Roger de Tosny</span> was appointed Provost of the manor of <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> by his brother-in-law (or perhaps uncle) <span class="per">Earl William</span> FitzOsbern. His family took the name "de <span class="loc">Berkeley</span>", and it was he who began the construction of <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> Castle, which was completed by his son, also <span class="per">Roger</span>. A younger son of the elder <span class="per">Roger, John</span> de <span class="loc">Berkeley</span>, went north to <span class="loc">Scotland</span> with Queen Maud, becoming the progenitor of the Scottish <span class="loc">Barclay</span> family.</p><br><br>
