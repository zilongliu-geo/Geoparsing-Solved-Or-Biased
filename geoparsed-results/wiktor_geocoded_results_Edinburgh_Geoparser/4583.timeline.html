  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Carney is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in <span class="loc">Baltimore County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 29,941 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Carney is located at 39°23′48″N 76°31′27″W (39.396707, -76.524078). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 7.0 square miles (18 km2), all of it land. In <span class="date">1880</span>, <span class="per">Thomas Carney</span> immigrated to the <span class="loc">United States</span> from <span class="loc">Ireland</span> and settled in <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>. Soon after his arrival, he married the former <span class="per">Mary McDermot</span> and bought forty and a half acres on the southeast side of the <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> and <span class="loc">Harford Turnpike</span>. <span class="date">Several years later</span> (about <span class="date">1885</span>), the Carney family moved to what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Harford</span> and <span class="per">Joppa</span> roads, where <span class="per">Thomas Carney</span> opened a general store which is believed to have served as the Eight Mile House on the turnpike. The store was located on the site presently occupied by the Barn Restaurant. In the 1880s and 1890s the store also served as the Carney family home. When the family grew too large for the store, <span class="per">Mr. Carney</span> built a new house on the hill behind the store. The house was completed in about <span class="date">1898</span> and stood in the vicinity of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="org">Thornewood Court</span>. <span class="date">Thirty-five years later</span>, the Carney house was moved to its present location at the corner of <span class="loc">Joppa</span> and <span class="loc">Avondale</span> roads and is <span class="date">now</span> a real estate office.</p><br><br>
