  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Coos County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 869 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the northernmost town in <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> and the largest town by area in the state – and in <span class="loc">New England</span> as well – more than twice the size of the next largest town, Lincoln. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 3 is the only major highway in the town, although the northern terminus of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 145 also lies within <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span>. <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Berlin</span>, NH–VT <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> derives its name from <span class="per">William Pitt</span>, Prime Minister of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. Prior to its incorporation in <span class="date">1840</span>, the area was settled c. <span class="date">1810</span> and known as the Territory of Indian Stream. It had the unique distinction of having been its own microstate briefly during the 1830s, called the Republic of Indian Stream, due to an ambiguous boundary between the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Pittsburg shares an international border with <span class="loc">Québec province</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> to its west and north, and borders the states of <span class="loc">Maine</span> (to the east) and <span class="loc">Vermont</span> (a very small portion to the southwest). Directly to the south is <span class="loc">Clarksville</span>. <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> is the only <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> municipality to border <span class="loc">Canada</span>, the only one that borders both <span class="loc">Maine</span> and <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, the only one to share a land border with <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, and the only town entirely north of the 45th parallel. <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> contains the only part of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> west of the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>, as that river defines the <span class="loc">Vermont</span> state line from <span class="loc">Clarksville</span> southward. <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>'s only Canadian border crossing is located at the northern end of town at the terminus of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 3. The western edge of <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> is defined by Halls Stream, being the "northwesternmost headwaters of the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>", which defined (ambiguously) the border in the Treaty of <span class="loc">Paris</span> of <span class="date">1783</span>.</p><br><br>
