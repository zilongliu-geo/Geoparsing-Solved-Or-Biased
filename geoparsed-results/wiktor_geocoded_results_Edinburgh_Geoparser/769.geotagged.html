<p>Eureka is a mining ghost town in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Juan County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along the Animas River, between <span class="loc">Silverton</span> and <span class="loc">Animas Forks</span>. Charles Baker's group of prospectors found traces of placer gold in the <span class="loc">San Juan</span> Mountains in 1860 at Eureka. Forced by the Ute Tribe out in 1861, who had been awarded the area in a <span class="loc">US</span> treaty. The prospectors returned in 1871, when lode gold was found in the Little Giant vein at <span class="loc">Arrastre Gulch</span> near <span class="loc">Silverton</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. The miners were allowed to stay after the Brunot Treaty of 13 Sept. 1873. In exchange for giving up 4 million acres, the <span class="loc">Southern Ute Indian Reservation</span> received $25,000 per year. By 1875, Eureka had a post office. The original mill was closed (reasons unknown) but to replace it, the Gold Prince Mill from <span class="loc">Animas Forks</span> was deconstructed and moved to the Eureka townsite to become the <span class="loc">Sunnyside</span> mill. In 1896, Eureka was connected to the <span class="loc">Denver</span> and <span class="loc">Rio</span> Grande Railroad via the <span class="loc">Silverton</span> Northern Railroad. Although the community grew steadily — not like a boomtown — it quickly declined after 1939, when the <span class="loc">Sunnyside</span> Mill closed for the last time. Today, the original townsite gravel roads remain, and debris litters the area. The only remaining structure is the Eureka jail, which has been restored. Foundations remain of the <span class="loc">Sunnyside</span> mill.</p>
