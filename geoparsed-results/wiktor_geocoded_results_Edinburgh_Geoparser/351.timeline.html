  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Barra</span> (Scottish Gaelic: <span class="loc">Barraigh</span>, Eilean Bharraigh, pronounced [ˈparˠaj, ˈelan ˈvarˠaj]) is an island in the <span class="loc">Outer Hebrides</span> in <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. <span class="loc">Barra</span> is the second southernmost inhabited island of the <span class="loc">Outer Hebrides</span> after the adjacent island of <span class="loc">Vatersay</span>, to which it is connected by a causeway. In <span class="date">2011</span> the population was 1,174, almost 100 higher than the 1,078 counted at the time of the <span class="date">2001</span> census. According to the <span class="date">2011</span> Census, there are 761 Gaelic speakers (62%) on <span class="loc">Barra</span>. The area of <span class="loc">Barra</span> is roughly 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi), the main village being <span class="loc">Castlebay</span> (<span class="loc">Bàgh a' Chaisteil</span>). The west of the island has white sandy beaches backed by shell-sand, machair and the east has numerous rocky inlets. <span class="loc">Kisimul</span> Castle at <span class="loc">Castlebay</span> is located on a rock in the bay, so giving the village its name. A smaller castle can be found in the middle of Loch <span class="per">St Clare</span> on the west side of the Island in <span class="loc">Tangasdale</span>. The highest elevation on the island is <span class="loc">Heaval</span>, halfway up which is located a prominent white marble statue of the <span class="loc">Madonna</span> and Child, called "Our Lady of the Sea", which was erected during the (<span class="org">Marian</span> year) of <span class="date">1954</span>. The predominant faith on the island is Catholicism and the Catholic church dedicated to Our Lady of the Sea is immediately apparent to all who arrive into <span class="loc">Castlebay</span>.</p><br><br>
