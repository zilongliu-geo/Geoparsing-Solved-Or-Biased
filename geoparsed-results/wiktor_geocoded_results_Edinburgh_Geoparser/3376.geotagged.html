<p><span class="loc">Vermont</span> (/vərˈmɒnt/ or /vɜːrˈmɒnt/, locally: [vɚˈmɑ̟̃(ʔ)]) is the second least populous of the 50 states in the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>, containing roughly 40,000 more people than <span class="loc">Wyoming</span>. Geographically located in the northeastern part of the country, Vermont shares borders with the other <span class="loc">U.S.</span> states of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> to the south, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> to the east, <span class="loc">New York</span> to the west, and an international border with the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Quebec</span> to the north. <span class="loc">Lake Champlain</span> forms half of Vermont's western border with the state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. The <span class="loc">Green Mountains</span> run north-south the length of the state and forests cover approximately 75% of its total land area. <span class="loc">Vermont</span> is the leading producer of maple syrup in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Originally inhabited by two major Native American tribes (the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and the <span class="loc">Iroquois</span>), much of the territory that is now <span class="loc">Vermont</span> was claimed by <span class="loc">France</span> during its early colonial period. <span class="loc">France</span> ceded the territory to <span class="loc">Britain</span> after being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years' War (referred to as the French and Indian War in the <span class="loc">US</span>). For many years, the nearby colonies, especially the Provinces of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span>, disputed control of the area (then called the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Grants). Settlers who held land titles granted by these colonies were opposed by the Green Mountain Boys militia, which eventually prevailed in creating an independent state, the Vermont Republic. Founded in 1777 during the Revolutionary War, the republic lasted for fourteen years. Aside from the Thirteen Colonies, <span class="loc">Vermont</span> is one of only four <span class="loc">U.S.</span> states that was previously a sovereign state (along with <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">Hawaii</span>, and <span class="loc">Texas</span>). In 1791, <span class="loc">Vermont</span> joined the <span class="loc">United States</span> as the 14th state, the first in addition to the original 13 colonies. <span class="loc">Vermont</span> was the first state to partially abolish slavery while still independent and played an important geographical role in the Underground Railroad, which helped American slaves escape to <span class="loc">Canada</span>.</p>
