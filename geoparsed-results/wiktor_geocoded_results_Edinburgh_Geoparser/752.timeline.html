  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Windsor</span> is a small historic unincorporated community located within Robbinsville Township (known as Washington Township until <span class="date">2007</span>) in <span class="loc">Mercer County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The area is served as <span class="loc">United States</span> Postal Service ZIP Code 08561. There are approximately 50 homes in the area, and as of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the population for ZIP Code Tabulation Area 08561 was 226. The community, covering 570 acres (230 ha), was added to <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> in <span class="date">1992</span>. Earliest mention of the local area in the 17th century refers to it as a wilderness with several Native American camps. Founded in <span class="date">1818</span>, it was named <span class="loc">Centerville</span> because it was the geographical center of the state. Until then, adjacent heavily wooded lands were called Magrilla (origins unknown). In <span class="date">1814</span>, after the completion of the <span class="loc">Bordentown</span> and <span class="loc">South Amboy</span> stagecoach turnpike, <span class="per">William McKnight</span>, director of the turnpike company, built a tavern at the intersection of the turnpike and present-day Windsor-Perrineville Road. A major thruway between <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>, the turnpike replaced Old York Road, which started out as a Native-American path prior to European settlement. In <span class="date">1816</span> the local section of the stagecoach turnpike between <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> ran along Main Street. In <span class="date">late 1831</span>, the <span class="loc">Camden</span> and Amboy Railroad was constructed through <span class="loc">Centerville</span>. The village became a stopover for rail travelers, and a thriving center for the bountiful farms and mills which serviced the growing population. It quickly became the largest village between <span class="loc">Yardville</span> (Sand Town) and <span class="loc">Hightstown</span>, and was renamed "Windsor" in <span class="date">1846</span> to avoid any confusion with a Centerville post office in <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>.</p><br><br>
