<p><span class="loc">Cleveland</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, within Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area and <span class="loc">Liberty County</span>. The population was 7,954 at the 2010 census. In 1854, a church and convent was built by Father Peter <span class="loc">La Cour</span> near the town's present site. The town began forming in 1878 when Charles Lander <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, a local judge, donated 63.6 acres (257,000 m2) of land to the <span class="loc">Houston</span> East &amp; <span class="loc">West Texas Railway</span> (now part of the Union Pacific Railroad) for use as a stop, requesting that the town be named for him. Since 1900 <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> has served as the junction of this line and the Gulf, <span class="loc">Colorado</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> (now the BNSF Railway). The town was not incorporated until 1935. The forests around <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, including <span class="loc">Sam Houston National Forest</span>, which is located just to its north, are a resort for many inhabitants of the <span class="loc">Houston</span> area, who come to camp, hike, hunt, and fish. <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> has several historic sites and public recreational facilities, including two parks. The Austin Memorial Library Center offers a wide range of services to the community, and the Texan Theater and the annual livestock show and rodeo, Dairy Days, provide entertainment. Commercially, <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> has been a shipping point for timber, lumber, and lumber byproducts since the 1870s. A large medical community, oil, gas, cattle, farm products, and sand and gravel are important to the town's economy. The general trend toward urbanization of the entire area is reflected by the fact that in 1965 <span class="loc">Liberty County</span> was added to the Houston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> grew from 1,200 in 1930 to 7,605 according to the census of 2000.</p>
