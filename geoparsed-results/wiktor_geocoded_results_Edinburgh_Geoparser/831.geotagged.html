It was first named by the merchant and inventor Samuel Blodget (after whom the Samuel Blodget Park in <span class="loc">Manchester</span> North is named).

It is located in <span class="loc">Hillsborough County</span> along the banks of the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span>, which divides the city into eastern and western sections. <span class="loc">Manchester</span> is near the northern end of the Northeast megalopolis. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 109,565, and its 2014 population estimate was 110,448. As of the 2014 population estimate, <span class="loc">Manchester</span> is the largest <span class="loc">New England</span> city north of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, including other <span class="loc">Massachusetts cities</span>. The <span class="loc">Manchester-Nashua metropolitan</span> area, with an estimated population in 2014 of 405,184, is home to nearly one-third of the population of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>.</p>
