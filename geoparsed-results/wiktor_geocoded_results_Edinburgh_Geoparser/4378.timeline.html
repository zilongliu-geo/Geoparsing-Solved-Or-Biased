  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Memphis</span> is a city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Hall County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 2,290. <span class="loc">Memphis</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, the county seat of <span class="loc">Hall County</span>, is at the junction of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 287, State Highway 256, and Farm Road <span class="date">1547</span>, in the northeastern part of the county. It started in <span class="date">1889</span>, when <span class="per">J. C. Montgomery</span> purchased land for a townsite north of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> on the <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span> and <span class="loc">Denver City Railway</span>. This land had been previously owned by <span class="per">W. H. Robertson</span>, who had a dugout near <span class="loc">Parker Creek</span>. <span class="per">Montgomery</span> and <span class="per">Robertson</span>, with <span class="per">Rev. J. W. Brice</span> and <span class="per">T. J. Woods, Jr.</span>, of Dallas, formed a townsite company and presented a plat <span class="date">early in January</span> <span class="date">1890</span>. <span class="per">P. M. Kelly</span> opened a law office. A rooming house (later the <span class="loc">Memphis</span> Hotel), a general store, a drugstore, and several residences were soon erected. For a time the new town was without a name. Several suggestions were submitted to federal postal authorities but with negative results. Finally, as the story goes, <span class="per">Reverend Brice</span>, while in Austin, happened to see a letter addressed by accident to <span class="loc">Memphis</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, rather than <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, with the notation "no such town in <span class="loc">Texas</span>." The name was submitted and accepted, and a post office was established on <span class="date">September 12, 1890</span>, with <span class="per">Robertson</span> as postmaster.</p><br><br>
