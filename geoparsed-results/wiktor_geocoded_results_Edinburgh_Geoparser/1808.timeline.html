  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The <span class="loc">Western Province</span> (<span class="per">Sinhalese</span>: බස්නාහිර පළාත Basnahira Palata; <span class="per">Tamil</span>: மேல் மாகாணம் Mael Maakaanam) is one of the nine provinces of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>, the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until <span class="date">1987</span> when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> established provincial councils. The province is the most densely populated province in the country and is home to the legislative capital Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte as well to <span class="loc">Colombo</span>, the nation's administrative and business center. Parts of present day <span class="loc">Western Province</span> were part of the pre-colonial Kingdom of <span class="loc">Kotte</span>. The province then came under Portuguese, Dutch and British control. In <span class="date">1815</span> the British gained control of the entire island of <span class="loc">Ceylon</span>. They divided the island into three ethnic based administrative structures: Low Country <span class="per">Sinhalese</span>, Kandyan <span class="per">Sinhalese</span> and <span class="per">Tamil</span>. The <span class="loc">Western Province</span> was part of the Low Country <span class="per">Sinhalese</span> administration. In <span class="date">1833</span>, in accordance with the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, the ethnic based administrative structures were unified into a single administration divided into five geographic provinces. The <span class="loc">districts of Chilaw</span>, <span class="loc">Colombo</span>, <span class="loc">Kalutara</span>, <span class="loc">Puttalam</span>, Seven Korales (present day <span class="loc">Kurunegala District</span>), Three Korales, Four Korales and Lower Bulatgama (present day <span class="loc">Kegalle District</span>) formed the new <span class="loc">Western Province</span>. <span class="loc">Chilaw District</span>, <span class="loc">Puttalam District</span> and Seven Korales were transferred to the newly created <span class="loc">North Western Province</span> in <span class="date">1845</span>. Three Korales, Four Korales and Lower Bulatgama were transferred to the newly created <span class="loc">Sabaragamuwa Province</span> in <span class="date">1889</span>.</p><br><br>
