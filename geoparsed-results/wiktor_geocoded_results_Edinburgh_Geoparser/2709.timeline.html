  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tampa</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 112. In <span class="date">1802</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span> returned most of the land to <span class="loc">France</span>. In <span class="date">1803</span>, most of the land for modern day <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was acquired by the <span class="loc">United States</span> from <span class="loc">France</span> as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. From the 1820s to the 1870s, one of the most significant land routes in the <span class="loc">United States</span> was the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail. It was located along the edge of what would become <span class="loc">Tampa</span>. Two <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail markers were located on the trail near <span class="loc">Tampa</span>. The trail was active across <span class="loc">Marion County</span> from <span class="date">1821</span> to <span class="date">1866</span>. In <span class="date">1854</span>, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in <span class="date">1861</span> <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In <span class="date">1855</span>, <span class="loc">Marion County</span> was established within the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory, which included the land for modern day <span class="loc">Tampa</span>. In <span class="date">1887</span>, the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Nebraska Railway built a main line from <span class="loc">Herington</span> through <span class="loc">Tampa</span> to <span class="loc">Pratt</span>. In <span class="date">1888</span>, this line was extended to Liberal. Later, it was extended to Tucumcari, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and <span class="loc">El Paso</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. It foreclosed in <span class="date">1891</span> and taken over by <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> and Pacific Railway, which shut down in <span class="date">1980</span> and reorganized as <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Texas Railroad, merged in <span class="date">1988</span> with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and finally merged in <span class="date">1997</span> with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the "<span class="loc">Rock Island</span>".</p><br><br>
