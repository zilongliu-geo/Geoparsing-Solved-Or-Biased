<p><span class="loc">Pura</span> is a municipality in the <span class="loc">district of Lugano</span> in the canton of <span class="loc">Ticino</span> in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. <span class="loc">Pura</span> is first mentioned around 751-760, though this is found in a 17th Century copy of the original. In the Middle Ages several institutions such as the monastery of <span class="loc">San Pietro</span> in <span class="loc">Ciel</span> d'<span class="loc">Oro</span> in <span class="loc">Pavia</span>, <span class="loc">Como Cathedral</span>, <span class="loc">Disentis Abbey</span> and the monastery of <span class="loc">Agno</span> possessed property or land in <span class="loc">Pura</span>. The village was part of the <span class="loc">Agno parish</span> until 1603 when it became a separate parish. The parish church of <span class="loc">San Martino</span> was first mentioned in 1352. It was rebuilt in 1580 and expanded between 1642 and 1658. The village economy was based mainly on agriculture, livestock and the dairy industry. The dairy cooperative opened in 1890. Due to limited farming land many of the residents emigrated in the 19th Century. The majority of them went to <span class="loc">Italy</span> to work as brickmakers. In the 1960s, a strong construction boom began. By 2000, approximately three quarters of the working population are commuters, especially to <span class="loc">Lugano</span>. <span class="loc">Pura</span> has an area, as of 1997, of 3.04 square kilometers (1.17 sq mi). Of this area, 0.67 km2 (0.26 sq mi) or 22.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 2.28 km2 (0.88 sq mi) or 75.0% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 0.53 km2 (0.20 sq mi) or 17.4% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.02 km2 (4.9 acres) or 0.7% is either rivers or lakes and 0.02 km2 (4.9 acres) or 0.7% is unproductive land.</p>
