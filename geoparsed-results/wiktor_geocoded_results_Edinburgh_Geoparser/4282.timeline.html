  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>For the town in: <span class="loc">Butte County</span>; see <span class="loc">Bagdad</span>, <span class="loc">Butte County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> and the town in <span class="loc">Arizona</span>; see <span class="loc">Bagdad</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span> <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> is a ghost town in the <span class="loc">Mojave Desert</span>, in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Bernardino County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> is located along the historic <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66, <span class="loc">east of Barstow</span> and <span class="loc">Ludlow</span>, and west of <span class="loc">Amboy</span> and Needles. The town was founded in <span class="date">1883</span> when the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway railway line between <span class="per">Barstow</span> and <span class="per">Needles</span> was built. At this time, <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> provided services to the <span class="org">Orange</span> Blossom Mine several miles to the north, and to the War Eagle Mine several miles to the south. In addition, a dirt track extended south past the War Eagle Mine into the Dale Mining District in the <span class="loc">Pinto Mountains</span>. <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> was long a thriving town along the National Old Trails Road and the famous Route 66. It was bypassed by the opening of Interstate 40 to the north in <span class="date">1973</span>, and lost traveler's business and resident population. The remaining buildings were razed in <span class="date">1991</span>, leaving little trace of the town. <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> holds the record for the longest dry streak in <span class="loc">United States</span> history with 767 straight <span class="date">days</span> without rain, from <span class="date">October 3, 1912</span> to <span class="date">November 8, 1914</span>. It is to the south of the <span class="loc">Granite Mountains</span> and the <span class="loc">Mojave National Preserve</span>, and north of the <span class="loc">Bullion Mountains</span>.</p><br><br>
