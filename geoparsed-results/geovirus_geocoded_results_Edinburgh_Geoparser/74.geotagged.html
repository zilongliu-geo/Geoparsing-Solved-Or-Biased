<p>Numerous cities throughout <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> have begun broadening their efforts to fight mosquito populations, in an effort to reduce transmission of the sometimes-lethal <span class="loc">West Nile</span> virus. Officials in <span class="loc">Dallas County</span> have declared a public health emergency. Officials there have requested use of five planes, intended to spray most of North Dallas, as well as other sections of the city. Tim Whitley, a city official in <span class="loc">Malakoff</span>, told Wikinews his city has begun using a pesticide specialist to spray two times weekly. According to <span class="loc">Whitley</span>, certain atmospheric conditions, such as wind speed and humidity, must be right before the large scale treatments can occur. He explained two treatments per week is more often than usual for the city. "With the concerns in Dallas, we're taking it seriously", <span class="loc">Whitley</span> added. Even in the drier climate found in <span class="loc">Abilene</span>, mosquitos recently tested were carrying the virus. As a result, that city has increased its pesticide treatments. Media sources indicate well over 80 cases of <span class="loc">West Nile</span> virus have been reported this year in Dallas alone. A top-ranking <span class="loc">Dallas County</span> official told media he views the problem with serious concern. There have been nine cases of <span class="loc">West Nile</span> virus in the <span class="loc">Houston region</span>, with one of those resulting in death. A <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> woman who is a former resident of Lubbock told media earlier this month she'd contracted the virus and believed she'd been bitten while visiting Austin. About 60 percent of <span class="loc">West Nile</span> cases in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> happen in <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Historically, there have been some objections raised over aerial spraying and the potential health hazards distributing such chemicals may pose. A California study, however, showed evidence that in areas where aerial spraying occurred, infection was six times less likely to occur. The earliest cases of the virus appeared in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> in the late 1990s.</p>
