  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Beers, sofas, TVs found in St. <span class="loc">Marys River</span>. <span class="loc">St. Marys</span> — The 130-mile St. <span class="loc">Marys River</span> is among the nation’s cleanest waterways, but not everyone cares. Although most people appreciate the <span class="loc">St. Marys</span> for its serenity and unspoiled beauty, beer drinkers have found another use for the river — as a dumping ground for their empties. <span class="per">Dean Woehrle</span>, co-chairman of the St. Marys River Management Committee, estimates about 60 percent of the trash picked up each year during the <span class="loc">St. Marys</span> River Celebration is discarded beer bottles. Considering volunteers have pulled more than 500,000 pounds of trash from the river and its tributaries since the first cleanup in <span class="date">1997</span>, that’s a lot of empties. <span class="per">Woehrle</span> believes the ratio of empties to other trash will remain the same when as many as 850 volunteers from <span class="per">Camden</span> and <span class="per">Charlton</span> counties in <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and <span class="per">Nassau</span> and <span class="per">Baker</span> counties in <span class="loc">Florida</span> participate in <span class="date">today</span>’s cleanup. Of course, beer bottles aren’t the only trash pulled from the river each year. Past cleanups have turned up items such as couches, air conditioners, bowling balls, vehicle parts and refrigerators, stoves and other large appliances. <span class="loc">Charlton County</span> manager <span class="per">Steve Nance</span> said he doesn’t understand why people dump household furnishings in the river, because the county picks up those items at no extra charge on trash collection <span class="date">days</span>.</p><br><br>
