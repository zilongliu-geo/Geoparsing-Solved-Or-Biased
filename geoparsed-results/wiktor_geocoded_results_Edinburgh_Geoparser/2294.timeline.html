  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dumbo</span> (or <span class="loc">DUMBO</span>, short for Down Under the <span class="per">Manhattan</span> Bridge Overpass) is a neighborhood in the New <span class="loc">York City</span> <span class="loc">borough of Brooklyn</span>. It encompasses two sections: one located between the <span class="per">Manhattan</span> and <span class="per">Brooklyn</span> Bridges, which connect <span class="per">Brooklyn</span> to <span class="loc">Manhattan</span> across the <span class="loc">East River</span>, and another that continues east from the <span class="loc">Manhattan</span> Bridge to the <span class="loc">Vinegar Hill</span> area. The neighborhood is bounded by <span class="per">Brooklyn</span> Bridge Park to the north, the <span class="loc">Brooklyn</span> Bridge to the west, <span class="loc">Brooklyn Heights</span> to the south and <span class="loc">Vinegar Hill</span> to the east. <span class="loc">Dumbo</span> is part of <span class="org">Brooklyn Community Board</span> 2. Originally a ferry landing and industrial area, the entirety of <span class="loc">Dumbo</span> was bought by developer <span class="per">David Walentas</span> and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community first becoming a haven for artist galleries and presently a center for technology startups. The large community of tech startups earned <span class="loc">DUMBO</span> the moniker as "the center of the <span class="per">Brooklyn</span> Tech Triangle". In that time, <span class="loc">Dumbo</span> has become <span class="per">Brooklyn</span>'s most expensive neighborhood, as well as New <span class="loc">York City</span>'s fourth richest community overall, due in part to the large concentration of technology startups, its close proximity to <span class="loc">Manhattan</span> and the prevalence of converted industrial buildings into spacious luxury residential lofts.</p><br><br>
