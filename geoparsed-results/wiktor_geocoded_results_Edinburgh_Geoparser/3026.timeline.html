  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Stanton is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Yavapai County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, that is <span class="date">now</span> used as an RV park. The town was originally a stagecoach stop known as Antelope Station, and was later renamed "Stanton" after the businessman and crook <span class="per">Chuck Stanton</span>, who took over the town in the 1870s. Stanton is located about twenty miles north of <span class="loc">Wickenburg</span>, at the base of <span class="per">Rich Hill</span>, near the ghost towns of <span class="per">Octave</span> and <span class="per">Weaver</span>. The town of Stanton, like the towns of <span class="per">Octave</span> and <span class="per">Weaver</span>, owe their existence to a group of pioneers who discovered gold in the area in <span class="date">1863</span>. Led by the frontiersman <span class="per">Pauline Weaver</span>, the explorers were camped along <span class="loc">Antelope Creek</span> when one of the men - a tracker named Alvaro - decided to go chasing after a runaway burro. After climbing to the top of what would become known as <span class="per">Rich Hill</span>, Alvaro tripped over a pile of gold nuggets that were "as big as potatoes." Soon after, <span class="per">Pauline Weaver</span> and a friend named <span class="per">Jack Swilling</span> found another pile of gold on top of nearby <span class="per">Antelope Hill</span>. <span class="per">Weaver</span> said that gold was so plentiful in the area that he could pop nuggets out of the ground with a knife, and that one acre yielded nearly $500,000 in gold.</p><br><br>
