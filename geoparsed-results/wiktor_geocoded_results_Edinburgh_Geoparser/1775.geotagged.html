<p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 41,052. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Winchester</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is part of the Tullahoma-Manchester, TN Micropolitan Statistical Area. Euro-American settlement began around 1800, and the county was formally organized in 1807 and named for Benjamin Franklin. During the next several decades, the size of the county was reduced several times by reorganizations which created the neighboring counties of <span class="loc">Coffee County</span>, <span class="loc">Moore County</span>, and <span class="loc">Grundy County</span>. One of the most notable early settlers was frontiersman Davy Crockett, who came about 1812 but is not thought to have remained long. The University of the South, founded by the Episcopal Church, was organized just before the Civil War. It began full operations shortly after hostilities ceased. It encompasses a full university and theological seminary. The University of Tennessee Space Institute is also located in the county. The area became strongly secessionist before the war. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> formally threatened to secede from <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> and join <span class="loc">Alabama</span> if <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> did not leave the union, which it shortly did. This contrasted sharply with the situation in nearby <span class="loc">Winston County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, which was pro-Union and discussed seceding from <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. The two illustrate the often divided and confused state of loyalties in the central South during this period.</p>
