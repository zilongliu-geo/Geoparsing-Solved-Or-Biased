  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mineral County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, <span class="loc">MD-WV Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 28,212. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Keyser</span>. The county was founded in <span class="date">1866</span>. <span class="loc">Mineral County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, <span class="loc">MD-WV Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It was not until after <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> became a state in <span class="date">1863</span> that present-day <span class="loc">Mineral County</span> was organized. It was created in <span class="date">1866</span> by an <span class="org">Act of the West</span> Virginia Legislature from the existing <span class="loc">Hampshire County</span>. The name was selected due to its reserves of minerals, especially coal (although, technically, coal is not a true mineral). The northern terminus of the <span class="loc">Allegheny Front</span> in <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> lies in <span class="loc">Mineral County</span>, and contains the highest point in the county. Known as the <span class="org">Pinnacle</span> it is 3,104 feet (946 m) above sea level. From the abandoned fire tower you can see four states on <span class="date">a clear day</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, and Virginia. The <span class="loc">Allegheny Front</span> is the largest mountain in the county; on the north end it is also known as <span class="loc">Green Mountain</span>. On top of the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> Plateau is located the town of <span class="loc">Elk Garden</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> in the southwestern portion of the county. The Potomac River Valley lies to west and north of the mountain, and the New Creek Valley lies to the east.</p><br><br>
