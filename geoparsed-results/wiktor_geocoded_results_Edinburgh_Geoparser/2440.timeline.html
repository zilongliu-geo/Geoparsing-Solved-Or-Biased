  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Orange County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 372,813. The county seat is <span class="loc">Goshen</span>. This county was first created in <span class="date">1683</span> and reorganized with its present boundaries in <span class="date">1798</span>. <span class="loc">Orange County</span> is included in the New <span class="loc">York-Newark-Jersey City</span>, <span class="loc">NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is in the state's <span class="loc">Mid-Hudson Region</span> of the <span class="loc">Hudson</span> Valley. <span class="loc">The County</span> Executive is <span class="per">Steve Neuhaus</span>. <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was officially established on <span class="date">November 1, 1683</span>, when the Province of <span class="loc">New York</span> was divided into twelve counties. Each of these was named to honor member of the British royal family, and <span class="loc">Orange County</span> took its name from the <span class="per">Prince of Orange</span>, who subsequently became King <span class="per">William III</span> of <span class="loc">England</span>. As originally defined, <span class="loc">Orange County</span> included only the southern part of its present-day territory, plus all of present-day <span class="loc">Rockland County</span> further south. The northern part of the present-day county, beyond <span class="loc">Moodna Creek</span>, was then a part of neighbouring <span class="loc">Ulster County</span>. At that date, the only European inhabitants of the area were a handful of Dutch colonists in present-day <span class="loc">Rockland County</span>, and the area of modern <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was entirely occupied by the native Munsee people. Due to its relatively small population, the original <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was not fully independent and was administered by New <span class="loc">York County</span>.</p><br><br>
