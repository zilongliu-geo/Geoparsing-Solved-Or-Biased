  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Columbus</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Platte County</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> in the Midwestern <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 22,111 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In the 18th century, the area around the confluence of the <span class="loc">Platte</span> and the <span class="loc">Loup Rivers</span> was used by a variety of Native American tribes, including <span class="loc">Pawnee</span>, <span class="loc">Otoe</span>, <span class="loc">Ponca</span>, and <span class="loc">Omaha</span>. The <span class="loc">Pawnee</span> are thought to have descended from the Protohistoric Lower <span class="loc">Loup</span> Culture; the <span class="loc">Otoe</span> had moved from central <span class="loc">Iowa</span> into the lower <span class="loc">Platte</span> Valley in the early 18th century; and the closely related <span class="loc">Omaha</span> and <span class="loc">Ponca</span> had moved from the vicinity of the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> mouth, settling along the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> by the mid-18th century. In <span class="date">1720</span>, <span class="loc">Pawnee</span> and <span class="loc">Otoe</span> allied with the French massacred the Spanish force led by <span class="per">Pedro de Villasur</span> just south of the present site of <span class="loc">Columbus</span>. In the 19th century, the "Great <span class="loc">Platte</span> River Road"—the valley of the <span class="loc">Platte</span> and <span class="loc">North Platte</span> rivers running from Fort Kearny to <span class="loc">Fort Laramie</span>— was the principal route of the westward expansion. For travellers following the north bank of the <span class="loc">Platte</span>, the <span class="loc">Loup River</span>, with its soft banks and quicksands, represented a major obstacle. In the absence of a ferry or a bridge, most of these followed the <span class="loc">Loup</span> for a considerable distance upstream before attempting a crossing: the first major wave of Mormon emigrants, for instance, continued up that river to a point about three miles downstream from present-day <span class="loc">Fullerton</span>.</p><br><br>
