<p><span class="loc">Bir</span> is a village located in the west of <span class="loc">Joginder Nagar</span> Valley in the state of <span class="loc">Himachal Pradesh</span> in northern <span class="loc">India</span>. <span class="loc">Bir</span> is a noted centre for ecotourism, spiritual studies and meditation. <span class="loc">Bir</span> is also home to a Tibetan refugee settlement with several Buddhist monasteries and a large stupa. <span class="loc">Bir</span> was ruled by the Pal dynasty of the Chandarvanshi lineage. The last <span class="loc">Raja</span> or <span class="loc">Rai</span> was Raizada Prithi Pal, who was a descendant of the Rajas of Bhangahal, who appear to have maintained their rights until the time of <span class="loc">Raja</span> Prithi Pal in the early part of the eighteenth century. <span class="loc">Raja</span> Prithi Pal fell victim to his father-in-law, <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="loc">Sidh</span> <span class="loc">Sen</span>, who in 1728 invited him to Mandi on the pretext of seeking his assistance against the <span class="loc">Raja</span> of <span class="loc">Suket</span>. He was kindly received, but within a month of his arrival he was beguiled into the <span class="loc">Damdama</span> Fort, and there murdered. It is said his body was duly burnt, but his head was buried in a tank facing the Mandi <span class="loc">Raja</span>'s palace. A pillar was erected on the spot, and a light was kept burning on it for years. <span class="loc">Sidh</span> <span class="loc">Sen</span>'s object in murdering <span class="loc">Raja</span> Prithi Pal was to seize his territory, but in this he only partially succeeded. The forts at Jagapur, Tika Thana and the Patgana of <span class="loc">Nir</span>, with eighteen villages of Ilaga Chuhar (all of them until then forming part of the Bhangahal kingdom) were annexed to Mandi. Subsequently, <span class="loc">Sidh</span> <span class="loc">Sen</span> sttempted to seize <span class="loc">Karanpur</span>, which also belonged to Bhangahal, but he was repulsed by <span class="loc">Raja</span> Raghunath Pal who had succeeded his father <span class="loc">Raja</span> Prithi Pal. In a second invasion, he penetrated as far as Kotharli Gulu, then in Bhangahal, but Raghunath Pal was able, with the assistance of <span class="loc">Raja</span> Thedi Singh of <span class="loc">Kulu</span>, not only to check his advance, but also to beat him back with considerable loss.</p>
