<p><span class="loc">Yuma</span> (<span class="loc">Cocopah</span>: Yuum) is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Yuma County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located in the southwestern corner of the state, and the population of the city was 93,064 at the 2010 census, up from the 2000 census population of 77,515. <span class="loc">Yuma</span> is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Yuma</span>, <span class="loc">AZ</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of <span class="loc">Yuma County</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the 2014 estimated population of the <span class="loc">Yuma</span> MSA is 203,247, though more than 85,000 retirees make <span class="loc">Yuma</span> their winter residence. The area's first settlers were Native American tribes whose descendants now occupy the <span class="loc">Cocopah</span> and Quechan reservations. In 1540, expeditions under Hernando de Alarcon and Melchior Diaz visited the area and immediately saw the natural crossing of the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> as an ideal spot for a city, as the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> narrows to slightly under 1,000 feet wide in one small point. Later military expeditions that crossed the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> at the <span class="loc">Yuma</span> Crossing include <span class="loc">Juan Bautista</span> de <span class="loc">Anza</span> (1774), the Mormon Battalion (1848) and the California Column (1862).</p>
