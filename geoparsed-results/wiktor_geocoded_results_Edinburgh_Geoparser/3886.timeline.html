  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Linton</span> is a small village in the Scottish Borders area of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is situated a mile north of the village of <span class="loc">Morebattle</span>. People have lived in the area since prehistoric times: on the summit of <span class="loc">Linton Hill</span> there is an Iron Age fort. <span class="per">Linton</span> was a substantial village in the Middle Ages. The Somerville family first appear in the records as being from <span class="per">Linton</span> in <span class="date">1136</span>. There was a tower built by the family close to the church, but it was destroyed by the forces of <span class="per">Henry VIII</span>, during the Rough Wooing, and nothing <span class="date">now</span> remains of it. <span class="per">Linton Church</span> stands on top of a sandy mound, and used to be surrounded by water and marshland. The history of the church dates back to the 12th century, but the current building dates from <span class="date">1911</span> and like its predecessors it has no solid foundations. The porch door has been inset with the "Somervail Stone" showing a knight fighting two beasts which is a link to the story of the Worm of <span class="per">Linton</span>. A local legend concerning the founding of the church states that a young man killed a priest and was condemned to death. His two sisters pleaded for his life, which was granted on condition that they should sift as much sand as would form a mound on which to build a church. The sisters succeeded in the task, the church was built, and the man was freed.</p><br><br>
