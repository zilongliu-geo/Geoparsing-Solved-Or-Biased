<p>Victoria /vɪkˈtɔːriə/ is the capital <span class="loc">city of British Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, and is located on the southern tip of <span class="loc">Vancouver Island</span> off <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s Pacific coast. The city has a population of about 80,017, while the metropolitan area of Greater Victoria, has a population of 344,615, making it the 15th most populous Canadian urban region. Victoria is about 100 kilometres (60 miles) from BC's largest <span class="loc">city of Vancouver</span> on the mainland. The city is about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from Seattle by airplane, ferry, or the Victoria Clipper passenger-only ferry which operates daily, year round between Seattle and Victoria and 40 kilometres (25 miles) from <span class="loc">Port Angeles</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, by ferry Coho across the <span class="loc">Strait of Juan de Fuca</span>. Named after Queen Victoria of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> and, at the time, British <span class="loc">North America</span>, Victoria is one of the oldest cities in the Pacific Northwest, with British settlement beginning in 1843. The city has retained a large number of its historic buildings, in particular its two most famous landmarks, Legislative buildings (finished in 1897 and home of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia) and the Empress hotel (opened in 1908). The city's <span class="loc">Chinatown</span> is the second oldest in <span class="loc">North America</span> after <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>'s. The region's Coast Salish First Nations peoples established communities in the area long before non-native settlement, possibly several thousand years earlier, which had large populations at the time of European exploration. Victoria, like many <span class="loc">Vancouver Island</span> communities, continues to have a sizeable First Nations presence, composed of peoples from all over <span class="loc">Vancouver Island</span> and beyond.</p>
