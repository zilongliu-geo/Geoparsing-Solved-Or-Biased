  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Laurel County</span> clerk honored at Lincoln Dinner. With her stunning red hair flaming, Rebecca Mays cozily sat on her papaw’s lap <span class="date">Saturday night</span>, listening to Kentucky’s top politicos make rousing speeches at the Lincoln Day Dinner. But soon it was her grandfather’s own turn to take to the stage. And when <span class="loc">Laurel County</span> Clerk <span class="per">Dean Johnson</span> was inducted into the 5th District’s Lincoln Club Hall of Fame, he beamed at his smiling granddaughter. <span class="per">Johnson</span> was one of four inductees — and the only <span class="loc">Laurel County</span> resident — welcomed into the prestigious club <span class="date">Saturday</span>. “I feel good about it, naturally,” he said of the honor. <span class="per">Johnson</span> joins fellow inductees state Sen. <span class="per">Tom Jensen</span>, R-London; former commonwealth’s attorney <span class="per">Tom</span> Handy and former <span class="per">senator Gene Huff</span>. But <span class="per">Johnson</span> said he wasn’t sure what clinched the honor for him. “I really don’t know,” he said. “I’ve always tried to help and support the people who run for state and federal offices. I suppose it’s because I’ve tried to be a strong supporter.” <span class="per">Johnson</span> entered the political arena himself in <span class="date">the early 1970s</span> when he ran for sheriff at the age of 31. “I thought there was some room for some younger people,” he said. Though he was defeated by 9 votes, <span class="per">Johnson</span> was immediately hooked to the political game and, soon thereafter, made a bid to fill the county clerk seat. Again, he was narrowly defeated but not discouraged. In <span class="date">1985</span>, he won the clerk’s seat and has occupied it ever since. Through it all, he has been a staunch Republican supporter, voting for Republican presidents and governors ever since he cast his first vote for <span class="per">Richard Nixon</span> in <span class="date">1960</span> at the age of 18. <span class="per">Johnson</span> said he’s admired many Republican presidents in his lifetime, including <span class="per">Dwight Eisenhower</span>. “He was the greatest and the best we ever had,” he said. “I was about 10 and we studied about him. I think he did a lot to bring this nation into the modern era.” Since, <span class="per">Johnson</span> said he has been a fan of <span class="per">Ronald Reagan</span> and “believe it or not, I thought the Bushes did a fine job. ”“You’ve got to understand the conditions they’re serving under,” he said. “I think we have to look at the times before we can be critical of anyone.” Of <span class="date">Saturday</span>’s dinner, <span class="per">Johnson</span> said he enjoyed speeches given by Senate President <span class="per">David Williams</span>, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Rep. Harold “Hal” Rogers and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Sens. <span class="per">Mitch McConnell</span> and <span class="per">Jim Bunning</span>. “I thought the content of them was good,” he said. “They didn’t get into specifics about a contested race that they might have in the primary. I thought they limited their speech to what they were doing and what they want to see done.” In terms of <span class="date">the future</span> of the Republican party, <span class="per">Johnson</span> is optimistic. “I think they have to sit back and wait,” he said. “There will be situations they can take advantage of. I think in <span class="date">two years</span>, there will be a reversal. I think people will want conservative values back.”</p><br><br>
