  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dale, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, is an unincorporated community located in northern <span class="loc">Beaufort County</span> in the southern corner of the state of <span class="loc">South Carolina, U.S.A</span>. It is located approximately five miles <span class="loc">north of Beaufort</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 21, designated the Trask Parkway in that area. The zip code for Dale, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, is 29914. Dale was formerly on the alignment of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad's <span class="loc">Carolina Division</span> low-level main line, constructed from <span class="date">1915</span> and opened <span class="date">December 31, 1917</span>. This rail route passed to the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad with the <span class="date">July 1, 1967</span> merger of the SAL and longtime rival Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, becoming the <span class="loc">Charleston</span> Subdivision, and the line downgraded with most traffic rerouting over the former ACL alignment to the west. The "<span class="loc">East Carolina Subdivision</span>", as it was colloquially called, was abandoned by stages, with the first portion removed north of Dale, between <span class="loc">Lobeco</span> and <span class="loc">Charleston</span>, after <span class="date">October 1, 1967</span>. Following the <span class="date">April 21, 1971</span> destruction of the old SAL lift bridge over the <span class="loc">Savannah River</span> by a ship in foggy conditions, the southern connection into Savannah was cut and the rail line removed between <span class="loc">Coosaw</span> and <span class="loc">Pritchardville</span>, south of Dale, in <span class="date">1978</span>. Most of the remaining line was lifted in <span class="date">1982</span>. Portions of the alignment have been converted into the New River Linear Trail hiking trail.</p><br><br>
