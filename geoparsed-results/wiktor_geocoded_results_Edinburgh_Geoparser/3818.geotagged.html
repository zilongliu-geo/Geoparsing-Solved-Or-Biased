<p><span class="loc">Knox County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 52,919. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Galesburg</span>. <span class="loc">Knox County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Galesburg</span>, <span class="loc">IL</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Knox County</span> was named in honor of Henry Knox, the first <span class="loc">US</span> Secretary of War. The first "<span class="loc">Knox County</span>" in what today is <span class="loc">Illinois</span> was unrelated to the modern incarnation. In 1790, the land of the <span class="loc">Indiana</span> Territory that was to become <span class="loc">Illinois</span> was divided into two counties: St. Clair and Knox. The latter included land in what was to become <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. When <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, was formed from this portion of the county in 1809, the <span class="loc">Illinois</span> portions were subdivided into counties that were given other names. The modern <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, was organized in 1825, from <span class="loc">Fulton County</span>, itself a portion of the original St. <span class="loc">Clair County</span>. Like its neighbor to the south, <span class="loc">Fulton County</span>, for its Spoon River Drive, <span class="loc">Knox County</span> is also known for a similar scenic drive fall festival the first two weekends in October, the <span class="loc">Knox County</span> Drive.</p>
