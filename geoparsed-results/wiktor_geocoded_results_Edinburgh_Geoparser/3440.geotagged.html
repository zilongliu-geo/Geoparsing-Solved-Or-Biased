<p>Sterling is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The population was 7,808 at the 2010 census. Sterling was first settled by Europeans in 1720 and was officially incorporated in 1781. Previous to its incorporation it was "the Second Parish of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>," and was commonly called by a portion of its Indian name, Chocksett. The original Indian name of the area being Woonsechocksett. The land encompassing the <span class="loc">Chocksett region</span> was not originally included in the first land sold by the great Indian Chief Sholan to the settlers of the <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> grant. However, Sholan's nephew <span class="loc">Tahanto</span> would eventually sell the Chocksett land to inhabitants of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> in 1713. The first white settlers arrived in Chocksett seven years later in 1720, formerly inhabitants of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> proper. Among these first settlers were families such as <span class="loc">Beman</span>, <span class="loc">Sawyer</span>, <span class="loc">Houghton</span>, and <span class="loc">Osgood</span>; names reflected to this day in the names of Sterling's oldest roads. A short time after settlement, in 1733, the residents of the Chocksett area requested its own incorporation, separate from <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, due to the "great inconvenience" of a long distance to the church in Lancaster's center. This request was denied. However, by 1780 the population of Chocksett was so numerous as to constitute a majority, and so the voters of the area voted out the existing <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> town officers and began to conduct town business and meetings in Chocksett. This was enough to convince the rest of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> that it was now time for Chocksett, the Second Parish of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, to go its own way.</p>
