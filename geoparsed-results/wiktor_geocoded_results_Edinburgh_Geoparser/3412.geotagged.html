<p>Greenwich (pronounced "Green-witch") was a town in <span class="loc">Hampshire County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. It was established in 1739 as <span class="loc">Quabbin</span>, incorporated as <span class="loc">Quabbin Parish</span> in 1754 and became the town of Greenwich (named for John Campbell, Duke of Greenwich) in 1754. It was located along the East and Middle branches of the <span class="loc">Swift River</span>. The Athol Branch of the <span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">Albany Railroad</span> ran through the center of town, as did Route 21. It was well known for its lakes and ponds, which were popular vacation spots. It bordered four towns - <span class="loc">Enfield</span>, <span class="loc">Prescott</span>, <span class="loc">Dana</span>, and <span class="loc">Hardwick</span>. Greenwich was disincorporated on April 28, 1938 as part of the creation of the <span class="loc">Quabbin</span> Reservoir. Upon disincorporation, portions of the town were annexed to the adjacent towns of <span class="loc">Hardwick</span>, <span class="loc">New Salem</span>, <span class="loc">Petersham</span>, and Ware. (Because of the redrawing of town lines, the land is no longer completely in <span class="loc">Hampshire County</span>; only the portion located in Ware is.) It is now largely submerged, except for the hilltops of Curtis Hill, Mount Liz and <span class="loc">Mount Pomeroy</span>, which are now islands.</p>
