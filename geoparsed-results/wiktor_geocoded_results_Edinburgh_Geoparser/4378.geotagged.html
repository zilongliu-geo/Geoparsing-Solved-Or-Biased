<p><span class="loc">Memphis</span> is a city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Hall County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 2,290. <span class="loc">Memphis</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, the county seat of <span class="loc">Hall County</span>, is at the junction of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 287, State Highway 256, and Farm Road 1547, in the northeastern part of the county. It started in 1889, when J. C. Montgomery purchased land for a townsite north of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> on the <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span> and <span class="loc">Denver City Railway</span>. This land had been previously owned by W. H. Robertson, who had a dugout near <span class="loc">Parker Creek</span>. Montgomery and Robertson, with Rev. J. W. Brice and T. J. Woods, Jr., of Dallas, formed a townsite company and presented a plat early in January 1890. P. M. Kelly opened a law office. A rooming house (later the <span class="loc">Memphis</span> Hotel), a general store, a drugstore, and several residences were soon erected. For a time the new town was without a name. Several suggestions were submitted to federal postal authorities but with negative results. Finally, as the story goes, Reverend Brice, while in Austin, happened to see a letter addressed by accident to <span class="loc">Memphis</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, rather than <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, with the notation "no such town in <span class="loc">Texas</span>." The name was submitted and accepted, and a post office was established on September 12, 1890, with Robertson as postmaster.</p>
