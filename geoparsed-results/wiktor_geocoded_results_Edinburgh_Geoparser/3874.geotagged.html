<p><span class="loc">Covadonga</span> (Asturian: Cuadonga, from Latin: <span class="loc">Cova</span> <span class="loc">Dominica</span>, "Cavern of the Lady", Arabic: صخرة بلاي‎ Ṣakhrat Bilāy ("the rock of the affliction or of the putting to the test")) is a village and one of 11 parishes in Cangas de Onís, a municipality within the province and autonomous community of <span class="loc">Asturias</span>, in northwestern <span class="loc">Spain</span>. It is situated in the <span class="loc">Picos de Europa</span> mountains. In 722 AD, Iberian Christians won a namesake battle over the Muslims in <span class="loc">Covadonga</span>. This was the first Christian victory in the <span class="loc">Iberian Peninsula</span> over the Arabs and Berbers invading from north <span class="loc">Africa</span> under the Umayyad banner, and is often considered to be the start of the 770-year effort to expel Muslim rulers governing the <span class="loc">Iberia</span> during the <span class="loc">Reconquista</span>. Our Lady of <span class="loc">Covadonga</span> is a significant Marian shrine. The Spanish Army has, over the years, named several of its units "Covadonga". In the mountains above the town are located the two lakes of <span class="loc">Covadonga</span>, Enol and Ercina, and the road leading to the lakes is often featured in the <span class="loc">Vuelta</span> a España bicycle race.</p>
