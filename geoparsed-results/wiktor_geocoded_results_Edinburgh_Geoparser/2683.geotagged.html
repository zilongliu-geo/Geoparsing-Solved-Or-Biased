<p><span class="loc">Norwich</span>, known as 'The Rose of <span class="loc">New England</span>', is a city in New <span class="loc">London County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 40,493 at the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. Three rivers, the <span class="loc">Yantic</span>, the <span class="loc">Shetucket</span>, and the <span class="loc">Quinebaug</span>, flow into the city and form its harbor, from which the <span class="loc">Thames River</span> flows south to <span class="loc">Long Island Sound</span>. <span class="loc">Norwichtown</span> was founded in 1659, by settlers from <span class="loc">Old Saybrook</span> led by Major John Mason and Reverend James Fitch. They purchased the land "nine miles square" that would become <span class="loc">Norwich</span> from the local Native Mohegan Sachem Uncas. In 1668, a wharf was established at <span class="loc">Yantic</span> Cove. Settlement was primarily in the three-mile (5-km) area around the Norwichtown Green. The 69 founding families soon divided up the land in the Norwichtown vicinity for farms and businesses. By 1694, the public landing built at the head of the <span class="loc">Thames River</span> allowed ships to offload goods at the harbor; the harbor area is known as the <span class="loc">Chelsea</span> neighborhood. The distance between the port and <span class="loc">Norwichtown</span> was serviced by the East and West Roads, which later became <span class="loc">Washington Street</span> and <span class="loc">Broadway</span>.</p>
