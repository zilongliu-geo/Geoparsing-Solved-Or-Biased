  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Asturias</span> is a third income class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Cebu</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 44,732. In the <span class="date">2013</span> election, it had 27,510 registered voters. It is bounded by <span class="loc">Tuburan</span> in the north; <span class="loc">Balamban</span> in the south, <span class="loc">Danao city</span> in the east and by the Tañon Strait in the west. <span class="loc">Asturias</span> comprises 27 barangays, of which 7 are coastal and 20 are inland: The original name of <span class="loc">Asturias</span> is <span class="loc">Naghalin</span>, perhaps from the word lalin, native Cebuano term for settlers coming from far places. Other authorities say that "Naghalin" is a mispronunciation of the Cebuano word naghaling which means "making fire" as preparation for cooking. This assertion is supported by the old name of an adjacent municipality, "Bagacawa" (<span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Tuburan</span>), which means "fiery cauldron" from the Cebuano baga (ember) and kawa (cauldron). The first occupants of <span class="loc">Asturias</span> came from other places and neighboring islands such as <span class="loc">Negros</span> and <span class="loc">Bohol</span>. At first, one part of <span class="loc">Naghalin</span> was part of <span class="loc">Tuburan</span> and the other part of <span class="loc">Balamban</span>. Over time, the population of <span class="loc">Naghalin</span> increased because of immigration and natural population growth. Eventually the inhabitants petitioned <span class="loc">Spain</span> to grant them their own local government. This petition was granted in the late 19th century by <span class="loc">Spain</span>, thereby creating the pueblo (town) of <span class="loc">Asturias</span>. This event was witnessed by the arrival in <span class="date">1888</span> of the alférez, <span class="per">Antonio Alonso</span>, uncle of <span class="per">José Rizal</span>.</p><br><br>
