  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Finalist Sommers</span> tackles Springfield's finances, future. <span class="per">Megan Gildow</span> brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, Ohio â€” <span class="org">Butler</span> Tech has been able to maintain high student achievement with low per-pupil costs by marketing to make sure seats were filled and eliminating spending that did not improve student achievement, CEO <span class="per">Bob Sommers</span> told <span class="loc">Springfield</span> residents <span class="date">Monday, March 31</span>. <span class="per">Sommers</span> was the first of three finalists for the next city schools' superintendent to spend <span class="date">a day</span> meeting staff, business leaders and the community as the final round of interviews for the position. He has been with <span class="org">Butler Technology and Career Development Schools</span> since <span class="date">2001</span> and by clearly defining and communicating goals, the school has reached new levels of success, he told the audience at <span class="date">Monday</span>'s open forum at <span class="org">Springfield High School</span>. "It's a focused attention to detail," he said. "It's making sure that faculty and staff are given the opportunity to think and make decisions for student achievement." Questions at the forum focused on fiscal accountability as well as how <span class="per">Sommers</span>, who has been superintendent of only <span class="org">Butler</span> Tech, a joint vocational district, would handle new challenges like early childhood and elementary education at <span class="loc">Springfield</span> . <span class="per">Sommers</span> said that he saw two major problems for <span class="loc">Springfield</span>: a need to improve student achievement and regain "marketshare," or students who are going to charter, voucher and open enrollment options. "There is no reason that <span class="loc">Springfield City</span> Schools cannot only regain its marketshare, but also become the premier place where you turn to go to school," he said. <span class="per">Sommers</span> said that he would focus on putting systems in place that allowed staff to make the best decisions to improve student achievement while engaging the community in conversations about what a successful education in <span class="loc">Springfield</span> should look like. "From my perspective, that's a question that the community answers and I deliver," he said.</p><br><br>
