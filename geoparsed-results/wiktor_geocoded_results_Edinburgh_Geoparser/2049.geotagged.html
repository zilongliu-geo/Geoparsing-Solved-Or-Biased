A visitor to <span class="loc">Bandera</span> can see a sign on Main Street, in front of the Fire Department, which states that <span class="loc">Bandera</span> was founded by Roman Catholic immigrants from <span class="loc">Poland</span>. St. Stanislaus Catholic Church was built by those immigrants, and the church is one of the oldest in <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Many of the residents are descended from those original Polish immigrants. There are many stories regarding the origin of the name "Bandera." One says that back in the 19th century, a flag was placed at the top of a path that came to be called <span class="loc">Bandera Pass</span>, due to bandera being the Spanish word for flag.</p>
