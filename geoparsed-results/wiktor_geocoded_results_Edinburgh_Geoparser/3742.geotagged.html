<p><span class="loc">Kingswood</span> is a suburb in <span class="loc">South Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. It is close to the county town of <span class="loc">Tallaght</span>. In the middle of <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> there is a square of buildings, which is not to be confused with The Square, which is near <span class="loc">Tallaght</span> <span class="loc">Town Centre</span>. These are: A quality launderette, an excellent betting shop, a superior fast-food takeaway and Gios Chipper, a majestic salon, an apothacary, a Centra convenience store, a public house with a clock-tower and closeby one community centre. The old community centre now serves as a centre of excellence for hip hop dance, famous speech and drama classes and a Bruce Lee inspired karate dojo ran by one of the worlds few Karate GrandMasters of Kenpo Karate. Next to it, there is the Newer Community Centre. It hosts WeWontPay protests, sport matches (including indoor javelin and Irish Wrestling (IMW)) exercise and health fitness club. It once featured a weekly, now defunct, disco called <span class="loc">Chilin</span>' it at <span class="loc">Killians</span> .The Scout den which won the Irish Architectural Innovation Award in 1989 is found beside the community centre and houses the 158th Castleview Scout Group. The Roman Catholic parish church is shared with Kilnamanagh, but Kingwood holds 70% of the shares, so that's grand.</p>
