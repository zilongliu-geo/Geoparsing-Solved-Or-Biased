  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Francisco</span> is a city located at the far east border of the <span class="loc">province of Córdoba</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, and parts of the city are beyond the border into the province of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>. In the city National Routes 19 and 158 intersect. It is the fourth most populated city in the <span class="loc">province of Córdoba</span>, with about 59,000 inhabitants, and the head city of the <span class="org">San Justo Department</span>. <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> is located on <span class="loc">Cordoba</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>'s provincial borders. The city is also located in a geographic depression. Frequently during the heavy <span class="date">summer</span> rains the entire city floods with up to two feet of water that covers the city's streets. The city is centered on Plaza <span class="loc">San Martin</span> which is a large brick plaza used for a variety of demonstrations and festivals. Most of the city streets are laid cobble stone that have been polished black from traffic. The town was founded on <span class="date">9 September 1886</span> by José <span class="per">Bernardo Iturraspe</span>, as part of a colonization plan of the provincial government. The current location of the city is slightly south of the original settlement and dates from <span class="date">1888</span>. Around that same time railroads of the Córdoba Central Railway reached the area. The settlement was officially declared a city in <span class="date">1915</span>. A large portion of the city's population is made up of immigrants and World War I and II refugees from <span class="loc">Europe</span>, a large concentration of them being from the region of <span class="loc">Piedmont</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>.</p><br><br>
