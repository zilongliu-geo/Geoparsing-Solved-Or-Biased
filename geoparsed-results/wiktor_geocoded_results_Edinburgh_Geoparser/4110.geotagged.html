<p><span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is a county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 15,279. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Floyd</span>. <span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is included in the Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford, <span class="loc">VA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Floyd County</span>'s recorded history begins with the arrival of traders, trappers and hunters in Southwest Virginia in the 18th century. The earliest known travel way through present day <span class="loc">Floyd County</span> was the Trader's Path, running from east to west across the <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> River where <span class="loc">Back Creek</span> enters the river, by John Mason's, R. Poage's, the headwaters of <span class="loc">Back Creek</span> and southwest over <span class="loc">Bent Mountain</span>. The trail continued westward through the <span class="loc">Little River</span> area to the Lead Mines. The first known attempts to settle the area appear to have been made during the 1740s. In 1745 the Virginia Council granted James Patton, of <span class="loc">Augusta County</span>, among others, 100,000 acres (400 km2) on the <span class="loc">New River</span> and the westward flowing waters, including the <span class="loc">Little River</span> area. In 1749 the Royal Company of Virginia also received a grant on the westward flowing waters, putting the two companies in competition with one another to settle the area. The first surveying of the land occurred in the late 1740s.</p>
