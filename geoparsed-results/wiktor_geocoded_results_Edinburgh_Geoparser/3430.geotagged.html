<p>Austin is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Tunica County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. Once a thriving shipping port on the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River, Austin served as county seat from 1847 to 1888. Earlier county seats were Commerce and Peyton. Austin was founded in 1847 and named for Austin Miller, who donation land on which the town and a courthouse were built. Austin was burned in 1863 by Union soldiers of the Mississippi Marine Brigade under the command of Alfred W. Ellet. Two houses were spared. The town rebuilt and was incorporated in 1871, though it is no longer incorporated. In 1884, the area was flooded when a nearby levee broke. When waters receded, a large sandbar had been left between the town and the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River, and steamboats could no longer land. The completion of the <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> and <span class="loc">Texas Railway</span> 3 mi (4.8 km) east of Austin in the late 1880s further contributed to its isolation. In 1888, the county seat was moved to Tunica, a more accessible location. The construction of the <span class="loc">Hardin Cutoff</span> in 1942, which created <span class="loc">Tunica Lake</span>, moved the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River an additional 7 mi (11 km) west of Austin.</p>
