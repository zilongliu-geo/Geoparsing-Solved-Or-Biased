<p>Franklin is a city in <span class="loc">Merrimack County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the 2010 census, the population was 8,477, the lowest of any of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>'s 13 cities. Franklin includes the village of <span class="loc">West Franklin</span>. Situated at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers that form the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span>, the town was settled by Anglo-European colonists in 1764 and originally known as <span class="loc">Pemigewasset</span> Village. It was taken from portions of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="loc">Andover</span>, <span class="loc">Sanbornton</span> and <span class="loc">Northfield</span>. The name Franklin was adopted in 1820 in honor of statesman and founding father Benjamin Franklin. Water power from the falls helped it develop as a mill town. It would incorporate as a town in 1828, and then as a city in 1895. Daniel Webster was born in a section of Franklin that was then part of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>. There is a state historic site located off Route 127 that preserves the famous orator's childhood home. As an adult, Webster owned "The Elms", a farm near the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span> along present-day Route 3. In 1943, the Army Corps of Engineers created the Franklin Falls Reservoir above Franklin by constructing the Franklin Falls Dam for flood control on the <span class="loc">Pemigewasset River</span>.</p>
