<p><span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is a suburban city located mostly in <span class="loc">Tarrant county</span>, with small parts in Ellis, Johnson and Dallas counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. It is a suburb of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex area. Its location is almost equidistant to Dallas, <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span> and DFW Airport. As of the 2010 census, the population was 56,368. The population of <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is estimated to grow to 59,831 in 2012 and projected to reach 70,019 in 2017. CNN/Money Magazine ranked <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> at #17 in 2014 in its annual "Best Places To Live" list. <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> has been in that list in the recent past: in 2007, 2009, and 2012, ranking it 83rd, 24th, and 30th, respectively. The first wave of European settlers arrived in the rolling <span class="loc">Cross Timbers</span> country of north central <span class="loc">Texas</span> in the 1840s. Primarily of Scotch-Irish origins, these pioneer farmers came for the most part from southern states, following the frontier as it shifted west of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. They entered an area where Native Americans had been living for thousands of years. The <span class="loc">Comanche</span> posed a serious threat to the settlers, and in 1849, the U.S. Army established <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span> to protect the farms along the sparsely populated frontier.</p>
