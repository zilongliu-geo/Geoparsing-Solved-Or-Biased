<p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> (county code MG) is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. As of the 2010 census, the county population was 35,471. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Independence, and its most populous city is <span class="loc">Coffeyville</span>. The <span class="loc">Coffeyville</span>, <span class="loc">KS</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> was established February 26, 1867. It was named in honor of Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture <span class="loc">Quebec City</span>, in <span class="loc">Canada</span>, after successfully capturing two forts and the <span class="loc">city of Montreal</span>. When <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was admitted to the Union as a state in 1861, the Osage Indian reservation occupied a large tract of land near the southern border. The reservation had been established in 1825. After the Civil War ended, the Osage lands were coveted as the largest and last reserve of good land in the eastern part of the state. As early as 1866, the Osages were forced to cede tracts at the eastern and northern edges of the reservation. This treaty conceded white settlement on land in the eastern part of what is now <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>.</p>
