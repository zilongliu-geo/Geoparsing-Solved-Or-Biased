  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Bluff or The Bluff is a geographical area, containing seven suburbs, in <span class="loc">Durban</span>, eThekwini metropolitan municipality, <span class="loc">KwaZulu-Natal Province</span>, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. Within the area referred to as "The Bluff" lie the suburbs of <span class="loc">Brighton Beach</span>, <span class="loc">Grosvenor</span>, <span class="loc">King's Rest</span>, <span class="loc">Ocean View</span>, <span class="loc">Fynnland</span>, Treasure Beach and <span class="loc">Wentworth</span>. The name of the area is derived from the long bluff - two ancient sand dunes on which most of the suburbs lie. The Bluff is one of the main enclosing elements of <span class="loc">Durban Harbour</span> from the <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span>, and forms the southern quayside of the Port of <span class="loc">Durban</span>. The promonotory on which Bluff is situated is Durban's most prominent natural landmark. Accordingly, it probably served as an important visual reference for navigational approaches to <span class="loc">Durban Harbour</span>. Between <span class="date">1907</span> and <span class="date">1975</span>, the exposed south-east side of The Bluff housed a whaling station. Since the mid-Nineteenth Century, the region has been purposed for navigational and military uses. This use has provided protection for much of the area's native vegetation. <span class="date">Today</span>, the area is considered important in the ecological management of <span class="loc">Durban</span> and environs.</p><br><br>
