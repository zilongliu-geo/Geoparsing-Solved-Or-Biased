  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span> (simplified Chinese: 钟祥; traditional Chinese: 鐘祥; pinyin: Zhōngxiáng) is a county-level <span class="loc">city of Jingmen</span>, central <span class="loc">Hubei province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. The name <span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span> means "Blessed with propitious omen", and was given to the city by the <span class="per">Jiajing Emperor</span> in the Ming dynasty. <span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span> is a well-known historical and cultural city in <span class="loc">China</span>. <span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span> is one of the cradles of Chu culture. It was the alternate capital of the Chu state in the Spring and <span class="date">Autumn</span> period and the Warring States period. Because the <span class="per">Jiajing Emperor</span> (r. <span class="date">1521</span>–<span class="date">1567</span>) of the Ming dynasty was born and had lived in the city before he succeeded to the throne, <span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span>, the place where the Chengtian Prefecture (fu) Government Office was located, became one of the three major prefectures directly under the central government. Once on the throne, the <span class="per">Jiajing Emperor</span> controversially had his dead father Zhu Youyuan (<span class="date">1476</span>–<span class="date">1519</span>) retroactively styled as the <span class="per">Gongruixian Emperor</span>; his mother became the Zhangsheng empress dowager. They were buried at a sumptuous mausoleum, knowns as the Xianling Tomb, a few kilometers northeast of <span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span>.</p><br><br>
