  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Stanton is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Powell County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,733 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Stanton is the birthplace of <span class="org">Hall of Fame</span> thoroughbred horse trainer <span class="per">Woody Stephens</span>. The first post office to be located in present-day <span class="loc">Stanton</span> was established on <span class="date">July 7, 1849</span> and was named Beaver Pond, because of the settlement's proximity to a small body of water resulting from a beaver dam. In <span class="date">1852</span>, both the post office and the settlement were renamed Stanton for <span class="per">Richard H. Stanton</span>, who served in Congress from <span class="date">1849</span>–<span class="date">1855</span> and later as a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> senator.
