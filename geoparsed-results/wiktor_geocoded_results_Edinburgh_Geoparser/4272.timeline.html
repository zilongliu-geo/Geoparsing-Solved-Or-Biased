  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Minot</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Androscoggin County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,607 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town includes the villages of <span class="loc">West Minot</span> and <span class="loc">Minot</span> Center. It is part of both the Lewiston-Auburn, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> statistical area and the Lewiston-Auburn, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> <span class="loc">New England</span> city and town area. Present-day <span class="loc">Minot</span> was part of Bakerstown Plantation, granted in <span class="date">1765</span> by the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> to Captain <span class="per">Thomas Baker</span> and his company of soldiers for their services to the state at the <span class="date">1690</span> Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. It replaced a <span class="date">1736</span> grant at what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, ruled invalid in <span class="date">1741</span> because of a prior claim from the descendants of <span class="per">John Mason</span>. In <span class="date">1795</span>, Bakerstown Plantation was incorporated as <span class="loc">Poland</span>, named after Chief <span class="per">Poland</span>, a noted local Indian sachem. On <span class="date">February 18, 1802</span>, the northeastern part of <span class="loc">Poland</span> was set off as <span class="loc">Minot</span>, named after <span class="per">George Richards</span> <span class="loc">Minot</span> (judge) (<span class="date">1758</span>â€“<span class="date">1802</span>), historian and judge of the General Court who had aided in the town's incorporation. The first settler was <span class="per">Moses Emery</span> from <span class="loc">Newbury</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in <span class="date">1772</span>. At that time there were several Indians of the Anasagunticook tribe living in the immediate area. The surface of the town is uneven, in some parts hilly, but with good soil for agriculture, the principal early occupation. Mills were erected at various water power sites, and products included lumber, clapboards, shingles, boxes, shooks and barrel staves. There was also manufacturing in leather, particularly boots, shoes, saddles and harnesses. In <span class="date">1842</span>, land was set off to form Auburn, to which more land was ceded in <span class="date">1873</span>. <span class="loc">Mechanic Falls</span>, the industrial village astride the border with <span class="loc">Poland</span>, was set off in <span class="date">1893</span>. The population in <span class="date">1859</span> was 1,734. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Minot</span> is gradually transitioning into a bedroom community of the <span class="loc">cities of Auburn and Lewiston</span>.</p><br><br>
