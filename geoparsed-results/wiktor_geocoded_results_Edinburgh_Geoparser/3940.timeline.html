  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kanal</span> (pronounced [kaˈnaːl] or [kaˈnaːu̯]; Italian: <span class="loc">Canale</span>, German: Kanalburg), frequently referred to as Kanal ob Soči ("Kanal on the Soča"; pronounced [kaˈnaːl ɔp ˈsoːtʃi] or [kaˈnaːu̯ ɔp ˈsoːtʃi]; Italian: <span class="loc">Canale d'Isonzo</span>), is a settlement mostly on the left bank of the Soča River in the Slovene Littoral, the traditional region in southwestern <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. It is an important crossing point over the Soča. At its eastern border, on the left bank of the Soča, runs the Bohinj Railway, the railway track linking the <span class="loc">Central Europe</span> and the Mediterranean. The name <span class="loc">Kanal</span> comes from the shape of the valley. The parish church of <span class="loc">Kanal</span> is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary and belongs to the <span class="loc">Diocese of Koper</span>. The current church was built in the Gothic style in the 1430s on the site of a 13th-century predecessor. The still preserved Gothic element is the chancel, whereas the nave was redesigned from <span class="date">1632</span> until <span class="date">1670</span> in the Baroque style and the facade was redesigned from <span class="date">1787</span> until <span class="date">1795</span> in the Neoclassical style. The original bell tower was built in <span class="date">1632</span>, but demolished in World War I and later rebuilt in the Renaissance Revival style. The left (northern) side chapel, dedicated to <span class="loc">Saint Anthony</span> of <span class="loc">Padua</span>, was consecrated in <span class="date">1662</span>, whereas the right (southern) side chapel, dedicated to <span class="org">the Mother of God</span>, was built in <span class="date">1698</span>.</p><br><br>
