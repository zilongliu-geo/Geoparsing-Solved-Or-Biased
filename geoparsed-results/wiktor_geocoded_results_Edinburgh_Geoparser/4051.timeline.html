  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 23,068. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Monroeville</span>. Its name is in honor of <span class="per">James Monroe</span>, fifth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a dry county, in which the sale of alcoholic beverages is restricted or prohibited, but <span class="loc">Frisco City</span> and <span class="loc">Monroeville</span> are wet cities. For <span class="date">thousands of years</span> the area was inhabited by indigenous peoples. In historic times, it was primarily the territory of the Creek peoples, who became known to European-American settlers as one of the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was established by European Americans on <span class="date">June 29, 1815</span>. It is known as the county older than the state. Most of the original European-American settlers were of English descent and came from the states of Virginia, <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and the <span class="loc">Carolinas</span>. The prominent <span class="loc">Upper Creek</span> chief, <span class="loc">Red Eagle</span> (also known as <span class="per">William Weatherford</span>) of the prominent Wind Clan, settled here after the Creek War (<span class="date">1813</span>-<span class="date">1814</span>), where he established a successful plantation. He was of Creek and European descent, and had adopted chattel slavery as a planter and horse breeder. Most of the Creek people were removed from <span class="loc">Alabama</span> to Indian Territory (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>) in the 1830s. The area was settled by European Americans, who brought slave workers with them, or purchased more after acquiring land.</p><br><br>
