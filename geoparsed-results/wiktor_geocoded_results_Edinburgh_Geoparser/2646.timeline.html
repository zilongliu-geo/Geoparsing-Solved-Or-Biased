  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Douglas</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cochise County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="per">Douglas</span> has a border crossing with <span class="loc">Mexico</span> and a history of mining. The population was 17,378 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The <span class="per">Douglas</span> area was first settled by the Spanish in the 18th century. Presidio de <span class="loc">San Bernardino</span> was established in <span class="date">1776</span> and abandoned in <span class="date">1780</span>. It was located a few miles east of present-day <span class="per">Douglas</span>. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Army established Camp <span class="loc">San Bernardino</span> in the latter half of the 19th century near the presidio, and in <span class="date">1910</span> <span class="loc">Camp Douglas</span> was built next to the town. <span class="per">Douglas</span> was founded as an American smelter town, to treat the copper ores of nearby <span class="loc">Bisbee</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. The town is named after mining pioneer Dr. <span class="per">James Douglas</span> and was incorporated in <span class="date">1905</span>. Two copper smelters operated at the site. The <span class="loc">Calumet</span> and <span class="org">Arizona Company Smelter</span> was built in <span class="date">1902</span>. The <span class="loc">Copper Queen</span> operated in <span class="per">Douglas</span> from <span class="date">1904</span> until <span class="date">1931</span>, when the Phelps Dodge Corporation purchased the <span class="loc">Calumet</span> and <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Company and took over their smelter. The <span class="loc">Calumet</span> and <span class="loc">Arizona</span> smelter then became the <span class="per">Douglas</span> Reduction Works. <span class="per">Douglas</span> was the site of the Phelps-Dodge Corporation <span class="per">Douglas</span> Reduction Works until its closure in <span class="date">1987</span>. The smoke stacks of the smelter were not taken down until <span class="date">January 13, 1991</span>. The town was a site of the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Copper Mine Strike of <span class="date">1983</span>.</p><br><br>
