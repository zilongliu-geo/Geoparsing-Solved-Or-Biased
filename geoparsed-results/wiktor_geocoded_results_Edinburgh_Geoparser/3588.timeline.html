It is the smaller of the two principal cities of the <span class="loc">Elkhart-Goshen Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which in turn is part of the South Bend-Elkhart-Mishawaka Combined Statistical Area. It is located in the northern part of <span class="loc">Indiana</span> near the <span class="loc">Michigan</span> border, in a region known as <span class="loc">Michiana</span>. <span class="loc">Goshen</span> is located 10 miles southeast of <span class="loc">Elkhart</span>, 25 miles southeast of <span class="loc">South Bend</span>, 120 miles east of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, and 150 miles north of <span class="loc">Indianapolis</span>.

The city is known as a center of manufacturing for recreational vehicles and accessories, the home of <span class="org">Goshen College</span>, a small Mennonite liberal arts college, and home to the <span class="loc">Elkhart County</span> 4-H Fair, one of the largest county fairs in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Goshen</span> was platted in <span class="date">1831</span>. It was named after the Land of <span class="loc">Goshen</span>.

The New <span class="loc">England</span> Yankee population that founded towns such as <span class="loc">Goshen</span> considered themselves the "chosen people" and identified with the Israelites of the Old Testament and they thought of <span class="loc">North America</span> as their <span class="loc">Canaan</span>. They founded a large number of towns and counties across what is known as the Northern Tier of the upper midwest. It was in this context that <span class="loc">Goshen</span> was named.</p><br><br>
