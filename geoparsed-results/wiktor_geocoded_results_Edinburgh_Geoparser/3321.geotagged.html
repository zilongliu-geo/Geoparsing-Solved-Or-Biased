<p>Paradise is a city in <span class="loc">Russell County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 49. In 1859, a hunting party explored the area, including a small tributary of the Saline River which led them to a site abundant in water, timber, and bison. One of the hunters, James R. Mead, described the site as paradise, and the tributary subsequently became known as <span class="loc">Paradise Creek</span>. The first post office in the area opened under the name Paradise in 1875. In 1887, the Union Townsite Company established a town on the north side of the creek northwest of the post office, naming it <span class="loc">Ivamar</span> after Iva Marr, the daughter of a local rancher. The Paradise post office relocated to <span class="loc">Ivamar</span> the next year, but kept its name. As a result, the town came to be known by both names; in 1891, the Union Pacific Railroad listed its rail stop there as Paradise with <span class="loc">Ivamar</span> in parentheses. The community grew through the 1890s to include a school, downtown businesses, and railroad facilities, reaching a population of 200 by 1910. <span class="loc">Ivamar</span> incorporated in 1924 and finally changed its name to Paradise. The population of the community has gradually declined since the 1930s.</p>
