  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lismore</span> is a town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, located on the Hamilton Highway 170 kilometres (106 mi) west of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. It is part of the Corangamite Shire local government area. The town is located at a point equidistant from <span class="loc">Geelong</span> and <span class="loc">Warrnambool</span>. At the <span class="date">2006</span> census, <span class="loc">Lismore</span> had a population of 513. At the <span class="date">2001</span> census, <span class="loc">Lismore</span> had a population of 262. The town which is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Lismore</span> was first settled by Europeans when a <span class="per">John Brown</span> was forced to stop to repair a wagon axle. It broke while he forded the creek <span class="date">now</span> named Brown's Waterholes. <span class="loc">Lismore</span> was surveyed and named in the 1850s. The settlement at that time was a rough grog shanty called the White <span class="loc">Swan Hotel</span> and a few houses near the crossing of Brown's <span class="loc">Water Holes</span>. <span class="org">Lismore Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">1 December 1864</span>. <span class="loc">Lismore</span> grew through the <span class="date">years</span> to become a prosperous service town for the surrounding fine wool producing properties. Its peak of population was probably in <span class="date">the 1950s</span> when many of the large properties of the area were divided up to make farms for returned soldiers. Since <span class="date">the late sixties</span>, <span class="loc">Lismore</span> has slowly become more of a retirement town, though it still has a good primary school and other facilities for younger residents. For its size, the town has a remarkable array of services and recreation and leisure activities.</p><br><br>
