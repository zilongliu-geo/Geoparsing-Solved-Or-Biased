  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Woodville</span> is a town in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Wilkinson County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. The population was 1,096 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The Woodville Republican, a weekly newspaper founded in <span class="date">1823</span>, is the oldest surviving business (and thus the oldest newspaper) in <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. This historic town, one of the oldest European-American towns in <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, is set among the rolling hills and pastures of <span class="loc">Wilkinson County</span>, just north of the Louisiana-Mississippi border in the southwest corner of the state. It was incorporated in <span class="date">1811</span>, after the <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> Purchase of <span class="date">1803</span> and not long before <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>’s admission to the <span class="loc">United States</span> in <span class="date">1817</span>. It was developed along the historic corridor between St. <span class="loc">Francisville</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, 24 miles to the south and <span class="loc">Natchez</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, 34 miles to the north. Since pre-colonial times, communities within this corridor have been linked, first by the Lower <span class="loc">Natchez</span> Trace, a footpath and portage developed by Native Americans and serving the east bank of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. In the 20th century, <span class="loc">U. S</span>. Highway 61, the “Blues Highway,” was later built along this route; it is considered the spine of jazz and blues, <span class="loc">America</span>’s music.</p><br><br>
