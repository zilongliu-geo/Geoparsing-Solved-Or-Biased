  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Potosi</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Grant County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 688 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The village is in the Town of <span class="loc">Potosi</span>. <span class="loc">Potosi</span> is located where <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>'s lead ore belt intersects with the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. The post office (<span class="date">1837</span> to <span class="date">present</span>) was originally located between <span class="loc">Van Buren</span> and <span class="org">Head of the Hollow</span>, then at <span class="loc">Van Buren</span>, then at <span class="loc">La Fayette</span>. In <span class="date">1839</span>, the leaders of three settlements (Snake Hollow, sometimes called <span class="org">Head of the Hollow</span>, <span class="loc">Van Buren</span>, and <span class="loc">La Fayette</span>) decided to combine the villages. The new, larger community was named <span class="loc">Potosi</span>, and the post office moved one last time, to the center of the new, merged community. There are several explanations for the origin of the name <span class="loc">Potosi</span>, but the correct one is unknown. Many mining towns are named <span class="loc">Potosi</span>, ultimately derived from the fabled silver mines of Potos√≠, <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>. Another explanation is that <span class="loc">Potosi</span> was named for <span class="loc">Potosi</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, where a lot of the early lead miners originated. Another explanation is that <span class="loc">Potosi</span> is a corruption of "Potosa," the supposed name of the wife of <span class="per">Julien Dubuque</span>, an early settler in the area. No evidence exists for this theory.</p><br><br>
