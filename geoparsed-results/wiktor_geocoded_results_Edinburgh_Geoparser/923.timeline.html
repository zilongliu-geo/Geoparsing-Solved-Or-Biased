  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Albany</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Ocean View</span>) is a city in <span class="loc">Alameda County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 18,539 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In <span class="date">1908</span>, a group of local women protested the dumping of <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> garbage in their community. Armed with two shotguns and a twenty-two-caliber rifle, they confronted the drivers of the wagons near what is <span class="date">now</span> the corner of San Pablo <span class="per">Avenue</span> and <span class="per">Buchanan</span> Street. The women told the drivers of the horse-drawn garbage wagons to go home, which they did quickly and without complaint. Shortly thereafter, the residents of the town voted to incorporate as the City of <span class="loc">Ocean View</span>. In <span class="date">1909</span>, voters changed the name of the city, primarily to distinguish the city from the adjacent section of <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> which had previously been named <span class="loc">Ocean View</span>. On a vote of 38 to 6 the city was renamed in honor of <span class="loc">Albany</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, the birthplace of the city's first mayor, <span class="per">Frank Roberts</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.5 square miles (14 km2), of which 1.8 square miles (4.7 km2) is land and 3.7 square miles (9.6 km2) (67.28%) is water.</p><br><br>
