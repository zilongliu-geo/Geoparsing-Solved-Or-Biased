  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tabuk</span> is a city and the capital of the <span class="loc">province of Kalinga</span> in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 103,912 people. It borders with the town of <span class="loc">Pinukpuk</span> in the north and the town of <span class="loc">Rizal</span> in the north-east. On its westernmost section it shares border with the towns of <span class="loc">Pasil</span> and <span class="loc">Lubuagan</span>. On the south-west it borders with the town of <span class="loc">Tanudan</span>. <span class="loc">Tabuk City</span> is a border <span class="loc">city of Kalinga</span> with the <span class="loc">provinces of Isabela</span> and <span class="loc">Mountain Province</span>. In the east, it is bordered by the town of <span class="per">Quezon, Isabela</span>, which is about 20 kilometers from the city center and the town of <span class="loc">Paracelis</span>, <span class="loc">Mountain Province</span>, to the south. The former municipal <span class="loc">district of Tabuk</span> was transformed into a regular municipality by Republic Act No. 533, approved <span class="date">June 16, 1950</span>. During the 11th Congress (<span class="date">1998</span>–<span class="date">2001</span>), Congress enacted into law 33 bills converting 33 municipalities into cities. However, Congress did not act on a further 24 bills converting 24 other municipalities into cities. During the 12th Congress (<span class="date">2001</span>–<span class="date">2004</span>), Congress enacted into law Republic Act No. 9009 (RA 9009), which took effect on <span class="date">30 June 2001</span>. RA 9009 amended Section 450 of the Local Government Code by increasing the annual income requirement for conversion of a municipality into a city from ₱20 million to ₱100 million. The rationale for the amendment was to restrain, in the words of Senator <span class="per">Aquilino Pimentel</span>, "the mad rush" of municipalities to convert into cities solely to secure a larger share in the Internal Revenue Allotment despite the fact that they are incapable of fiscal independence.</p><br><br>
