  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Livermore</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> is an abandoned town that was located on the <span class="loc">Conemaugh River</span> between <span class="loc">Blairsville</span> and <span class="loc">Saltsburg</span> in <span class="loc">Derry Township</span>, <span class="loc">Westmoreland County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. The town was abandoned and partially razed in <span class="date">the early 1950s</span> following authorization by the Flood Control Act of <span class="date">1936</span> and Flood Control Act of <span class="date">1938</span> for construction of the <span class="loc">Conemaugh River</span> Dam and Lake to prevent flooding of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. Much of the former town site <span class="date">now</span> lies under the reservoir and floodplains. The town was established along the <span class="loc">Conemaugh River</span> within <span class="loc">Derry Township</span> in <span class="date">1827</span> by <span class="per">John Livermore</span>, naming the town after himself. The <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> legislature had established the <span class="org">Board of Canal Commissioners for the Commonwealth</span> in <span class="date">1825</span>, and authorized a public canal and railroad project across the state, the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Canal system. The Main Line Canal's Western Division, which stretched 103 miles from <span class="loc">Johnstown</span> to <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, was constructed past <span class="loc">Livermore</span> along the <span class="loc">Conemaugh</span>. The <span class="loc">West Penn Railroad</span> extended past <span class="loc">Livermore</span> alongside the canal in <span class="date">1854</span>, and a station was built in <span class="date">1864</span>, providing connections to <span class="loc">Blairsville</span> and <span class="loc">Saltsburg</span>. Grading from <span class="loc">Blairsville</span> to the <span class="loc">Allegheny River</span> was completed in <span class="date">1857</span>, and the same year, the state sold the canal to the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Railroad. Another grade was built in <span class="date">1882</span> to bypass a hill. These tracks were used for <span class="date">25 years</span> until <span class="date">1907</span>, when a new straight line bypassed the canal curves. A new station was also built.</p><br><br>
