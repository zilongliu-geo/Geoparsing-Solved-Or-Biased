<p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Florida</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 49,746. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Marianna. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> was created by the Florida Territorial Council in 1822 out of <span class="loc">Escambia County</span>, along with <span class="loc">Duval County</span> out of St. <span class="loc">Johns County</span>, making them the third and fourth counties in the Territory. The county was named for Andrew Jackson, who had served as Florida's first military governor for six months in 1821. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> originally extended from the <span class="loc">Choctawhatchee River</span> on the west to the <span class="loc">Suwannee River</span> on the east. The county had been reduced close to its present boundaries by 1840 through the creation of new counties from its original territory. Minor adjustments to the county boundaries continued through most of the 19th century, however. There were no towns in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> when it was formed. The first county court met at what was called "Robinson's Big Spring" (later called Blue Springs) in 1822 and then at the "Big Spring of the Choctawhatchee" in 1823. The following year the county court met at "<span class="loc">Chipola</span> Settlement" which is also known as Waddell's <span class="loc">Mill Pond</span>.</p>
