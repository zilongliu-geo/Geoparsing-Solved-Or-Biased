  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wilton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,116 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Situated beside <span class="loc">Wilson</span> Pond, the former mill town is <span class="date">today</span> primarily a recreation area. The land replaced an invalidated <span class="date">1727</span> grant by <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> to veterans for service in the French and Indian Wars. The first grant (<span class="date">now</span> part of <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>) was originally dubbed Harrytown after a particularly dangerous Native American, then renamed <span class="loc">Tyngstown</span> for <span class="per">Captain William Tyng</span>, leader of the expedition of "snowshoe men" that killed him in <span class="date">1703</span>. <span class="per">Abraham Butterfield</span>, a settler from <span class="loc">Wilton</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, paid the cost of incorporation in <span class="date">1803</span> to have the new town named after his former residence. <span class="loc">Wilton</span> is known for being the location of <span class="loc">Maine</span>'s first cotton mill, started in <span class="date">1810</span> by <span class="per">Solomon Adams</span>. In <span class="date">1876</span>, <span class="per">George Henry Bass</span> (<span class="date">1855</span>â€“<span class="date">1925</span>) founded <span class="org">G.H. Bass &amp; Co.</span> and became the best-known businessman in <span class="loc">Wilton</span>'s history. Bass shoes (including those worn by <span class="per">Charles Lindbergh</span> during his Atlantic crossing and Admiral Byrd in his expeditions to <span class="loc">Antarctica</span>) were made exclusively in <span class="loc">Wilton</span> for more than <span class="date">a century</span> until <span class="date">1998</span>. By then the Bass family had sold out, and in <span class="date">1998</span> Bass' parent company, Phillips-Van Heusen, moved operations overseas.</p><br><br>
