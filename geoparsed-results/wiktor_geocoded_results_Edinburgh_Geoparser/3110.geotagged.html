<p><span class="loc">Rabat</span> (Arabic: ar-Ribaaṭ الرباط‎; <span class="loc">Berber</span>: ⵕⵕⴱⴰⵟ Ṛṛbaṭ) is the capital of <span class="loc">Morocco</span> and its seventh largest city center with an urban population of approximately 580,000 (2014) and a metropolitan population of over 1.2 million. It is also the capital of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region. The city is located on the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg. On the facing shore of the river lies Salé, the city's main commuter town. <span class="loc">Rabat</span>, <span class="loc">Temara</span>, and Salé form a conurbation of over 1.8 million people. Silt-related problems have diminished Rabat's role as a port; however, <span class="loc">Rabat</span> and Salé still maintain important textile, food processing and construction industries. In addition, tourism and the presence of all foreign embassies in <span class="loc">Morocco</span> serve to make <span class="loc">Rabat</span> one of the most important cities in the country. Once a reputed corsair haven, <span class="loc">Rabat</span> served as one of the many ports in <span class="loc">North Africa</span> for the Barbary pirates, who were particularly active from the 16th through the 18th centuries. <span class="loc">Rabat</span> is accessible by train through the ONCF system and by plane through the nearby Rabat–Salé Airport.</p>
