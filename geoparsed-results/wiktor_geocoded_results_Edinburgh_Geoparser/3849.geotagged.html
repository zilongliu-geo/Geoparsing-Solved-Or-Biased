<p>Colton is a ghost town located in <span class="loc">Utah County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, about 6 miles (9.7 km) south of <span class="loc">Soldier Summit</span>. Formerly a busy railroad junction on the <span class="loc">Denver</span> and <span class="loc">Rio</span> Grande Western Railroad, Colton is a landmark on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 6 through Spanish Fork Canyon between the <span class="loc">cities of Spanish Fork and Price</span>. The site was first settled in 1883 under the name of Pleasant Valley Junction, where the Pleasant Valley Railroad connected the mining town of Winter Quarters, 20 miles (32 km) to the south, to the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> line. This line was soon abandoned, replaced by a <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> branch along a much easier grade between Pleasant Valley Junction and <span class="loc">Scofield</span>. Pleasant Valley Junction quickly grew to include a store, hotel, and five saloons. In addition to the railroad, the mining and milling of ozokerite was important in the local economy. Sometime just before 1898 the town was renamed Colton in honor of railroad official William F. Colton. Two years later in 1900 the Scofield mine disaster dealt the entire area a serious blow, but Colton survived.</p>
