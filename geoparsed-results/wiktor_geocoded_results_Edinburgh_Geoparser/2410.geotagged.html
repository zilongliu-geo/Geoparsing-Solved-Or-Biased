<p>Jefferson is a city in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Salem Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 3,098 at the 2010 census. It is home to the annual Mint Harvest Festival and is the self-proclaimed "Mint Capital of the World" as well as "Frog Jumping Capital of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>." The first name for this locality was Conser's Ferry, for Jacob S. Conser, an <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trail pioneer of 1848 who ran a ferry across the <span class="loc">Santiam River</span>. Conser was also involved in the communities of <span class="loc">Syracuse</span> and <span class="loc">Santiam City</span>, which was about 2 miles (3 km) downstream of Jefferson. He established the ferry in 1851, and also served as the postmaster of <span class="loc">Santiam City</span>. When the Jefferson Institute was established in the vicinity (not the same as the Jefferson Institute in <span class="loc">Polk County</span>), the name Jefferson was eventually adopted by the community. Jefferson post office was established in 1861, with a name change from <span class="loc">Syracuse</span>, and previously, <span class="loc">Santiam City</span>. The 1854 Jacob Conser House, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, currently serves as the city's library. The current <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 164 bridge across the <span class="loc">Santiam</span> was designed by Conde McCullough and named in Conser's honor.</p>
