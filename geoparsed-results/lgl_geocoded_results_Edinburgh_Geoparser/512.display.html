<p>Finalist Sommers tackles Springfield's finances, future. Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. <span onClick="goto_name('Springfield')" class="loc">Springfield</span>, Ohio — Butler Tech has been able to maintain high student achievement with low per-pupil costs by marketing to make sure seats were filled and eliminating spending that did not improve student achievement, CEO Bob Sommers told <span onClick="goto_name('Springfield')" class="loc">Springfield</span> residents Monday, March 31. Sommers was the first of three finalists for the next city schools' superintendent to spend a day meeting staff, business leaders and the community as the final round of interviews for the position. He has been with Butler Technology and Career Development Schools since 2001 and by clearly defining and communicating goals, the school has reached new levels of success, he told the audience at Monday's open forum at Springfield High School. "It's a focused attention to detail," he said. "It's making sure that faculty and staff are given the opportunity to think and make decisions for student achievement." Questions at the forum focused on fiscal accountability as well as how Sommers, who has been superintendent of only Butler Tech, a joint vocational district, would handle new challenges like early childhood and elementary education at <span onClick="goto_name('Springfield')" class="loc">Springfield</span> . Sommers said that he saw two major problems for <span onClick="goto_name('Springfield')" class="loc">Springfield</span>: a need to improve student achievement and regain "marketshare," or students who are going to charter, voucher and open enrollment options. "There is no reason that <span onClick="goto_name('Springfield City')" class="loc">Springfield City</span> Schools cannot only regain its marketshare, but also become the premier place where you turn to go to school," he said. Sommers said that he would focus on putting systems in place that allowed staff to make the best decisions to improve student achievement while engaging the community in conversations about what a successful education in <span onClick="goto_name('Springfield')" class="loc">Springfield</span> should look like. "From my perspective, that's a question that the community answers and I deliver," he said.</p>
