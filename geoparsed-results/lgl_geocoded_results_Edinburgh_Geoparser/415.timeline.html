  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Crafton</span> man suing WPXI over photo mix-up. <span class="per">A Crafton</span> man is suing WPXI-TV over a broadcast story that he claims used his photo when the story was about another man with the same last name. The story, broadcast <span class="date">Sept. 28</span>, was about a <span class="loc">South Fayette</span> teacher and coach who resigned <span class="date">last year</span> over what the school district called "inappropriate" e-mails that landed in the hands of other personnel and citizens in the district. The plaintiff, <span class="per">Nicholas A. Schepis</span>, filed suit in <span class="org">Allegheny County Court</span> against WPXI, its local cable affiliate, PCNC, and their parent company, Cox Enterprises Inc. of <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>. "Prior to the release of the broadcast, defendants took not even the most basic of action to inquire into the accuracy of their linking of the photograph of plaintiff to the allegations of criminal conduct on the part of <span class="per">Peter C. Schepis Jr.</span>," the suit said. <span class="per">Peter Schepis</span> is the former substitute teacher and middle school football coach who resigned after the e-mail message, which included text and a nude photo, got the district's attention. The suit charges the television station with defamation, negligence and invasion of privacy. The station's General Manager <span class="per">Ray Carter</span> declined to say how the mix-up occurred. "As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we immediately stopped airing the photo and we issued a correction," <span class="per">Mr. Carter</span> said. "We believe we responded quickly and appropriately."</p><br><br>
