  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Newport</span> is a town in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Sullivan County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is 43 miles (69 km) west-northwest of <span class="org">Concord</span>. The population was 6,507 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. A covered bridge is in the northwest. The area is noted for maple sugar and apple orchards. The central settlement in town, where 4,769 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Newport</span> census-designated place (CDP) and is located next to the <span class="loc">Sugar River</span> at the junction of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> routes 10 and 11. The town also includes the villages of <span class="per">Kelleyville</span> and <span class="per">Guild</span>. Granted in <span class="date">1753</span> by Colonial Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span>, the town was named <span class="per">Grenville</span> after <span class="per">George Grenville</span>, Prime Minister of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> and brother-in-law of <span class="per">William Pitt</span>. But ongoing hostilities during the French and <span class="org">Indian War</span>, as close as the Fort at Number 4 at <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>, delayed settlement. Nevertheless, in <span class="date">1761</span> the town would be incorporated as <span class="per">Newport</span>, for <span class="per">Henry Newport</span>, a distinguished English soldier and statesman. It was first settled in <span class="date">1763</span> by pioneers from <span class="loc">North Killingworth</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. <span class="per">Absalom Kelsey</span> was one of the earliest settlers. The first blow in clearing the forests was struck by <span class="per">Absalom Kelsey</span> on the D.F. Pike farm at the foot of <span class="loc">Claremont Hill</span>, <span class="loc">Newport</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. At that time, the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> was the only route for travel, until a road was cut through the wilderness to <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> in <span class="date">1767</span>. <span class="date">The following year</span>, the first gristmill was established. But dissatisfied with treatment by the state government far beyond the mountains, <span class="per">Newport</span> in <span class="date">1781</span> joined 33 other towns along the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> and seceded from <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> to join <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, however, would dissolve their union with <span class="loc">Vermont</span> in <span class="date">1782</span>, and the towns rejoined <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>.</p><br><br>
