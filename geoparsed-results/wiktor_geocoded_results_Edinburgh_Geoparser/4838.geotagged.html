<p>The <span class="loc">city of Grafton</span> is the seat of local government, the Federal and State government admimistrative centre, and the commercial hub of the <span class="loc">Clarence River</span> Valley. Established in 1851, <span class="loc">Grafton</span> features many historic buildings and tree-lined streets. It is located approximately 630 kilometres north of the New South <span class="loc">Wales</span> State capital, <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, 340 km <span class="loc">south of Brisbane</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span> and approximately 35 km west of the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> coast. As at June 2014, <span class="loc">Grafton</span> had a population of 18,698. Before European settlement, the <span class="loc">Clarence River</span> marked the border between the Bundjalung and Gumbainggir peoples, and so descendants of both language groups can now be found in the <span class="loc">Grafton region</span>. <span class="loc">Grafton</span>, like many other settlements in the area, was first opened up to white settlement by the cedar-getters. An escaped convict, Richard Craig, 'discovered' the district in 1831. With the wealth of 'red gold' cedar just waiting for exploitation, he was given a pardon and one hundred pounds to bring a party of cedar-getters on the cutter 'Prince George' to the region. Word of such wealth to be had did not take long to spread and one of the arrivals was pioneer John Small on the 'Susan' in 1838, and he first occupied land on <span class="loc">Woodford</span> Island. 'The Settlement' (as the embryonic <span class="loc">Grafton</span> was then imaginatively named) was established shortly after.</p>
