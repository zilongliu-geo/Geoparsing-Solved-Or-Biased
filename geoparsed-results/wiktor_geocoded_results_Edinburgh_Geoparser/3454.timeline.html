  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Glendale</span> /ˈɡlɛndeɪl/ is a city in <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located about nine miles (14 km) northwest from Downtown Phoenix. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population of the city is 226,721. In the late 1800s what is <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Glendale</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, was all desert. <span class="per">William John Murphy</span>, a native of <span class="loc">New Hartford</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> who resided in the town of Flagstaff in what was then known as the territory of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, was in charge of building a 40-mile long <span class="loc">Arizona Canal</span> from Granite Reef to <span class="loc">New River</span> for the <span class="loc">Arizona Canal</span> Company. He completed the canal, which would bring water to the desert land, in <span class="date">1885</span>. Murphy was deep in debt, since he had agreed to be paid in <span class="loc">Arizona Canal</span> Company stock and bonds and land instead of cash. In <span class="date">1887</span>, Murphy formed the <span class="org">Arizona Improvement Company</span>. His objective was to sell the land and water rights south of the canal. Murphy had to raise capital from out of state sources in order to meet payroll and construction expenses. Murphy decided to refer to this land as "<span class="loc">Glendale</span>". In order to develop and interest potential investors and settlers in this new town, Murphy decided to provide a better way of access from Phoenix to <span class="loc">Glendale</span> and ending in the town of <span class="loc">Peoria</span> by building an 18 mile long diagonal road which he named <span class="loc">Grand Avenue</span>.</p><br><br>
