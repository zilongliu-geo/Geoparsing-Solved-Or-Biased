  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Not to be confused with the Sena dynasty or <span class="loc">Sana</span>'a, the capital of <span class="loc">Yemen</span>. Sena (Arabic), sometimes spelled Senna, <span class="loc">Sanaw</span> or Sanāw (the latter three names also Arabic), is an abandoned ancient town in <span class="loc">Yemen</span> located in the remote eastern <span class="loc">Hadramaut</span> valley. This village is distinct from the capital of <span class="loc">Yemen</span>, <span class="loc">San</span>'a (Arabic), and the town of Sanāw in <span class="loc">Oman</span>. Sena was a thriving Jewish city at the time of the Babylonian empire around <span class="date">500 BC</span>, and is believed to have been dominated by Israelites who had fled <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> during the Babylonian invasion. They crossed the <span class="loc">Jordan</span> into <span class="loc">Yemen</span>, believing they were safe in the valley in the east, crossing the <span class="loc">Masilah</span> River. According to hydrologists, agriculture in the dry valley was only made possible by a dam; when this broke leaving no water, the inhabitants of the city were forced to move or face starvation. British anthropologist <span class="per">Tudor Parfitt</span>, who specializes in Jewish studies, believes <span class="org">the Ark of the Covenant</span> was kept in the town for some time before it was taken across to <span class="loc">Africa</span>, where the Israelites leaving Sena settled along the <span class="loc">Limpopo River</span> in <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>. The town of Sena is frequently mentioned in the history of the Lemba tribe; more recently genetic studies have found they are descendants of the Israelites.</p><br><br>
