<p><span class="loc">Collinsville</span> is a city in Rogers and Tulsa counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, and a part of the <span class="loc">Tulsa</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was named for Dr. A. H. Collins, an engineer and surveyor who first surveyed the land that became this community. The population was 5,606 according to the 2010 census, an increase of 37.5 percent from 4,077 at the 2000 census. A community that had existed here had no official name until Dr. A. H. Collins, the town namesake, established a post office on May 28, 1897. Henry P. Cook was the first postmaster. Then it became known as either <span class="loc">Collins</span> or <span class="loc">Collins Post</span> Office. The name officially became <span class="loc">Collinsville</span> by June 1898 and it incorporated as a city in April 1899. The population in 1900 was 376. The <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> routed its line from <span class="loc">Kansas</span> to <span class="loc">Owasso</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> about a mile west of <span class="loc">Collinsville</span> in 1899, to avoid crossing an additional stream. The town's buildings were moved on rollers to be nearer the track in 1899 and 1900. <span class="loc">Collinsville</span> originally was located in <span class="loc">Rogers County</span>. In 1918, the residents voted to be annexed by <span class="loc">Tulsa County</span>, in order to be nearer a county seat. It was only 20 miles (32 km) north of <span class="loc">Tulsa</span>.</p>
