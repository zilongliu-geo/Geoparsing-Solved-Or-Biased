<p><span class="loc">San Pablo</span> is a city in Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Richmond</span> surrounds nearly the whole city. The population was 29,139 at the 2010 census. The current Mayor is Rich Kinney, and the current Vice Mayor is Paul V. Morris. Current Council members include Cecilia Valdez, Kathy Chao <span class="loc">Rothberg</span>, and Rich Kinney. The area in which today's <span class="loc">San Pablo</span> is situated was originally occupied by the Cuchiyun band of the Ohlone indigenous people. The area was claimed for the king of <span class="loc">Spain</span> in the late 18th century and was granted for grazing purposes to the <span class="loc">Mission Dolores</span> located in today's <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>. Upon <span class="loc">Mexico</span>'s independence from <span class="loc">Spain</span>, church properties were secularized and in 1823, the area became part of a large grant to an ex-soldier stationed at the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> Presidio, Francisco Mar√≠a Castro. The grant was given the name <span class="loc">Rancho San Pablo</span>, thus originating the name for today's city as well as for one of the <span class="loc">East Bay</span>'s oldest principal roads, today's <span class="loc">San Pablo</span> Avenue (called in the prior Spanish era "<span class="loc">El Camino Real</span> de la <span class="loc">Contra Costa</span>").</p>
