<p><span class="loc">Miami</span> is a community in <span class="loc">southern Manitoba</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> which was formed in 1885. It supports a K-12 school and has a curling rink and a skating rink. It lies 100 kilometres southwest of <span class="loc">Winnipeg</span> in the Rural Municipality of <span class="loc">Thompson</span>. <span class="loc">Miami</span> also has a well trained fire department. Members of the department are trained to a minimum Level I fire fighting certification with the Office of the Fire Commissioner. The Miami Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service has about 24 active members. The town also has a well trained and well equipped EMS Unit that works in conjunction with the surrounding hospitals. In 2005, the town was the victim of a mass street sign theft. All of the town's signs, a total of 44, were stolen just before Christmas Day; total replacement cost was about $7,000 CAD. It just so happened that same night a house fire was reported and no street signs were available for directions. Most of the streets in the community are named after prominent past residents or pioneers. <span class="loc">Miami</span> was used in a controversial prank contest by Winnipeg radio station Classic Rock 97.5 FM (CJKR) morning man Scruff Connors in 1995. The radio station ran a contest for an all expenses paid trip to <span class="loc">Miami</span> to watch the Super Bowl, but did not mention that they were referring to <span class="loc">Miami</span>, <span class="loc">Manitoba</span> and not the one in <span class="loc">Florida</span>. Local media reported that some participants had considered lawsuits over the prank. Because of the negative backlash of the prank, CJKR terminated Connors' contract within days of the incident.</p>
