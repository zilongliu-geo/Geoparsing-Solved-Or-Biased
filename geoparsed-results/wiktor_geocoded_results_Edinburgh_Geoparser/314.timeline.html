  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Wellington</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Lorain County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,802 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Wellington</span> was settled in <span class="date">1818</span> by <span class="per">Ephraim Wilcox</span>, <span class="per">Charles Sweet</span>, <span class="per">William T. Welling</span>, <span class="per">John Clifford</span>, and <span class="per">Joseph Wilson</span> from the states of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span>. It was originally named <span class="loc">Charlemont</span> by <span class="per">Charles Sweet</span> who, after winning a tree chopping contest, was given the right to name the township. It was later changed to <span class="per">Wellington</span> by the townspeople in honor of one of the founders, <span class="per">William Welling</span> and "<span class="loc">Iron Duke</span>," the <span class="per">Duke of Wellington</span>. <span class="per">Wellington</span> was incorporated as a village in <span class="date">1855</span>. In <span class="date">1858</span>, the former American House Hotel (later torn down and replaced by <span class="org">Herrick Memorial Library</span>) was the site of the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue. A group of men, both white and black and many from <span class="loc">Oberlin</span>, swarmed the hotel to rescue runaway slave <span class="per">John Price</span>. He was being held by a <span class="loc">US</span> Marshal and his men, who intended to return him to his master in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The abolitionists transported Price out of town en route to the Underground Railroad and helped convey him to <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Thirty-seven men were indicted, but only two, <span class="per">Simeon M. Bushnell</span> and <span class="per">Charles Henry Langston</span>, were tried in federal court for interfering with the marshal in carrying out the Fugitive Slave Law. After <span class="per">Langston</span>'s eloquent speech about slavery and discrimination, the judge gave them light sentences. The events and trial received national attention, and kept the issue of slavery at the forefront of debate.</p><br><br>
