  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Charlestown</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Sullivan County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,114 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is home to Hubbard State Forest and the headquarters of the Student Conservation Association. The primary settlement in town, where 1,152 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> census-designated place (CDP) and is located along <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 12. The town also includes the villages of <span class="loc">North Charlestown</span>, <span class="loc">South Charlestown</span> and Hemlock Center. The area was first granted on <span class="date">31 December 1735</span> by colonial governor <span class="per">Jonathan Belcher</span> of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> as "Plantation No. 4", the fourth in a line of forts on the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> border established as trading posts. Settled in <span class="date">1740</span>, Number Four was the northernmost township, and its <span class="date">1744</span> log fort became a strategic military site throughout the French and Indian Wars. On the <span class="date">evening of May 2, 1746</span>, <span class="per">Seth Putnam</span> joined <span class="per">Major Josiah Willard</span> and several soldiers as they escorted women to milk the cows. As they approached the booth, Natives hiding in the bushes opened fire, killing <span class="per">Putnam</span>. This was the first casualty in the hostilities that would lead to the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span>. In <span class="date">1747</span> the fort was besieged for <span class="date">three days</span> by a force of 400 French and Native people. <span class="per">Captain Phineas Stevens</span> and 31 soldiers, stationed at the fort, repelled the attack. Their success became well-known, and the fort was never attacked again.</p><br><br>
