<p>Virginia duck and goose hunters, and waterfowl hunters in other parts of the <span class="loc">US</span>, might for the first time find themselves approached by state game officials who are testing harvested birds for the presence of Avian Flu. The migratory flyways considered most at risk of disease transmission are on the Pacific side of <span class="loc">the Americas</span> in <span class="loc">Alaska</span> and the Pacific NorthWest, closest to <span class="loc">Asia</span>. The Atlantic flyway shares migratory influence from <span class="loc">Europe</span> and <span class="loc">Africa</span> where the Avian Flu has also been found. A low pathogenic strain of H5N1 that currently exists in <span class="loc">North America</span> is common among waterfowl. Testing for the more virulent strains involves swabbing the bird's throat or rectum.</p>
