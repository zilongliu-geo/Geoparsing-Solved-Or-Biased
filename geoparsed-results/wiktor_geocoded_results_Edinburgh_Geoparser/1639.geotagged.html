<p><span class="loc">Cuba</span>, officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Cuba</span> (Spanish:  República de <span class="loc">Cuba</span> ), is a sovereign state comprising the islands of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, <span class="loc">Isla de la Juventud</span> and several archipelagos in the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span>. The capital and largest city <span class="loc">Havana</span> is 365 km (227 mi) from <span class="loc">Miami</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>. Geographically, <span class="loc">Cuba</span> is considered part of <span class="loc">North America</span>. Culturally, it is considered part of Latin <span class="loc">America</span>. Prior to Spanish colonization in the late 15th century, <span class="loc">Cuba</span> was inhabited by Amerindian tribes. It remained a colony of <span class="loc">Spain</span> until the Spanish–American War of 1898, which led to nominal independence as a de facto <span class="loc">U.S.</span> protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, <span class="loc">Cuba</span> attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1952. Further unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the July 26 Movement, which afterwards established a government under the leadership of Fidel Castro. Since 1965, the country has been governed by the Communist Party of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>. <span class="loc">Cuba</span> is the largest island in the Caribbean, and the second-most populous after <span class="loc">Hispaniola</span>, with over 11 million inhabitants. It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and customs derive from diverse origins, including the aboriginal Taíno and Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of African slaves, and a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the Cold War.</p>
