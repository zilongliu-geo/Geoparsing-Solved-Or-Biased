<p>Oak Park is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 11 km north of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>'s central business district. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Moreland</span>. At the 2011 Census, Oak Park had a population of 5,771. Oak Park is bounded by New Road, Victoria Street, <span class="loc">Kiama</span> Street and Charlotte Street in the north, Watt Avenue and Pascoe Vale Road in the east, <span class="loc">Moonee Ponds Creek</span> in the west and Main Street in the south. Oak Park was formed from part of the John Pascoe Fawkner estate. The name of the area derived from the name chosen by the purchasers of the Fawkner Estate. Oak Park was relatively slowly developed, as the area did not have a railway station until housing development had commenced in the 1950s. Through the 1950s and 1960s development of the area proceeded quickly, with the post office opening on 2 April 1957. Major features of the area include McDonald's on Pascoe Vale Road, the Winifred Street Shopping Centre, two reserves along <span class="loc">Moonee Ponds Creek</span> including the Oak Park Sports Centre, and the <span class="loc">Moonee Ponds Creek</span> Trail for cyclists. The Oak Park Sports Centre is home to the Oak Park Football Club, a member of the <span class="loc">Essendon District</span> Football League as well as Therry Penola Football Club, a member of the Victorian Amateur Football Association.</p>
