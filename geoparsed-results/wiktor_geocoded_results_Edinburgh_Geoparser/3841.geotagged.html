<p><span class="loc">York County</span> is a county located in the state of <span class="loc">Maine</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 197,131, making it the second-most populous county in <span class="loc">Maine</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Alfred. Founded in 1636, it is the oldest county in <span class="loc">Maine</span> and one of the oldest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">York County</span> is part of the Portlandâ€“South <span class="loc">Portland</span>, <span class="loc">ME</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. In the 1650s the nearby <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span> asserted territorial claims over what is now southern <span class="loc">Maine</span>, and by 1658 had completely absorbed what is now southwestern <span class="loc">Maine</span> into <span class="loc">York County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The first known and recorded deed for a purchase of land in <span class="loc">York County</span> is in 1668, when Francis Small traded goods with the Newichewannock tribe of this area. Their Chief Wesumbe, also known as Captain Sandy, was friendly with Small and warned him of a plot against his life. A group of renegade tribesmen planned on murdering Small instead of paying him with the furs that were owed to him. Small escaped after watching his house in what is now Cornish, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, burn to the ground. Small returned and rebuilt. The Chief made up the loss by selling Small all the lands bounded by the Great and Little Ossipee Rivers, the <span class="loc">Saco River</span>, and the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> border. Known now as the five Ossipee towns, the tract included all of <span class="loc">Limington</span>, <span class="loc">Limerick</span>, <span class="loc">Cornish</span> (formerly named Francisborough), <span class="loc">Newfield</span> and <span class="loc">Parsonsfield</span>.</p>
