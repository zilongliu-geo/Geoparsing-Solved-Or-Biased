<p>Aberdeen /ˈæbərdiːn/ is a city in <span class="loc">Grays</span> <span class="loc">Harbor County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, founded by Samuel Benn in 1884. Aberdeen was incorporated on May 12, 1890. The city is the economic center of <span class="loc">Grays</span> <span class="loc">Harbor County</span>, bordering the <span class="loc">cities of Hoquiam and Cosmopolis</span>. Aberdeen is called the "Gateway to the <span class="loc">Olympic Peninsula</span>" and is best known for being the birthplace and hometown of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobainand Bryan Danielson. Some Nirvana lyrics, in songs such as "Something in the Way" and parts of the Bleach album, referred to locations within the town. The population was 16,896 at the 2010 census. Aberdeen was named for a local salmon cannery to reflect its Scottish fishing port namesake of Aberdeen and because it too is also situated at the mouth of two rivers just like its namesake in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> which is located between the rivers 'Don' at the north and the river 'Dee' to the south side of the Scottish city. Although it became the largest and best-known city in <span class="loc">Grays Harbor</span>, <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> lagged behind neighbors <span class="loc">Hoquiam</span> and <span class="loc">Cosmopolis</span> in the early years. When A.J. West built the town's first sawmill in 1894, the other two municipalities had been in business for several years. Aberdeen and its neighbors vied to be the terminus for Northern Pacific Railroad, but instead of ending at one of the established mill towns, the railroad skimmed through <span class="loc">Cosmopolis</span> and headed west for <span class="loc">Ocosta</span>. Hoquiam and Aberdeen citizens banded together to build a spur; and in 1895, the line connected Northern Pacific tracks to <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span>.</p>
