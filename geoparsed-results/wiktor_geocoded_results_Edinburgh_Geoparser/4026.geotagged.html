<p><span class="loc">Canterbury</span> is a suburb in south-western <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Canterbury</span> is located 10.5 kilometres south-west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district in the <span class="loc">City of Canterbury</span>. The <span class="loc">City of Canterbury</span> takes its name from the suburb but its administrative centre is located in the adjacent suburb of <span class="loc">Campsie</span>, which is also a large commercial centre. <span class="loc">Canterbury</span> is surrounded by <span class="loc">Ashbury</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Campsie</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Earlwood</span> to the south, and <span class="loc">Hurlstone</span> Park to the east. In 1770, the land along the <span class="loc">Cooks River</span> was explored by British officers from the HMS Bark Endeavour. In 1793, the area's first land grant was made to the Chaplain of the First Fleet, the Rev. Richard Johnson. He gave the 100 acre (40 hectare) grant, located one mile (1.6 km) north of the river, the name <span class="loc">Canterbury</span> Vale. The grant was passed onto William Cox, who sold the land for 525 pounds to Robert Campbell in May 1803, after going bankrupt. By 1834 the Campbell Estate grew to 1,242 acres (5 kmÂ²). In 1865, daughter Sarah Jeffrey subdivided the land into allotments, each containing several acres. The first major industry was established in 1841 with the building of the Australian Sugar Company's sugar mill by the <span class="loc">Cooks River</span> to produce molasses and spirits. Other industries and trades such as boiling down works and tanneries later developed along the river. The Methodists built the first church in the suburb, with services beginning in 1841. The railway line was completed in 1895, encouraging suburban development and leading to the area becoming heavily populated. This was too late for the Sugar Mill, which ceased production in September 1854, but was favourable for horse racing, which informally began in 1871.</p>
