  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Rhodes</span>, <span class="per">Rivkin</span> top Amherst election. He has taught, been a school librarian, and assistant superintendent at the former <span class="org">Belchertown State School</span>. "I want to bring all that experience" to the committee, he said. Serving on those financial committees gave him an insight into the financial workings of the town budget and he believes that the overriding issue is the budget. <span class="per">Rivkin</span> is chairman of the economics department at <span class="org">Amherst College</span>. He specializes in the economics of education. <span class="per">Rivkin</span>, along with current <span class="org">School Committee</span> member <span class="per">Catherine A. Sanderson</span>, co-founded the <span class="org">Amherst Committee for Excellence</span> in <span class="date">2007</span> in an attempt to ensure academic excellence for all children. As a committee member he wants to ensure that all students are intellectually engaged. And he also wants "to bring a sense of open debate and discussion (at <span class="org">School Committee</span> meetings) to focus on data and evidence . . . and most of all to focus on the children." <span class="per">Rhodes</span> <span class="date">Tuesday night</span> credited his committee for helping him win the seat. "I'm ready," he said. "I'm so ready." For <span class="org">Jones Library Board</span> of Trustees Carol J. <span class="per">Gray</span> and <span class="per">Sarah</span> <span class="loc">McKee</span> won the two seats beating <span class="per">John M. McDonald</span> III, and <span class="per">Lucy L. McMurrer</span>. Incumbents Merrylees <span class="per">Turner</span> and <span class="per">Ann</span> <span class="per">H. Grose</span> did not seek re-election. <span class="per">John W. Coull</span>, former <span class="loc">Chamber of Commerce</span> executive director, won two positions, retaining his position as elector of the <span class="per">Oliver Smith Will</span>, beating out <span class="per">David F. Farnham</span> who had held the seat for <span class="date">a number of years</span>. <span class="per">Coull</span> also beat out <span class="per">Robert B. Kusner</span> for Amherst Redevelopment Authority. Looks like about a 10% turnout in overly enlightened <span class="loc">Amherst</span>. But <span class="date">five months ago</span> in the Presidential election, the turnout was close to 80% AMHERST - <span class="per">Irvin E. Rhodes</span> was the big winner in the <span class="org">School Committee</span> race in <span class="date">Tuesday</span>'s Annual Town Election, with <span class="per">Steven G. Rivkin</span> finishing second in a three-way race for two seats. <span class="per">Megan D. Rosa</span> a parent who said she was running to ensure students get the best education they can finished third. Incumbents <span class="per">Elaine L. Brighty</span> and <span class="per">Sonia Correa Pope</span> did not seek re-election. <span class="per">Rhodes</span> has been on the Finance Committee and most recently served on the town's <span class="org">Facilitation for Community Choices Committee</span>.</p><br><br>
