  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Junta</span> is the Home Rule Municipality that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of <span class="loc">Otero County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city population was 7,077 at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. <span class="loc">La Junta</span> is located on the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River in southeastern <span class="loc">Colorado</span> east of Pueblo. <span class="loc">La Junta</span> (Spanish for "the junction") rests at the intersection of the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail with the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River. The town developed near <span class="org">Bent's Post</span>, a fur trading post of the 19th century. During World War II, <span class="loc">La Junta</span> had an Army Air Force Training Base outside town. An Air Force detachment of the Strategic Air Command remained there until modern flight simulators developed in <span class="date">the 1980s</span> rendered live flight unnecessary for pilot training maneuvers. At least one military aircraft crashed close by during such training maneuvers. The airport, located 5 miles (8.0 km) north of <span class="loc">La Junta</span>, has 77 acres (31 ha) of tarmac and two runways which are still in use. One runway (east-west) is 6,851 feet (2,088 m) long and the other is 5,800 feet (1,800 m). [2].</p><br><br>
