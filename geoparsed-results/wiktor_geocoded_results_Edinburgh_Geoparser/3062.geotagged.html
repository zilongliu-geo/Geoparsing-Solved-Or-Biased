<p>Trenton (2001 population 19,374) is a community in Southern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> in the municipality of <span class="loc">Quinte West</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Located on the <span class="loc">Bay of Quinte</span>, it is the main population centre in <span class="loc">Quinte</span> West, and is one of the largest freestanding unincorporated communities in the province. Trenton is the starting point for the Trent-Severn Waterway, which continues northwest to <span class="loc">Peterborough</span> and eventually <span class="loc">Port Severn</span> on <span class="loc">Georgian Bay</span>. The <span class="loc">Trent River</span> was known to the <span class="loc">Mississauga</span> as Sangichiwigewonk, or 'fast flowing.' It was named after the <span class="loc">River Trent</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. French explorer Samuel de Champlain followed the <span class="loc">Trent</span> Severn passing through Trenton in 1615. The area around the mouth of the <span class="loc">Trent River</span> was first settled by Europeans in the 1780s. Assorted settlements and town plots in the area went under a number of names, until the Village of Trenton was incorporated in 1853. Trenton grew thanks to its port location and area lumber industry. During the First World War, the town was home to a major munitions plant owned by the British Chemical Company. This facility was built in 1915 to manufacture artillery, rifle, and small arms ammunition. Three weeks before the Armistice, an explosion levelled the plant. Remains of the old plant can still be found today.</p>
