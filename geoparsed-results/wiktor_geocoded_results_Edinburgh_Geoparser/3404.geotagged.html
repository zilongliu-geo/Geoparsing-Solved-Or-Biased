<p><span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> in <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, is a place north of the <span class="loc">Gila River</span> near <span class="loc">Hyder</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. The location was the site of a resort established at the site of nearby hot springs. <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span>, a name derived from Spanish meaning "hot water", received its name from nearby hot springs which were originally used by the local Indians. By 1858 Flap-Jack Ranch was located six miles from the <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> hot springs along the <span class="loc">Gila River</span>, 84 miles from Fort Yuma. It was established as stagecoach station of the Butterfield Overland Mail. In 1862, it was called Grinnel’s Ranch and was listed on the itinerary of the California Column in the same place as Flap Jack Ranch, (84 miles), from Fort Yuma on the route to <span class="loc">Tucson</span>. So too was what Union Army reports called <span class="loc">Stanwix Ranch</span> or <span class="loc">Stanwix Station</span> which became the site of the westernmost skirmish of the American Civil War. John Ross Browne described his visit to the <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> Springs from Grinnel’s Station in 1864: "While the Company were encamped at Grinnell's, <span class="loc">Poston</span>, White, and myself crossed the <span class="loc">Gila</span>, and rode about six miles to the ranch of Martin and Woolsey, situated near the Aqua Calliente. Mr. Woolsey had left, a few days before, with a large quantity of stock for the gold placers. We were hospitably entertained by his partner, Mr. Martin, who is trying the experiment of establishing a farm here by means of irrigation. The soil is excellent, and the prospect is highly encouraging. An abundant supply of water flows from the Aqua Calliente. We had a glorious bath in the springs next morning, which completely set us up after the dust and grit of the journey. They lie near the point of the hill, about a mile and a half from Martin's. I consider them equal to the baths of <span class="loc">Damascus</span>, or any other in the world. The water is of an exquisite temperature, and possesses some very remarkable qualities in softening the skin and soothing the nervous system."</p>
