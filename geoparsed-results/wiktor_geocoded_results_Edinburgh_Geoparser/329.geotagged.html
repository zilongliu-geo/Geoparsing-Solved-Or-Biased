<p>Clifton is both a suburb of <span class="loc">Bristol</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, and the name of one of the city's thirty-five council wards. The <span class="loc">Clifton ward</span> also includes the areas of Cliftonwood and Hotwells. Other parts of the suburb lie within the <span class="loc">ward of Clifton East</span>. Notable places in Clifton include Clifton Suspension Bridge, <span class="loc">Clifton</span> Cathedral, <span class="loc">Clifton</span> College, The Clifton Club, Bristol Zoo, <span class="loc">Goldney Hall</span> and <span class="loc">Clifton Down</span>. Clifton is an inner suburb of the English port <span class="loc">city of Bristol</span>. Clifton was recorded in the Domesday book as Clistone, the name of the village denoting a 'hillside settlement' and referring to its position on a steep hill. Until 1898 Clifton St Andrew was a separate civil parish within the Municipal Borough of <span class="loc">Bristol</span>. Various sub-districts of Clifton exist, including Whiteladies Road, an important shopping district to the east, and <span class="loc">Clifton</span> Village, a smaller shopping area near the <span class="loc">Avon Gorge</span> to the west. Although the suburb has no formal boundaries, the name Clifton is generally applied to the high ground stretching from Whiteladies Road in the east to the rim of the <span class="loc">Avon Gorge</span> in the west, and from <span class="loc">Clifton Down</span> and <span class="loc">Durdham Down</span> in the north to Cornwallis Crescent in the south. This area corresponds roughly with the city <span class="loc">wards of Clifton and Clifton East</span>, although the former also includes the river side suburb of Hotwells.</p>
