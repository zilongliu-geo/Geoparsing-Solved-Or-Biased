<p><span class="loc">Potter County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 17,457, making it the fifth-least populous county in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Coudersport. The county was created in 1804 and later organized in 1836. It is named after James Potter, who was a general from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Though it is named for him, James Potter never actually lived in <span class="loc">Potter County</span> and may have never even visited the area. <span class="loc">Potter County</span> is located in the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> Plateau region. Major Isaac Lyman, an American Revolutionary war veteran was one of the first permanent settlers in <span class="loc">Potter County</span>. Major Lyman is recognized as the founder of <span class="loc">Potter County</span>. He was paid ten dollars for each settler he convinced to move to <span class="loc">Potter County</span>. He built his home in 1809 in nearby <span class="loc">Lymansville</span>, now known as Ladonna. Major Lyman also built the first road to cross <span class="loc">Potter County</span> and <span class="loc">Potter County</span>'s first sawmill and gristmill. Lyman had a colorful personal history. After the death in childbirth of his first wife, Sally Edgecombe, he remarried; later he left his second wife and started a third family in <span class="loc">Potter County</span>. The second Mrs. Lyman was determined not to suffer on her own. She sought out the Major, travelling from <span class="loc">Bolton Landing</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> to <span class="loc">Potter County</span> with the help of their son, Burrell, who was 18 at the time. Major Lyman lived with these two families in <span class="loc">Potter County</span>. Historical accounts of the living situation vary. Some say that Lyman kept both wives under one roof. Others state that there were two log homes for the families on the same piece of property. Descendants of Major Isaac Lyman's three families still live and work in <span class="loc">Potter County</span>.</p>
