  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is an unincorporated area of <span class="loc">Nashville</span>, located roughly 13 miles southwest of the downtown area via Interstate 40. It is served by the Metropolitan Government of <span class="loc">Nashville</span> and <span class="loc">Davidson County</span>. In <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> was a small community which existed primarily to serve the needs of nearby farms. It was located mostly along the railroad tracks near the <span class="loc">Harpeth River</span>, and had only a few buildings such as a hardware store, post office, and a Masonic lodge hall. The suburbanization was made official when the United States Postal Service changed the designation of the office there from "<span class="loc">Bellview</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>" to a branch of the <span class="loc">Nashville</span> office in <span class="date">the late 1970s</span>. Since the <span class="date">year 2000</span>, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> has grown in population and development in the already established areas along <span class="loc">Old Hickory</span>, and <span class="date">now</span> it is becoming progressively more lit. It also has Boulevard and Hwy 70S, as well as in the more affluent developments off <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> <span class="per">State Highway</span> 100. There are three commercial retail hotspots in the <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> area which are located near the Highway 70/I-40 interchange, at the intersection of Highway 70 and <span class="loc">Old Hickory</span> Boulevard; and near the intersection of Old Harding <span class="per">Pike</span> and <span class="per">Highway</span> 100.</p><br><br>
