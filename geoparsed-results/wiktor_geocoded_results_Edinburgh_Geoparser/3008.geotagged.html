<p><span class="loc">Roseville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Macomb County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, and is a part of the Metro Detroit area. The population was 47,299 at the 2010 census. Until 1958, <span class="loc">Roseville</span> was a part of Erin Township. The first permanent post office in the area was established in 1840 by William Rose who named it the Roseville Post Office in honor of his father Dennison Rose, a veteran of the War of 1812. The Village of <span class="loc">Roseville</span> was incorporated in 1926 and the <span class="loc">Municipal Building</span> was constructed in 1929 at <span class="loc">Gratiot Avenue</span> and <span class="loc">Meier Road</span>. This replaced the Erin Township Building that was built near the corner of 11 Mile Road and <span class="loc">Gratiot</span> in 1886. The 1929 building housed administrative offices as well as the police and fire departments until the 1960s when separate police and fire stations were constructed. City offices remained in the building until 1974. Michiganâ€™s first commercial airport, <span class="loc">Packard</span> Field, opened at <span class="loc">Gratiot</span> Avenue and Frazho Road in 1919.
