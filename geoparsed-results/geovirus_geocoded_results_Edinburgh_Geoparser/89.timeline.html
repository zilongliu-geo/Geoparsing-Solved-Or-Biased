  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The United Nations (<span class="org">UN</span>) has confirmed six aid workers in <span class="loc">South Sudan</span> were killed on <span class="date">Saturday</span> in what the <span class="org">UN</span> representative called a "heinous murder." The attack occurred in a government-controlled section of road as the six workers drove from the capital, <span class="loc">Juba</span>, northeast to <span class="loc">Pibor</span>. The victims were later found by other members of the humanitarian convoy. <span class="org">UN</span> humanitarian coordinator for <span class="loc">South Sudan</span>, <span class="per">Eugene Owusu</span> described the attack as "utterly reprehensible". He also expressed his outrage that it occurred while humanitarian needs are higher than they have ever been. At least twelve aid works have died in <span class="loc">South Sudan</span> <span class="date">this year</span>, according to the <span class="org">UN</span>, 79 since the <span class="date">December 2013</span> outbreak of civil war. <span class="date">This month</span>, the South Sudanese government also announced plans to increase visa fees for humanitarian workers to US$10,000. Special Representative of the <span class="org">UN</span> Secretary-General for <span class="loc">South Sudan</span> David Shearer said in response to the attack that humanitarian workers in <span class="loc">South Sudan</span> faced more danger than almost any other country. The country's deputy ambassador to the <span class="org">UN</span>, <span class="per">Joseph Moum</span> <span class="loc">Malok</span>, has reiterated the government's commitment to assist people affected by famine and civil war, and asked the international community to maintain their involvement. <span class="per">A UN</span> report obtained by Agence <span class="per">France-Presse</span> and <span class="per">Reuters</span> has suggested the government is also continuing to expand its arms stockpile despite the famine, allegations the government denies. A recent outbreak of cholera in parts of the country has exacerbated the crisis and increased pressure on aid workers. <span class="org">UN</span> figures suggest 7.5 million South Sudanese <span class="date">now</span> require humanitarian aid, with one million verging on starvation.</p><br><br>
