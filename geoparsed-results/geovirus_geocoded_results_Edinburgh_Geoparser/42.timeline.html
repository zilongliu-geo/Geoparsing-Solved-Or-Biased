  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A British medical student has become the first confirmed case of swine flu in <span class="loc">Kenya</span>, east <span class="loc">Africa</span>. The student, who was in a group of 33, was in <span class="loc">Kenya</span> to attend a series of medical camps in <span class="loc">Nyanza province</span>. The whole group is currently quarantined in their hotel in <span class="loc">Kisumu</span> while undergoing treatment. A second suspected case involving a Kenyan woman who had just arrived from <span class="loc">India</span> was put in isolation at <span class="org">Kenyatta National Hospital</span> in the capital <span class="loc">Nairobi</span> pending laboratory results. Over <span class="date">the weekend</span> there was panic in the capital as mobile text messages circulated warning people to stay away from <span class="loc">Sarit</span> centre, a popular commercial establishment where another suspected case had been diagnosed. The patient's test results however came back negative for the H1N1 virus. <span class="loc">Kenya</span> has maintained strong ties with <span class="loc">Britain</span> since gaining independence in <span class="date">1962</span>. Direct flights to <span class="loc">London</span> operate regularly. There are fears that the high tourism season which begins <span class="date">this month</span> and runs into <span class="date">September</span> will be adversely affected even as the global recession rages on. The tourism sector is yet to make a full recovery after the country almost slid into a civil war following a disputed general election <span class="date">two years ago</span>, which forced the international community to intervene. A cholera epidemic sweeping across the country has exacerbated the situation, killing at least 80 people since <span class="date">March</span> and setting the stage for a major scare. In <span class="date">recent years</span> <span class="loc">Kenya</span> has received large numbers of tourists most of whom troop to Kogelo in <span class="loc">Nyanza province</span> to visit the ancestral home and family of the current <span class="loc">US</span> president's late father Hussein Obama. There are plans to put up a museum there in his honour. This has made the region extremely susceptible to the current flu pandemic.</p><br><br>
