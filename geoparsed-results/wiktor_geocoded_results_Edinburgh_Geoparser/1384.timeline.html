  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gladstone</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Clay County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, is a suburb of <span class="loc">Kansas City</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The <span class="loc">City of Gladstone</span> has the advantage of being located only 10 minutes from downtown <span class="loc">Kansas City</span>, and 10 minutes from <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> International Airport. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 26,365. How did <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> get its name? There are two versions of the story, so you’ll have to decide which one you prefer. One version is told in a beautiful, framed calligraphy scroll which was signed and presented to the City on <span class="date">July 4, 1976</span> by two members of the first City Council who were instrumental in the City’s incorporation in <span class="date">1952</span>. The story goes that when <span class="org">the Petition for Incorporation</span> was presented to the Circuit Court of <span class="loc">Clay County</span>, the bearers were informed the Petition was incomplete because the name of the proposed new city was not shown. As time was of the essence (<span class="loc">Kansas City</span> had plans to annex this area), a hurried meeting was called and <span class="per">Mrs. Maria Harless</span>, who later became the first City Clerk, suggested the name of <span class="loc">Gladstone</span>. At that time, much publicity was being given to <span class="org">Southwestern Bell Telephone Company</span>’s opening of the new <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> telephone exchange in this area. <span class="per">Mrs. Harless</span> reasoned that the publicity this name received would also provide some much-needed publicity for this newborn city. Thus, the name <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> was borrowed from the telephone company.</p><br><br>
