<p><span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 4,836, making it the least populous county in <span class="loc">New York</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Lake Pleasant</span>. The county is named after Alexander Hamilton, the only member of the <span class="loc">New York</span> State delegation who signed the United States Constitution in 1787 and later the first United States Secretary of the Treasury. The county was created in 1816 and later organized in 1847. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is one of only two counties that lie entirely within the <span class="loc">Adirondack</span> Park (Essex is the other). Because of its situation in the <span class="loc">Adirondack</span> Park, any development in the county is severely restricted by the <span class="loc">New York</span> State Constitution, which designates the park as "forever wild." There is no permanent traffic light in the county. On April 12, 1816, <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> was created by partitioning 1,800 square miles (4,700 km2) from <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, but due to low population it remained unorganized and administered from <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, <span class="loc">N.Y.</span> until it was recognized as sufficiently organized for self-government on January 1, 1838. The organization process was completed by Summer of 1847.</p>
