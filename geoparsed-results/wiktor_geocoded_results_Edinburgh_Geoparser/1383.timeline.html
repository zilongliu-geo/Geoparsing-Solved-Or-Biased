  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gladstone</span> is a city located in <span class="loc">Clackamas County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 11,497 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> is an approximately 4-square-mile (10 km2) suburban community, 12 miles (19 km) south of <span class="loc">Portland</span>, the largest city in <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, and located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Clackamas</span> and <span class="loc">Willamette</span> rivers. <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> has held several important cultural and social events, hosting both the inaugural <span class="loc">Clackamas County</span> Fair and the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> State Fair, before both were moved to more spacious locations. Both Secretary of State <span class="per">William Jennings Bryan</span> and presidential candidate <span class="per">Theodore Roosevelt</span> have given public speeches in the city. Prior to European settlement, there were several Native American groups living in the area that was to become <span class="loc">Gladstone</span>. In <span class="date">1804</span>, President <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span> commissioned the <span class="per">Lewis</span> and <span class="per">Clark</span> expedition to explore the Louisiana Territory and beyond. Although the expedition passed only near the <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> â€“ <span class="loc">Oregon City</span> locality on their way to and from the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>, via the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span>, natives such as the Kalapuya and the <span class="loc">Clackamas</span> people told them about the area. In the subsequent <span class="date">years</span>, successive waves of explorers and traders would introduce epidemics of cholera and smallpox, which would take a heavy toll on the native peoples and contributed to a substantial reduction in population.</p><br><br>
