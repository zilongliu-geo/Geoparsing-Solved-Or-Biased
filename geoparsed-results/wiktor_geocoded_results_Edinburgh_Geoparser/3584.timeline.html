  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">London</span> is a Canadian city located in Southwestern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> along the Quebec Cityâ€“Windsor Corridor. The city has a population of 366,151 according to the <span class="date">2011</span> Canadian census. <span class="loc">London</span> is at the confluence of the non-navigable <span class="loc">Thames River</span>, approximately halfway between <span class="loc">Toronto</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span> and <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The <span class="loc">City of London</span> is a separated municipality, politically separate from <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, though it remains the county seat. <span class="loc">London</span> and the <span class="loc">Thames</span> were named in <span class="date">1793</span> by <span class="per">Lord Simcoe</span>, who proposed the site for the capital of <span class="loc">Upper Canada</span>. The first European settlement was between <span class="date">1801</span> and <span class="date">1804</span> by <span class="per">Peter Hagerman</span>. The village was founded in <span class="date">1826</span> and incorporated in <span class="date">1855</span>. Since then, <span class="loc">London</span> has grown to be the largest Southwestern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> municipality and <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s 11th largest municipality, having annexed many of the smaller communities that surrounded it. <span class="loc">London</span> is a regional centre of health care and education, being home to the <span class="org">University of Western Ontario, Fanshawe College</span>, and several hospitals. The city hosts a number of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals, which contribute to its tourism industry, but its economic activity is centred on education, medical research, insurance, and information technology. London's university and hospitals are among its top ten employers. <span class="loc">London</span> lies at the junction of Highway 401 and 402, connecting it to <span class="loc">Toronto</span>, <span class="loc">Windsor</span>, and <span class="loc">Sarnia</span>. It also has an international airport, train and bus station.</p><br><br>
