  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bir</span> is a village located in the west of <span class="loc">Joginder Nagar</span> Valley in the state of <span class="loc">Himachal Pradesh</span> in northern <span class="loc">India</span>. <span class="loc">Bir</span> is a noted centre for ecotourism, spiritual studies and meditation. <span class="loc">Bir</span> is also home to a Tibetan refugee settlement with several Buddhist monasteries and a large stupa. <span class="loc">Bir</span> was ruled by the Pal dynasty of the Chandarvanshi lineage. The last <span class="loc">Raja</span> or <span class="loc">Rai</span> was <span class="per">Raizada Prithi Pal</span>, who was a descendant of the Rajas of Bhangahal, who appear to have maintained their rights until the time of <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="per">Prithi Pal</span> in the early part of the eighteenth century. <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="per">Prithi Pal</span> fell victim to his father-in-law, <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="loc">Sidh</span> <span class="loc">Sen</span>, who in <span class="date">1728</span> invited him to Mandi on the pretext of seeking his assistance against the <span class="loc">Raja</span> of <span class="loc">Suket</span>. He was kindly received, but within <span class="date">a month</span> of his arrival he was beguiled into the <span class="loc">Damdama</span> Fort, and there murdered. It is said his body was duly burnt, but his head was buried in a tank facing the Mandi <span class="loc">Raja</span>'s palace. A pillar was erected on the spot, and a light was kept burning on it for <span class="date">years</span>. <span class="loc">Sidh</span> <span class="loc">Sen</span>'s object in murdering <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="per">Prithi Pal</span> was to seize his territory, but in this he only partially succeeded. The forts at Jagapur, Tika Thana and the Patgana of <span class="loc">Nir</span>, with eighteen villages of Ilaga Chuhar (all of them until then forming part of the Bhangahal kingdom) were annexed to Mandi. Subsequently, <span class="loc">Sidh</span> <span class="loc">Sen</span> sttempted to seize <span class="loc">Karanpur</span>, which also belonged to Bhangahal, but he was repulsed by <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="per">Raghunath Pal</span> who had succeeded his father <span class="loc">Raja</span> <span class="per">Prithi Pal</span>. In a second invasion, he penetrated as far as Kotharli Gulu, then in Bhangahal, but <span class="per">Raghunath Pal</span> was able, with the assistance of <span class="loc">Raja</span> Thedi Singh of <span class="loc">Kulu</span>, not only to check his advance, but also to beat him back with considerable loss.</p><br><br>
