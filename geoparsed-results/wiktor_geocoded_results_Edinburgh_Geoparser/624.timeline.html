  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Belmont</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Belknap County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,356 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The primary settlement in town, where 1,301 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined by the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> as the <span class="loc">Belmont</span> census-designated place (CDP) and includes the densely populated portion of the town near the intersection of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 106 and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 140. Originally known as Upper Gilmanton, <span class="per">Belmont</span> was chartered in <span class="date">1727</span> as a <span class="loc">parish of Gilmanton</span>. With water power from the <span class="loc">Tioga</span> River, it developed as a mill town. Built in <span class="date">1833</span>, the <span class="org">Gilmanton Village Manufacturing Co.</span> made cotton and woolen textiles. Over the <span class="date">years</span> it would change owners, names and products. In <span class="date">1921</span>, it was the <span class="org">Belmont Hosiery Co.</span>, a maker of silk, lisle and woolen stockings. It went out of business in <span class="date">1955</span>, and the renovated mill building is <span class="date">now</span> a community center. Separated from <span class="loc">Gilmanton</span> by an act of legislature, the town was incorporated on <span class="date">28 June 1859</span> as Upper Gilmanton. The name <span class="per">Belmont</span> was adopted in <span class="date">1869</span> to honor <span class="per">August Belmont</span>, a wealthy financier who (it was hoped) would contribute to the nascent town, but he never acknowledged the act.</p><br><br>
