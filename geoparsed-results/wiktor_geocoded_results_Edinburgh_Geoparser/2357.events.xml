  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="was officially changed to Peru in 1806">
    Originally named for Oliver Partridge, one of the three purchasers of the town (along with Governor Francis Bernard), the name was officially changed to Peru in 1806, on the suggestion of the Rev. John Leland, "because it is like the Peru of South America, a mountain town, and if no gold or silver mines are under her rocks, she favors hard money and begins with a P." According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 26.0 square miles (67.4 km2), of which 25.9 square miles (67.1 km2) is land and 0.12 square miles (0.3 km2), or 0.41%, is water.
