  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windsor County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 9,373 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. One of the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> grants, the township was chartered on <span class="date">August 20, 1761</span> by Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span> and awarded to <span class="per">Gideon Lyman</span> and 61 others. Although Springfield's alluvial flats made it among the best agricultural towns in the state, the <span class="loc">Black River</span> falls, which drop 110 feet (33.5 m) in 1/8 of a mile (201 m), helped it develop into a mill town. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> was located in the center of the Precision Valley region, home of the <span class="loc">Vermont</span> machine tool industry. In <span class="date">1888</span>, the <span class="loc">Jones</span> and <span class="loc">Lamson Machine Tool</span> Company (J&amp;L) moved to <span class="loc">Springfield</span> from <span class="loc">Windsor</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span> under the successful leadership of <span class="per">James Hartness</span>. Gaining international renown for precision and innovation, J&amp;L ushered in a new era of precision manufacturing in the area. <span class="per">Edwin R. Fellows</span> co-founded the Fellows Gear <span class="org">Shaper Company</span> here in <span class="date">1896</span>. As knowledge and infrastructure grew to support precision machining, other companies such as the <span class="org">Bryant Chucking Grinder Company and Lovejoy Tool</span> formed, grew, and provided much of the economic engine. Springfield Telescope Makers, the oldest amateur telescope makers' club in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, has been headquartered in <span class="loc">Springfield</span> since its inception in <span class="date">1920</span>. The club's clubhouse, Stellafane, located on the campus of Stellafane Observatory has hosted a convention for the geographically scattered club since <span class="date">1927</span>. During World War II, Springfield's production of machine tools was of such importance to the American war effort that the <span class="loc">US</span> government ranked <span class="loc">Springfield</span> (together with the Cone at <span class="loc">Windsor</span>) as the seventh most important bombing target in the country.</p><br><br>
