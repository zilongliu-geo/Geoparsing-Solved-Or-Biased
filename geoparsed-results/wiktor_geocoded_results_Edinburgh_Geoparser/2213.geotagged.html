<p><span class="loc">Canoas</span> (Portuguese pronunciation: [kaˈnoɐs]), which earned city status in 1939, is a municipality in the Brazilian state of <span class="loc">Rio Grande do Sul</span>. With more than 300,000 inhabitants, it is part of the <span class="loc">Porto Alegre</span> conurbation and has the second highest GDP in the state. It is also the fourth largest city in the state by population. <span class="loc">Canoas</span> boasts a strong manufacturing-based economy and is the home of the Canoas Air Force Base, used by the Brazilian Air Force. According to the IBGE, Brazil's Geography and Statistics Institute, <span class="loc">Canoas</span> currently has no rural areas, but it started as a village of large landowners. The first of them was conquistador Francisco <span class="loc">Pinto Bandeira</span>, who received from the Portuguese Crown, in 1740, an area north of the Gravataí River. History has that 1871 was the beginning of the village of <span class="loc">Canoas</span>, when the first section of the railway that would link <span class="loc">Porto Alegre</span> to São <span class="loc">Leopoldo</span> was inaugurated. <span class="loc">Canoas</span> was then part of the municipalities of Gravataí and São Sebastião do Caí. Soon large farms would lose space to small properties.</p>
