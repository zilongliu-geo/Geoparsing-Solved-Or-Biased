<p><span class="loc">Frankfort</span> is a village in Will and Cook counties, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 17,782 at the 2010 census, up from 10,391 in 2000. According to Forbes.com, in 2007 the village ranked as the 36th fastest growing suburb in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The name "<span class="loc">Frankfort</span>" was taken from <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> Township as designated by the governing board of <span class="loc">Will County</span>. It was commonly known as "<span class="loc">Frankfort</span> Station" after the opening of the <span class="loc">Joliet</span> &amp; Northern <span class="loc">Indiana Railroad</span> through the township in 1855, though the official plat of the community dated March 1855 shows the name as "<span class="loc">Frankfort</span>". Property deed abstracts and railroad documents also show that the name was always <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>. Local residents incorporated <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> as a village in 1879. First inhabited by Native Americans, including the Potawatomi and Sac and Fox tribes, <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> was used as a conduit between the <span class="loc">Des Plaines</span> and St. Joseph rivers. Originally, the area was part of the Virginia Territory before the French signed a treaty with Manitoqua, the Potawatomi chief, for land in the <span class="loc">Prestwick</span> area. The first pioneers came to <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> in the early 1830s by means of the <span class="loc">Des Plaines</span> River from the southwest and by wagon from the east along the <span class="loc">Sauk</span> Trail, a roadway that still exists today.</p>
