<p><span class="loc">Santo Domingo</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsanto ðoˈmiŋɡo] meaning "<span class="loc">Saint Dominic</span>"), officially <span class="loc">Santo Domingo</span> de Guzmán, is the capital and largest city in the <span class="loc">Dominican Republic</span> and the largest city in the Caribbean by population. The population of the city is of 1,506,233 by 2016 and of 3,891,788 when its metropolitan area was included. The city lies within the boundaries of the <span class="loc">Distrito Nacional</span> ("D.N.", "National District"), itself bordered on three sides by <span class="loc">Santo Domingo</span> Province. It is also the second largest city in Central <span class="loc">America</span>, behind <span class="loc">Guatemala City</span>. Founded by Bartholomew Columbus in 1496, on the east bank of the <span class="loc">Ozama</span> River and then moved by Nicolás de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in <span class="loc">the Americas</span>, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the <span class="loc">New World</span>. <span class="loc">Santo Domingo</span> is the site of the first university, cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in the <span class="loc">New World</span>. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. <span class="loc">Santo Domingo</span> was called <span class="loc">Ciudad Trujillo</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [sjuˈðað tɾuˈhiʎo]), from 1936 to 1961, after the <span class="loc">Dominican Republic</span>'s dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.</p>
