<p>Troy is a town in <span class="loc">Cheshire County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,145 at the 2010 census. It is situated at the base of <span class="loc">Mount Monadnock</span>. The town center village, where 1,221 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the Troy census-designated place (CDP), and is located along <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 12. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Troy Village Historic District. Settled in 1762, by 1815 the community had grown so much that it sought its own incorporation. It was set off from <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> that year, and included parts of <span class="loc">Fitzwilliam</span>, <span class="loc">Swanzey</span> and <span class="loc">Richmond</span>. A prominent citizen and friend of Governor John Taylor Gilman, Captain Benjamin Mann of Mason, suggested the name Troy. His daughter, Betsy, was married to Samuel Wilson, famous as "<span class="loc">Uncle Sam</span>", and at that time a resident of Troy, <span class="loc">New York</span>. At least seven members of Wilson's family were living in the town at the time, thus securing the name. The town hall, built in 1813-1814 near the rail-fenced common, was originally the village meetinghouse.</p>
