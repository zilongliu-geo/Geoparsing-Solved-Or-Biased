  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Tulare /tuːˈlɛəriː/ is a city in <span class="loc">Tulare County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The population was 59,278 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Tulare</span> is located in the heart of the Central Valley, eight miles (13 km) south of <span class="loc">Visalia</span> and thirty miles northwest of <span class="loc">Porterville</span>, in the <span class="loc">Visalia-Porterville Metropolitan</span> Area. The city is named for the currently dry <span class="loc">Tulare Lake</span>, once the largest freshwater lake west of the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span>. The city's mission statement is: "To promote a quality of life making <span class="loc">Tulare</span> the most desirable community in which to live, learn, play, work, worship and prosper." The <span class="loc">Stockton</span> seaport is 170 miles (270 km) away, and the Sacramento port is 207 miles (333 km) away. The <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> ports are each approximately 200 miles (320 km) away, making <span class="loc">Tulare</span> a hub or central location for product movement. The Yokuts people built reed boats and fished in what was later to be called <span class="loc">Tulare Lake</span> in their homeland for <span class="date">centuries</span>, until the invasion and settlement by the Spanish and American pioneers. When <span class="loc">California</span> became a state in <span class="date">1850</span>, <span class="loc">Tulare</span> did not yet exist as a town. <span class="loc">Tulare</span> was founded in <span class="date">1872</span>, by the Southern Pacific Railroad. The town was named for Lake Tulare. The lake had been named for the tule rush plant (Schoenoplectus acutus) (pictured left), a species of bulrush that predominantly lined the marshes and sloughs of its shore.</p><br><br>
