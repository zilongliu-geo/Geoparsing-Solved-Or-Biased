<p><span class="loc">Santa Rita</span> is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Samar</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 38,082 people. <span class="loc">Santa Rita</span> is connected to <span class="loc">Tacloban</span> and <span class="loc">Leyte Island</span> by the <span class="loc">San Juanico</span> Bridge. <span class="loc">Santa Rita</span> is a town known but to a few people of <span class="loc">Samar</span>. However, in a few years, the <span class="loc">San Juanico</span> Bridge will be completed. This multi-million bridge will be a water link between <span class="loc">Tacloban City</span> at one end and <span class="loc">Santa Rita</span> at the other. This link, which is the Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway, formerly known as the Philippine Highway, is envisioned to connect the entire archipelago from horth to south, facilitating travel and communication between <span class="loc">Samar</span> and <span class="loc">Leyte</span> and the <span class="loc">provinces of Luzon and Mindanao</span>. The tiny island between <span class="loc">Samar</span> and <span class="loc">Leyte</span>, known to many people as <span class="loc">Tabucan</span> Island, became the first site of poblacion. Local tradition dates the founding of the town to the early part of the eighteenth century. No historical records however and whatsoever could be found. The early settlers, according to the aged inhabitants, were the tribes of <span class="loc">Agoy</span>, Amistoso, Lacambara clans. Joaquin Amistoso rose to be their leader. <span class="loc">San Juanico Strait</span> was supposed to have been named in his honor. The people made their living by small-scale fishing. In 1800, <span class="loc">Capitan</span> <span class="loc">Bartolome</span> <span class="loc">Sanchez</span>, the head of the Spanish Expedition, was enticed by the people's friendliness and stayed to help the people of the island. He called nearby tribes to unite with them and made Joaquin Amistoso as Cabeza de Barangay. The ruin of the watch tower locally called Barawalti, are mute evidence of Moro raids. A fleet of moro vintas defeated <span class="loc">Capitan</span> <span class="loc">Tiago</span> and men. This fleet was headed by the famous <span class="loc">Sultan Kudarat</span>. Some of the people escaped to the marshy shores of the mainland of <span class="loc">Samar</span>. These refugees founded a barangay called Lalawiton with peril Lacambra as their capitan. The site of Lalawiton is the present site of the poblacion. In 1863, the municipality of <span class="loc">Santa Rita</span> was officially recognized by the Spanish authorities. Before that time it belonged to the Municipality of <span class="loc">Basey</span>, <span class="loc">Santa Rita</span> was reverted to its former status as a barangay of <span class="loc">Basey</span> from 1904 to 1906. Pedro Amistoso was elected as municipal president in the first local election held in 1908. Succeeding him were Mamerto Ilagan, 1910; Alipio Ragarit 1912; Inocencio Hilvano 1916; Florentino Nerviol, 1928; and Margarito Caberic 1932â€“1940. Conrado Adolfo was elected municipal mayor in 1941 but was unable to serve his full-time because of the onset of the Second World War. Florentino Nerviol served as Mayor from 1942 to 1944 and as [PCAU] (Philippine Civil Affairs Unit) mayor to January 6, 1945, and Margarito Caberic succeeded him up to May 31, 1946. Isidro Zeta was appointed mayor until the held in 1947. Succeeding him were Simplicio Lacaba 1948; Pedro Hilvano, acting 1952 and elected in 1956; Gaudencio Espino in 1960; re-elect in 1964 and again Pedro Hilvano elected in 1968 and re-elected in the latest election.</p>
