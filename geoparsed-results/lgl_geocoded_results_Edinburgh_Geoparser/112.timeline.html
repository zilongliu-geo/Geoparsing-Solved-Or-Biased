  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Mound Center set to open in S.C. <span class="date">today</span>. <span class="loc">SOUTH CHARLESTON</span>, <span class="loc">W.Va</span>. -- Photographs of artifacts taken from the Creel Burial Mound in <span class="loc">South Charleston</span> <span class="date">now</span> have a permanent home at the new Mound Interpretive Center next to the LaBelle Theater in <span class="loc">South Charleston</span>. The new center will open to the public at 11 a.m. <span class="date">today</span> after <span class="date">nearly five years</span> of work and research by <span class="loc">South Charleston</span> officials and community leaders. "Joe Mays was on city council and did the ground work to get this going," said <span class="per">Ben Paul</span>, chairman of the center committee. The completion of the center was made possible through a $300,000-plus grant from the <span class="loc">West Virginia Division</span> of Highways, and the city added $80,000. The city-owned building was renovated by the public works department and designed by designminds, which planned and created the interpretive displays in the center. Along with the mound display and Native American artifacts, a portion of the center is devoted to the Midland Trail. <span class="per">Alice Hypes</span>, executive director of the Midland Trail National Scenic Highway, represents the 180 miles of the trail in <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. "We're very excited about the exhibit," she said. "Folks that come into the center can push a button and find out about the whole trail, which is one of the oldest in the country." In fact, <span class="per">Hypes</span> said <span class="loc">George Washington</span> designed the original trail from Virginia Beach, Va., to Cedar Grove in <span class="date">1790</span>. Visitors to the center can discover the interesting points along the trail from <span class="loc">Cabell County</span> to <span class="loc">Bluefield</span> by selecting one of nine buttons that initiates an audio interpretation of a specific area along the trail. In addition to the <span class="per">Mound</span> and <span class="per">Midland</span> Trail sections of the center, there are displays of Blenko Glass and items from Union Carbide when it was in its heyday. The mound portion of the center focuses on the Adena Culture that built the mounds in the area. At one time there were more than 50 earthen mounds built by these Native Americans in our area from <span class="loc">St. Albans</span> to <span class="loc">Kanawha City</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, only three remain. One is located behind Sunset Memorial Park in <span class="loc">South Charleston</span> while another is at <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> Park in Institute. The largest remaining one is the <span class="loc">South Charleston Mound</span>, which is estimated to have been built between 250 and <span class="date">100 B.C.</span> "This is the first time in <span class="date">125 years</span> that people can see what artifacts were discovered in the mound," said Mayor Mullins. "We hope this center provides the public with a good image of the history of our area." <span class="loc">Mullins</span> also said he wants school groups to be a part of the center's programs by visiting and taking part in activities planned for <span class="date">the future</span>. "We want this center to be open to all, from individuals to schools, seniors, church groups and college students," he said. "We hope that anyone who's interested in the history of the area will find the center exciting, enjoyable and educational." A large relief map of the three mounds still in the <span class="loc">Kanawha</span> Valley along with a wall map marked to indicate their location is also audio equipped. The display also shows a half-portion of a mound where visitors to the center can see what the Adena people buried in their mounds. A back hallway of the center is lined with pictures of the artifacts excavated in the 1800s by the <span class="loc">Smithsonian Institution</span>. <span class="per">Darla Spencer</span>, a member of the West <span class="org">Virginia Council for Archaeology</span> as well as the Native American History Council, took the pictures. The photos show necklaces of ocean shells that were made by the Adena people and fish darts, arrowheads, mussel shells, projectile points, stone disks and more. The Adena people were the first in this region to settle down in small villages, cultivate crops, use pottery vessels, acquire exotic raw materials, such as copper and marine shells to make ornaments and jewelry and to bury their honored dead in burial mounds. The period of the Adena's existence is estimated from <span class="date">500 BC</span> to <span class="date">1000 AD</span>. <span class="per">Mary Ann Wade</span> and <span class="per">Gloria Shirkey</span> will be operating the center and be available to answer any questions visitors might have. "At least we hope so," said <span class="per">Wade</span>. "We also have a video or sound library of 13 CDs of historical artifacts of the city of <span class="loc">South Charleston</span> that we can play for visitors too." When the center opens <span class="date">Friday</span>, there will be a group of school children from <span class="loc">South Charleston</span> among the first visitors. "We hope that kids will utilize the center at every opportunity," said Mayor Mullins. "It's the community's place <span class="date">now</span> and we hope folks will visit often." The Mound Interpretive Center is on D Street in <span class="loc">South Charleston</span> and will be open to the public from 10 a.m. to <span class="date">5 p.m. Monday</span> through <span class="date">Friday</span> and from 10 a.m. to <span class="date">4 p.m. Saturday</span>.</p><br><br>
