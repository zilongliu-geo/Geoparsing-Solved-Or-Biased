  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Arlington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">northern Snohomish County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, bordered by the <span class="loc">city of Marysville</span> to the south. The population was 17,926 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Arlington</span> was platted by European Americans in <span class="date">1900</span>, and was named after <span class="per">Lord Henry Arlington</span>, a member of <span class="per">Charles II</span> of <span class="loc">England</span>'s cabinet. <span class="loc">Haller City</span> was a nearby town founded <span class="date">April 24, 1890</span>, by <span class="per">Theodore Haller</span> and his parents <span class="loc">Henrietta</span> and <span class="per">Granville O. Haller</span>.  When <span class="per">Arlington</span> was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">May 5, 1903</span>, it included <span class="loc">Haller City</span>. The city is home to the <span class="loc">Stillaguamish</span> Valley <span class="loc">Pioneer Museum</span>. Prior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by Indigenous Americans, whose descendants identify as the Stillaquamish Tribe. According to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification system, <span class="per">Arlington</span> has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb). From its founding, <span class="per">Arlington</span> was dependent on timber harvesting and timber products. It was once dubbed the "Shingle Capital of the World" owing to the shingle mills, sawmills, and logging camps in the vicinity. Historically, <span class="per">Arlington</span> was a railroad town with several different rail connections. It was located on the Northern Pacific(NP) mainline that stretched from the Canadian border through Sedro-Woolley to <span class="loc">Snohomish</span>. <span class="per">Arlington</span> also had a branch line running east to <span class="loc">Darrington</span> that primarily carried timber products. Both of these lines were abandoned by NP's successor Burlington Northern in <span class="date">the 1980s</span> due to declining industry. While it is not as rail dependent as it once was, <span class="per">Arlington</span> still maintains a rail connection with BNSF Railways via a spur line. Remnants of <span class="per">Arlington</span>'s railroad history can still be seen with the various trestles and signal equipment still in place. <span class="loc">Snohomish County</span> is in the process of converting the abandoned rail right of way into bike/hike trails.</p><br><br>
