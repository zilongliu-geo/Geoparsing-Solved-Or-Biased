<p><span class="loc">Fort Smith</span> (<span class="loc">Chipewyan</span> language: Thebacha "beside the rapids") is a town in the South Slave Region of the <span class="loc">Northwest Territories</span> (NWT), <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is located in the southeastern portion of the <span class="loc">Northwest Territories</span>, on the <span class="loc">Slave River</span> and adjacent to the NWT/Alberta border. <span class="loc">Fort Smith</span> was founded around the <span class="loc">Slave River</span>. It served a vital link for water transportation between southern <span class="loc">Canada</span> and the Western Arctic. Early fur traders found an established portage route from what is now <span class="loc">Fort Fitzgerald</span>, on the western bank of the <span class="loc">Slave River</span> to <span class="loc">Fort Smith</span>. This route allowed its users to navigate the four sets of impassable rapids (Cassette Rapids, <span class="loc">Pelican Rapids</span>, <span class="loc">Mountain Rapids</span>, and Rapids of the Drowned). The portage trail had been traditionally used by local aboriginal people for centuries. The aboriginal population of the region shifted as the fortunes of the tribes changed. By 1870, Cree had occupied the <span class="loc">Slave River</span> Valley. The Slavey had moved north by this time and the <span class="loc">Chipewyan</span> had also begun moving into the area. Peter Pond of the North West Company was the first white trader to travel on the <span class="loc">Slave River</span> and make contact with aboriginal people in this region. He established a post on <span class="loc">Lake Athabasca</span> called <span class="loc">Fort Chipewyan</span> in the 1780s, at the head of the <span class="loc">Slave River</span>.</p>
