  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kelso</span> is a city in southwest <span class="loc">Washington State</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and is the county seat of <span class="loc">Cowlitz County</span>. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 11,925. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Longview</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which has a population of 102,410. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> shares its long western border with <span class="loc">Longview</span>. It is near Mount <span class="loc">St. Helens</span>. The earliest known inhabitants of <span class="loc">Kelso</span> were Native Americans from the Cowlitz tribe. The Cowlitz people were separated into the Upper (or Taidnapam) and Lower (or Mountain) Cowlitz tribes, who were members of the <span class="per">Sahaptin</span> and <span class="per">Salish</span> language families, respectively. In <span class="date">1855</span>, European explorers noted that there numbered over 6000 individuals of the Cowlitz Tribe. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> was founded by <span class="per">Peter W. Crawford</span>, a Scottish surveyor, who, in <span class="date">1847</span>, took up the first donation land claim on the Lower <span class="loc">Cowlitz River</span>. <span class="per">Crawford</span> platted a townsite which he named after his home town of <span class="loc">Kelso</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. The original plat was dated and filed in <span class="date">October 1884</span>. It became incorporated in <span class="date">1889</span>. In its early <span class="date">days</span>, <span class="loc">Kelso</span> obtained the nickname "<span class="loc">Little Chicago</span>" as it became famous for its large number of taverns and brothels that catered to local loggers. On <span class="date">weekends</span>, trainloads of loggers would come into town from the surrounding region looking for women, liquor, gambling and fights. The FBI finally forced the mayor to shut them down in <span class="date">the 1950s</span> with the last closing in the mid-1960s. The economy continues to be based largely on wood products.</p><br><br>
