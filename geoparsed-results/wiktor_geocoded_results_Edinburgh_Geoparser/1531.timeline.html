  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Valencia</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="loc">Santa Clarita</span> in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It is located in the northwestern corner of the <span class="loc">Santa Clarita</span> Valley, generally west of Interstate 5, although <span class="loc">Six Flags Magic Mountain</span>, outside the city limits, is generally considered part of <span class="loc">Valencia</span>. Most of <span class="loc">Valencia</span> is part of a planned community; it was one of the four unincorporated communities (along with <span class="loc">Saugus</span>, <span class="loc">Newhall</span>, and Canyon Country) that merged to create the city of <span class="loc">Santa Clarita</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, in <span class="date">1987</span>. <span class="loc">Valencia</span> is home to the <span class="loc">Six Flags Magic Mountain</span> theme park and the adjacent Six Flags Hurricane Harbor water park. In <span class="date">1769</span>, the Spanish Portola expedition, first Europeans to see inland areas of <span class="loc">California</span>, came up and over the pass from the <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> Valley and camped near the river on <span class="date">August 8</span>–9. They found a large native village there and witnessed a wedding celebration. Fray <span class="per">Juan Crespi</span>, a Franciscan missionary travelling with the expedition, named the river <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> and noted in his diary that the place would be a good location for a mission. On the return trip, however, the party found a less strenuous trail through <span class="loc">Conejo</span> Valley. Later travelers also preferred that route, and Mission San <span class="per">Fernando Rey</span> de España was established down in the valley.</p><br><br>
