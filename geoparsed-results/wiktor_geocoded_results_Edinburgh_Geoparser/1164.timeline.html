  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Kuta</span> is administratively a district (kecamatan) and subdistrict/village (kelurahan) in <span class="loc">southern Bali</span>, <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>. A former fishing village, it was one of the first towns on <span class="loc">Bali</span> to see substantial tourist development, and as a beach resort remains one of <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>'s major tourist destinations. It is known internationally for its long sandy beach, varied accommodation, many restaurants and bars, and many renowned surfers who visit from <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located near Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport. <span class="loc">Kuta</span> was the site of the <span class="date">October 12, 2002</span> 1st Bali bombing (202 killed) and the <span class="date">October 1, 2005</span> 2nd Bali bombing (26 killed). The Balinese Provincial Government have taken the view that the preservation of the Balinese culture, natural resources and wildlife are of primary importance in the development of the island. To this end they have limited tourist development to the peninsula on the extreme southern aspect of the island; Kuta beach is on the western side of this peninsula and <span class="loc">Sanur</span> is on the east. To the north of the peninsula no new tourist development is supposedly permitted..</p><br><br>
