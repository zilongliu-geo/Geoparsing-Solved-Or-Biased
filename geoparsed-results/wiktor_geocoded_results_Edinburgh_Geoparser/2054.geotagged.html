<p><span class="loc">Richland</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Kalamazoo County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 791 at the 2010 census. The village is within Richland Township, about nine miles northeast of <span class="loc">Kalamazoo</span>. <span class="loc">Richland</span> is located in the middle of what was once the Gull Prairie, an upland area relatively free of trees and maintained by natural and man-made fires. The area had a few Pottawatamie villages, one was located on the west side of nearby <span class="loc">Gull Lake</span>. Fish and game were plentiful, and the land was very fertile. Since there were few trees to clear, the prairie was among the first areas of <span class="loc">Kalamazoo County</span> to be settled. By the 1830s, the Native Americans had been moved west, and <span class="loc">Richland</span> was a thriving frontier village. The village even contended with <span class="loc">Prairie Ronde</span> for the county seat, but the centrally-located village of <span class="loc">Bronson</span> (now <span class="loc">Kalamazoo</span>) was ultimately chosen. Lacking a flowing stream that would have provided water power, <span class="loc">Richland</span> never developed significant industry and remained a sleepy farm community until the late twentieth century. In the 1980s and 1990s, small employers such as Richard Allen Medical moved to the edge of town, and <span class="loc">Richland</span> became a bedroom community for <span class="loc">Kalamazoo</span>. The high quality of the local <span class="loc">Gull Lake</span> School District also drew people from surrounding areas. New subdivisions were built in what had been hilly farm country.</p>
