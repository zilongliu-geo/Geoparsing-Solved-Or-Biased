<p>Private plane trip for a loyal employee. AN aircraft fitter celebrated 30 years with Marshall with a flight in the boss's private plane. Brian Wiles was treated to a trip in Michael Marshall's Rallye Minerva to honour his loyal service to the Cambridge engineering firm. The flight, which was piloted by Marshall executive Terry Holloway, also marked the completion of Mr Wiles's one year of training as an aircraft fitter after working for 29 years in the company's vehicle division. Mr Wiles, from <span class="loc">Cherry Hinton</span>, said: "It was a real day to remember and an experience I shall remember for a very long time. It was a wonderfully smooth flight and I enjoyed it enormously. Mr Holloway added: "This was a very special day for Brian and it was a real pleasure to help make it a very memorable one."</p>
