  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Ten infants have died and nearly 6,000 others have been infected in <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> with whooping cough, or pertussis, since <span class="date">the beginning of this year</span>. Health officials are referring to the event as the worst outbreak of the cough in <span class="date">60 years</span>. A spokesman from the <span class="loc">California</span> Department of Public Health, <span class="per">Michael Sicilia</span>, says all of the deaths occurred in infants under <span class="date">three months</span> and that nine of the deaths were found in infants under <span class="date">eight weeks</span> old. This leads to the conclusion that the children were too young to receive the vaccine for the disease. <span class="per">Sicilia</span> indicated that an estimated 50% of children received the disease from parents or caregivers. <span class="date">Earlier in July</span> of <span class="date">this year</span> <span class="loc">California</span> recommended that anyone over <span class="date">seven years</span> old who was not fully vaccinated for Pertussis get a Tdap pertussis booster. Some parents are refusing to have their children vaccinated against the disease and the vaccine has worn off in some adults. <span class="per">Alison Patti</span>, a spokesperson from <span class="org">the Centers for Disease Control</span> and Prevention (CDC), pointed out that the vaccine does not protect individuals indefinitely and health officials are urging that people get the vaccine again if they have not received it within <span class="date">the past five years</span>. According to the CDC, for the first week or two the symptoms of the cough are similar to the common cold; soon after the child begins to "cough violently and rapidly, over and over, until the air is gone from their lungs and they're forced to inhale with a loud 'whooping' sound." Pertussis carries side effects, such as a 20 percent chance of pneumonia and about a one percent chance of convulsions, which makes it very deadly to infants. Doctors and parents often miss the symptoms of whooping cough in infants under <span class="date">six months</span> old due to the absence of the "whooping" sound. <span class="per">Alison Patti</span> said that the "whooping" characteristic is absent in adults which makes them think they don't have pertussis. She recommends that anyone with a persistent cough get tested for the whooping cough.</p><br><br>
