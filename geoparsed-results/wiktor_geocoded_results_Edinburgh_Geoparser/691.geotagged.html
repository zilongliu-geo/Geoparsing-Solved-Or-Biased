<p><span class="loc">Stratford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Fairfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located on <span class="loc">Long Island Sound</span> at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Housatonic River</span>. <span class="loc">Stratford</span> is in the <span class="loc">Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It was founded by Puritans in 1639. The population was 51,384 as of the 2010 census. It has a historical legacy in aviation, the military, and theater. <span class="loc">Stratford</span> is bordered on the west by <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span>, to the north by <span class="loc">Trumbull</span> and <span class="loc">Shelton</span>, and on the east by <span class="loc">Milford</span> (across the <span class="loc">Housatonic River</span>). <span class="loc">Stratford</span> was founded in 1639 as " the plantation at Pequonnocke", by Puritan leader Reverend Adam Blakeman (pronounced <span class="loc">Blackman</span>), William Beardsley, and either 16 families—according to legend—or approximately 35 families—suggested by later research—who had recently arrived in <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> from <span class="loc">England</span> seeking religious freedom. In 1640 the community was known as Cupheag Plantation. By April 13, 1643, the growing town was known as <span class="loc">Stratford</span>, changed to honor <span class="loc">Stratford-upon-Avon</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Stratford</span> is one of many towns in the northeastern American colonies founded as part of the Great Migration in the 1630s when Puritan families fled an increasingly polarized <span class="loc">England</span> in the decade before the civil war between Charles I and Parliament (led by Oliver Cromwell). Some of the <span class="loc">Stratford</span> settlers were from families who had first moved from <span class="loc">England</span> to the <span class="loc">Netherlands</span> to seek religious freedom, like their predecessors on the <span class="loc">Mayflower</span>, and decided to come to the <span class="loc">New World</span> when their children began to adopt the Dutch culture and language.</p>
