  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Gilbert</span> is a city in Saint <span class="loc">Louis County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,799 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. State Highway 37 (MN 37) and State Highway 135 (MN 135) are two of the main routes in <span class="per">Gilbert</span>. <span class="per">Gilbert</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Quad Cities</span> of Virginia, <span class="loc">Eveleth</span>, and <span class="loc">Mountain Iron</span>. <span class="per">Gilbert</span> gets its name from <span class="per">E. J. Gilbert</span>, who led the exploration of the McKinley mine property in the 1890s. <span class="per">Gilbert</span> was platted in <span class="date">1907</span>. A post office has been in operation at <span class="per">Gilbert</span> since <span class="date">1907</span>. <span class="per">Gilbert</span> is home to one of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>â€™s most well known OHV parks. The Iron Range Off-Highway Vehicle State Recreation Area consists of 1,200 acres (5 km2) of land with 36 miles (58 km) of trails. <span class="per">Gilbert</span> is also the location of Lake Ore-be-gone, a former mining pit <span class="date">now</span> used for fishing. It used to be for swimming until recently when the water levels dropped around 10 ft., making it unsafe to swim in. The town of <span class="per">Gilbert</span> was actually moved for the pit. The town was once known as the red light district of the Iron Range, and planned a 'Whorehouse <span class="date">Days</span>' festival for <span class="date">two days</span> in <span class="date">July 2005</span>.[1] However, this festival was cancelled due to objections by the city council.</p><br><br>
