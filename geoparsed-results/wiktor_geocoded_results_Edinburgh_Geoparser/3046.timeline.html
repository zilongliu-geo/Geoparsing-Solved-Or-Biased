  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Plata</span> is a ghost town on the southern end of <span class="loc">Cache County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located in the Bear <span class="loc">River Mountains</span> on a small tributary of the east fork of the <span class="loc">Little Bear River</span>, <span class="loc">La Plata</span> was a short-lived silver mining boomtown in the 1890s. The first ore in the area was discovered in <span class="date">July 1891</span> by a mountain shepherd, who brought a curiously dense rock to show his foreman. The foreman recognized it as silver-bearing galena and took it to be assayed in <span class="loc">Ogden</span>. The sample was 45% lead, with a silver concentration of 400 ounces per ton. The two quietly registered a mining claim, but the secret got out. Several more high-grade ore pockets were found, and a silver rush began. This was the first <span class="per">major Utah</span> mining claim ever found north of <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span>, and many northern Utahns became interested. By <span class="date">August 1891</span> more than 1000 miners had arrived, and the number soon reached <span class="date">1500</span>. Lines of cabins and stores stretched along either side of the creek, forming a town called <span class="loc">La Plata</span> (Spanish for "silver"). There were 60â€“70 buildings in all, including two stores, saloons, a bank, and a post office.</p><br><br>
