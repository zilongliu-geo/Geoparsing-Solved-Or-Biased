<p><span class="loc">Exeter</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Fillmore County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 591 at the 2010 census. In 1870, Dr. Horace Greeley Smith and his wife filed a homestead claim at the site of present-day <span class="loc">Exeter</span>. In an earlier scouting trip, Smith had determined that the site would lie near the line of the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and <span class="loc">Missouri River Railroad</span> as it extended itself westward. In the fall of 1871, the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and <span class="loc">Missouri</span> was completed through <span class="loc">Fillmore County</span>. To promote settlement along its line, the railroad established towns at intervals. Towns were named alphabetically as the railroad ran westward from Lincoln, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. In eastern <span class="loc">Fillmore County</span>, a town was established on land donated by Smith and by James Dolan. One of the families that had settled in the area had come from <span class="loc">Exeter</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, and it was proposed that the town be given that name. It was adopted, as being in keeping with the alphabetical sequence: <span class="loc">Crete</span>, <span class="loc">Dorchester</span>, <span class="loc">Exeter</span>, <span class="loc">Fairmont</span>, <span class="loc">Grafton</span>, <span class="loc">Harvard</span>, <span class="loc">Inland</span>, <span class="loc">Juniata</span>, <span class="loc">Kenesaw</span>, and <span class="loc">Lowell</span>. The railroad advertised the availability of free government land in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, bringing settlers from the eastern <span class="loc">United States</span>, and Czech, German, English, Irish, and Scandinavian immigrants. The town's growth was initially slow, but hastened in the late 1870s. In 1878, two large grain elevators were built and a number of businesses opened; the town's first newspaper, the Enterprise, was established in that year. In 1879, the town was incorporated; by that time, it had sixteen businesses.</p>
