<p>Newton (Welsh: Drenewydd yn Notais) is a village located near the seaside resort town of <span class="loc">Porthcawl</span>, in <span class="loc">Bridgend County</span> Borough, <span class="loc">Wales</span>. Newton village dates from the 12th century and <span class="loc">St John</span> the Baptist Church was founded by the Knights of the Order of <span class="loc">St. John</span> of <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> 800 years ago and originally built as a fortress, still overlooks the village green. The Jolly Sailor pub, the oldest in <span class="loc">Porthcawl</span>, and the Ancient Briton pub also overlook the green. 130 metres to the south of the church lies <span class="loc">St. John</span>'s water well, the water from which is reputed to have healing properties. Newton Beach is a long sandy beach, approximately 3 miles long, stretching from <span class="loc">Newton Point</span> in the east to the mouth of the River Ogmore in the west. The Newton Burrows and <span class="loc">Merthyr Mawr</span> sand dunes back Newton beach, and are a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest. The present warren is what is left of what was once the largest sand dune system in <span class="loc">Europe</span>, stretching along the coast to Mumbles. The dunes form an important habitat for wildlife and plants, and also claim fame to the second highest sand dune in <span class="loc">Europe</span>, locally known as the ‘big dipper’. Some of the filming of Lawrence of <span class="loc">Arabia</span> took place on the dunes.</p>
