<p><span class="loc">Soho</span> is an area of the <span class="loc">City of Westminster</span> and is part of London's <span class="loc">West End</span>. Long established as an entertainment district, for much of the 20th century <span class="loc">Soho</span> had a reputation as a base for the sex industry in addition to its night life and its location for the headquarters of leading film companies. Since the 1980s, the area has undergone considerable gentrification. It is now predominantly a fashionable district of upmarket restaurants and media offices, with only a small remnant of sex industry venues. <span class="loc">Soho</span> is a small, multicultural area of central <span class="loc">London</span>; a home to industry, commerce, culture and entertainment, as well as a residential area for both rich and poor. It has clubs, including the former Chinawhite nightclub; public houses; bars; restaurants; a few sex shops scattered amongst them; and late-night coffee shops that give the streets an "open-all-night" feel at the weekends. Record shops cluster in the area around <span class="loc">Berwick</span> Street, with shops such as Blackmarket Records and Vinyl Junkies. On many weekends, <span class="loc">Soho</span> is busy enough to warrant closing off some of the streets to vehicles. <span class="loc">Westminster City</span> Council pedestrianised parts of <span class="loc">Soho</span> in the mid-1990s, but later removed much of the pedestrianisation, apparently after complaints of loss of trade from local businesses.</p>
