  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Plymouth</span> (/ˈplɪməθ/) is a city on the south coast of <span class="loc">Devon</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, about 37 miles (60 km) south-west of <span class="loc">Exeter</span> and 190 miles (310 km) west-south-west of <span class="loc">London</span>, between the mouths of the rivers Plym to the east and <span class="loc">Tamar</span> to the west where they join <span class="loc">Plymouth Sound</span> to form the boundary with <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>. Plymouth's early history extends to the Bronze Age, when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten. This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of <span class="loc">Sutton</span>, <span class="date">now</span> called <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>. In <span class="date">1620</span>, the Pilgrim Fathers departed <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> for the <span class="loc">New World</span> and established <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span> – the second English settlement in what is <span class="date">now</span> the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>. During the <span class="org">English Civil War</span> the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between <span class="date">1642</span> and <span class="date">1646</span>. Throughout the Industrial Revolution, <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> grew as a commercial shipping port, handling imports and passengers from <span class="loc">the Americas</span>, and exporting local minerals (tin, copper, lime, china clay and arsenic) while the neighbouring town of <span class="loc">Devonport</span> became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In <span class="date">1914</span> three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the <span class="loc">county borough of Plymouth</span>, the <span class="loc">county borough of Devonport</span>, and the urban <span class="loc">district of East Stonehouse</span> were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> which, in <span class="date">1928</span>, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during World War II, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of <span class="loc">Plympton</span> and <span class="loc">Plymstock</span> along with other outlying suburbs in <span class="date">1967</span>.</p><br><br>
