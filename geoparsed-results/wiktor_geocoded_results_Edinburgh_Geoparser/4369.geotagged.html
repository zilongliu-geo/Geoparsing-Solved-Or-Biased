<p>Scranton is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Tooele County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located in <span class="loc">Barlow Canyon</span> near the <span class="loc">Juab County</span> line, it was a short-lived mining town. Scranton has been uninhabited for nearly a century, but some of its ruins have survived relatively intact. Scranton was founded in 1908 around the New Bullion Mine, a lead and zinc mine. It was part of the <span class="loc">North Tintic Mining District</span>, organized in 1902 for the area's silver, lead, and zinc mines. The new town became the home of the Scranton Mining and Smelting Company, the owners naming it after <span class="loc">Scranton</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, their home town. Some 90 miners lived in Scranton, a few with families. The town included homes, a boarding house, general store/post office, and assay office. The large pocket of good ore at the New Bullion lasted only about two years, and the town began to dwindle. Then in October 1914 a new company called the <span class="loc">South Scranton</span> was organized, and miners dug a long tunnel in search of other mineral resources. During World War I Scranton produced tungsten, sending it by insured parcel post due to its scarcity. After the war the town quickly emptied.</p>
