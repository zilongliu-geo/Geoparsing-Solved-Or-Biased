<p><span class="loc">Imi</span> (also transliterated as Imay and Hinna) is a town in the Somali Region of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. It is currently divided to two separate towns. <span class="loc">East Imi</span> located in Imiberi woreda of the Gode Zone and <span class="loc">West Imi</span> located in Mirab Imi woreda of the Afder Zone. The <span class="loc">Shebelle</span> River runs between these towns. It's located at latitude and longitude 6°28′N 42°10′E with an elevation of 442 meters above sea level. The Central Statistical Agency has not published an estimate for this village's 2005 population. <span class="loc">Imi</span> hosts an airport (ICAO code <span class="loc">HAIM</span>) which consists of an unpaved airstrip about 1050 meters in length, possibly the shortest in an Ethiopian civil airport. Probably the earliest European explorer to visit <span class="loc">Imi</span> was Arthur Rimbaud, who was working at the time as a commercial agent in <span class="loc">Harar</span> for the firm of Mazeran, Vinnay and Barday. In a report of his expeditions into the "Ogadine" (or <span class="loc">Ogaden</span>), dated 10 December 1883, Rimbaud proposed setting up a trading post at <span class="loc">Imi</span>, "a large, permanent village situated on the Ogadine bank of the river, eight days from <span class="loc">Harar</span> by caravan."</p>
