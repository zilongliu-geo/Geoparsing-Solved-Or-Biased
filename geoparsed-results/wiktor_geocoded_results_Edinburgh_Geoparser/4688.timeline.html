  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Alberton</span> is a locality in the City of <span class="loc">Gold Coast</span> in <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. According to the <span class="date">2011</span> census it had a population of 576. It is bounded in the north by the <span class="loc">Logan River</span> and in the west by its tributary, the <span class="loc">Albert River</span>. The Aboriginal name for the area was Wobbomerijee (where Wobum means mud and Mudtheri means sticky). European settlement began in <span class="date">1863</span> when the first settlers arrived, mostly German immigrants. A town reserve was established in <span class="date">1865</span> on the souther bank near the junction of the <span class="per">Logan</span> and <span class="per">Albert</span> Rivers. In <span class="date">1869</span>, the first Lutheran church was established near the Lutheran cemetery on Zipfs Road. The area was known as <span class="loc">Elkana</span> (meaning "God has created and blessed"). Later the area was called <span class="loc">Alberton</span> after <span class="per">Prince Albert</span>, consort to <span class="per">Queen Victoria</span>, but the name <span class="loc">Elkana</span> is preserved in Elkana Road. In <span class="date">1870</span>, a ferry service across the river was introduced with the first bridge being built in <span class="date">1876</span> at <span class="loc">Yatala</span>. A German school was established early in the 1870s beside the church. The <span class="org">Alberton Provisional School</span> opened on <span class="date">13 May 1876</span> with children attending German school on only <span class="date">one day</span> <span class="date">a week</span>. On <span class="date">13 October 1884</span> the provisional school became the <span class="org">Alberton State School</span>. In <span class="date">1886</span>, a new larger Lutheran church (the present St Peter's at 187 Alberton Road) was built. It was consecrated in <span class="date">1887</span> by <span class="per">Rev Hellmuth</span>.</p><br><br>
