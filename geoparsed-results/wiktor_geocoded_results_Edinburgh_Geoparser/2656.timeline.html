  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ontario</span> is the largest city in <span class="loc">Malheur County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies along the <span class="loc">Snake River</span> at the <span class="loc">Idaho</span> border. The population was 11,366 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city is the largest community in the region of far eastern <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, also known as the Western Treasure Valley. <span class="loc">Ontario</span> is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, OR-ID <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which includes <span class="loc">Malheur County</span> in <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and <span class="loc">Payette County</span> in <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. <span class="loc">Ontario</span> is approximately halfway between <span class="loc">Portland</span> and <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span>. It is the closest city to the <span class="loc">Idaho</span> border along Interstate 84. The city's slogan is "Where <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Begins". <span class="loc">Ontario</span> was founded on <span class="date">June 11, 1883</span>, by developers <span class="per">William Morfitt</span>, <span class="per">Mary Richardson</span>, <span class="per">Daniel Smith</span>, and James Virtue. In <span class="date">March 1884</span>, <span class="per">Richard Welch</span> started a post office for the quarter of <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, so named by James Virtue after <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. <span class="date">Two months later</span> <span class="per">Joseph Morton</span> applied for a <span class="per">Morton</span> post office at an island about one mile south of town, with <span class="per">Oscar Scott</span> as postmaster. Unfortunately for <span class="per">Morton</span> and <span class="per">Scott</span>, merchants <span class="per">Morfitt</span> and <span class="per">Richardson</span> of <span class="loc">Malheur City</span>, gold miner Virtue, and lumberman <span class="org">Smith of Baker City</span> acquired more land and were better financed. More importantly, <span class="per">Morfitt</span> had negotiated a train depot for <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. All the settlers and speculators knew the railroad was coming and how important that would be to <span class="loc">Ontario</span>'s future so <span class="per">Scott</span> closed his <span class="per">Morton</span> post office and built a hotel at present-day <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. By <span class="date">December</span>, <span class="per">Scott</span> was <span class="loc">Ontario</span>'s postmaster.</p><br><br>
