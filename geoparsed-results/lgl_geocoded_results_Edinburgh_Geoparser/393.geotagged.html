<p><span class="loc">Shiloh</span> ponders change, Part III. <span class="loc">HUME</span> – Principal Mark Hettmansberger has concerns about Shiloh’s relationship with the Kansas Treatment and Learning Center (TLC) of the Eastern Illinois Area of Special Education. Hettmansberger advised board members that sending <span class="loc">Shiloh</span> students to TLC is expensive, yet there seems to be little in the way of positive results. <span class="loc">Shiloh</span> currently has four students attending the facility for youths with severe behavioral problems at a cost of $15,000 per student. “In the three years that I have been here, we haven’t had one student graduate from TLC,” said Hettmansberger. The principal stressed the failure of students to stay at TLC has an adverse impact on Shiloh’s graduation rate.</p>
