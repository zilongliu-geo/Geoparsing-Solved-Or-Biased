  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Vallecito</span>, in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> is an oasis of cienegas and salt grass along <span class="loc">Vallecito Creek</span> and a former settlement on the edge of the <span class="loc">Colorado Desert</span> in the <span class="loc">Vallecito Valley</span>. <span class="loc">Vallecito</span> its Spanish name is translated as "little valley". <span class="loc">Vallecito</span> was located at the apex of the gap in the <span class="loc">Carrizo Badlands</span> created by <span class="loc">Carrizo Creek</span> and its wash in its lower reach, to which <span class="loc">Vallecito Creek</span> is a tributary. The springs of <span class="loc">Vallecito</span> like many in the vicinity are a product of the faults that run along the base of the Peninsular Ranges to the west. Once a seasonal village of the native Kumeyaay people, on a trail across the desert from the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span>, this oasis, became a crucial stopping place for Spanish and then Mexican travelers to recover from the desert crossing between <span class="loc">Sonora</span> and <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> to <span class="loc">California</span>. Later it also served the same function for American soldiers, 49ers and their herds of animals being driven to the goldfeilds on the Southern Emigrant Trail. The non native settlement of the site began in <span class="date">1850</span>, as a camp with a one room sod warehouse as the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Army Depot Vallecito for the supply of Fort Yuma. It was later increased in size and became a store, a stage station, and a ranch house. Eventually reduced to ruins, the Station house was restored in <span class="date">1934</span> and is <span class="date">now</span> the site of a <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span> Park.</p><br><br>
