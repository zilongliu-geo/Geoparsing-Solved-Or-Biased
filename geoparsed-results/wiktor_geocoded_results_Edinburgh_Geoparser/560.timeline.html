  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Montana (Bulgarian: Монтана) is a city in northwestern <span class="loc">Bulgaria</span>, located 50 kilometres (31 miles) south of the Danube river, 40 kilometres (25 miles) northwest of <span class="loc">Vratsa</span> and 30 kilometres (19 miles) east of the Serbian border. It is the administrative centre of the homonymous <span class="loc">Montana Province</span>. When the town was first settled by Slavs it was known as <span class="loc">Kutlovitsa</span>; later in Ottoman Turkish as Kutlofça. The town was renamed <span class="loc">Ferdinand</span> in <span class="date">1890</span>, receiving the benevolence of Bulgarian Knyaz Ferdinand and a city status. On <span class="date">1 March 1945</span>, by a decree of the government, the communist authorities changed the town's name to Mihaylovgrad after the red party activist Hristo Mihaylov (died <span class="date">1944</span>), a leader of the <span class="date">1923</span> <span class="date">September</span> Uprising in the region. In <span class="date">1993</span>, after a presidential decree, the town received the name Montana, inspired by the name of the nearby Roman settlement, from Latin mons, "mountain". Montana is situated on the river <span class="loc">Ogosta</span>, north of <span class="loc">Stara Planina</span>, surrounded on the south and east by uplands. The climate is temperate continental, with a cold <span class="date">winter</span> and hot <span class="date">summer</span>. The average temperature is 1 °C (34 °F) in <span class="date">January</span> and 25 °C (77 °F) in <span class="date">July</span>. In the last 15–<span class="date">20 years</span>, temperatures reaching up to 35 to 40 °C (95 to 104 °F) in the <span class="date">summer</span> are not uncommon.</p><br><br>
