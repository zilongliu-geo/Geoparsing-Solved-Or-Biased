<p><span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span>, known locally as P.G., is the capital and largest town of <span class="loc">Toledo District</span> in southern <span class="loc">Belize</span>. <span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span> is the southernmost sizable town in the nation, with a population of about 5,000 people. Although the town bears a Spanish name, its inhabitants are mostly Kriol/English-speaking, and are primarily of Garifuna, East Indian, Kriol, and Maya descent. St. Peter Claver Catholic parish, with a large elementary school, serves the predominantly Catholic population of the town. <span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span> is a seaport and fishing town on the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span>. It was a small fishing village before it was settled by a number of Garifuna emigrants from <span class="loc">Honduras</span> in 1823. The Garifuna refer to the town as Peini. The town is about fifteen feet above sea level. <span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span> is the main point of transportation for people visiting the <span class="loc">Toledo district</span> and the offshore southern cayes. There is a small airport which serves domestic flights from Maya Island Air and Tropic Air. James Bus Line is based in <span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span> and offers a regular service to points north such as Independence, <span class="loc">Dangriga</span>, <span class="loc">Belmopan</span>, and <span class="loc">Belize City</span>. Water taxis offer daily crossings to <span class="loc">Puerto Barrios</span> and twice weekly service to <span class="loc">Livingston</span> in <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>. Unlike the purpose-built water taxis plying the routes between <span class="loc">Belize city</span> and the northern cays, the services from <span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span> are provided by small, open boats.</p>
