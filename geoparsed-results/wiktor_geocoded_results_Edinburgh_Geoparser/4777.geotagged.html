<p>Tune is a former municipality in Østfold county, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. The former municipality originally covered the current Sarpsborg municipality with the exception of <span class="loc">Skjeberg</span> and with the addition of Rolvsøy. The <span class="loc">parish of Tune</span> was established as a municipality January 1, 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The <span class="loc">city of Sarpsborg</span> was grounded and separated from Tune to constitute a separate administrative unit in 1839. The rural <span class="loc">district of Varteig</span> was separated from Tune in 1861, and the same thing happened with Rolvsøy on 1 January 1911, leaving Tune with a population of 8,040. Despite the separations Tune witnessed steady growth over the years. Starting in 1884, a series of border adjustments which moved territory from Tune to <span class="loc">Sarpsborg</span> took place. Following the moving of an uninhabited part of Tune to <span class="loc">Sarpsborg</span> in 1884, parts with 696, 1,008, 66 and 10 inhabitants were moved to <span class="loc">Sarpsborg</span> in 1912, 1925, 1957 and 1980 respectively. On 1 January 1992 the rest of Tune, along with <span class="loc">Skjeberg</span> and <span class="loc">Varteig</span> municipalities, was incorporated into <span class="loc">Sarpsborg</span>. Prior to the merger Tune had a population of 15,143, and consisted of the parishes Tune and Greåker.</p>
