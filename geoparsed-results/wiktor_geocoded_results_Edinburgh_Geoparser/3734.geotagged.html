It is located on the west side of the Canadian National Railway right of way close to the Belvedere LRT station. The neighbourhood is triangle shaped with the railway right of way along the south east side, 137 Avenue on the north, and 66 Avenue on the west. Fort Road cuts through the neighbourhood close to the south east boundary. The neighbourhood is surrounded by a mixture of residential neighbourhoods and industrial and commercial neighbourhoods. Residential neighbourhoods are <span class="loc">York</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Clareview</span> <span class="loc">Town Centre</span> to the northeast, Balwin and Delwood to the west, and <span class="loc">Kildare</span> to the northwest.
