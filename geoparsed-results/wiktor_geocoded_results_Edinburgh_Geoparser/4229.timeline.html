  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bangor</span> (/ˈbæŋɡɔːr/ BANG-gor) is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Maine</span>. The city proper has a population of 33,039, while the metropolitan <span class="loc">Bangor metropolitan</span> area has a population of 153,746. Modern <span class="loc">Bangor</span> was established in the mid-1800s with the lumber and shipbuilding industries. Lying on the <span class="loc">Penobscot River</span>, logs could be floated downstream from the <span class="loc">Maine</span> <span class="loc">North Woods</span> and processed at the city's water-powered sawmills, then shipped from <span class="loc">Bangor</span>'s port to the Atlantic ocean 30 miles downstream, and from there to any port in the world. <span class="org">Evidence</span> of this is still visible in the lumber barons' elaborate Greek Revival and Victorian mansions and the 31 foot high statue of <span class="per">Paul Bunyan</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Bangor</span>'s economy is based on services and retail, healthcare, and education. Founded as Condeskeag Plantation, <span class="loc">Bangor</span> was incorporated as a <span class="loc">New England</span> town in <span class="date">1791</span>. There are more than 20 communities worldwide named <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, of which 15 are in the <span class="loc">United States</span> and named after <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>. The reason for the choice of name is disputed but it was likely to be either from the eponymous Welsh hymn or from either of two towns of that name in <span class="loc">Wales</span> and <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>. The final syllable is pronounced gor, not ger. In <span class="date">2015</span>, local public officials, journalists, doctors, policemen, photographers, restaurateurs, TV personalities and Grammy-winning composers came together to record the YouTube video How To Say <span class="loc">Bangor</span>.</p><br><br>
