  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Madison</span> is the capital of the State of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Dane County</span>. As of <span class="date">July 1, 2013</span>, <span class="per">Madison</span> had an estimated population of 243,344, making it the second largest city in <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, after <span class="loc">Milwaukee</span>, and the 83rd largest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city forms the core of the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau's <span class="loc">Madison Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which includes all of <span class="loc">Dane County</span> and neighboring <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">Green</span>, and <span class="loc">Columbia</span> counties. The <span class="loc">Madison Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area had a <span class="date">2010</span> population of 568,593. <span class="per">Madison</span>'s origins begin in <span class="date">1829</span>, when former federal judge <span class="per">James Duane Doty</span> purchased over a thousand acres (4 kmÂ²) of swamp and forest land on the isthmus between Lakes <span class="per">Mendota</span> and <span class="per">Monona</span>, with the intention of building a city in the <span class="loc">Four Lakes</span> region. When the <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> Territory was created in <span class="date">1836</span> the territorial legislature convened in <span class="loc">Belmont</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. One of the legislature's tasks was to select a permanent location for the territory's capital. Doty lobbied aggressively for <span class="per">Madison</span> as the new capital, offering buffalo robes to the freezing legislators and promising choice <span class="per">Madison</span> lots at discount prices to undecided voters. He had <span class="per">James Slaughter</span> plat two cities in the area, <span class="per">Madison</span> and "The City of <span class="loc">Four Lakes</span>", near present-day <span class="loc">Middleton</span>. Doty named the city <span class="per">Madison</span> for <span class="per">James Madison</span>, the fourth President of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> who had died on <span class="date">June 28, 1836</span> and he named the streets for the other 39 signers of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Constitution. Although the city existed only on paper, the territorial legislature voted on <span class="date">November 28</span> in favor of <span class="per">Madison</span> as its capital, largely because of its location halfway between the new and growing cities around <span class="loc">Milwaukee</span> in the east and the long established strategic post of Prairie du <span class="loc">Chien</span> in the west, and between the highly populated lead mining regions in the southwest and <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>'s oldest city, <span class="loc">Green Bay</span> in the northeast. Being named for the much-admired founding father <span class="per">James Madison</span>, who had just died, and having streets named for each of the 39 signers of the Constitution, may have also helped attract votes.</p><br><br>
