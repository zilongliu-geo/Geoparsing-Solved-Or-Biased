  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Macau</span> (/məˈkaʊ/; 澳門; 澳门; "Bay gate"), also spelled <span class="loc">Macao</span>, officially known as the <span class="org">Macao Special Administrative Region</span> of the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, is a special administrative region on the southern coast of the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. <span class="loc">Macau</span> lies on the western side of the Pearl River Delta across from <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span>, which is about 64 kilometers to the east, and it is also bordered by Guangdong of Mainland <span class="loc">China</span> to the north and the <span class="loc">South China Sea</span> to the east and south. With an estimated population of around 636,200 living in an area of 30.3 km2 (11.6 sq mi), it is the most densely populated region in the world. As Portuguese <span class="loc">Macau</span>, it was administered by the Portuguese Empire and its inheritor states from the mid-16th century until <span class="date">late 1999</span>, when it was the last remaining European colony in <span class="loc">Asia</span> under <span class="loc">Portugal</span>. Portuguese traders first settled in <span class="loc">Macau</span> in the 1550s. In <span class="date">1557</span>, <span class="loc">Macau</span> was rented to <span class="loc">Portugal</span> from <span class="loc">Ming</span> <span class="loc">China</span> as a trading port. The Portuguese Empire administered the city under Chinese authority and sovereignty until <span class="date">1887</span>, when <span class="loc">Macau</span> became a colony. Sovereignty over <span class="loc">Macau</span> was transferred to <span class="loc">China</span> on <span class="date">20 December 1999</span>. The Joint Declaration on the Question of <span class="loc">Macau</span> and <span class="loc">Macau Basic Law</span> stipulate that <span class="loc">Macau</span> operate with a high degree of autonomy until at least <span class="date">2049</span>, <span class="date">fifty years</span> after the transfer.</p><br><br>
