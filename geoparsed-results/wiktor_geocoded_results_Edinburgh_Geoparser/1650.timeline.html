  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The <span class="loc">Central Province</span> (Sinhalese: මධ්‍යම පළාත Madhyama Palata, <span class="loc">Tamil</span>: மத்திய மாகாணம் Malaiyakam Maakaanam) is one of the nine provinces of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>, the first level administrative division of the country. (The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until <span class="date">1987</span> when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> established provincial councils.) The <span class="loc">Central Province</span> is primarily in the central mountainous terrain of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>. It is the 6th largest province by area and is home to 2.5 million people. It is bordered by <span class="loc">North Central Province</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Uva Province</span> to the east, <span class="loc">North Western Province</span> to the west and <span class="loc">Sabaragamuwa Province</span> to the south and west. The province's capital is <span class="loc">Kandy</span>. The <span class="loc">cities of Matale</span> and <span class="loc">Nuwara Eliya</span> are in the <span class="loc">Central Province</span>. The province is famous for its production <span class="loc">Ceylon</span> tea, planted by the British in the 1860s after a devastating disease killed all the coffee plantations in the province. The <span class="loc">Central Province</span> attracts many tourists, with hill station towns such as <span class="loc">Gampola</span>, <span class="loc">Hatton</span> and <span class="loc">Nuwara Eliya</span>.</p><br><br>
