  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Bedford</span> is a city located in the <span class="loc">Montérégie region</span> of <span class="loc">southern Quebec</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The population as of the <span class="loc">Canada</span> <span class="date">2011</span> Census was 2,684. This small community is just an hour's drive from larger cities such as <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and <span class="loc">Montreal</span>, and is the home to southern <span class="loc">Quebec</span>'s largest boy scout troop. The name "<span class="per">Bedford</span>" could have been given by Loyalists who knew of several <span class="loc">Bedfords</span> back in the former American colonies. The name could also have been a tribute to Lord <span class="per">John Russell</span>, who was the fourth <span class="per">Duke of Bedford</span> (<span class="date">1710</span>–<span class="date">1771</span>), an English politician and Secretary of State (<span class="date">1748</span>–<span class="date">1751</span>), and governor general of <span class="loc">Ireland</span> from <span class="date">1756</span> to <span class="date">1761</span>. <span class="per">Bedford</span> is part of Brome-Missisquoi <span class="loc">Regional County</span> Municipality, in the administrative region of Montérégie. The town, located 86 kilometres (53 mi) southeast of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>, is completely enclaved within the township of <span class="per">Bedford</span>. Seated in the Saint-Lawrence lowlands, at the beginning of the steep leading to the Appalachian Mountains, the <span class="loc">Pike River</span> (Rivière aux Brochets) flows through the middle of the town, separating it into south and north parts.</p><br><br>
