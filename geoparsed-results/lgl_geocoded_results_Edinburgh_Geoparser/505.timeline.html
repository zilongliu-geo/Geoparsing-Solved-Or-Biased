  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Family, friends mourn four children killed in fire. ST. PARIS â€” <span class="per">Scott Randall</span> threw up and cried when he saw the mobile home ravaged by a fire that killed four children. "The whole house was gone, especially the living room," he said. "It looked like an explosion blew out the wall." <span class="per">Nathan Skaggs</span>, 2; <span class="per">Patrick Snelling</span>, 8; <span class="per">Breonna</span> <span class="per">Snelling</span>, 10; and <span class="per">Cassandra Karg</span>, 10, died in a fire at <span class="date">2:46 a.m. Saturday, March 21</span>, at 11690 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 36, Lot No. 15, in the St. Paris Court West mobile home park, just west of St. Paris, according to the <span class="org">Champaign County Sheriff's Office</span>. <span class="per">Phillip Skaggs Jr.</span>, 33; <span class="per">Christina Gregg</span>, 33; and <span class="per">Natalia Skaggs</span>, 8-<span class="date">months</span>, escaped. They were treated at Mercy Memorial Hospital in <span class="loc">Urbana</span> and released, according to a sheriff's office news release. The relationship between the children and the adults was not described, although <span class="per">Randall</span> said <span class="per">Karg</span> lived down the street and was visiting for the night. <span class="per">Randall</span> lives at Lot No. 5 and has known the family for <span class="date">about six years</span>. The family moved into the mobile home <span class="date">a few months ago</span> and the children are good friends with <span class="per">Randall</span>'s son. "I still don't know how to break it to my son," <span class="per">Randall</span> said. Brandyberry stopped by their home <span class="date">Friday night</span>, ate some cookies and talked with them. They were supposed to meet up again this morning at <span class="loc">Kiser Lake</span> to fish. <span class="per">Breonna</span> <span class="per">Snelling</span> did well in school and <span class="per">Patrick Snelling</span> loved sports, he said. "They are good kids ... They are the cutest little things," he said. Brandyberry visited <span class="per">Gregg</span> at Mercy Memorial Hospital on <span class="date">Saturday morning</span>. "Those kids were her life. They would go without for their kids ... She is so scared she can't even hold her own little baby," he said. The mobile home had electrical problems, shocking people who touched parts of it, <span class="per">Randall</span> said. The cause of the fire remains undetermined, said <span class="per">Shane Cartmill</span>, public information officer for the <span class="org">Division of the State Fire Marshal</span>. An electrical engineer will examine the mobile home for additional testing on <span class="date">Monday</span>, <span class="per">Cartmill</span> said. "We have not ruled out electrical as a possible cause," he said. <span class="per">Tabitha Roderick</span>, 15, was sleeping across the street at her grandmother's home at Lot No. 51 when the fire started. "My grandmother came in and woke me up," she said. "I came out and all I could really see was smoke and flames and the fire trucks. It looked like it was really bad." She had played with the children a few hours before the fire. The boys played football, and <span class="per">Roderick</span> and <span class="per">Breonna</span> <span class="per">Snelling</span> made rhymes. Tammy Danner lives at Lot No. 7 and found out about the fire from a phone call at 4 a.m. She often saw the children riding their bikes or playing outside while waiting for the school bus in the morning. "It's awful, this is terrible," <span class="loc">Danner</span> said. "I can't even imagine it being one of my boyfriend's kids ... It could have been any one of these trailers."</p><br><br>
