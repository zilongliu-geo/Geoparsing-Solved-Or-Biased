(AP) &#x97; Police in <span class="loc">Sevierville</span> say an <span class="loc">Ohio</span> man has died after being found floating in a <span class="loc">Smoky Mountains</span> resort swimming pool. A spokesman for the <span class="loc">city of Sevierville</span> said 65-year-old <span class="per">Ronald Drocy</span> of <span class="loc">Swanton</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, had been playing in the pool at <span class="loc">Wyndham</span> <span class="loc">Smoky Mountains</span> with his granddaughter. He was found floating about <span class="date">9:30 p.m. Saturday</span> and was pronounced dead at Fort Sanders Medical Center in nearby <span class="loc">Knoxville</span>.
