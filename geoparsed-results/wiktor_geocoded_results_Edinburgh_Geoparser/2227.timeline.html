The population was 788 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is located along a bend of the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>, across from <span class="loc">Barnet</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. It was originally chartered as part of <span class="per">Lyman</span>. In <span class="date">1762</span> Colonial Governor <span class="per">John Wentworth</span> issued a grant ("Number 11") to 64 persons obligated to clear, farm and settle one tenth of each of their parcels or forfeit the grant. Only two made the attempt but the charter was extended, in <span class="date">1769</span>, for another <span class="date">five years</span>. Eleven of the original 64 grantees were named <span class="per">Lyman</span>. In that same year, <span class="per">Wentworth</span> also granted to one <span class="per">Colonel John Hurd</span> (of <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> part of the land which is <span class="date">today</span> within the bounds of <span class="loc">Monroe</span>. The grant was named <span class="per">Hurd</span>'s Location and included five small islands in the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>, known as "<span class="loc">Deer Islands</span>," and a parcel of land from below the present Village Bridge to the foot of Fifteen Mile Falls. In addition to <span class="per">Hurd</span>'s Location, and the governor's 500 acres (2.0 km2), there were 23 lots of the 64 portions of <span class="per">Lyman</span> located in "<span class="per">West Lyman</span>," or the "<span class="loc">Lyman</span> Plain," <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Monroe</span>, making up less than 7,500 acres (30 km2) of the present area. A portion of Bath, to the south, was annexed in <span class="date">1897</span>.</p><br><br>
