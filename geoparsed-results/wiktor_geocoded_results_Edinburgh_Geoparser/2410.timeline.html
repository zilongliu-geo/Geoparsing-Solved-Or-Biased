  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Jefferson is a city in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Salem Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 3,098 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is home to the annual Mint Harvest Festival and is the self-proclaimed "Mint Capital of the World" as well as "<span class="org">Frog</span> <span class="org">Jumping Capital</span> of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>." The first name for this locality was <span class="per">Conser</span>'s Ferry, for <span class="per">Jacob S. Conser</span>, an <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trail pioneer of <span class="date">1848</span> who ran a ferry across the <span class="loc">Santiam River</span>. <span class="per">Conser</span> was also involved in the communities of <span class="loc">Syracuse</span> and <span class="loc">Santiam City</span>, which was about 2 miles (3 km) downstream of Jefferson. He established the ferry in <span class="date">1851</span>, and also served as the postmaster of <span class="loc">Santiam City</span>. When the <span class="org">Jefferson Institute</span> was established in the vicinity (not the same as the <span class="org">Jefferson Institute</span> in <span class="loc">Polk County</span>), the name Jefferson was eventually adopted by the community. Jefferson post office was established in <span class="date">1861</span>, with a name change from <span class="loc">Syracuse</span>, and previously, <span class="loc">Santiam City</span>. The <span class="date">1854</span> <span class="org">Jacob Conser House</span>, which is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>, currently serves as the city's library. The current <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 164 bridge across the <span class="loc">Santiam</span> was designed by <span class="per">Conde McCullough</span> and named in <span class="per">Conser</span>'s honor.</p><br><br>
