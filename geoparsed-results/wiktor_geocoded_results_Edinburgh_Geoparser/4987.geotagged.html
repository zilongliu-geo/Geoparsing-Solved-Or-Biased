<p><span class="loc">Mason County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 27,324. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span>. The county was founded in 1804 and was named for George Mason, delegate to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Constitutional Convention. Before the Civil War, the county was located in the State of Virginia. <span class="loc">Mason County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span>, WV-OH Micropolitan Statistical Area. In the second half of 1749, the French explorer, Pierre Joseph Céloron de <span class="loc">Blainville</span>, claimed French sovereignty over the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> Valley, burying a lead plaque at the meeting point of the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Kanawha Rivers</span>, naming the place <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span>. In the Battle of <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span> (October 10, 1774), fought on the future site of the town, over one thousand Virginia militiamen, led by Colonel <span class="loc">Andrew Lewis</span> (1720–1781), defeated a roughly equal force of an Algonquin confederation of <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> and <span class="loc">Mingo</span> warriors led by <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> Chief Cornstalk (ca. 1720-1777). The event is celebrated locally as the "First Battle of the American Revolutionary War" and in 1908 the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senate authorized erection of a local monument to commemorate it as such. Most historians, however, regard it not as a battle of the Revolution (1775–1783), but as a part of Lord Dunmore's War (1774). "Camp <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span>" was established by Col. Lewis at the time of the Battle and the settlement that followed also took that name. Although not certain, <span class="loc">Point Pleasant</span> may have been permanently settled by whites as early as 1774.</p>
