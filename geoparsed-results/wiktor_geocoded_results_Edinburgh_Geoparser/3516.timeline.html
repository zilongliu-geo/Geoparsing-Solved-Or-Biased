  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1686</span>. The population was 17,456 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is home to <span class="org">Greenfield Community College</span>, the <span class="org">Pioneer</span> Valley Symphony Orchestra, and the <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> Fair. The city has a Main Street Historic District containing fine examples of Federal, Greek Revival, and Victorian architecture. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area. Pocumtuck Indians first settled and originally inhabited the <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> area. Native American artifacts found in the area have been dated between 7,000 to <span class="date">9,000 years</span> BCE. The Pocumtucks planted field crops and fished local rivers but were wiped out by the Mohawks in <span class="date">1664</span>. Thereafter, the newly unoccupied area—being the eastern terminus of the Mohawk Trail, a principal route for Native American trade traveling west into New York—was colonized as part of <span class="loc">Deerfield</span> by the English in <span class="date">1686</span>. In <span class="date">1753</span>, <span class="loc">Greenfield</span>, named for the <span class="loc">Green River</span>, was incorporated as a separate town from <span class="loc">Deerfield</span>. In <span class="date">1795</span> the <span class="loc">South Hadley Canal</span> opened, enabling boats to bypass the <span class="loc">South Hadley</span> falls and reach <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> via the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>. Located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Deerfield</span> and Green rivers, and not far from where they merge into the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>, <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> developed into a trade center. Falls provided water power for industry, and <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> grew into a prosperous mill town. <span class="per">John Russell</span> established the <span class="loc">Green River</span> Works in <span class="date">1834</span>, hiring skilled German workers at what was the country's first cutlery factory. The <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> Railroad was the first of several railways to enter the town, replacing the former canal trade. During the 19th and 20th <span class="date">centuries</span>, <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> was one of the most important American centers of the tap and die business and was the home of <span class="org">Greenfield Tap &amp; Die Company</span> (GTD).</p><br><br>
