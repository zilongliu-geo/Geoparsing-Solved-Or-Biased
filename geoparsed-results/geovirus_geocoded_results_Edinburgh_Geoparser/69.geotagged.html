<p>A cow in the province <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, has tested positive for Mad Cow disease, said Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials on Monday. Officials also stated that the six-year-old cross-bred cow did not make it into the human or animal feed chain. "Last evening the...laboratory for BSE located in <span class="loc">Winnipeg</span> confirmed the presence of BSE in a cross-bred cow born and raised in <span class="loc">Alberta</span>," said CFIA chief veterinarian Brian Evans. "The animal was detected on the farm where it was born and no part of this animal entered the food for human consumption or feed for animal consumption purposes." It is the fourth case to turn up in <span class="loc">Canada</span> since 2003. Evans also stated that it is too early to tell whether or not export markets would ban Canadian cows and beef. The <span class="loc">United States</span> has seen two cases of Mad Cow disease. The first was discovered in December of 2003 in the state of <span class="loc">Washington</span>. Officials later linked this case to <span class="loc">Canada</span> because the cow was born on a farm in <span class="loc">Alberta</span>. The second infected cow was discovered in <span class="loc">Texas</span> in 2005. The later case was diagnosed in <span class="loc">England</span> after earlier samples tested had shown conflicting results.</p>
