<p><span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> is a hamlet located in the towns of <span class="loc">Pittstown</span> and <span class="loc">Schaghticoke</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. It was named for its settler, William Johnson. <span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> is considered a "railroad town" due to the importance of the railroad in the history of the area; however, it was an important industrial area even before the coming of railroad. Due to its close proximity to the <span class="loc">Hoosic</span> River, the largest estuary of the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>, many factories sprung up along the river banks: flour, grist and lumber mills; axe factories; and other types of industry. The Johnsonville Axe Factory was once the largest axe factory in the world. The coming of the railroad in 1830 made it much easier for these factories to market and transport their products, and contributed to the industrial growth of the hamlet. Although no passenger trains stop in <span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> anymore, the <span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">Maine Railroad</span>'s mainline continues to run through <span class="loc">Johnsonville</span>, transporting freight between <span class="loc">New England</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span>. "The B&amp;M" is now owned by Pan Am Railways. The station house has long since been closed and today is a multi-unit apartment dwelling.</p>
