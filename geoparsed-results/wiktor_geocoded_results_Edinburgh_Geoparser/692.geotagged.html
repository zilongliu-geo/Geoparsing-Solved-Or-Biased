<p><span class="loc">Stratford</span> is a city on the <span class="loc">Avon River</span> in <span class="loc">Perth County</span> in southwestern <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, with a population of 30,886 as of 2011. When the area was first settled by Europeans in 1832, the townsite and the river were named after <span class="loc">Stratford-upon-Avon</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is the seat of <span class="loc">Perth County</span>. <span class="loc">Stratford</span> was incorporated as a town in 1859 and as a city in 1886. The first mayor was John Corry Wilson Daly and the current mayor is Dan Mathieson. The swan has become a symbol of the city. Each year twenty-four white swans are released into the <span class="loc">Avon River</span>. The town is well known for being the home of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. The town was originally a railway junction. Furniture manufacturing became an important part of the local economy by the twentieth century. In 1933 a general strike, started by the furniture workers and led by the Communist Workers' Unity League, marked the last time the army was deployed to break a strike in <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The city's economy took a major turn when the Stratford Shakespeare Festival started in 1953. Mayor David Simpson approved the project pitched by Tom Patterson while at the convention of the Canadian chapter of the American Waterworks Association in <span class="loc">Winnipeg</span> May 1951. The annual festival now brings hundreds of thousands of theatre goers and tourists to the area. Celebrities such as Alec Guinness, Christopher Plummer, Olivia McLean, Dame Maggie Smith, and William Shatner have performed at the festival. The Canadian novelist and playwright Timothy Findley performed in the first season, and had an ongoing relationship with the festival, eventually moving to <span class="loc">Stratford</span> in 1997.</p>
