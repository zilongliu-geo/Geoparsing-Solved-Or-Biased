  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Auburn is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Androscoggin County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 23,055 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is one of two principal cities of and included in the Lewiston-Auburn, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> <span class="loc">New England</span> city and town area and the Lewiston-Auburn, <span class="loc">Maine Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area (which is part of the Portland-Lewiston-South <span class="loc">Portland</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span> combined statistical area). <span class="per">Auburn</span> and <span class="per">Lewiston</span> (directly across the <span class="loc">Androscoggin</span> River) are known locally as the <span class="loc">Twin Cities</span> or Lewiston-Auburn (L-A). The area was originally part of the Pejepscot Purchase, land bought in <span class="date">1714</span> by a consortium from <span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> following the Treaty of <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>, which brought peace between the Abenaki Indians and English settlements. In <span class="date">1736</span>, however, the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> granted a large section of the land to veterans of the <span class="date">1690</span> Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. Conflicting claims led to prolonged litigation; consequently, settlement was delayed until after the French and Indian Wars. Auburn was first settled in <span class="date">1786</span> as part of <span class="loc">Bakerstown</span>, renamed <span class="loc">Poland</span> when it was incorporated by the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> in <span class="date">1795</span>. It was then part of <span class="loc">Minot</span>, set off from <span class="loc">Poland</span> and incorporated in <span class="date">1802</span>. Auburn would itself be set off and incorporated on <span class="date">February 24, 1842</span>. The name was apparently inspired by "Auburn", a village (real or fictitious) featured in the <span class="date">1770</span> poem "The Deserted Village" by <span class="per">Oliver Goldsmith</span>. Originally part of <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, the town became county seat of <span class="loc">Androscoggin County</span> at its creation in <span class="date">1854</span>. By annexing land from towns around it, including part of <span class="loc">Poland</span> in <span class="date">1852</span>, <span class="loc">Minot</span> in <span class="date">1873</span>, and all of <span class="loc">Danville</span> (first called <span class="loc">Pejepscot</span>) in <span class="date">1867</span>, Auburn grew geographically into one of <span class="loc">Maine</span>'s largest municipalities. Incorporated a city in <span class="date">1868</span>, Auburn in <span class="date">1917</span> would be the first city in the state to adopt a council-manager form of government.</p><br><br>
