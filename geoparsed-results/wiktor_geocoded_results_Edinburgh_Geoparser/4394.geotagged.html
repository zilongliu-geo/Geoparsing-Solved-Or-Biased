<p>There are also five <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> Townships in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Westmoreland County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It stands 45 miles (72 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. As of the 2010 census, the borough population was 4,454. The Borough of <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>, consisting of the town area, should not be confused with <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> Township, which is an entirely separate municipality. <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> Township is predominantly rural and adjoins the borough to the north. In the past, <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> was a center of an extensive coke-making industry. Other products included flour, lumber, iron, glass, foundry products, etc. The year of <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>'s first non-Indian resident is not known, although one source states that at the time of the American Revolutionary War, there was a settlement of "not more than a half dozen houses." Braddock Road (Braddock expedition) passed through the western end of the future town in 1755, opening the area to settlement. In 1793 Michael Smith was licensed to operate an inn, which would have served traffic on Glades Road (sometimes spelled Glade Road), now Route 31. In 1797, Nathaniel Marshall sold land to Andrew McCready, who laid out the design of the town.</p>
