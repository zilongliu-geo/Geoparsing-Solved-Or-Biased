  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Norwich</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windsor County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,414 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Home to some of the state of <span class="loc">Vermont</span>'s wealthiest residents, the municipality is a commuter town for nearby <span class="loc">Hanover</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> across the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>. The town is part of the <span class="org">Dresden School District</span>, the first interstate school district in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, signed into law by President <span class="per">John F. Kennedy</span>. The boundaries of <span class="loc">Norwich</span> were established on <span class="date">July 4, 1761</span>, when Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span> of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> defined the boundaries of townships in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. The first settlers reached the area in <span class="date">1763</span> and began to clear the wilderness and erect the first hand-hewn log buildings, wintering over for the first time in <span class="date">1765</span>. Early settlements occurred along the <span class="loc">Ompompanoosuc River</span>. Later, the current village site became settled. The first town meeting occurred in <span class="date">April 1768</span>. The first Congregational church was founded in <span class="date">1770</span> and a structure built in <span class="date">1778</span>. The population grew from 206 in <span class="date">1771</span> to 1,158 in <span class="date">1791</span> and 2,316 in <span class="date">1830</span>. The town was named after <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, the state from which the first settlers originated. In the original charter, the name was spelled "Norwhich", but the additional 'h' was dropped shortly after the town was chartered. Originally pronounced "Norritch" (similar to the English pronunciation of the <span class="loc">city of Norwich</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>), the town name has in more recent times become more commonly pronounced "Nor-wich".</p><br><br>
