<p>Iraqi Officials: Car Bomb Kills 20 in <span class="loc">Baghdad</span>. BAGHDAD — A car bomb exploded near a crowded market in a mainly Shiite area in <span class="loc">Baghdad</span> on Thursday, killing as many as 20 people, Iraqi officials said, in the fifth major attack in <span class="loc">Iraq</span> this month. The blast came a day after the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> military said overall attacks nationwide have fallen to levels of the early months of the war, which began with the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>-led invasion in March 2003. The car was parked near a bus terminal surrounded by shops in the <span class="loc">eastern Shaab district</span> when it blew up shortly after noon on Thursday, the officials said. Iraqi police and hospital officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to release the information, said the 20 killed included four children and four women. The officials said 35 people also were wounded. The <span class="loc">U.S.</span> military confirmed the attack but said preliminary reports indicated eight people were killed and 14 were wounded. Conflicting casualty tolls are common in the aftermath of bombings. <span class="loc">Shaab</span> is a former Shiite militia stronghold that has seen a drop in violence since cleric Muqtada al-Sadr declared a cease-fire amid a crackdown by the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> and Iraqi militaries.</p>
