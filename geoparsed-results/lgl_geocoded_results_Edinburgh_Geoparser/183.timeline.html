  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Local business owners optimistic. On some <span class="date">mornings</span>, the line at the Mom’s Donut Shop drive-through window is four or five cars long, and the small building is filled with families and individuals gazing at the sweet treats through the glass display cases while employees pack the goodies into neat white boxes. Even in tough economic times people still like a treat <span class="date">now</span> and then. Mom’s Donut owner <span class="per">Cindy Davidson</span> — who operates the donut business with her husband, <span class="per">Chris</span> — said things haven’t been all good, but they are not dismal. “<span class="date">January</span> was real rough,” <span class="per">Davidson</span> said in a telephone interview <span class="date">Friday</span>, “<span class="date">January</span> is always a rough time for us because people are dieting and have spent a lot of money at <span class="date">Christmas</span>, but things are picking up. <span class="date">This week</span> which was spring break has been real good. We’ve seen a lot of faces that we don’t normally see.” The Davidsons are part of a fairly large number of <span class="per">Gainesville</span> business owners and operators who say they are not only surviving, they are thriving even in a bad economy. Some business owners choose to improve the look of their stores. <span class="per">Gainesville</span>’s <span class="loc">Tom Thumb</span> supermarket, which is owned by the <span class="loc">California</span>-based Safeway corporation, recently revamped its store on <span class="loc">Grand Avenue</span>. The changes are part of the company’s plan to make shopping a bit easier for customers, said <span class="per">Connie Yates</span> a spokesman for the company. The renovated <span class="loc">Tom Thumb</span> store was set up using the company’s lifestyle concept, she noted. “We are in the process of remodeling all of our stores in <span class="loc">Texas</span> to have the lifestyles format,” she said. The store is organized in more a customer-friendly way with lots of similar items grouped together. “We want to have one-stop shopping for our customers in an atmosphere that they can enjoy shopping in,” she said. The store renovations are part of that plan. “We are very proud of our newly remodeled store in <span class="per">Gainesville</span> and are doing everything we can using special sales and discount opportunities for our customers.” Food is one requirement that cannot be ignored, she said. “I have heard the grocery industry referred to as an essential industry. People have to eat,” <span class="per">Yates</span> said. A handful of <span class="per">Gainesville</span> companies chose to settle in new locations. Curves, a local fitness facility, is set to move to a new office complex on <span class="loc">Grand Avenue</span>. <span class="per">Owner Judy Waskow</span> said after some difficult times <span class="date">late last year</span>, her company seems to be recovering quickly. “<span class="date">The end of the year</span> was not good at all,” <span class="per">Waskow</span> admitted. “But <span class="date">January</span> and <span class="date">February</span> have started out well.” She said although the move to the new building was essential — the building where Curves is located was sold over <span class="date">a year ago</span> — the new location is a larger facility which she believes both current and future members will enjoy. Working out is a passion for many residents, she added. “There’s a good bunch (of members) that work out regularly,” she said. She also said the economic picture isn’t perfect, but it isn’t all bleak. “I’m optimistic,” she said. Another <span class="per">Gainesville</span> business set to move to new, larger digs is Landmark Bank. Landmark Bank Chief Executive Officer Basil Bigbie said the company has experienced “steady growth in the north central <span class="loc">Texas</span> (Texoma) area. ”“Providing our customers with access to new facilities along the Highway 82 corridor east into <span class="per">Gainesville</span> and <span class="per">Lindsay</span> was a natural progression for the bank,” <span class="loc">Bigbie</span> said in an e-mail message. He also said the decision to open new facilities in this area came after a lot of thought and preparation. “The planning, strategy and allocation of resources for these two facilities was in place well before the recent economic events. We’re excited to be moving forward with these two new banking centers and have already received a lot of positive feedback from the <span class="loc">Gainesville</span> and <span class="per">Lindsay</span> communities,” <span class="loc">Bigbie</span> noted. Local automobile dealerships faced <span class="date">a year</span> when most major auto manufacturers reported huge losses. But a representative for one Gainesville-area dealership said business is not bad at all. <span class="per">Glenn Polk</span> AutoPlex is posting sales and service numbers that are equal to <span class="date">2007</span>, which, a press release says, was <span class="date">a fantastic year</span>. They attribute their success to repeat and referral business. “Although lot traffic has slowed a bit, we still have a steady stream of our previous customers coming in, and referrals of their friends and relatives,” said owner <span class="per">Glenn Polk</span>. “Not only are we proud of our hard work and the success that we have had in <span class="loc">Cooke County</span>, but we are proud to be a part of the American auto industry. We are excited to be a part of <span class="org">Ford Motor Company</span> and <span class="org">Chrysler</span>,” <span class="per">Polk</span> added. According to Polk’s son, <span class="per">Trent</span>, the company also employees approximately 60 people and has contributed almost $200,000 in donations, fundraisers and sponsorships. “<span class="per">Glenn Polk</span> AutoPlex averages between 125-150 new and used vehicle sales every month. Since opening in <span class="date">April of 1995</span>, we have sold over 22,000 here in <span class="per">Gainesville</span>. These kinds of numbers are equal to dealerships you’d find in a big city,” Trent <span class="per">Polk</span> said. Like other business owners, the Polks said they encourage residents to shop local businesses. “We encourage folks to do business local. Keeping the money here in <span class="per">Gainesville</span> is very important to the growth of our community,” <span class="per">Trent</span> <span class="per">Polk</span> concluded. Auto dealer <span class="per">James Wood</span> is another businessman who sees the potential in <span class="per">Gainesville</span>. Wood recently made a deal to purchase Brown Motor Company. “We’ve been looking to put in a finance lot in <span class="per">Gainesville</span> because it’s such a good trade area,” <span class="per">Wood</span> said in a <span class="date">March 4</span> Register story. <span class="per">Wood</span> said he believes the dealership will be larger than Brown Motor Company.</p><br><br>
