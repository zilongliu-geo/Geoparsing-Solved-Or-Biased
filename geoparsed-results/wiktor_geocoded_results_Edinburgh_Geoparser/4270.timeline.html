  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Sal</span> is a concelho (municipality) of <span class="loc">Cape Verde</span>. It covers the whole island of <span class="per">Sal</span>. Its capital is the town <span class="per">Espargos</span>. The municipality consists of one freguesia (civil parish), <span class="loc">Nossa Senhora das Dores</span>, which also covers the whole island. The freguesia is subdivided into the following settlements: <span class="per">Espargos Murdeira Palmeira Pedra de Lume</span> Santa <span class="per">Maria Terra Boa Sal</span>’s main town, <span class="per">Espargos</span>, is home to one of the nation’s international airports and has around 17,000 inhabitants. <span class="per">Sal</span>'s population grew around salt collection and later shifted to fishing, but is <span class="date">now</span> based on tourism (amounting to 50% of the archipelago’s tourism) at the beach resort of <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span>. Its airport, Amílcar <span class="org">Cabral International Airport</span>, was used as a refuelling base by South <span class="org">African Airways</span> on its <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span> to <span class="loc">London</span> routes. Later, flights to and from <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> also refuelled there, and the island was a crew-change station. SAA established the long runways needed by the fully fueled <span class="org">Boeing</span> 707s on their take-offs in the high temperatures. On <span class="date">July 1, 2006</span>, SAA operated its final flight to <span class="per">Sal</span> due to the ending of its flights to <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>.</p><br><br>
