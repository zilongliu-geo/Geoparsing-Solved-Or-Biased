  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Adelaide</span> Hills, south-east of <span class="loc">Adelaide</span> in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is the former end of the Adelaide-Bridgewater railway line; this route was closed in <span class="date">1987</span>. The railway was converted to standard gauge in <span class="date">1995</span> and continues to be the main line from <span class="loc">Adelaide</span> to <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, but no trains stop at the <span class="date">now</span> demolished Bridgewater railway station. <span class="loc">Cox Creek</span> (named after the explorer <span class="per">Robert Cock</span>, who led an expedition through this area in <span class="date">December 1837</span>), runs through <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span>, and the town was originally settled as <span class="loc">Cox Creek</span>. An early use of the name "Bridgewater" was in <span class="per">James Addison</span>'s (ca.1819 – <span class="date">26 April 1870</span>) "Bridgewater Hotel", and the town was renamed <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> when the adjacent flour mill was built by <span class="per">John Dunn</span> and the nearby land subdivided in <span class="date">1857</span>. The streets of one part of <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> appear to have been named for Orient Line steam ships: SS <span class="loc">Omrah</span>, SS <span class="loc">Otway</span>, SS <span class="loc">Orsova</span>, SS Orontes (<span class="date">1902</span>–<span class="date">1926</span>), SS <span class="loc">Ophir</span>, SS <span class="loc">Otranto</span> (<span class="date">1909</span>–<span class="date">1918</span>), SS <span class="loc">Orvieto</span> (<span class="date">1909</span>–<span class="date">1931</span>), SS <span class="loc">Orotava</span> (<span class="date">1889</span>–<span class="date">1921</span>) (though <span class="loc">Oratava</span> Street) and SS <span class="loc">Osterley</span> (<span class="date">1909</span>–<span class="date">1929</span>).</p><br><br>
