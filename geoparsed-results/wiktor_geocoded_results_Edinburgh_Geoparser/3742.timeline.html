  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kingswood</span> is a suburb in <span class="loc">South Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. It is close to the county town of <span class="loc">Tallaght</span>. In the middle of <span class="loc">Kingswood</span> there is a square of buildings, which is not to be confused with The Square, which is near <span class="loc">Tallaght</span> <span class="loc">Town Centre</span>. These are: A quality launderette, an excellent betting shop, a superior fast-food takeaway and Gios Chipper, a majestic salon, an apothacary, a Centra convenience store, a public house with a clock-tower and closeby one community centre. The old community centre <span class="date">now</span> serves as a centre of excellence for hip hop dance, famous speech and drama classes and a <span class="per">Bruce Lee</span> inspired karate dojo ran by one of the worlds few Karate GrandMasters of Kenpo Karate. Next to it, there is the <span class="org">Newer Community Centre</span>. It hosts WeWontPay protests, sport matches (including indoor javelin and Irish Wrestling (IMW)) exercise and health fitness club. It once featured a weekly, <span class="date">now</span> defunct, disco called <span class="loc">Chilin</span>' it at <span class="loc">Killians</span> .The Scout den which won the Irish Architectural Innovation Award in <span class="date">1989</span> is found beside the community centre and houses the 158th <span class="org">Castleview Scout Group</span>. The Roman Catholic parish church is shared with Kilnamanagh, but Kingwood holds 70% of the shares, so that's grand.</p><br><br>
