<p>Hamilton is a city in <span class="loc">Caldwell County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,809 at the 2010 census. It is known as the hometown of James Cash Penney, the business entrepreneur and philanthropist, and the hometown of Jenny Doan who has built a large quilting-related business called Missouri Star Quilt Co. Hamilton, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> owes its existence largely to the <span class="loc">Hannibal</span> &amp; St. Joseph Railroad. Prior to 1854 the area around Hamilton was unsettled prairie land belonging to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Government. With the coming of the railroad, the Hamilton Town Company was formed to develop a tract of land along the rails. At first the name <span class="loc">Prairie City</span> was intended for the new community. However Albert Gallatin Davis, a key member of the Town Company, chose Hamilton instead, in honor two early Americans, Founding Father and first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, as well as Joseph Hamilton, a notable early American lawyer and military leader killed at the Battle of the <span class="loc">Thames</span> during the War of 1812. The first house in Hamilton, fittingly, was built by Mr. Davis in the summer of 1855 as well as the first business, a general store, in 1857. The store would serve as Hamilton's first Post Office and Davis the first Postmaster in 1858. The <span class="loc">Hannibal</span> &amp; St. Joseph was finally completed on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1859 and it proved a sweet day indeed for Hamilton as the first train arrived that day as well. A railroad depot was constructed by Fall, 1859 with Albert Gallatin Davis appointed the first railroad and express agent.</p>
