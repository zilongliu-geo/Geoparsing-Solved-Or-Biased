  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Seaside is an unincorporated master-planned community on the Florida panhandle in <span class="loc">Walton County</span>, between <span class="loc">Panama City</span> <span class="per">Beach</span> and <span class="per">Destin</span>. Being one of the first cities in <span class="loc">America</span> designed on the principles of New Urbanism, the town has become the topic of slide lectures in architectural schools and in housing-industry magazines, and is visited by design professionals from all over the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town rose to global fame as being the main filming location of the movie The Truman Show. On <span class="date">April 18, 2012</span>, the American Institute of Architects's Florida Chapter placed the community on its list of Florida Architecture: <span class="date">100 Years</span>. 100 Places as the Seaside - New Urbanism Township. The idea behind Seaside came from <span class="date">1946</span>, when the grandfather of future founder <span class="per">Robert S. Davis</span> bought 80 acres (32 ha) of land along the shore of Northwest Florida as a <span class="date">summer</span> retreat for his family. In <span class="date">1979</span> <span class="per">Davis</span> inherited the parcel from his grandfather, and aimed to transform it into an old-fashioned beach town, with traditional wood-framed cottages of the Florida Panhandle. <span class="per">Davis</span>, his wife <span class="per">Daryl</span>, and architectural partners Andr√©s Duany and <span class="per">Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk</span> of Duany <span class="per">Plater-Zyberk</span> &amp; Company (DPZ), toured the south studying small towns as a basis for planning Seaside.</p><br><br>
