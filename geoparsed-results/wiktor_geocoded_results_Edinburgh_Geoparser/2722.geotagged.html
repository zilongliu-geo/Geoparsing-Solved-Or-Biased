<p><span class="loc">Holt</span> is a former municipality in <span class="loc">Aust-Agder county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. It is currently located in the present-day municipality of <span class="loc">Tvedestrand</span> in the <span class="loc">Sørlandet region</span>. It is located along the Nordkalottruta. The church at <span class="loc">Holt</span> probably dates from the twelfth century and has an ancient font. The interior was decorated by Torsten Hoff. The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Holt farm (Old Norse: <span class="loc">Holt</span>), since the first church was built there. The name comes from skogholt (lund) which means "grove (of trees)". The municipality (originally the parish) of <span class="loc">Holt</span> was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). According to the 1835 census, the municipality had a population of 3,116. On 1 January 1881, a part of <span class="loc">Holt</span> with 52 inhabitants was moved to the neighboring municipality of Dypvåg, and on 1 July 1919 another part of <span class="loc">Holt</span> with 14 inhabitants was moved to the neighboring municipality of <span class="loc">Moland</span>. On 1 January 1960, <span class="loc">Holt</span> (population: 3,759), Dypvåg (population: 1,805), and <span class="loc">Tvedestrand</span> (population: 868) were merged to form an enlarged municipality of <span class="loc">Tvedestrand</span>.</p>
