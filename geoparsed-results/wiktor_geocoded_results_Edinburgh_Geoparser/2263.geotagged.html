<p><span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a county located in the eastern portion of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 52,566. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Troy. The county was founded December 14, 1818, and named for Major General Benjamin Lincoln of the American Revolutionary War. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is part of the St. Louis, <span class="loc">MO-IL Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. According to Goodspeed's History of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> (1888), <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> was named by Major Christopher Clark, the first permanent white settler, when he addressed the Territorial Legislature saying, "I was born, sir, in <span class="loc">Link-Horn County</span>, <span class="loc">N.C.</span>, I lived for many years in <span class="loc">Link-Horn County</span> in old Kain-tuck. I wish to die in <span class="loc">Link-Horn County</span>, in <span class="loc">Missouri</span>; and I move, therefore, that the blank in the bill be filled with the name Link-Horn." The motion was carried unanimously and the clerk, not adopting the frontier parlance of the Major, wrote "Lincoln" in the blank space of the bill. Others say it was named for Major General Benjamin Lincoln who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.</p>
