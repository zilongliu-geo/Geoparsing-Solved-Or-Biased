    Keith has three distinct sections: Old Town, where the original settlement was first established; Keith which is the main commercial centre and Fife Keith which was originally a separate town built in competition by the Earl of Fife but which, having proved less economically vibrant, was eventually joined to form one homogeneous settlement separated now only by the river.

  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="1180 where the Old Town still remains">
    The oldest part of Keith dates to around 1180 where the Old Town still remains, now almost indistinguishable from the rest of the town.

    The main part of the town is on higher ground above the river, laid out around 1750 by the Earl of Findlater.
