  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pamplona</span> is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Cagayan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 23,236 people. History <span class="loc">Pamplona</span> is the result of the fusion of two villages; Abulacan (<span class="date">now</span> barrio <span class="loc">San Juan</span>) and <span class="loc">Masi</span>. Abulacan was founded by the ecclesiastical authorities on <span class="date">April 30, 1757</span> with <span class="loc">San Juan Nepomuceno</span> as the patron saint. Sometime in <span class="date">1842</span>, Vicar Pedro <span class="loc">Montenegro, O.P.</span> convinced the people to unite the two towns. The vicar named it "<span class="loc">Pamplona</span>" in memory of his hometown <span class="loc">Pamplona</span> in <span class="loc">Spain</span>. After the fusion, an agreement was made that there would be two patron saints of <span class="loc">Pamplona</span>: <span class="loc">San Juan Nepomuceno</span> and <span class="loc">San Pedro</span> de <span class="loc">Martir</span>. This is the reason why the town fiesta is celebrated for <span class="date">two days</span> and the images of the two patron saints are carried during religious processions. The town fiesta is celebrated every <span class="date">April 29</span>. In <span class="date">1919</span>, some of the prominent people of <span class="loc">Pamplona</span> recommended the transfer of the same to <span class="loc">Bidduang</span>, a barrio of <span class="loc">Pamplona</span>. The transfer was made on <span class="date">November 16, 1919</span>, during the administration of municipal <span class="per">president Esteban Meneses</span> by order of General Wood. In <span class="date">1928</span>, on the sixth year of the administration of municipal <span class="per">president Paulino Ifurung</span>, one of his last acts was the transfer of the municipal government back to its old site, <span class="loc">Pamplona</span>, by then called "Albano."</p><br><br>
