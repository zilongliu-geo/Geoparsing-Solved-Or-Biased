<p>The town of <span class="loc">Palmerston</span>, in <span class="loc">New</span> <span class="loc">Zealand</span>'s <span class="loc">South Island</span>, lies 50 kilometres to the north of the <span class="loc">city of Dunedin</span>. It is the largest town in the <span class="loc">Waihemo Ward</span> of the <span class="loc">Waitaki District</span>, with a population of 890 residents. <span class="loc">Palmerston</span> grew at a major road junction: State Highway 1 links <span class="loc">Dunedin</span> and <span class="loc">Waikouaiti</span> to the south with <span class="loc">Oamaru</span> and <span class="loc">Christchurch</span> to the north, while State Highway 85 (known colloquially as "The <span class="loc">Pigroot</span>") heads inland to become the principal highway of the <span class="loc">Maniototo</span>. The Main South Line railway passes through the town and the Seasider tourist train travels from <span class="loc">Dunedin</span> to <span class="loc">Palmerston</span> and back once or twice a week. From 1880 until 1989, the town acted as the junction between the main line and a branch line that ran inland, the <span class="loc">Dunback</span> and Makareao Branches. <span class="loc">Palmerston</span> stands near the banks of the <span class="loc">Shag River</span>, five kilometres inland from the Pacific coast. Between it and the sea stands the lone hill of <span class="loc">Puketapu</span> (Maori for sacred hill, known by Southerners as Holy Hill), crowned with a monument to the 19th century Otago politician Sir John McKenzie. An annual race takes place up to the memorial and back, which is called the Kelly's canter, dedicated to Albert Kelly who ran up <span class="loc">Puketapu</span> as a constable in the <span class="loc">Palmerston</span> police force every day during World War II.</p>
