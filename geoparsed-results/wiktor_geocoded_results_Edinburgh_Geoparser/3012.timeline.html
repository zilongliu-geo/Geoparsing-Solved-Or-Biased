  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Hama</span> (Arabic: حماة‎ Ḥamāh [ħaˈmaː], Biblical Ḥamāth, "fortress") is a city on the banks of the <span class="loc">Orontes River</span> in west-central <span class="loc">Syria</span>. It is located 213 km (132 mi) north of <span class="loc">Damascus</span> and 46 kilometres (29 mi) north of <span class="loc">Homs</span>. It is the provincial capital of the <span class="org">Hama</span> Governorate. With a population of 854,000 (<span class="date">2009</span> census), <span class="org">Hama</span> is the fourth-largest city in <span class="loc">Syria</span> after <span class="loc">Aleppo</span>, <span class="loc">Damascus</span> and <span class="loc">Homs</span>. The city is renowned for its seventeen norias used for watering the gardens, which are locally claimed to date back to <span class="date">1100 BC</span>. Though historically used for purpose of irrigation, the norias exist <span class="date">today</span> as an almost entirely aesthetic traditional show. In the last <span class="date">decades</span>, the <span class="loc">city of Hama</span> has become known as a center of the anti-Ba'ath opposition in <span class="loc">Syria</span>, most notably the Muslim Brotherhood. The city was raided by the Syrian Army, beginning with the <span class="date">1964</span> Islamist uprising, and becoming the scene of carnage during the Islamist uprising in <span class="loc">Syria</span> in <span class="date">April 1981</span> and especially in <span class="date">1982</span>, when nearly 25,000 people were killed in what became known as <span class="org">Hama</span> massacre. The city was once again the site of conflict between the Syrian military and opposition forces, as one of the main arenas of the Syrian civil war in <span class="date">2011</span> and <span class="date">2012</span>.</p><br><br>
