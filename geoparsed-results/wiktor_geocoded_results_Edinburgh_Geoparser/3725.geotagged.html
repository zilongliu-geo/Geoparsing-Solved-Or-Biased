<p>Saint-Esprit (French for "Holy Spirit") is a municipality in the <span class="loc">Lanaudière region</span> of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, part of the <span class="loc">Montcalm</span> <span class="loc">Regional County</span> Municipality. It is located on both banks of the Saint-Esprit River, a tributary of the <span class="loc">L</span>'<span class="loc">Assomption</span> River. The area's first settlers arrived at the end of 18th century and were mostly from <span class="loc">L</span>'Ange-Gardien, <span class="loc">Beauport</span>, and Saint-Sulpice. Originally, the area was identified as the Rivière-Saint-Esprit or Grand-Saint-Esprit Concession. In 1808, the <span class="loc">Parish of Saint-Ours-du-Saint-Esprit</span> was founded, however after 1838, the parish name was shortened to just Saint-Esprit to avoid confusion with another parish called Saint-Ours in the <span class="loc">Diocese of Montreal</span>. In 1852, its post office opened and in 1855, the Parish Municipality of Saint-Ours-du-Saint-Esprit was formed. A century later in 1956, it followed the parish by also shortening its name to Saint-Esprit. In 2000, the parish municipality changed its status and became the Municipality of Saint-Esprit. Because Saint-Esprit is surrounded by extensive plains, the local economy is characterized by agriculture. The main agricultural activities include tobacco and Sugar Maple cultivation, milk production, and breeding of lamb, pork and poultry.</p>
