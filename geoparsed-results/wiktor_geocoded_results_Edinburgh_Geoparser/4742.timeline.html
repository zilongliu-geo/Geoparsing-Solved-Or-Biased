  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The <span class="loc">City of Louisville</span> /ˈluːɪsvɪl/ is a Home Rule Municipality in <span class="loc">Boulder County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city population was 18,376 at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. <span class="loc">Louisville</span> began as a rough mining community in <span class="date">1877</span>, suffered through a period of extraordinary labor violence early in the 20th century, and then, when the mines closed in <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, made a transition to a suburban residential community. According to <span class="org">CNN</span>/<span class="per">Money</span> and <span class="per">Money</span> magazine's list of the 100 best places to live in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="loc">Louisville</span> was placed third in <span class="date">2007</span>, first in <span class="date">2009</span> and <span class="date">2011</span>, and second in <span class="date">2013</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Louisville</span> dates back to the start of the Welch Mine in <span class="date">1877</span>, the first coal mine in an area of <span class="per">Boulder</span> and <span class="per">Weld</span> counties known as the Northern Coalfield. The town was named for <span class="per">Louis Nawatny</span>, a local landowner who platted his land and named it for himself. Incorporation came <span class="date">several years later</span>, in <span class="date">1882</span>. The Northern Coalfield proved to be highly productive, and eventually some 30 different mines operated within the current boundaries of <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, though not all at the same time. During the <span class="date">years</span> of peak production (<span class="date">1907</span>–09) twelve mines were in operation in <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, including the Acme Mine whose two million tons of coal came from directly beneath the center of town. The presence of many independent mining companies in <span class="loc">Louisville</span> saved the town from becoming a "company town", wholly owned and dominated by a single mining company.</p><br><br>
