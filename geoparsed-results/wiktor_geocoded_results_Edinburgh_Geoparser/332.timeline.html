  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Clifton</span> is a small town within the metropolitan borough of the <span class="loc">City of Salford</span>, in <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically in <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, it lies alongside and in the <span class="loc">Irwell</span> Valley in the northern part of the <span class="loc">City of Salford</span>. <span class="loc">Clifton</span>, a former centre for coal mining, once formed part of the Municipal Borough of <span class="loc">Swinton</span> and <span class="loc">Pendlebury</span>. <span class="loc">Clifton</span> is derived from the Old English clif and tun, and means the "settlement near a cliff, slope or riverbank". <span class="loc">Clifton</span> was mentioned in the Pipe Roll of <span class="date">1183</span>â€“84. Clifton Hall Colliery was situated a few yards to the west of <span class="loc">Lumns</span> Lane on a site currently occupied by a domestic refuse and recycling site, run by the <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span> Waste Disposal Authority. It is thought that the colliery was operating by <span class="date">1820</span>, and its tramway is shown on a parliamentary plan from <span class="date">1830</span> and an <span class="date">1845</span> map. The colliery closed in <span class="date">1929</span>. On <span class="date">18 June 1885</span>, an underground explosion at the colliery killed 178 men and boys. It is thought the explosion was caused by firedamp igniting on contact with a candle. Blacksmith <span class="per">George Hindley</span> (aged 16) and fireman <span class="per">George Higson</span>, were part of a band of men who descended into the mine immediately after the explosion. They received an Albert Medal (2nd class) in recognition of their heroism.</p><br><br>
