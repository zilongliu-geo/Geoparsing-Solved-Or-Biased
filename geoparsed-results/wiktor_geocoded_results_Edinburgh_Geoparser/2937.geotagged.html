<p><span class="loc">Zhoushan</span> ; formerly transliterated as <span class="loc">Chusan</span>, is a prefecture-level city in <span class="loc">northeastern Zhejiang province</span> of Eastern <span class="loc">China</span>. One of the two prefecture-level cities of the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span> consisting solely of islands (the other is <span class="loc">Sansha</span> in <span class="loc">Hainan</span>, however its territory is in dispute), it lies across the mouth of the <span class="loc">Hangzhou</span> Bay, and is separated from the mainland by a narrow body of water. On 8 July 2011 the central government approved <span class="loc">Zhoushan</span> as Zhoushan Archipelago New Area, a state-level new area. At the 2010 census, its population was 1,121,261 whom 842,989 lived in the built-up area made of <span class="loc">Dinghai</span> and <span class="loc">Putuo</span> counties. The archipelago was inhabited 6,000 years ago during the Neolithic by people of the Hemudu culture. During the Spring and Autumn period, <span class="loc">Zhoushan</span> was called <span class="loc">Yongdong</span> (甬东), referring to its location east of the <span class="loc">Yong</span> River, and belonged to the State of <span class="loc">Yue</span>. The fishermen and sailors who inhabited the islands often engaged in piracy and became recruits for uprisings against the central authorities. At the time of the Eastern <span class="loc">Jin</span> dynasty, <span class="loc">Zhoushan</span> Islands served as the base for Sun En's rebellion. Sun En, an adherent of the Taoist sect Way of the Five Pecks of Rice, launched his rebellion around the year 400 and was defeated by <span class="loc">Jin</span> forces in 402. In 863, the Japanese Buddhist monk <span class="loc">Hui</span>'e (慧锷; Egaku) and a Putuoshan local Zhang-shi (张氏) placed a statue of <span class="loc">Guanyin</span> at <span class="loc">Chaoyin</span> Cave (潮音洞) that would later become a popular tourist and pilgrim destination. During the Ming dynasty, especially between the years 1530 and 1560, Japanese and Chinese pirates used <span class="loc">Zhoushan</span> as one of their principal bases from which they launched attacks as far as <span class="loc">Nanjing</span>; "the whole Chinese coast from northern <span class="loc">Shandong</span> to western Guangdong was ravaged to a distance of sixty miles inland."</p>
