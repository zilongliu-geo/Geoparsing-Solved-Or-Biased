<p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. As of 2010, the population was 42,376. The county seat is <span class="loc">Brownstown</span>. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> was formed in 1816. It was named for Andrew Jackson, who defeated the British in 1815 at the Battle of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> in the War of 1812, and afterward elected President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> was the site of the first recorded train robbery of a moving train in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. On October 6, 1866 the Reno Gang robbed an <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Mississippi Railway</span> train making off with over $10,000.They were nicknamed: "The Jackson Theives" later on. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is home to the longest 3-span covered bridge in the world; The <span class="loc">Medora Covered</span> Bridge. After a recent project to completely refurbish the <span class="loc">Medora Covered</span> Bridge the nearby town of <span class="loc">Medora</span> now has an annual event using the bridge as the focal point. The bridge is open for pedestrian traffic and site-seers. Another long neglected covered bridge, the Bells <span class="loc">Ford Bridge</span>, which is believed the last remaining Post Truss bridge in the world, succumbed to similar neglect, collapsing into the <span class="loc">White River</span> on January 2, 2006.</p>
