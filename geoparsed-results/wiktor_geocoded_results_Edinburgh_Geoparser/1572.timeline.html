  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The <span class="loc">District of Taylor</span> is a small town in northeastern British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, located on mile 36 of the Alaska Highway. <span class="per">Taylor</span>, a member municipality of the <span class="loc">Peace River</span> Regional District, covers an area of about 17.09 kmÂ² with 1,373 residents. As it is just south of the much larger <span class="loc">city of Fort</span> <span class="loc">St. John</span>, there is a sizable amount of commuting and interaction between the two. The town sits on a terrace 60 m above the north bank of the <span class="loc">Peace River</span>. The first settler on the flat was a trapper named <span class="per">Herbert Taylor</span> in <span class="date">1911</span>. The town incorporated in <span class="date">1958</span> with industrial business beginning to locate there. Since then, <span class="per">Taylor</span> has remained a small town, even though it has developed a large industrial base. It has become home to the annual World's Invitational Class 'A' Gold Panning Championships and was featured on the <span class="org">CBC Television</span> program Village on a Diet. The town, and the <span class="loc">Taylor Flats</span> upon which the town is located, are named after <span class="per">Donald Herbert Taylor</span>, a fur-trader with the Hudson's Bay Company who regularly met his Aboriginal trading counterparts on this river flat. In <span class="date">1912</span> <span class="per">Taylor</span> left his employers and took up residence on the flats with a few other squatters. <span class="date">That year</span> the federal government opened the area to homesteading and <span class="per">Taylor</span> was granted the land upon which he had settled. These early settlers were trappers with the first farm established by <span class="per">Henry Philip</span>, from <span class="loc">Glasgow</span>, who inherited buildings, equipment and land from his survey team when they left the area. In <span class="date">1919</span>, with the help of <span class="per">Taylor</span>'s nine children, along with those from a few American families who settled there, the provincial government opened the <span class="per">Taylor</span> Flats School.</p><br><br>
