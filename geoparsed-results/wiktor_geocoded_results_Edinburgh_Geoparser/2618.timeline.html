  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Ta‘ū is the largest island in the Manu‘a Group and the easternmost volcanic island of the <span class="loc">Samoan Islands</span>. Ta‘ū is part of American <span class="loc">Samoa</span>. In the early 19th century, the island was sometimes called Opoun. The island is the eroded remnant of a "hotspot" shield volcano with a caldera complex or collapse feature (<span class="loc">Liu Bench</span>) on the south face. The summit of the island, called <span class="loc">Lata Mountain</span>, is at an elevation of 931 meters (3,054 ft), making it the highest point in American <span class="loc">Samoa</span>. The last known volcanic eruption in the Manu‘a Islands was in <span class="date">1866</span>, on the submarine ridge that extends westnorthwest towards nearby Ofu-Olosega. The largest airport in the Manu‘a Islands is on the northeast corner of Ta‘ū at Fiti‘uta. There is also a private airport. A boat harbor is located at Faleāsao at the northwestern corner of the island. A roadway along the north coast connects all of the several inhabited villages between Ta‘ū on the west and Fiti‘uta. All of the southeastern half of Ta‘ū—including all of the rainforest on top of <span class="loc">Lata Mountain</span> and within the caldera—and southern shoreline and associated coral reefs are part of the National Park of American <span class="loc">Samoa</span>. The park includes the ancient, sacred site of <span class="loc">Saua</span>, considered to be the birthplace of the Polynesian people.</p><br><br>
