  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kingston</span> (Norf'k laengwij <span class="loc">Daun</span> a'Taun) is the capital of <span class="org">the Australian</span> South Pacific <span class="loc">Territory of Norfolk Island</span>. The vice-regal, legislative, administrative and judicial offices are all located in <span class="loc">Kingston</span>. The town is the second-oldest in <span class="loc">Australia</span>, and is of great historical and cultural significance to all Norfolk Islanders and other Australians. <span class="loc">Kingston</span> is located on the east-west aligned <span class="loc">Kingston</span> Plain which rises from the coast to about 20 m (66 ft) above sea level in the foothills of the <span class="loc">Kingston</span> escarpment. The plain is 1.5 km (0.9 mi) long by about 500 m (1,640 ft) wide, with calcareous lime sands to the south along the coast and basaltic clays to the north along the foothills. The western end of the plain is marked by the 60 m (197 ft) high Flagstaff Hill. <span class="loc">Watermill Creek</span> traverses the plain after leaving Arthur's Vale to the north-west, and is joined by <span class="loc">Town Creek</span> and several minor tributaries to form the <span class="loc">Kingston</span> swamps before draining into <span class="loc">Emily Bay</span>. Most of the accessible beaches on the island are located along the <span class="loc">Kingston</span> foreshores. Southwards, <span class="loc">Emily Bay</span> and <span class="loc">Slaughter Bay</span> open into the <span class="loc">Kingston</span> lagoon and reefs and the broad expanse of <span class="loc">Sydney Bay</span>. Eastwards, Cemetery Bay opens directly into the <span class="loc">South Pacific Ocean</span>.</p><br><br>
