  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lodi</span> (/ˈloʊ.daɪ/ LOW-dy) is a town in <span class="loc">Seneca County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,550 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The Town of <span class="loc">Lodi</span> is in the southwest part of the county and is northwest of <span class="loc">Ithaca</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. The town contains a village also named <span class="loc">Lodi</span>. Both owe their names to the Italian <span class="loc">city of Lodi</span>. The area was occupied by members of the Seneca tribe until <span class="date">1779</span> when the Sullivan Expedition destroyed their villages, including a Seneca orchard at <span class="loc">Lodi Point</span>. The town became part of the Central New York Military Tract. The first settler arrived around <span class="date">1789</span>. In <span class="date">1799</span>, in the area of Brokaw Road, a group of New Jersey Dutch farmers settled to form a Dutch Reformed community, eventually having two churches. Remnants of one of these churches is the McNeil Cemetery located in the area of Brokaw Road. The New Jersey Dutch settled into the area for several generations and eventually their churches combined with several other churches to form the United Presbyterian Church of <span class="loc">Lodi</span>. Descendents of these original Dutchmen reside in the town <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
