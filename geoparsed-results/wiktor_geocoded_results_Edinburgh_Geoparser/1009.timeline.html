  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Somerset</span> (/ˈsʌmərsɛt/ or /ˈsʌmərsᵻt/) is a county in <span class="loc">South West England</span> which borders <span class="loc">Gloucestershire</span> and <span class="loc">Bristol</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Dorset</span> to the south-east and <span class="loc">Devon</span> to the south-west. It is bounded to the north and west by the <span class="loc">Severn Estuary</span> and the <span class="loc">Bristol Channel</span>, its coastline facing southeastern <span class="loc">Wales</span>. Its traditional border with <span class="loc">Gloucestershire</span> is the <span class="loc">River Avon</span>. Somerset's county town is <span class="loc">Taunton</span>. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> is a rural county of rolling hills such as the <span class="loc">Blackdown Hills</span>, <span class="loc">Mendip Hills</span>, <span class="loc">Quantock Hills</span> and <span class="loc">Exmoor National Park</span>, and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels. There is evidence of human occupation from Paleolithic times, and of subsequent settlement in the Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The county played a significant part in the consolidation of power and rise of <span class="per">King Alfred</span> the Great, and later in the <span class="org">English Civil War</span> and the Monmouth Rebellion. The <span class="loc">city of Bath</span> is famous for its substantial Georgian architecture and is a <span class="org">UNESCO World Heritage Site</span>. Somerset's name derives from Old English Sumorsǣte, short for Sumortūnsǣte, meaning "the people living at or dependent on Sumortūn" (<span class="loc">Somerton</span>). The first known use of Somersæte is in the law code of <span class="per">King Ine</span> who was the Saxon <span class="per">King of Wessex</span> from 688 to 726, making <span class="loc">Somerset</span> along with <span class="loc">Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span> and <span class="loc">Dorset</span> one of the oldest extant units of local government in the world. An alternative suggestion is the name derives from Seo-mere-saetan meaning "settlers by the sea lakes."</p><br><br>
