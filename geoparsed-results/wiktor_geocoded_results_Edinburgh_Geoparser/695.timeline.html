  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Stratford</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Camden County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 7,040, reflecting a decline of 231 (-3.2%) from the 7,271 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn declined by 343 (-4.5%) from the 7,614 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. The Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine is located in <span class="loc">Stratford</span>. The <span class="loc">Borough of Stratford</span> was created on <span class="date">February 13, 1925</span>, from <span class="loc">Clementon</span> Township, one of seven municipalities created from the now-defunct township. The borough was named for <span class="loc">Stratford-upon-Avon</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, by the owners of the Rural Land Improvement Company that developed the area in the 1880s. <span class="loc">Stratford</span> is governed under the Borough form of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> municipal government. The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the <span class="date">November</span> general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The Borough form of government used by <span class="loc">Stratford</span>, the most common system used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.</p><br><br>
