  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Family takes bait, opens fishing shop. By <span class="loc">KENT</span> MALLETT Advocate Reporter <span class="date">March 30, 2009</span> <span class="loc">NEWARK</span> &#x97; Wess <span class="per">Henry</span>, who lost his home to foreclosure <span class="date">last year</span>, was fishing for a way to change his luck. He hopes his fortunes change after he opened Drowned Worm Bait Shop on <span class="date">Friday 13th of March</span>. <span class="per">Henry</span> and his son, <span class="per">Matt</span>, are co-owners of the business at 197 N. Cedar <span class="per">St.Henry</span> purchased the inventory of Newark Live Bait, which closed its Western Avenue business in <span class="date">January</span>. He then found the rent at the Cedar Street location was affordable. The unlikely chain of events started when <span class="per">Matt Henry</span> started planning for a fishing trip <span class="date">a few months ago</span>. “I called down there (to Newark Live Bait) to see what they wanted for bait and she said, &#x91;I’ll give you what I got because I’m going out of business,’” <span class="per">Matt Henry</span> said. “And, she gave me a price for everything in the store. It was an offer we couldn’t refuse.” The <span class="loc">Henrys</span> had talked about opening a bait shop, but the did not know that Newark Live Bait was going out of business until his son stumbled onto the news. “I’d say it was fisherman’s luck,” <span class="per">Wess Henry</span> said. “Everything seemed to fall into place, If (Matt) hadn’t decided to go fishing, it probably wouldn’t be reality. I still can’t believe I’m here.” Wess <span class="per">Henry</span>, 47, a 14-year employee of <span class="org">Tectum Inc.</span>, had just enough savings to start the business without a loan, which he said he probably could not have secured anyway. The <span class="loc">Henrys</span> said they have a good chance of developing a successful business once people discover them and their location because there is not much competition. “The fishermen are spreading the word amongst themselves,” <span class="per">Wess Henry</span> said. “Everyone is so glad we’re here because there’s nowhere else to get bait. “I’m just trying to listen to what customers want. If people want something, I’ll try to get it in within <span class="date">a week</span> from the bait dealer.” Wess <span class="per">Henry</span> does have some retail experience. His parents had operated what <span class="loc">Wess</span> said was the largest bicycle shop in <span class="loc">Licking County</span> in <span class="date">the 1980s</span>, Mound City Bicycle Shop on Idlewilde Avenue. The shop will continue the tradition from <span class="loc">Newark</span> Live Bait of providing fishing contests and offering a raffle and door prizes. Wess <span class="per">Henry</span> also dabbles in woodworking and sells some of his work at the shop. The recession could actually work in the <span class="loc">Henrys</span>’ favor in a couple ways, <span class="per">Matt</span> said. “It may even spike when the economy is down because, when people are laid off, there is nothing else to do, and they may as well go fishing,” he said. “I’d say it’s about the cheapest hobby left.” Although fishermen can spend large amounts of money for equipment and boats, the <span class="loc">Henrys</span> said they also can get started with a license and minimal equipment for about $50. Another potential benefit from the poor economy is stimulus money offered from the government. <span class="per">Matt Henry</span> applied for $100,000 to hire employees, purchase more inventory and even open up a second store. “I said, just for the heck of it, apply for it,” <span class="loc">Wess</span> said he told his son. <span class="per">Matt Henry</span>, 24, said he’s counting on the business lasting well into <span class="date">the future</span>. “I hope it’s here for <span class="date">the next 40 years</span>,” <span class="per">Matt Henry</span> said. “Essentially, this is what I want to make my life’s work.” <span class="per">Matt Henry</span>, left, and his father, Wess <span class="per">Henry</span>, opened Drowned Worm Bait Shop at 197 N. Cedar St. (<span class="per">Michael Lehmkuhle</span>, The Advocate)</p><br><br>
