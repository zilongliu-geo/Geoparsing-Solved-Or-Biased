<p><span class="loc">Glasgow</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Valley County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with an estimated population of 3,380 as of 2014. American Indians inhabited the region for centuries, and extensive buffalo and pronghorn antelope herds provided ample food for the nomadic tribes. The <span class="loc">Nakoda</span>, <span class="loc">Lakota</span>, and Dakota peoples alternately inhabited and claimed the region from the 16th to the late 19th centuries. In 1804 the Lewis and Clark expedition came within 15 miles (24 km) of the future site of <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> and noted the extensive herds of buffalo and various game. In 1851, the <span class="loc">US</span> government formed the first treaty with the Native American tribes, in 1885 the tribes engaged in the last known buffalo hunt in the region, and in 1887, a treaty was signed where the tribes surrendered 17,500,000 acres (7,100,000 ha), which led from 1888 to the formation of the <span class="loc">Fort Peck Indian Reservation</span> and the removal of the tribes from the <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> area. <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> was founded in 1887 as a railroad town by James J. Hill, who was responsible for creating many communities along the Hi-Line. The town was named after <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> in <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> grew during the 1930s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the construction of the Fort Peck Dam, which became a major source of employment for the <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> area.</p>
