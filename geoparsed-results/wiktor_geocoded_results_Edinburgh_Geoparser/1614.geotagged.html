<p><span class="loc">Newport</span> (Welsh: <span class="loc">Trefdraeth</span>, meaning: "town by the beach") is a community, town and ancient port (Parrog) on the Pembrokeshire coast in south-west <span class="loc">Wales</span>, at the mouth of the River Nevern (Welsh: <span class="loc">Afon Nyfer</span>) in the <span class="loc">Pembrokeshire Coast National Park</span>. A popular tourist destination, <span class="loc">Newport</span> town straddles the A487 <span class="loc">Fishguard</span> to Cardigan road, while the old port area hosts many beach, water and other activities. <span class="loc">Newport</span> is twinned with the village of <span class="loc">Plouguin</span> in Finist√®re, Brittany and Annapolis, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The town was founded by the <span class="loc">Norman</span> William FitzMartin (c.1155-1209) in about 1197. He was a son-in-law of the Lord Rhys, who nevertheless expelled him from his former base at nearby <span class="loc">Nevern</span>, which had been established by his father Robert fitz Martin. William founded <span class="loc">Newport</span> as the new capital of the Marcher Lordship of Cemais and it was a busy port founded primarily on the growing medieval wool trade. Despite seizure from the native Welsh, it remained within the FitzMartin family until the death of William, the 2nd Lord Martin, who died without male heir in 1326.</p>
