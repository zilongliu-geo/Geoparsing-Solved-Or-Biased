  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Denton</span> is a hamlet in <span class="loc">Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>.  <span class="loc">Denton</span> lies approximately 11 miles (18 km) north-west of <span class="loc">Huntingdon</span>. <span class="loc">Denton</span> is in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Denton and Caldecote</span>. <span class="loc">Denton</span> is situated within <span class="loc">Huntingdonshire</span> which is a non-metropolitan <span class="loc">district of Cambridgeshire</span> as well as being a historic <span class="loc">county of England</span>. <span class="loc">Denton</span> has approximately 12 houses. All Saints Church in <span class="loc">Denton</span>, substantially rebuilt 1629-1671, but with 12th and 13th century elements, was abandoned in <span class="date">the early 1960s</span> and is currently in a ruinous state. However, the roofless church and tower remain grade II listed and occasional services and events are held within. In <span class="date">1085</span> William the Conqueror ordered that a survey should be carried out across his kingdom to discover who owned which parts and what it was worth. The survey took place in <span class="date">1086</span> and the results were recorded in what, since the 12th century, has become known as the Domesday Book. Starting with the king himself, for each landholder within a county there is a list of their estates or manors; and, for each manor, there is a summary of the resources of the manor, the amount of annual rent that was collected by the lord of the manor both in <span class="date">1066</span> and in <span class="date">1086</span>, together with the taxable value.</p><br><br>
