  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pila</span> is a third class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Laguna</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 46,534 people. <span class="loc">Pila</span> has a total land area of 31.2 km². The town of <span class="loc">Pila</span> is the site for some well-preserved houses dating back to the Spanish period as well as the old <span class="loc">Saint Anthony</span> of <span class="loc">Padua Parish</span> Church, the first Antonine church in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. <span class="per">Don Felizardo</span> <span class="loc">Rivera</span>, who donated his lands to the church and municipal government, is the recognized founder of <span class="loc">Pila</span>. He is the ancestor of prominent families in <span class="loc">Pila</span> surnamed <span class="loc">Rivera</span>, <span class="loc">Relova</span>, <span class="loc">Agra</span> and Álava. This also served as a location for the reality show, The Amazing Race <span class="loc">Asia</span> 2 and the ABS-CBN daytime drama hit series Be Careful With <span class="org">My Heart</span>. <span class="loc">Pila</span> is politically subdivided into 17 barangays. In <span class="date">1957</span>, the sitio of <span class="loc">Pinagbayanan</span> was converted into a barrio. <span class="loc">Pila</span> and adjacent towns along the shores of <span class="loc">Laguna de Bay</span> are considered by archaeologists as one of the oldest settlements in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. The community is one of three such concentrations of population known archaeologically to have been in place before A.D. <span class="date">1000</span>. Archaeologists recovered in Pinagbayanan potteries and artifacts that indicate considerable settlement in the area during the Late Tang Dynasty (<span class="date">900 A.D</span>.). Archaeologists also recovered ancient horse bones ending the debate on whether the Spaniards brought them or not. The scientists were able to uncover <span class="loc">Philippines</span>’ oldest crematorium in the same area. It is worthwhile to note that the oldest Philippine document, the <span class="date">900 A.D.</span> Laguna Copperplate Inscription, mentioned <span class="loc">Pila</span> (as Pailah) twice and its ruler Jayadewa.</p><br><br>
