  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Luanda</span>, formerly named São <span class="per">Paulo</span> da Assunção de <span class="loc">Loanda</span>, is the capital and largest city in <span class="loc">Angola</span>, and the country's most populous and important city, primary port and major industrial, cultural and urban centre. Located on <span class="loc">Angola</span>'s coast with the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>, <span class="loc">Luanda</span> is both <span class="loc">Angola</span>'s chief seaport and its administrative centre. It has a metropolitan population of over 6 million. It is also the capital <span class="loc">city of Luanda</span> Province, and the world's third most populous <span class="loc">Portuguese-speaking city</span>, behind only São <span class="per">Paulo</span> and <span class="loc">Rio de Janeiro</span>, both in <span class="loc">Brazil</span>, and the most populous Portuguese-speaking capital city in the world, ahead of Brasília, <span class="loc">Maputo</span> and <span class="loc">Lisbon</span>. The city is currently undergoing a major reconstruction, with many large developments taking place that will alter the cityscape significantly. Portuguese explorer <span class="per">Paulo Dias de Novais</span> founded <span class="loc">Luanda</span> on <span class="date">25 January 1576</span> as "São <span class="per">Paulo</span> da Assumpção de <span class="loc">Loanda</span>", with one hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. In <span class="date">1618</span>, the Portuguese built the fortress called Fortaleza São Pedro da <span class="loc">Barra</span>, and they subsequently built two more: Fortaleza de São Miguel (<span class="date">1634</span>) and Forte de São Francisco do <span class="loc">Penedo</span> (<span class="date">1765</span>-6). Of these, the Fortaleza de São Miguel is the best preserved.</p><br><br>
