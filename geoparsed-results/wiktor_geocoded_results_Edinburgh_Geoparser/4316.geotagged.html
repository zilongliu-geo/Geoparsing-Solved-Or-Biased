<p>Prospect is a town in <span class="loc">Waldo County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 709 at the 2010 census. The most prominent landmark in Prospect is <span class="loc">Fort Knox</span>, a large 19th-century fort. It is now a major tourist attraction, as is the Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory. Originally part of <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>, it was settled in 1759 when Fort Pownall was completed at <span class="loc">Fort Point</span> on <span class="loc">Cape Jellison</span>. Prospect was set off and incorporated in 1794. Land was then set off from Prospect in 1845 to form part of <span class="loc">Searsport</span>. <span class="loc">Stockton</span> (later <span class="loc">Stockton</span> Springs) was set off and incorporated in 1857. Shipbuilding was an early industry. By 1859, the town had one gristmill, three sawmills and a shingle mill. Construction on <span class="loc">Fort Knox</span> began in 1844, using granite from <span class="loc">Mount Waldo</span> in <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>. It was built to defend the <span class="loc">Penobscot River</span> and the lumber port of <span class="loc">Bangor</span> during the Aroostook War. Although never fully completed, work on the huge defense stopped in 1869. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 20.20 square miles (52.32 km2), of which, 18.09 square miles (46.85 km2) of it is land and 2.11 square miles (5.46 km2) is water. Drained by the south branch of the <span class="loc">Marsh River</span>, Prospect is situated along the west bank of the <span class="loc">Penobscot River</span>.</p>
