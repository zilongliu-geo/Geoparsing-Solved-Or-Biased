  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dover</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Loudoun County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. <span class="loc">Dover</span> is located east of <span class="loc">Middleburg</span> at the intersection of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 50, <span class="per">Champe</span> <span class="org">Ford</span> Road (SR 629 south), and Cobb House Road (SR 629 north). The <span class="loc">Little River</span> begins following Route 50 at this point. <span class="loc">Dover</span> as a geographical entity is somewhat exaggerated, seeing as the bend in Route 50 it refers to consists of only few houses, but it has a long pedigree as a named area, appearing on state and national maps. Most likely, it understanding as a geographical entity stems from the fact that the <span class="loc">Little River</span> Turnpike (first toll road in <span class="loc">America</span>) and Aldie-Ashby's Gap Turnpike terminated approximately together here, 1.3 miles west of <span class="loc">Aldie</span>. There are four <span class="loc">Virginia</span> historical markers at the site, commemorating <span class="per">John Champe</span>, Revolutionary War Hero, and three Civil War markers, including one mentioning the Battle of <span class="loc">Aldie</span>. Its two distinguishing features are Stoke (a prominent house where <span class="per">Teddy Roosevelt</span> was a frequent guest) and the <span class="per">Champe</span> <span class="org">Ford</span> Memorial (an obelisk commemorating <span class="per">John Champe</span>, handpicked by <span class="loc">George Washington</span> to re-capture <span class="per">Benedict Arnold</span> after his defection to the British side. He came very close to succeeding, but at the last moment, <span class="per">Arnold</span> changed plans and the whole endeavor had to be called off. His house was at the crossing of the <span class="loc">Little River</span> where the monument stands <span class="date">today</span>, but the house itself had collapsed (according to <span class="per">Col. Harris</span> of Stoke) "sometime in the [19]20s." He only realized when reading an old journal that one of his old buildings had to have been <span class="per">Champe</span>'s residence.</p><br><br>
