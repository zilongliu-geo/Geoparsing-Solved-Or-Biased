  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Easton is a town in <span class="loc">Aroostook County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,287 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In <span class="date">1851</span> the first known residence in the Easton wilderness was built by <span class="per">Henry Wilson</span>, who had taught school in <span class="loc">Presque Isle</span>. When Solomon Bolster arrived in <span class="date">1854</span>, he joined <span class="per">Henry Wilson</span> and <span class="per">Augustus Rackliffe</span>, its sole residents. In 1855-1856, <span class="per">Noah Barker</span> partitioned the township into 142 lots of 160 acres in size, thereby determining its layout. The state opened it for settlement, and on <span class="date">July 26, 1856</span> it was organized as the Fremont Plantation. A schoolhouse was built in <span class="date">1858</span> and the first of several lumber mills was constructed in another year. By <span class="date">1860</span> the population was 320. Growth of the population slowed during the Civil War, and the town of Easton was incorporated <span class="date">1865</span>. Economic growth was slow, evidenced by an <span class="date">1862</span> record that taxes should be paid in grain or shingles. The first store was opened in <span class="date">1863</span>. A starch factory was built in <span class="date">1877</span>, and a steam shingle mill in <span class="date">1879</span>. Easton became "one of the greatest potato producing towns in the County. . . The 1880s saw the appearance of the Methodists and the Free Will Baptists--also the Odd Fellows. By <span class="date">1880</span> the population was 835; by <span class="date">1890</span>, 978.</p><br><br>
