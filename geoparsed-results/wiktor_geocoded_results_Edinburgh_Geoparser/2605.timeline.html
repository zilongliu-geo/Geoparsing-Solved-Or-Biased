  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Palenque</span> is a city and municipality located in the north of the state of <span class="loc">Chiapas</span>, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The city was named <span class="date">almost 200 years</span> before the famous nearby Mayan ruins were discovered in the 18th century. The area has a significant indigenous population, mostly of the Ch'ol people, a Mayan descendent. The city is the only urban area in a municipality of over 600 communities and it is surrounded by rainforest. However, deforestation has had dramatic effects on the local environment, with howler monkeys occasionally seen in the city itself as they look for food. While most of the municipality’s population is highly marginalized economically, working in agriculture, the <span class="loc">Palenque</span> archeological site is one of the most important tourist attractions for both the area and the state of <span class="loc">Chiapas</span>. It is the poorest major city in the state of <span class="loc">Chiapas</span>. <span class="loc">Palenque</span> refers both to the modern city and the municipality for which it is the local governing authority. As of <span class="date">2010</span>, the municipality had a total population of 110,918. As of <span class="date">2010</span>, the <span class="loc">city of Palenque</span> had a population of 42,947, up from 37,301 as of <span class="date">2005</span>. Other than the <span class="loc">city of Palenque</span>, the municipality had 950 localities, the largest of which (with 2010 populations in parentheses) were: Río Chancalá (2,156), <span class="per">Doctor Samuel</span> León Brindis (1,320), Agua Blanca Serranía (1,263), Arimatea (1,251), and Profresor <span class="loc">Roberto Barrios</span> (1,173), classified as rural.</p><br><br>
