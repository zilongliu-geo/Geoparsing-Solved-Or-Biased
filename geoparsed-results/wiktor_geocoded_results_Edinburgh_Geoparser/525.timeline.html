  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Alexandria</span> is a city in and the parish seat of <span class="loc">Rapides Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies on the south bank of the <span class="loc">Red River</span> in almost the exact geographic center of the state. It is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Alexandria</span> metropolitan area (population 153,922) which encompasses all of <span class="per">Rapides</span> and <span class="per">Grant</span> parishes. Its neighboring city is <span class="loc">Pineville</span>. In <span class="date">2010</span>, the population was 47,723, an increase of 3 percent from the <span class="date">2000</span> census. Located along the <span class="loc">Red River</span>, the <span class="loc">city of Alexandria</span> was originally home to a community which supported activities of the adjacent Spanish outpost of Post du <span class="per">Rapides</span>. The area developed as an assemblage of traders and merchants in the agricultural lands bordering the mostly unsettled areas to the north and providing a link from the south to the <span class="loc">El Camino Real</span> and then larger settlement of Natchitoches, the oldest permanent settlement in the <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> Purchase. <span class="per">Alexander Fulton</span>, a businessman from <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, near <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, received a land grant from <span class="loc">Spain</span> in <span class="date">1785</span>, and the first organized settlement was made at some point in the 1790s. In <span class="date">1805</span>, <span class="per">Fulton</span> and business partner <span class="per">Thomas Harris</span> Maddox laid out the town plan and named the town in <span class="per">Fulton</span>'s honor. The earliest deed that survives, for an <span class="loc">Alexandria</span> resident is from <span class="date">June 24, 1805</span> when a <span class="per">William Cochren</span> who identifies himself as a "of the Town of <span class="loc">Alexandria</span>" sold a tract of land across the <span class="loc">Red River</span> to a <span class="per">William</span> Murrey.[<span class="loc">Louisiana</span> State Land Office, Historical Records, Sales Documents, South Western District, Sales Letters, 39].</p><br><br>
