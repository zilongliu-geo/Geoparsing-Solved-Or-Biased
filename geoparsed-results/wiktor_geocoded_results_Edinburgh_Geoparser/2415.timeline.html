  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Jefferson is an unincorporated community located in <span class="loc">Frederick County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, established in <span class="date">1774</span>, incorporated as a town in <span class="date">1831</span>. However, <span class="date">a year later</span>, in <span class="date">1832</span>, the citizens of the town decided that municipal government was unnecessary, thus, it was disincorporated. According to archaeologist <span class="per">Mary F. Barse</span>, Jefferson was initially laid out in <span class="date">1774</span> on a 96-acre (390,000 m2) tract owned by <span class="per">Mrs. Eleanor Medley</span> and called New Town. It contained 40 rectangular lots – 20 aligned on each side of MD 180 – stretching between what are <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Lander</span> <span class="per">Road</span> and <span class="per">Old</span> <span class="loc">Middletown</span> Road. In <span class="date">1795</span>, twenty-two additional lots were platted by <span class="per">Elias Delashmutt</span> on the western end of the original section, and called <span class="loc">New Freedom</span>. It was not until <span class="date">1831</span> that both sections were incorporated as Jefferson by the <span class="loc">Maryland</span> Legislature. Jefferson’s growth in the 19th century was due largely to its location on the main road between <span class="per">Frederick</span> and <span class="per">Harpers</span> Ferry, <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 340. Wagon traffic and livestock drives were frequent. Concomitantly, commercial development intensified to serve the surrounding farms as well as travelers. It was during this mid 19th century period of commercial growth during which Hemp's Meats was established in <span class="date">1849</span>. This butchering shop has continuously served the local community under Hemp family ownership since it opened its doors in <span class="date">1849</span>.</p><br><br>
