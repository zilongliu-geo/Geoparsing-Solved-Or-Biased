  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Sterling</span> is a Home Rule Municipality that is the county seat and the most populous city of <span class="loc">Logan County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city population was 18,211 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="org">Sterling</span> is located at 40°37′32″N 103°12′42″W (40.625430, -103.211783). It is 128 miles (206 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Denver</span>, and is located on Interstate 76, on the 'eastern plains' of northeastern <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.9 square miles (18 km2), all of it land. The original inhabitants of the <span class="loc">Colorado</span> <span class="loc">High Plains</span> near <span class="org">Sterling</span> were probably paleo-Indians of the Clovis culture. The earliest known European visitors (post-Spanish exploration) to the area were primarily French fur trappers searching for fertile beaver streams in the late-1700s. By that time, the principal Indian tribes occupying the region were the <span class="per">Arapaho</span> and <span class="per">Cheyenne</span>, although war and hunting parties of other Plains tribes such as the <span class="loc">Sioux</span> and <span class="loc">Pawnee</span> probably passed through. Organized exploration of the area by Americans began with the visit on <span class="date">June 26, 1820</span> of the expedition of Major <span class="per">Stephen Harriman Long</span>, who referred to much of the area between the <span class="loc">Missouri River</span> and the <span class="loc">Rocky Mountains</span> as "The <span class="loc">Great American Desert</span>". One of the final battles of the Indian wars in <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="org">the Battle of Summit Springs</span> between Tall Bull and his <span class="per">Cheyenne</span> Dog Soldiers and <span class="per">Colonel Eugene A. Carr</span> and the <span class="org">U.S. Army</span> took place near <span class="org">Sterling</span> on <span class="date">July 11, 1869</span>.</p><br><br>
