  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Braemar</span> /breɪˈmɑːr/ is a village in <span class="loc">Aberdeenshire</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, around 58 miles (93 km) west of <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> in the Highlands. It is the closest significantly-sized settlement to the upper course of the <span class="loc">River Dee</span> sitting at an altitude of 339 metres (1,112 ft). The Gaelic Bràigh Mhàrr properly refers to the area of upper <span class="loc">Marr</span> (as it literally means), i.e. the area of <span class="loc">Marr</span> to the west of <span class="loc">Aboyne</span>, the village itself being <span class="loc">Castleton</span> of <span class="loc">Braemar</span> (Baile a' Chaisteil). The village used to be known as Cinn Drochaid (bridge end); <span class="loc">Baile</span> a' Chaisteil referred to only the part of the village on the east bank of the river, the part on the west bank being known as <span class="loc">Ach</span> an Droighinn (thorn field). <span class="loc">Braemar</span> is approached from the South on the A93 from <span class="loc">Glen Clunie</span> and the <span class="loc">Cairnwell Pass</span> and from the East also on the A93 from <span class="loc">Deeside</span>. <span class="loc">Braemar</span> can be approached on foot from the West through <span class="loc">Glen Tilt</span>, <span class="loc">Glen Feshie</span>, <span class="loc">Glen Dee</span> (by the <span class="loc">Lairig Ghru</span>), and <span class="loc">Glen Derry</span> (by the <span class="loc">Lairig an Laoigh</span>). <span class="loc">Braemar</span> is within a one-and-a-half hour drive of <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span>, <span class="loc">Dundee</span>, and <span class="loc">Perth</span>.</p><br><br>
