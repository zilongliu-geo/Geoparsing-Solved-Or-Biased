  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Grand jury indicts pair in <span class="loc">Des Plaines</span> nun scam. A federal grand jury in <span class="loc">Milwaukee</span> has returned a three-count indictment against a <span class="loc">Chicago</span> couple accused of posing as destitute Kenyan refugees and scamming Carmelite nuns in <span class="loc">Pewaukee</span> out of more than $800,000. Acting <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Attorney <span class="per">Michelle Jacobs</span> announced the indictment <span class="date">Tuesday</span> charging 35-year-old Angela Martin-Mulu and 39-year-old <span class="per">Edward Bosire</span> with mail fraud. The two Kenyan citizens arrived in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> in <span class="date">1999</span> and received political asylum in <span class="date">2007</span>. The indictment said the two targeted religious orders by claiming they suffered from illnesses and needed money for medical bills or education, at the same time maintaining apartments in <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and <span class="loc">Bolingbrook</span>, Ill., and spending much of the money at casinos or on things unrelated to medical or educational expenses. An FBI affidavit has said the married couple first visited the Pewaukee monastery in <span class="date">December 2004</span> and told the nuns they were brother and sister, homeless and would be killed if they were deported to <span class="loc">Kenya</span>. Prosecutors said the nuns gave them cash and checks over a three-year period, totaling about $815,000 before the scheme was discovered. <span class="per">Sister Mary Agnes</span> has said the money came from the nuns' health fund, and she declined to say how much of the fund had been depleted. She said the nuns don't have health insurance because it's too expensive.</p><br><br>
