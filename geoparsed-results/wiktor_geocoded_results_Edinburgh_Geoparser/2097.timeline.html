As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 77,435. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat and largest city is <span class="loc">Pine Bluff</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>'s 21st county, formed on <span class="date">November 2, 1829</span>, from portions of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> and <span class="loc">Pulaski</span> counties, and named for <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span>, third President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Pine Bluff</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county is bisected by the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River, which was critical to its development and long the chief transportation byway. The area that would later become <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was occupied by the <span class="loc">Quapaw</span> when French explorers established the <span class="org">Arkansas Post</span> in the 17th century; the foreigners claimed this area as <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, part of New <span class="loc">France</span>. In <span class="date">March 1819</span>, <span class="per">Robert Crittenden</span> was appointed secretary of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Territory. That same year, Joseph Bonne, traveling upstream on the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River from <span class="org">Arkansas Post</span>, built a cabin on a “high bluff covered with pine trees” on the river’s south bank. <span class="date">Several years later</span>, <span class="per">James Scull</span>, also from <span class="org">Arkansas Post</span>, established a tavern and small inn on the river's north bank, across from what would become the site of <span class="loc">Pine Bluff</span>.</p><br><br>
