<p>Trenton is a city in <span class="loc">Gibson County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The population was 4,264 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Gibson County</span>, and its third largest city. Trenton is located at 35°58′25″N 88°56′30″W (35.973627, -88.941569). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.6 square miles (15 km2), of which 5.5 square miles (14 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (0.90%) is water. Trenton is most famous for its collection of rare antique porcelain veilleuses, donated by the late Dr. Frederick C. Freed in 1955. The teapots are unique because the candle's glow illuminates the pot's exterior, thus serving as a night light. None of the 525 teapots in this collection are alike, and some are designed as palaces or people in unique still-life castings. The town celebrates its collection with an annual "Teapot Festival" held each spring since 1981. Trenton is also known for its unusual speed limit of 31 miles per hour (50 km/h), established by the city in the 1950s and posted by signs throughout the town.</p>
