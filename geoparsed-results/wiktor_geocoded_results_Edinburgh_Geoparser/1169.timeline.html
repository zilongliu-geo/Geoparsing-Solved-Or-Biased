  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Costa Rica</span> is the name of a small town located about 30 minutes (by car) south of Culiac√°n, <span class="loc">Sinaloa</span>, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. In its beginnings <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span> was a small peasant town created due to the existence of the sugar cane processing plant that was there. In <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, there were just about 15,000 people in the town but it was thriving with commerce. Its people were known to be very polite. There were 2 movie theaters and plenty of restaurants. The more popular places were the Farmacia Del Capi, El Restaurante <span class="loc">Lety</span>, <span class="loc">La</span> Neveria De Juvencio, El Mercado <span class="per">Nuevo</span> and <span class="per">La</span> Ferreteria Gutierrez, among others. The sugar cane industry was very prosperous. Then came the closing of the plant due to mismanagement and thousands became unemployed. <span class="date">Now</span> most employment is offered by the service sector, but people continue to struggle to make ends meet. Like other cities in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, the city of <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span>, <span class="loc">Sinaloa</span>'s condition is a result of corruption and narcotraffic. While most of the people try to make an honest living, there is a part of the population that live out of the narcotraffic business. <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span>, <span class="loc">Sinaloa</span> is a city plagued by corruption, a city where stolen cars are driven freely and the authorities do not care about it as long as they receive their cut. <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span>, <span class="loc">Sinaloa</span> is a city full of brand new cars and dirt roads. Where many businesses flourish without paying taxes, which contribute to the lack of public services available in the city. But as of late more of the city's tax money is being used for the prosperity of the people of <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span>, which includes its first street light.</p><br><br>
