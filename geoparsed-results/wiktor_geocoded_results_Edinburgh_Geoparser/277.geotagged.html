<p>Ada is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Pontotoc County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 16,810 at the 2010 census, an increase of 7.1 percent from 15,691 at the 2000 census. The city was named for Ada Reed, the daughter of an early settler, and was incorporated in 1901. Ada is home to East Central University, and is the headquarters of the Chickasaw Nation. Ada is an <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> Main Street City, an <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> Certified City, and a Tree City <span class="loc">USA</span> member. In the late 1880s, the <span class="loc">Daggs</span> family (by way of <span class="loc">Texas</span>) became the first white family to settle what is now known as Ada, which was formerly known as <span class="loc">Daggs</span> Prairie. In April 1889, Jeff Reed (a native <span class="loc">Texan</span>, and relative of the <span class="loc">Daggs</span> family) was appointed to carry the mail from Stonewall to Center (which was later combined with <span class="loc">Pickett</span>), two small communities in then Indian Territory. With his family and his stock, he sought a place for a home on a prairie midway between the two points, where he constructed a log house and started Reed's Store. Other settlers soon built homes nearby. In 1891, a post office was established and named after Reed's oldest daughter, Ada. Ada incorporated as a city in 1901 and grew rapidly with the arrival of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway line. Within a decade the Santa Fe Railroad and the Oklahoma Central Railway also served the town.</p>
