  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Physicians and others are struggling to address a growing outbreak of influenza affecting a large portion of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="date">Earlier this week</span>, the Mayor of <span class="loc">Boston</span> declared a "flu emergency" for the city, as 700 cases of the virus were reported. Public officials in <span class="loc">Texas</span> have urged citizens to receive a flu shot. The state's public health Commissioner said in a press release, "The best thing people can do to protect themselves is to get a dose of flu vaccine <span class="date">now</span>." Doctors are telling citizens to wash their hands, get a flu shot and avoid sick people if possible to lessen chances of catching the virus. However, a report released on <span class="date">Friday</span> noted that 7.3% of deaths <span class="date">last week</span> were a result of pneumonia and the flu. A total of 20 children in the <span class="loc">United States</span> have died during this flu season from flu-related illnesses. <span class="org">The Centers for Disease Control</span> reports nine out of 10 regions in the <span class="loc">United States</span> had "elevated" flu activity. These data indicate that seasonal flu has spread and reached high levels <span class="date">several weeks</span> before the usual time of <span class="date">late January</span> or <span class="date">February</span>. New York <span class="per">Governor Andrew M. Cuomo</span> declared a state-wide public health emergency on <span class="date">Saturday</span>. He also issued an executive order which allows pharmacists to administer flu vaccinations to patients between <span class="date">six months</span> and <span class="date">18 years</span> of age.</p><br><br>
