<p>Alamo is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Contra</span> <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a suburb located in the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> Bay Area's <span class="loc">East Bay</span> region, approximately 28 miles (45 km) east of <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>. Alamo is equidistant between the city of <span class="loc">Walnut Creek</span> and the town of <span class="loc">Danville</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 14,750. Alamo (from the Spanish Ã¡lamo, "poplar") was named for the poplar trees that lined <span class="loc">San Ramon Creek</span>. As an unincorporated community, Alamo does not have a government of its own. Police services are provided by the <span class="loc">Contra</span> Costa County Office of the Sheriff. Fire and EMS services are provided by the San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District. Alamo, with a median household income of $140,561 (as of 2011), is one of the wealthiest communities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In August, 2007, a group of citizens launched a new initiative to incorporate the community, the latest in a series of attempts that go back to the early 1960s or before. Previous failed Alamo incorporation efforts always included parts of other nearby unincorporated areas: Alamo-Danville (1964) and Alamo-Danville-San Ramon (1976). This latest Alamo incorporation effort was defeated by referendum in March, 2009.</p>
