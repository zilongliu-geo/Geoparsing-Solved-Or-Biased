<p><span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Grafton County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, in the White Mountains Region. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is located at the convergence of the Pemigewasset and Baker rivers. The population was 6,990 at the 2010 census. The town is home to Plymouth State University, Speare Memorial Hospital, and Plymouth Regional High School. The town's central settlement, where 4,456 people resided at the 2010 census (primarily <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> State students), is defined as the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> census-designated place (CDP), and is located along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 3, south of the confluence of the Baker and Pemigewasset rivers. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> was originally the site of an Abenaki village that was burned to the ground by Captain Thomas Baker in 1712. This was just one of the many British raids on American Indian settlements during Queen Anne's War. Part of a large plot of undivided land in the <span class="loc">Pemigewasset</span> Valley, the town was first named <span class="loc">New Plymouth</span>, after the original <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span> in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth granted <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> to settlers from <span class="loc">Hollis</span>, all of whom had been soldiers in the French and Indian War. Some had originally come from <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The town was incorporated in 1763. Parts of <span class="loc">Hebron</span> and <span class="loc">Campton</span> were annexed in 1845 and 1860.</p>
