  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Bowling Green</span> students endorse fee for new arena. <span class="loc">BOWLING GREEN</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span> (AP) &#x97; Students at <span class="loc">Bowling Green</span> State University have voted to approve a fee to help build a new campus arena. In an online vote, 2,630 undergraduates cast ballots in favor of the $60-per-semester fee, and 1,182 opposed it. The school said <span class="date">Saturday</span> that about 28 percent of the eligible student population voted. Public universities must get an OK from the <span class="org">Ohio Board</span> of Regents before they can raise fees, and a show of student support is a requirement for that approval. Collection of the new student fee wouldn't begin until the $36 million arena is finished in <span class="date">late 2011</span>. The proposed 4,700-seat arena would replace <span class="loc">Anderson Arena</span> as the home for basketball and volleyball games and would also would be used for concerts and other events.</p><br><br>
