The municipality has a surface of 827.1 km2 (319 sq mi) and is bordered by <span class="loc">San Javier</span> and Longaví on the north, by <span class="loc">Parral</span> on the south, by <span class="loc">Cauquenes (Province</span> of <span class="loc">Cauquenes</span>), on the west and by Longaví on the east. The commune was founded officially on <span class="date">December 22, 1891</span>. President Ramón <span class="per">Barros Luco</span> owned a manor house in this area. <span class="loc">Retiro</span> was, therefore, visited frequently by well-known politicians and statesmen of the time, and in general by those that contributed to the decision-making process in the country affairs. The name of "Retiro" (Retirement) was given to the commune on account of being the place of retirement - leisure - of <span class="per">President Barros Luco</span>.</p><br><br>
