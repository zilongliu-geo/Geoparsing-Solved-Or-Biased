<p><span class="loc">Toledo</span> is a city located on the <span class="loc">Yaquina River</span> and along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 20 in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. The population was 3,465 at the 2010 census. The city was a 2009 <span class="loc">All-America City</span> Award finalist. European-American settlement in <span class="loc">Toledo</span> began in 1866, when John Graham, his son Joseph, and William Mackey, claimed land made available by the Homestead Act. The site was called "Graham's Landing" until a post office was established two years later. Joseph D. Graham, John's son, named the post office for <span class="loc">Toledo</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, because he was homesick. William Mackey was the first postmaster. <span class="loc">Toledo</span> was made the county seat of the newly established <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> in 1893. The city incorporated in 1893 and reincorporated in 1905. Charles Barton Crosno served as the first mayor. The county seat moved from <span class="loc">Toledo</span> to <span class="loc">Newport</span> in 1953. In 1918, the Port of <span class="loc">Toledo</span> leased land to the Spruce Production Division for a sawmill to cut airplane frames for World War I. However, before production began, the war ended. C. D. Johnson and associates then bought the mill and related equipment, which by 1923 processed logs shipped to <span class="loc">Toledo</span> by rail. Georgia-Pacific acquired the operation in 1951 and turned it into a pulp mill.</p>
