<p><span class="loc">Brighton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Northumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, approximately 150 kilometres (93 mi) east of <span class="loc">Toronto</span> and 100 km (62 mi) west of Kingston. It is traversed by both Highway 401 and the former Highway 2. The west end of the <span class="loc">Murray</span> Canal that leads east to the <span class="loc">Bay of Quinte</span> is at the east end of the town. <span class="loc">Brighton</span> was primarily an agricultural community, specializing in the farming of apples and production of new apple types. However, in recent years, many of the original orchards in the area have been partially removed, to make way for the steadily growing population, and more profitable agricultural produce, such as: wheat, corn and soybeans. In late September, <span class="loc">Brighton</span> is host to Applefest, its largest yearly festival. The Municipality of <span class="loc">Brighton</span> (formed on January 1, 2001, through an amalgamation of the former Town of <span class="loc">Brighton</span> and <span class="loc">Brighton Township</span>) is home to nearly 11,000 inhabitants, with a higher than average percentage of those retired. This is common, as the quiet, clean and friendly atmosphere of many smaller towns near lake <span class="loc">Ontario</span> tend to draw the elderly as popular places for retirement living. Many small hamlets surround the town, including <span class="loc">Codrington</span>, <span class="loc">Carman</span>, <span class="loc">Hilton</span>, <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> and <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>.</p>
