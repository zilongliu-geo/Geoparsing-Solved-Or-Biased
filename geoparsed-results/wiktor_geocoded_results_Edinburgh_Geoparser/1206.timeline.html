  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Bedford</span> is a borough and the county seat of <span class="loc">Bedford County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. It is located 102 miles (164 km) west of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, the state capital, and 107 miles (172 km) east of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Bedford County</span>. <span class="per">Bedford</span>'s population was 2,841 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Growing up around <span class="loc">Fort Bedford</span>, which had been constructed near the trading post called <span class="loc">Raystown</span>, <span class="loc">Bedford</span> was settled about <span class="date">1751</span> and laid out in <span class="date">1766</span>. <span class="per">Bedford</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">March 13, 1795</span>. For <span class="date">many years</span> it was an important frontier military post. The <span class="org">Espy House</span> in <span class="per">Bedford</span> is notable for having been the headquarters of <span class="loc">George Washington</span> and his force of 13,000 while putting down the Whiskey Rebellion in <span class="date">1794</span>, which had started around the Jean Bonnet Tavern just west of <span class="loc">Bedford</span>. In <span class="date">1758</span> the British Army came to the vicinity of <span class="loc">John Ray</span>'s trading post to set up <span class="loc">Fort Bedford</span>, named for the politically powerful <span class="per">Duke of Bedford</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. Some believe this is how the town later got its name. <span class="loc">Fort Bedford</span> was built as one of the many British Army stepping stones through the state leading to the forks of the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>; the other side of the forks was dominated by Indians. The British used the fort to drive out the French to ensure the new continent would be British controlled. The fort was later a safe house for settlers escaping Indian raids. <span class="loc">Fort Bedford</span> was "liberated" <span class="date">ten years</span> before the Revolution by American rebels, <span class="per">James Smith</span>'s Black Boys, and was the first fort taken from the British. The fort later collapsed; it was reconstructed in <span class="date">1958</span>.</p><br><br>
