  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Eureka</span> is a mining ghost town in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Juan County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along the Animas River, between <span class="loc">Silverton</span> and <span class="loc">Animas Forks</span>. <span class="per">Charles Baker</span>'s group of prospectors found traces of placer gold in the <span class="loc">San Juan</span> Mountains in <span class="date">1860</span> at <span class="org">Eureka</span>. Forced by the Ute Tribe out in <span class="date">1861</span>, who had been awarded the area in a <span class="loc">US</span> treaty. The prospectors returned in <span class="date">1871</span>, when lode gold was found in the Little Giant vein at <span class="loc">Arrastre Gulch</span> near <span class="loc">Silverton</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. The miners were allowed to stay after the Brunot Treaty of <span class="date">13 Sept. 1873</span>. In exchange for giving up 4 million acres, the <span class="loc">Southern Ute Indian Reservation</span> received $25,000 per year. By <span class="date">1875</span>, <span class="org">Eureka</span> had a post office. The original mill was closed (reasons unknown) but to replace it, the Gold Prince Mill from <span class="loc">Animas Forks</span> was deconstructed and moved to the <span class="org">Eureka</span> townsite to become the <span class="loc">Sunnyside</span> mill. In <span class="date">1896</span>, <span class="org">Eureka</span> was connected to the <span class="loc">Denver</span> and <span class="loc">Rio</span> Grande Railroad via the <span class="loc">Silverton</span> Northern Railroad. Although the community grew steadily — not like a boomtown — it quickly declined after <span class="date">1939</span>, when the <span class="loc">Sunnyside</span> Mill closed for the last time. <span class="date">Today</span>, the original townsite gravel roads remain, and debris litters the area. The only remaining structure is the <span class="org">Eureka</span> jail, which has been restored. Foundations remain of the <span class="loc">Sunnyside</span> mill.</p><br><br>
