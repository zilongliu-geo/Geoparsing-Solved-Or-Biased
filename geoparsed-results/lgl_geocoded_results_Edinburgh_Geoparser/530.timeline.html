Pulitzer-prize winning author <span class="per">Alice Walker</span>, who wrote "The Color Purple," is traveling to <span class="loc">Gaza</span> along with other female activists to highlight the devastation wrought by the <span class="date">three week</span> long Israeli offensive against the Hamas terror rulers of <span class="loc">Gaza</span>. Pulitzer-prize winning author <span class="per">Alice Walker</span>, who wrote "The Color Purple," is traveling to <span class="loc">Gaza</span> along with other female activists on <span class="date">Sunday</span>. Photo: <span class="per">AP Walker</span>, who was making her first trip to <span class="loc">Gaza</span>, said it was important for Americans who give so much military aid to <span class="loc">Israel</span> to understand how their money was being used. <span class="per">Walker</span> is part of a group of about 60 women going to <span class="loc">Gaza</span> to deliver aid and meet with NGOs and residents. The trip, organized by the <span class="loc">US</span> anti-war group Code Pink, is intended to push both <span class="loc">Israel</span> and <span class="loc">Egypt</span> to open the borders into <span class="loc">Gaza</span>, said <span class="per">Medea Benjamin</span>, co-founder of Code Pink who helped organize the trip.</p><br><br>
