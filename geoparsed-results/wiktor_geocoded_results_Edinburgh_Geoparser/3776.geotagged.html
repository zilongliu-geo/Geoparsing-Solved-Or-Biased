<p><span class="loc">Moira</span> (from Irish: Maigh Rath, meaning "plain of the streams or wheels") is a village and civil parish in <span class="loc">County Down</span>, <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>. It is in the northwest of the country, near the borders with counties <span class="loc">Antrim</span> and <span class="loc">Armagh</span>. The M1 motorway and Belfastâ€“Dublin railway line are nearby. The settlement has existed since time immemorial. In a 2008 estimate the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency approximated the population of <span class="loc">Moira</span> to be 4,221. The etymology of <span class="loc">Moira</span> is somewhat uncertain. It seems to be an anglicisation of the Irish Maigh Rath, which may mean either 'plain of the wheels' or 'plain of the ringforts'. Another Irish form of the name is Mag Rath. The change most probably occurred during or before the Plantation of <span class="loc">Ulster</span>. Regardless <span class="loc">Moira</span> has now evolved to become both the official name and the one in everyday use. <span class="loc">Moira</span> has been a settlement for at least 1,500 years. For the period it consisted most probably only of small dwellings surrounded by several earthen ringforts. Evidence of three such forts still remain. The best known of these is the so-called "Rough Fort", situated on the Old Kilmore Road. However the remains of "Pretty Mary's Fort" exist behind the <span class="loc">Waringfield</span> residential area. Finally evidence of a third ringfort can be found near <span class="loc">Claremont</span>.</p>
