  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Holbrook</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Derbyshire</span> at the southern end of the <span class="loc">Pennines</span> around five miles north of <span class="per">Derby</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> lies about two miles to the north-east of <span class="loc">Duffield</span>, the parish of which it was a part, being within <span class="loc">Duffield</span> <span class="loc">Frith</span>. When the latter was seized by King <span class="per">Henry III</span> following the rebellion of <span class="per">Robert de Ferrers</span>, 6th <span class="per">Earl of Derby</span> it appears to have been spared. However it became the property of <span class="per">Edmund Crouchback</span> along with the rest of the <span class="loc">Frith</span>. It was sold by the <span class="org">Crown</span> to various local copyholders in the reign of <span class="per">Charles I</span>. It included the capital messuage, called Cocksbench, or <span class="loc">Coxbench</span> Hall. <span class="loc">Coxbench</span>, which is a hamlet just to the south, is supposed to have been the "Herdebi" mentioned in the Domesday Survey, as held under <span class="per">Henry de Ferrers</span>; and the adjoining part of the manor of <span class="loc">Horsley</span> is supposed to have been the "Herdebi" held under <span class="per">Ralph de Burun</span>. In <span class="date">1863</span>, <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> (or Holbrooke) was created as a separate parish from that of <span class="loc">Duffield</span>. The church of <span class="per">St. Michael</span> is a simple construction in stone built in <span class="date">1761</span> by <span class="per">Rev. S. Bradshaw</span>. It was rebuilt and enlarged in <span class="date">1841</span> by the MP <span class="per">William Evans</span>.</p><br><br>
