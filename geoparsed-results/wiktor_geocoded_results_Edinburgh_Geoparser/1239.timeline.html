  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Rende</span> is a town and comune in <span class="loc">Calabria</span>, southern <span class="loc">Italy</span>, home to the headquarters of the <span class="org">University of Calabria</span>. It has a population of about 35,000, or more than 60,000 if the university students living there are taken into account. It is divided in two parts: the old town, which is stands on a high hill, and the modern area, on level ground, which is part of the urban area of <span class="loc">Cosenza</span> and is the centre of the city's economy. The ancient Enotrii, coming from the plain of <span class="per">Sant'Eufemia</span> and <span class="per">Clampetia</span> (Amantea), founded near the river which they called Acheronte the early Acheruntia and subsequently Pandosia. The florid area was unfit to defend during conflict, so some Acheruntini left the area to take refuge in a more defensible site: <span class="date">today</span>'s Nogiano. This new settlement, which dates from <span class="date">520 BC</span>, was named Aruntia ("the houses of the strong") and then Arintha. Hecataeus of <span class="loc">Miletus</span>, who lived in <span class="date">500 BC</span>, cites Arintha as the <span class="loc">City of Bretia</span> of Enotra origin. During Roman domination, Arintha was a Municipio, but when Spartacus with his army passed through the valley of the <span class="loc">Crati</span>, many Acheruntini followed him. With the arrival of the barbarians close to Cosentia the Acheruntini offered a brave and staunch resistance, but despite their efforts all areas of Arintha fell into the hands of barbarians in <span class="date">547 AD</span>. In later <span class="date">centuries</span>, as well as many common Calabrian, Arintha subdued the Byzantine and Muslim rulers; Muslims countered by Acheruntini that in <span class="date">721 AD</span> took part in the struggle for the liberation of the territory of <span class="loc">Naples</span>. The Saracens' reaction was tough and the <span class="loc">Cities of Arintha</span>, <span class="loc">Bisignano</span>, <span class="loc">Montalto</span> and <span class="loc">Cosenza</span> suffered retaliation by the Muslims, but in <span class="date">921 AD</span> an important battle was won and the valley of <span class="loc">Crati</span> was freed by Muslim oppression. Saracens returned more than before and forced the rebels to take refuge in <span class="loc">Sila</span>; they could return to their lands only with the coming of the <span class="loc">Normans</span> in <span class="date">1059</span>. Arintha was under the direct control of the <span class="loc">Normans</span>, particularly <span class="per">Robert Guiscard</span>, which imposed on the City payment of tributes and the presence of a "Lord", the archbishop of <span class="loc">Cosenza</span>. But in <span class="date">1091</span> the entire <span class="loc">district of Cosenza</span> rebelled for the taxes too high. <span class="per">Roger Borsa</span>, the son of <span class="per">Robert Guiscard</span> and designated heir, succeeded his father in the management of the territory. He asked the involvement of <span class="per">Roger I</span>, his uncle, and Bohemond, his brother, who repressed the rebellion by force. Bohemond obtained the control of the <span class="loc">county of Cosenza</span>. Bohemond dâ€™Hauteville decided to build a castle on the solitary hill between streams <span class="per">Surdo</span> and <span class="per">Emoli</span>, which dominates valley of the <span class="loc">Crati</span>. The massive structure was finished in <span class="date">1095</span> with the help of Mirandi Artifices. In this period, for the first time appears in official documents the name <span class="loc">Renne</span>, it means Kingdom in the old French language (idiom of the <span class="loc">Normans</span> in Southern <span class="loc">Italy</span> in that period).</p><br><br>
