<p><span class="loc">Sorrento</span> ([s̪oˈr̺ːɛn̪t̪o]; Neapolitan: Surriento [s̪uˈr̺ːi̯en̺d̪ə]) is a town overlooking the <span class="loc">Bay of Naples</span> in Southern <span class="loc">Italy</span>. A popular tourist destination, it can be reached easily from <span class="loc">Naples</span> and <span class="loc">Pompeii</span> as it is at the south-eastern end of the Circumvesuviana rail line. The <span class="loc">Sorrentine</span> Peninsula has views of <span class="loc">Naples</span>, <span class="loc">Vesuvius</span> and the <span class="loc">Isle of Capri</span>. The <span class="loc">Amalfi</span> Drive, connecting <span class="loc">Sorrento</span> and <span class="loc">Amalfi</span>, is a narrow road that threads along the high cliffs above the <span class="loc">Tyrrhenian Sea</span>. Ferries and hydrofoils connect the town to <span class="loc">Naples</span>, <span class="loc">Amalfi</span>, <span class="loc">Positano</span>, <span class="loc">Capri</span> and <span class="loc">Ischia</span>. <span class="loc">Sorrento</span>'s sea cliffs and luxury hotels have attracted celebrities including Enrico Caruso and Luciano Pavarotti. Limoncello is a digestif made from lemon rinds, alcohol, water and sugar which is produced in <span class="loc">Sorrento</span>. Other agricultural production includes citrus fruit, wine, nuts and olives. The Roman name for <span class="loc">Sorrento</span> was Surrentum. Legends indicate a close connection between Lipara and Surrentum, as though the latter had been a colony of the former; and even through the Imperial period Surrentum remained largely Greek. The oldest ruins are Oscan, dating from about 600 BC. Before its control by the Roman Republic, Surrentum was one of the towns subject to Nuceria, and shared its fortunes up to the Social War; it seems to have joined in the revolt of 90 BC like Stabiae; and was reduced to obedience in the following year, when it seems to have received a colony.</p>
