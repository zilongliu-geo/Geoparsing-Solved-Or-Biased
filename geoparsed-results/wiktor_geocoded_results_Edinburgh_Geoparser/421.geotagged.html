Their choice was fifty acres, 37 and one half of which were owned by Joseph Blythe and 12 and one half owned by Peter Ruff, both of whom gifted the land. A public square, streets, alleys and 104 lots were laid off and the lots were sold at auction over a two-day period in either March or April 1823. <span class="loc">Paris</span> was incorporated on September 30, 1823.
