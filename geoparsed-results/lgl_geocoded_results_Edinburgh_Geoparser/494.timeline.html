  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Springfield City</span> Council OKs renewal plan designation for Chapman Valve plant site. Still, officials and residents said, the council's 9-0 vote is a welcome sign toward getting the former Chapman Valve site to thrive again. "We've waited a very long time for this. We've looking forward to it being developed," said Susan M. Craven Soto, president of the <span class="org">Indian Orchard Citizens Council</span>. Chapman Valve at <span class="per">Goodwin</span> and <span class="per">Pinevale</span> streets once was the world's largest manufacturers of all kinds of valves, including fire hydrants, and employed nearly 3,500 people. The plant moved here from <span class="loc">Boston</span> in <span class="date">1874</span>. <span class="org">Crane Co.</span>, of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, bought the company in <span class="date">1959</span> and closed it in <span class="date">1988</span>. The plant milled uranium at Chapman Valve in <span class="date">the late 1940s</span> in a nuclear power project for the <span class="org">Brookhaven National Laboratory</span> on <span class="loc">Long Island</span>, <span class="loc">N.Y</span>. The <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Navy cleaned the site and recent city tests have shown it to be radiation-free, officials have said. But the site also is likely to contain oils, asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyl, commonly known as PCB's, man-made organic chemicals banned in <span class="date">1979</span>, officials have said. Another problem is the discovery in <span class="date">the past few years</span> of a series of underground tunnels and pits, prompting questions about the strength of the foundation. The Chapman Valve plant has been demolished. The city owns two parcels, or nearly 14 acres. The remaining 39 acres are controlled by private owners, including <span class="org">Crane Co.</span>, which still owns about half an acre, said <span class="per">Christopher J. Moskal</span>, senior project manager with the city Office of <span class="per">Planning</span> and <span class="per">Economic</span> Development. The urban renewal designation lets the city begin negotiating with the 39 acres' owners, <span class="per">Brian M. Connors</span>, acting city chief development officer, said before the meeting. The designation must be approved by the state Department of <span class="org">Housing and Community Development</span>. Officials see that as likely in light of Gov. Deval <span class="per">L. Patrick</span> in <span class="date">August</span> announcing a program to speed the cleanup of former industrial sites in the state, including the Chapman Valve property.</p><br><br>
