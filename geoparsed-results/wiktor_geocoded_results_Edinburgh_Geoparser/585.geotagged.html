<p>Miranda is a suburb in southern <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Miranda is 24 kilometres south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district, in the <span class="loc">Sutherland Shire</span>. Miranda has a mixture of low, medium and high density residential and is known as a commercial centre for the southern suburbs. The Westfield Miranda shopping centre attracts many shoppers from the <span class="loc">Sutherland Shire</span>, the <span class="loc">St George</span> area and as far away as <span class="loc">Wollongong</span>. Thomas Holt (1811–88) owned the land that stretched from <span class="loc">Sutherland</span> to <span class="loc">Cronulla</span>. James Murphy, the manager of the Holt estate named the area after Miranda, a character in the William Shakespeare play The Tempest. In a 1921 letter, James Murphy said "the name Miranda was given to the locality by me as manager of the Holt Sutherland Company which I formed in 1881. I thought it a soft, euphonious, musical and appropriate name for a beautiful place." It is believed that the character in the play was named after <span class="loc">Miranda de Ebro</span>, a town in <span class="loc">Spain</span>. Early Australian explorer Gregory Blaxland was promised a significant parcel of land in the area as a reward for discovering a passage through the <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span>. He had not selected his parcel by 1816, when he chose to sell that promise to John Connell for £250. However, in 1831 he also selected a parcel of land and claimed it under the original promise of reward, at which Connell stepped forward to claim the land. The matter was taken to court, where Connell was recognised as the owner.</p>
