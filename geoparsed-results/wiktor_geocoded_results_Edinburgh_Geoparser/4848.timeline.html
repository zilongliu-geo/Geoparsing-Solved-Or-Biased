  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Grafton</span> is a community in the <span class="loc">province of Ontario</span>. It is in <span class="loc">Northumberland County</span>, in the township of Alnwick/Haldimand. It is 12 km <span class="loc">east of Cobourg</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span> on the former Highway 2 (<span class="date">now</span> Country Road 2), with close access to Highway 401. The hamlet is near the geographically significant Oak Ridges Moraine at <span class="loc">Rice Lake</span>. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> was originally called Grover's Tavern until <span class="date">March, 1832</span>. The original Grover's Tavern, the namesake building of the hamlet, still stands <span class="date">today</span> as the Grafton Village Inn, a restaurant and B &amp; B in the heart of the hamlet. It was also referred to early in its history as Haldimand, which is the name of the township it is located in. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> is an excellent example of the type of hamlets that flourished in the 19th century. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> had a bustling port for <span class="date">many years</span>, shipping grain, barley and other commodities to communities along the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span>. In addition, the hamlet included a <span class="org">Sons of Temperance</span> group, an order of Freemasons, and numerous other social leagues. Bolstered by satellite communities such as <span class="loc">Centreton</span>, <span class="loc">Castleton</span>, <span class="loc">Wicklow</span>, and Vernonville, <span class="loc">Grafton</span> was a productive hamlet that supported itself through both agriculture and services.</p><br><br>
