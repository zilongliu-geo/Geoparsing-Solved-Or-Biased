  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Brody</span> (Ukrainian: Броди, Polish: <span class="per">Brody</span>, Yiddish: בראָד, translit. <span class="loc">Brod</span>) is a city in Lviv Oblast (region) of western <span class="loc">Ukraine</span>. It is the administrative center of <span class="per">Brody Raion</span> (district), and is located in the valley of the upper <span class="loc">Styr</span> River, approximately 90 kilometres (56 miles) northeast of the oblast capital, Lviv. Population: 23,784 (<span class="date">2013</span> est.). <span class="per">Brody</span> is the junction of the <span class="loc">Druzhba</span> and Odessa–Brody oil pipelines. The first mention of a settlement on the site of <span class="per">Brody</span> is dated <span class="date">1084</span> (Instructions by Volodymyr Monomach). It is believed to have been destroyed by Batu Khan in <span class="date">1241</span>. From <span class="date">1441</span> <span class="per">Brody</span> was the property of different feudal families (<span class="date">Jan</span> Sieniński; from <span class="date">1511</span>, Kamieniecki). <span class="per">Brody</span> was granted Magdeburg rights and city status in <span class="date">1584</span>. At this time it was known under the name <span class="loc">Lubicz</span> (Любич, Polish: <span class="loc">Lubicz</span>) that gave name to the Lubicz coat of arms of the owner, <span class="per">Stanisław Żółkiewski</span> (not to be confused with Lubech, Lubecz). Since the 17th century, the city has been populated not only by Ukrainians and Poles, but also a significant number of Jews (70% of the town's population), Armenians, and Greeks. From <span class="date">1629</span>, the city became the property of <span class="per">Stanisław Koniecpolski</span>, who ordered the construction of <span class="per">Brody Castle</span> (<span class="date">1630</span>–<span class="date">1635</span>). The castle, or rather the fortress, was designed by the French military engineer <span class="loc">Guillaume</span> <span class="loc">Le Vasseur</span> de <span class="loc">Beauplan</span>. In <span class="date">1648</span>, during the Cossack insurrection, the castle took <span class="date">eight weeks</span> for Bohdan Khmelnytsky to capture. Notably, according to the book History of the <span class="loc">Rus</span>, the town′s Jewish population was spared after the sack. The Jews of <span class="per">Brody</span> were found not to have been engaged in maltreatment of the <span class="org">Orthodox Christian</span> (<span class="loc">Rus</span>) population and were only required to pay a "moderate tribute" in kind.</p><br><br>
