  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Playa</span> (Spanish for "the beach") is a bayfront neighborhood in the <span class="loc">Point Loma</span> community of <span class="loc">San Diego</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It is bordered by the <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego Bay</span> on the east, Naval Base <span class="loc">Point Loma</span> on the south, the Wooded Area neighborhood to the west and <span class="loc">Point Loma</span> Village/Roseville-Fleetridge to the north. It lies across a channel from <span class="loc">Shelter Island</span>. The bayside residential area <span class="date">now</span> called <span class="loc">La Playa</span> lies somewhat north of the original <span class="loc">La Playa</span>, where commercial and military ships anchored during the early <span class="date">days</span> of the city. The <span class="loc">La Playa</span> neighborhood includes some of the most expensive homes in <span class="loc">San Diego</span>. The neighborhood is mostly residential and contains two yacht clubs, <span class="org">San Diego Yacht Club and Southwestern Yacht Club</span>. Some bayfront homes have private piers for small boats. The original area known as <span class="loc">La Playa</span> played an important role in the early history of <span class="loc">San Diego</span>. The first European to set foot in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">California, Juan</span> Rodriguez Cabrillo, came ashore in <span class="date">1542</span> at <span class="loc">La Playa</span>, probably at a small rocky peninsula called Ballast Point. When a permanent European settlement was established a few miles inland in <span class="date">1769</span>, <span class="loc">La Playa</span> served as the town's "harbor", actually an anchorage where cargo was loaded and unloaded via small boats. Goods were then transported to the settlement by land over the historic <span class="loc">La Playa</span> Trail, the oldest European trail on the West Coast. The anchorage at <span class="loc">La Playa</span> continued to serve as <span class="loc">San Diego</span>â€™s main port until the establishment of New Town (current downtown) in the 1870s.</p><br><br>
