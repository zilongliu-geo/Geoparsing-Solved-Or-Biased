The earliest History of <span class="per">Caldwell</span> is centered on <span class="loc">Elmhurst</span>, as there wasn't any village of any size until after <span class="date">1900</span>.

The Tavern was built in1824 by <span class="per">Henry</span> B. <span class="per">Hunter</span>, son -in-law of <span class="per">Captain Anderson</span>. The <span class="per">Anderson</span> mansion was on the other side of the river. <span class="loc">Elmhurst</span> was operated for <span class="date">years</span> as a stage stop, being only a few yards from the toll bridge over which passed the east and west stage and wagon road. The Bridge over the Greenbrier river was built in <span class="date">1821</span>. The tavern with its extensive acreage was sold in <span class="date">1848</span> at auction together with a gristmill in court proceedings of <span class="per">Allen T. Caperton</span>, executor of <span class="per">Henry Erskine</span>'s estate v. <span class="per">Henry</span> B. Hunters Heirs. <span class="loc">Elmhurst</span> was bought by Jon A .

So with all this said, The name <span class="per">Caldwell</span> for the town comes from the marriage of <span class="per">Isabelle Abney</span> North to <span class="per">James Robinson Caldwell</span> married on <span class="date">November 24, 1852</span>.</p><br><br>
