<p><span class="loc">Chatham</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Barnstable County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="loc">Barnstable County</span> being coextensive with Cape Cod. First settled by the English in 1664, the township was originally called Monomoit based on the indigenous population's term for the region. The population was 6,125 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Chatham</span> is home to the <span class="loc">Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge</span>, located on <span class="loc">Monomoy Island</span>, For geographic and demographic information on specific parts of the town of <span class="loc">Chatham</span>, please see the articles on <span class="loc">Chatham</span> (CDP) and <span class="loc">West Chatham</span>. Native American tribes who lived in the area before European colonization included the <span class="loc">Nauset</span>, specifically the Manomoy or Monomoy people. The expansive lands over which they roamed were known to them as <span class="loc">Manamoyik</span> or Monomoit. Explorer Samuel de Champlain landed here in October of 1606 at a place he christened "Port Fortun√©", where he contacted (and skirmished with) the <span class="loc">Nauset</span>. Twelve years later another group of Europeans gave it the name "Sutcliffe's Inlets". Neither name stuck, and the location was not permanently occupied by Europeans until English settlers reached Monomoit in 1664. The town was incorporated on 11 June 1712, at which point it was renamed after <span class="loc">Chatham</span>, <span class="loc">Kent</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Its territory expanded with the annexation of Strong Island and its vicinity on 7 February 1797.</p>
