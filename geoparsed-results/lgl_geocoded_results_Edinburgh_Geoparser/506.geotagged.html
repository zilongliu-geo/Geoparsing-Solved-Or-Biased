According to the police report, the teens said they were walking near the intersection of Fair Street and <span class="loc">South Lowry Avenue</span> when a man approached them. After initially asking them for change, the man reportedly said, "Give me everything you got!" then struck the 17-year-old across the face. The teen who said he was struck told police he realized the man had hit him with a gun, so he ran. The man with the gun reportedly then demanded the 18-year-old place his wallet on the ground. When he did so, the robber picked up the wallet, which contained $15, and fled northbound on <span class="loc">South Lowry Avenue</span>, according to the police report.
