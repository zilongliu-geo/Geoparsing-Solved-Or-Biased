<p>Gordon is a village in the old <span class="loc">county of Berwickshire</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span> and is now part of the Scottish Borders Council. The village sits on the crossroads of the A6106 <span class="loc">Earlston</span> to Duns road and the A6089 <span class="loc">Edinburgh</span> to <span class="loc">Kelso</span> road, it is 6 miles east of <span class="loc">Earlston</span> and 4 miles west of <span class="loc">Greenlaw</span> at grid reference NT64764306 Gordon was once on a branch line of the Berwickshire Railway. The first Gordon on record is Richard of Gordon, previously of <span class="loc">Swinton</span>, said to have been the grandson of a famous knight who slew some monstrous animal in the <span class="loc">Merse</span> during the time of King Malcolm III of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. This Richard was Lord of the Barony of Gordon in the <span class="loc">Merse</span>. The name is said to derive from the Gaelic 'Gor Dun' meaning great fort. The de <span class="loc">Gordons</span> held the lairdship of Gordon for over two centuries and were thought to have built a castle at the former hamlet of <span class="loc">Huntly</span> just to the north; they still held lands up to the 18th century.
