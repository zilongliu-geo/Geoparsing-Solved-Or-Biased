  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Carmen is a second income class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Bohol</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 43,579. In the <span class="date">2013</span> election, it had 29,228 registered voters. It comprises 29 barangays with an area of 248 square kilometres (96 sq mi). Carmen was originally part of the municipality of <span class="loc">Bilar</span> and called <span class="loc">Imbaya</span>, after the name of a stream in the settlement. During the Spanish time, it was inhabited by not more than fifty families. In <span class="date">1868</span>, the people of Carmen petitioned for its independence since its population grew to an unprecedented number. The town of Carmen was founded on <span class="date">March 1, 1869</span> by final order of <span class="per">Governor General Jose</span> de la <span class="loc">Gandara</span> and renamed at the same time in honor of the Lady of <span class="loc">Carmel</span> of <span class="loc">Spain</span>. In <span class="date">1874</span>, the town of Carmen had its separate parish with Father <span class="per">Pedro Nolasco</span> <span class="loc">San Juan</span> as the first parish priest. Due to the influence of Spanish culture and tradition, all barangays of Carmen have a patron saint as well as a Spanish name, who are celebrated in an annual barangay fiesta.</p><br><br>
