  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Camden</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,850 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The population of the town more than triples during the <span class="date">summer</span> <span class="date">months</span>, due to tourists and <span class="date">summer</span> residents. <span class="loc">Camden</span> is a famous <span class="date">summer</span> colony in the <span class="loc">Mid-Coast region</span> of <span class="loc">Maine</span>. Similar to Bar Harbor, <span class="loc">Nantucket</span> and <span class="loc">North Haven</span>, <span class="loc">Camden</span> is well known for its <span class="date">summer</span> community of wealthy Northeasterners, mostly from <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>. Penobscot Abenaki Indians called the area Megunticook, meaning "great swells of the sea", a reference to the silhouette of the <span class="loc">Camden</span> Hills (more visibly seen on a bright night). Part of the Waldo Patent, it remained wilderness until after the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span>. It was first settled about <span class="date">1771</span>â€“<span class="date">1772</span> by <span class="per">James Richards</span>, who built a home at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Megunticook River</span>. Others soon followed, some making modest attempts to farm the broken and often mountainous terrain. The first home in the area was the <span class="org">Conway House</span>, a Cape Cod style home built in <span class="date">1770</span>. In <span class="date">1962</span>, it was purchased and renovated into a history museum.</p><br><br>
