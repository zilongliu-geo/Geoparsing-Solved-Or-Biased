<p>Delano is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Wichita</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. A mixed commercial and residential area on the west bank of the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River, it is home to Friends University, Lawrence–Dumont Stadium, and Exploration Place, the <span class="loc">Sedgwick County</span> science museum. Thanks to the availability of cheap land under the Homestead Act of 1862, settlers purchased land across the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River from <span class="loc">Wichita</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. These settlers named their new community <span class="loc">Elgin</span>. In 1870, <span class="loc">Elgin</span> became a cattle shipment point on the <span class="loc">Chisholm</span> Trail and began to grow. In March 1871, local residents renamed the town Delano after Columbus Delano, Secretary of the Interior under President Ulysses S. Grant. Hotels, saloons, and other new businesses opened over the next two years along with a post office and a toll bridge across the river to <span class="loc">Wichita</span>. Unlike <span class="loc">Wichita</span>, Delano had no law enforcement. As a result, it became an area center of drinking, gambling, and prostitution for cowboys working in the cattle trade. Gunfights occurred as well, including a fatal and locally famous incident between two saloon keepers in 1873. In the late 1870s, the cattle trade relocated west to <span class="loc">Dodge City</span>, and <span class="loc">Delano</span>’s period as a rowdy cowtown came to a close.</p>
