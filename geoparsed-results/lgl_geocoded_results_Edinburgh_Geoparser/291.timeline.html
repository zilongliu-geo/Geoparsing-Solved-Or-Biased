  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Missing Lancaster girl's body is found as mother's story unravels. A chilling report that a <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> mother had been knocked unconscious by an attacker and her 18-month-old daughter abducted <span class="date">Wednesday afternoon</span> triggered a frantic search by authorities for the missing child. That search ended nearly a dozen hours later <span class="date">Thursday</span>, though, when police discovered the toddler's body dumped by the side of a road in <span class="loc">Sylmar</span>, near the Golden State Freeway. <span class="date">Now</span>, in the wake of the discovery, investigators are saying there are problems with the mother's explanation. <span class="per">Emma Leigh Barker</span>'s remains were found by investigators after they determined there "were several inconsistencies" with her mother's story, authorities said. The girl's body was found near <span class="loc">Roxford</span> Street and El Dorado Avenue, concealed by deep overgrown brush alongside a fence. Authorities said it appeared the girl's 25-pound body had been dumped sometime over the last 24 hours and showed no visible signs of trauma. The girl's mother, <span class="per">Stacy Barker</span>, 20, initially told detectives that she was at a <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> park next to the Antelope Valley Freeway about 5 p.m. and had placed <span class="per">Emma</span> in her car seat. The mother said she was "struck from behind by an unknown assailant" and knocked unconscious, sheriff's homicide Lt. <span class="per">Pat Nelson</span> said. Barker insisted to detectives she awoke about 10:30 p.m. several miles away at a Palmdale park-and-ride on Avenue S and her daughter was missing. The mother's brother called authorities, and deputies were dispatched to the park-and-ride lot. Deputies found the mother semiconscious and partly undressed with visible bruises on her head, <span class="per">Nelson</span> said. The <span class="org">Sheriff's Department</span> began searching for the girl at 11 p.m. Wednesday. Investigators put out a description of the girl as being 30 inches tall and wearing blue-jean shorts and a multicolored polka dot top. Photos of <span class="per">Emma</span>'s smiling face filled <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> television airwaves <span class="date">Thursday morning</span> as investigators conducted a high-profile search for the missing toddler. Sources familiar with the investigation said the mother changed her story by <span class="date">Thursday</span> and was insisting that <span class="per">Emma</span>'s death was an accident. Investigators and the county coroner's office must <span class="date">now</span> determine how the girl died. The mother is <span class="date">now</span> helping investigators. "She is not in custody. She is cooperating with the investigation," <span class="per">Nelson</span> said. Barker is "not considered a suspect" at this point, he said. "But that may change" as the investigation continues, he said. When asked whether there were other persons of interest, <span class="per">Nelson</span> said that investigators were "working additional leads," but "nobody specific" was under investigation. Sheriff's investigators <span class="date">late Thursday night</span> confirmed that the body was that of <span class="per">Emma</span>.</p><br><br>
