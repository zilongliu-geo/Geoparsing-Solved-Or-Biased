  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Brooklyn (popularly known as <span class="loc">Lovejoy</span>), is a village in St. <span class="loc">Clair County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located two miles north of East <span class="per">St. Louis</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> and three miles northeast of downtown <span class="per">St. Louis</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, it is the oldest town incorporated by African Americans in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was founded by freed and fugitive slaves from <span class="per">St. Louis</span>, led by "Mother" <span class="per">Priscilla Baltimore</span> in the period of <span class="date">1829</span> to <span class="date">1839</span>. Its motto is "Founded by Chance, Sustained by Courage". The current mayor is Mayor Vera Banks-Glasper. <span class="org">Superstar</span> <span class="per">Tina Turner</span> regularly performed at a local club in her early <span class="date">years</span> as an entertainer. A missionary AME Church was established in the new settlement in <span class="date">1836</span>. <span class="date">Now</span> known as Quinn's Chapel AME, its congregation is believed to have supported the Underground Railroad and aided fugitive slaves to freedom, together with members of the Antioch Baptist Church established in <span class="date">1838</span>. According to oral history tradition, by <span class="date">1829</span> "Mother" <span class="per">Priscilla Baltimore</span> led a group of eleven families, composed of both fugitive and free African Americans, to flee slavery in <span class="per">St. Louis</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. They crossed the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River to the free state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, where they established a freedom village in the American Bottoms. "Mother" <span class="per">Baltimore</span> was said to have purchased her freedom as an adult from her master. She also bought the freedom of members of her family. Born in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, she tracked her white father to <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and bought her mother's freedom from him. The earliest black families included <span class="per">Anderson, Sullivan</span>, <span class="per">Singleton, Wilson</span>, <span class="per">Cox, Wyatt</span>, and <span class="per">Carper</span>.</p><br><br>
