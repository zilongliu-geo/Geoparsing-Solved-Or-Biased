<p><span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 21,218. The county seat is <span class="loc">Eatonton</span>. Since the early 21st century, the county has seen a housing boom due to its proximity to Lake Oconee, as well as major employment centers such as <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, <span class="loc">Athens</span>, and <span class="loc">Macon</span>. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is named in honor of Israel Putnam, a hero of the French and Indian War and a general in the American Revolutionary War. It began to be settled after the war, as migrants moved down from the Upper South. <span class="loc">The County</span> was created on December 10, 1807 by an act of the Georgia General Assembly. The county was developed for cotton cultivation, where plantations were dependent on the field labor of numerous African-American slaves. African Americans still comprise more than 40 percent of the county population, even after thousands left during the Great Migration of the first half of the 20th century. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is home to the nationally known Dairy Festival. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 361 square miles (930 km2), of which 345 square miles (890 km2) is land and 16 square miles (41 km2) (4.4%) is water. The entirety of <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is located in the Upper <span class="loc">Oconee River</span> sub-basin of the <span class="loc">Altamaha River</span> basin.</p>
