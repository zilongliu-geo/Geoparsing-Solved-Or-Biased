<p><span class="loc">Newstead</span> is the most northeastern town in <span class="loc">Erie County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,594 at the 2010 census. The name is reportedly derived from <span class="loc">Newstead Abbey</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Newstead</span> is northeast of Buffalo, and its principal community is the village of <span class="loc">Akron</span>. The town was first settled around 1801. The town of <span class="loc">Newstead</span> was established in 1823 as the "Town of <span class="loc">Erie</span>" from the eastern part of the town of Clarence. In 1831, the town's name was changed to "Newstead", reportedly on the advice of Abigail Fillmore, who was fond of the poetry of Lord Byron. A fire in the 1870s destroyed town records, leaving little historical information about the town between 1823 and 1870. The discovery of gypsum and the growth of the related cement industry helped promote the area. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 51.05 square miles (132.21 km2), of which 50.76 square miles (131.46 km2) is land and 0.29 square miles (0.74 km2), or 0.56%, is water.</p>
