<p><span class="loc">Nako</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">Himalayas</span> of northern <span class="loc">India</span>, located near the Indo-China border in the <span class="loc">Trans-Himalayan region</span> of <span class="loc">Kinnaur district</span> in <span class="loc">Himachal Pradesh</span>. <span class="loc">Nako</span> Lake is a prominent feature here where it borders the village. <span class="loc">Nako</span> Monastery, dated to 1025, is located in the village as well as several other Buddhist chortens. <span class="loc">Nako</span> is the largest village at an elevation of 3,625 metres (11,893 ft) (3,662 metres (12,014 ft) is also mentioned) in the <span class="loc">Hangrang</span> Valley with the backdrop of Reo Purgyal which has an elevation of 6,816 metres (22,362 ft) and is the highest mountain in <span class="loc">Himachal Pradesh</span>. The village is now on a more stable location near the <span class="loc">Nako</span> Lake (formed by the slopes of the mountains of Reo Purgyal), compared to the opposite bank across the <span class="loc">Nako</span> river where it was located earlier and then shifted because of tectonic upliftment of the site. As of 2002, the village had a population of 416. Access to the village is from a branch road of 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) from the National Highway 22. It is 117 kilometres (73 mi) away from <span class="loc">Kalpa</span>. <span class="loc">Nako</span> Monastery in the upper part of the village and the <span class="loc">Nako</span> Lake are important land marks in the village. Apples and Sun dried apricots are the agricultural produce from the village.</p>
