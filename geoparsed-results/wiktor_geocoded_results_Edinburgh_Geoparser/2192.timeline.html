  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Stockton</span> is a small village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">Wylye Valley</span> in <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, about 8 miles (13 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Warminster</span>. The parish includes the hamlet of <span class="loc">Bapton</span>. The village is close to <span class="loc">Codford</span>, south of the A36 road, between the town of <span class="loc">Warminster</span> and the <span class="loc">city of Salisbury</span>. When the civil <span class="loc">parish of Fisherton Delamere</span> was extinguished in <span class="date">1934</span>, the portion south of the <span class="loc">Wylye</span> (1,174 acres) was transferred to <span class="loc">Stockton</span>. This transfer included <span class="loc">Bapton</span> and <span class="loc">Fisherton Mill</span>, in the village of Fisherton Delamere. <span class="loc">Stockton</span> also has two cottages some three miles from the main village street at a remote spot called <span class="loc">Great Bottom</span>. <span class="loc">St John</span> the Baptist's Church, <span class="loc">Stockton</span>, is largely unrestored and in the south aisle has an early 14th-century stone effigy of a lady, believed to be the foundress of the chantry for which this aisle was built. In the north aisle is a canopied tomb of <span class="per">John</span> and <span class="per">Mary</span> Topp. Parts of the building date from the late 12th-century. It is a Grade I listed building. <span class="loc">Stockton</span> has one pub, The Carriers, in the main village street.</p><br><br>
