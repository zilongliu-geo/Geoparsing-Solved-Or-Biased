<p><span class="loc">Lodi</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Medina County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,746 at the 2010 census. Founded in 1811, <span class="loc">Lodi</span> is the oldest settlement in <span class="loc">Medina County</span>. It was originally called <span class="loc">Harrisville</span>, in honor of Judge Joseph Harris. The community's name echoes that of the <span class="loc">city of Lodi</span> in northern <span class="loc">Italy</span>, where Napoleon won a victory in 1796. The year of incorporation was 1891. An early pioneer named <span class="loc">Redfield</span> (after whom <span class="loc">Redfield</span> Street is named) sculpted the modern route to <span class="loc">Medina</span> through trees. It was later deemed too curvy, so the first governmental road through the region was straightened. In later years, this road became <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 42. <span class="loc">Lodi</span> hosts the annual Sweet Corn Festival in the middle of July. This three-day-long event begins with a large parade through the town square. Other attractions include fair food, amusement rides, and a popular tug-of-war. <span class="loc">Lodi</span> is located at 41°1′59″N 82°0′42″W (41.033059, -82.011774), along the East Fork of the <span class="loc">Black River</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 2.26 square miles (5.85 km2), of which 2.25 square miles (5.83 km2) is land and 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2) is water.</p>
