  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Makin</span> or Makeen is a small town in <span class="loc">South Waziristan</span>, <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>, located on the Y-junction between <span class="per">Sararogha</span> and <span class="per">Wana</span>, just south of <span class="loc">Razmak</span> in <span class="loc">North Waziristan</span>. It is mainly populated by members of the Mehsud tribe. The Pakistani military has called it "the nerve center" of the Pakistani Taliban. Just north of <span class="loc">Makin</span> is the village of <span class="loc">China</span>, and the Taliban stronghold of <span class="loc">Ladha</span> is a few kilometers to the south. The <span class="date">Jan</span> <span class="org">Alam Hospital</span> is located in <span class="loc">Makin</span>'s bazaar. The bazaar is the commercial hub of the Mehsud tribe. As of <span class="date">2005</span>, tribesmen entering <span class="loc">Makin</span> bazaar had to deposit weapons at a checkpoint, to be returned on departure. The <span class="loc">Makin</span> Tehsil has seven middle schools (including two for girls) and two high schools (none for girls). <span class="loc">Makin</span> was the base of Baitullah Mehsud, the former leader of Tehrik-i-Taliban until his death in an <span class="date">August 2009</span> drone attack. In <span class="date">2007</span>, Baitullah Mehsud was at "<span class="per">Anwar Shah</span>â€™s house" in <span class="loc">Makin</span> when he allegedly claimed responsibility for the assassination of <span class="per">Benazir Bhutto</span> during an intercepted phone call.</p><br><br>
