  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Richmond</span> (/ˈrɪtʃmənd/ RICH-mənd) is a city in western <span class="loc">Contra</span> <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city was incorporated on <span class="date">August 7, 1905</span>. Located in the eastern region of the <span class="loc">San Francisco Bay</span> Area, <span class="loc">Richmond</span> borders the cities of <span class="loc">San Pablo</span>, <span class="loc">Albany</span>, <span class="loc">El Cerrito</span> and <span class="loc">Pinole</span> in addition to the unincorporated communities of <span class="loc">North Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">Hasford</span> Heights, <span class="loc">Kensington</span>, <span class="loc">El Sobrante</span>, Bayview-Montalvin Manor, <span class="loc">Tara Hills</span>, and <span class="loc">East Richmond Heights</span>, and briefly <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> on Red <span class="loc">Rock Island</span>. Under the McLaughlin Administration, <span class="loc">Richmond</span> was the largest city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> served by a Green Party mayor. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, the city's population is at 103,710, making it the second largest city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> named <span class="loc">Richmond</span>. The largest, <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, is the namesake of the <span class="loc">California</span> city. The Ohlone Indians were the first inhabitants of the <span class="loc">Richmond</span> area, settling an estimated <span class="date">5,000 years ago</span>. The name "<span class="loc">Richmond</span>" appears to predate actual incorporation by <span class="date">more than fifty years</span>. <span class="per">Edmund Randolph</span>, originally from <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, represented the city of <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> when <span class="loc">California</span>'s first legislature met in <span class="loc">San Jose</span> in <span class="date">December 1849</span>, and he became state assemblyman from <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>. His loyalty to the town of his birth caused him to persuade a federal surveying party mapping the <span class="loc">San Francisco Bay</span> to place the names "<span class="loc">Point Richmond</span>" and "<span class="loc">Richmond</span>" on an <span class="date">1854</span> geodetic coast map, which was the geodetic map at the terminal selected by the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="loc">San</span> Joaquin Valley Railroad; and by 1899 maps made by the railroad carried the name "<span class="loc">Point Richmond</span> Avenue," designating a county road that later became Barrett Avenue, a central street in <span class="loc">Richmond</span>.</p><br><br>
