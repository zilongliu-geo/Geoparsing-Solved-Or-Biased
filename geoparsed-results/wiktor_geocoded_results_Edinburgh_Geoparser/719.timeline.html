  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lipa</span> (Tagalog pronunciation: [liˈpaʔ]), officially the <span class="loc">City of Lipa</span> (Filipino: Lungsod ng <span class="loc">Lipa</span>), is a first class component city in the <span class="loc">province of Batangas</span> in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It is one of the three cities in <span class="loc">Batangas</span> (the others are <span class="loc">Batangas City</span> and <span class="loc">Tanauan</span>). It is located 78 kilometres (48 mi) south of Manila and has a population of 283,468 people according to the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city is named after a species of tree in the Urticaceae family, lipa (Dendrocnide meyeniana), known for the stinging trichomes on its twigs. <span class="loc">Lipa City</span> is a recreational, religious, commercial, industrial and educational center. The city is also home to the <span class="loc">Fernando Air Base</span>, former headquarters of the <span class="org">Philippine Air Force</span>'s 100th Training Wing and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), known in military circles as the <span class="loc">Baguio</span> of the Armed Forces of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. The Southern <span class="loc">Tagalog Arterial Road</span> (STAR) and <span class="loc">South Luzon Expressway</span> (SLEX) provide access to <span class="loc">Batangas City</span> and <span class="loc">Metro Manila</span>. Batangueños from the early <span class="date">years</span> had their settlement in <span class="loc">Bombon</span> Lake and began dispersing to other places when the volcano erupted. While a group of people was moving to another settlement area, the image of <span class="date">St. Sebastian</span> was stolen from them and later on was found on a tree called “lipa”. People believed that the patron saint wished to name that place “Lipa”.</p><br><br>
