  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Esperanza is a municipality in <span class="loc">Masbate Province</span>, the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, with a population of 17,357 people in the <span class="date">2010</span> census. About 60% of the population lives along the coastline, most of whom are fishermen. It is about 4 hours travel south of <span class="loc">Masbate City</span> with some roads and highways still undeveloped. Esperanza has several beaches, among them <span class="org">Gamay Na</span> Baybay Beach, <span class="loc">Talisay</span> (<span class="loc">Punta</span>) <span class="per">Beach</span> and <span class="per">Manok</span> <span class="per">Manok</span> Beach. Esperanza is politically subdivided into 20 barangays. People in <span class="date">the 1970s</span> to <span class="date">early 1990s</span> were heavily dependent on the water resources in the so-called <span class="loc">Kapayawan</span>, which means "deep well". It is the only safe water source for the majority of the people living in the area. In <span class="date">2000</span>, Esperanza was finally connected to the electricity grid supplied by MASELCO which benefited 80% of the households in the area. In <span class="date">2006</span>, <span class="per">President Gloria Arroyo</span> defined Esperanza to be the most accessible town in <span class="loc">Masbate</span> going to <span class="loc">Samar</span>, <span class="loc">Leyte</span> and <span class="loc">Cebu</span>. That is the primary reason why the National Government constructed the port to serve as a roll-on/roll-off (RORO) gateway.</p><br><br>
