<p>Austin is an unincorporated community, considered a ghost town, in <span class="loc">Grant County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located north of <span class="loc">Oregon Route</span> 7, near the <span class="loc">Middle Fork John Day River</span> in the <span class="loc">Malheur National Forest</span>. Austin was named for Minot and Linda Austin, early settlers of the area. The <span class="loc">Austins</span> operated a small store and hotel, Austin House. Austin House was started as a hotel and stagecoach station by a Mr. Newton. Austin post office was established in 1888 and closed in 1950. The tracks of the Sumpter Valley Railway reached Austin in 1905. The railway was built by Oregon Lumber Company and Austin became an important railroad logging community. Austin was the hub of the area until Bates, a company town of the Oregon Lumber Company, was built 1 mile (1.6 km) to the west. Austin was also a supply depot for local mining towns, including <span class="loc">Susanville</span> and <span class="loc">Galena</span>. Austin sawmills supplied lumber for places such as Greenhorn and the Bonanza Mine, higher up in the <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span>. At its height, the population was about 500 (some estimates say it was high as 5,000) and the community had three sawmills. The town also had a substantial jail and the offices of several doctors, lawyers and real estate operators. As the neighboring mining towns disappeared, however, Austin also went into decline.</p>
