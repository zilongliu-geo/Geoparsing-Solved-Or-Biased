<p><span class="loc">Arnold</span> is a market town, unparished area and suburb of the <span class="loc">city of Nottingham</span>, in the English ceremonial <span class="loc">county of Nottinghamshire</span>. It is to the north-east of Nottingham’s city boundary, and is in the local government <span class="loc">district of Gedling</span> Borough. Since 1968 <span class="loc">Arnold</span> has had a market, and the town used to have numerous factories associated with the hosiery industry. Arnold’s town centre is the largest in <span class="loc">Gedling Borough</span> (whose headquarters are located in the town) and the most important in the northeastern part of the Greater Nottingham conurbation. At the time of the 2011 Census, <span class="loc">Arnold</span> had a population of 37,768. Areas within <span class="loc">Arnold</span> include <span class="loc">Daybrook</span>, <span class="loc">Woodthorpe</span>, <span class="loc">Redhill</span> and Killisick. <span class="loc">Arnold</span> was referred to as ‘Ernehale’ in the Domesday Book of 1068; this former name meant ‘place frequented by eagles’ or ‘the valley of eagles’. ‘A History of Arnold’ (1913) by Rev. Rupert W. King and Rev. James Russell explains the etymology of Arnold’s name thus: ‘Heron-hald’, meaning the corner of the forest where Herons (large birds) live. Which becomes over the centuries since 500 A.D. by ‘lazy’ pronunciation, Eron-ald, thence Ern-old and Arn-old.</p>
