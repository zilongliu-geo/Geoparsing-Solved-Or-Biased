<p><span class="loc">Ferndale</span> (Welsh: Glynrhedynog) is a small town located in the <span class="loc">Rhondda</span> Valley in the <span class="loc">county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span>. Neighbouring villages are <span class="loc">Blaenllechau</span>, <span class="loc">Maerdy</span> and <span class="loc">Tylorstown</span>. <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> was industrialised in the mid 19th century when the first coal mine shaft was sunk in 1857 and was the first community to be intensively industrialised in the <span class="loc">Rhondda</span> Valley. In Welsh <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> is known as Glynrhedynog, the name of one of the old farms on which the town is built. In its infancy Glynrhedynog was also known as Trerhondda after the name of the first large chapel to be built in the town. The naming of settlements after chapels was widespread in <span class="loc">Wales</span> at the time, as is shown in village names such as <span class="loc">Bethesda</span>, <span class="loc">Beulah</span> and <span class="loc">Horeb</span>, but neither Glynrhedynog nor Trerhondda was destined to be used for long. The Welsh word Glynrhedynog is made from the words "glyn" meaning valley and "rhedynog" meaning ferny, and so coal from the Glynrhedynog pits was marketed as <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> coal, a much easier name for English buyers to assimilate. The <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> pits are what drew the workforce and their families to the area, and by the 1880s "Ferndale" was well established as a thriving town. With the phasing in of bilingual road signs from the late 1980s onwards, the name Glynrhedynog gradually reappeared and is now the officially designated Welsh language name for <span class="loc">Ferndale</span>. The Welsh language is on the increase in <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> after the village adopted the English language during the Industrial revolution. A Welsh language school is situated near the park and the school is named after the park's lake, 'Llyn-y-Forwyn.' (The Maiden's Lake)</p>
