<p><span class="loc">Medford</span> is a township in <span class="loc">Burlington County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the township's population was 23,033, reflecting an increase of 780 (+3.5%) from the 22,253 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 1,727 (+8.4%) from the 20,526 counted in the 1990 Census. <span class="loc">Medford</span> was incorporated as a township by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on March 1, 1847, from portions of Evesham Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. Portions of the township were taken to form <span class="loc">Shamong</span> Township (February 19, 1852), Lumberton Township (March 14, 1860) and <span class="loc">Medford Lakes</span> (May 17, 1939). The area known as <span class="loc">Medford</span> was sold to Samual Coles in 1670, in all it consisted of 900 acres (3.6 kmÂ²). Within the next few years the <span class="loc">Braddock</span>, <span class="loc">Prickett</span>, <span class="loc">Stratton</span>, <span class="loc">Branin</span>, and <span class="loc">Wilkins</span> families moved to the area (many of whom continue to live in the area today). <span class="loc">Upper Evesham</span>, as it was then known, continued to grow from scattered homesteads into a small village. Many of the building and roads built between the sale of the land and the American Revolutionary War are still in existence, which include Oliphant's Mill, Christopher's Mill and the <span class="loc">Shamong</span> Trail (now known as Stokes Road).</p>
