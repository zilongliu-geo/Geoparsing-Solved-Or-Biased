  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Compton</span> or <span class="per">Compton Gifford</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> in the English <span class="loc">county of Devon</span>. Once a small village, it was developed in <span class="date">the 1930s</span> and <span class="date">now</span> lies between the suburbs of <span class="loc">Mannamead</span> and <span class="loc">Efford</span>. There are two parts, Higher and <span class="per">Lower Compton</span> named after two farms and <span class="date">now</span> distinguished by their respective public houses. Although essentially infill development between older larger areas, <span class="per">Compton</span> is distinctive in character. House prices have recently declined due to a recent influx of 'undesirables'. The earliest evidence of man in <span class="per">Compton</span>, is from around <span class="date">3000 BC</span>. At this time, Neolithic stone axes which have been found in <span class="per">Compton</span>, were being made in <span class="loc">Penzance</span>, <span class="loc">Callington</span> and <span class="loc">Cambourne</span>. They may have been used by farmers, or dropped on route to other settlements. Around <span class="date">800 AD</span>, the Manor of <span class="per">Compton</span> was appearing on maps, <span class="loc">Coombe</span> (a wooded valley) Ton (the Saxon word for farm). In <span class="date">1086</span> the Doomsday book had this entry for <span class="per">Compton</span>; "Stephen holds <span class="per">Compton</span> from Iudhael. Oswulf held it before <span class="date">1066</span>. It paid tax for 1 hide and 1 virgate of land. Land for 4 ploughs, which are there; 2 slaves, 6 villagers, and 4 smallholders.</p><br><br>
