<p><span class="loc">York</span> (/ˈjɔːrk/) is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers <span class="loc">Ouse</span> and <span class="loc">Foss</span> in <span class="loc">North Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The municipality is the traditional county town of <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span> to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in <span class="loc">England</span> throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions. The city was founded by the Romans as Eboracum in 71 AD. It became the capital of the Roman <span class="loc">province of Britannia Inferior</span>, and later of the kingdoms of <span class="loc">Northumbria</span> and Jórvík. In the Middle Ages, <span class="loc">York</span> grew as a major wool trading centre and became the capital of the northern ecclesiastical province of the Church of England, a role it has retained. In the 19th century, <span class="loc">York</span> became a hub of the railway network and a confectionery manufacturing centre. In recent decades, the economy of <span class="loc">York</span> has moved from being dominated by its confectionery and railway-related industries to one that provides services. The University of York and health services have become major employers, whilst tourism has become an important element of the local economy.</p>
