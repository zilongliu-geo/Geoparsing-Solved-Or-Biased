<p>Woodlands is a model village 3 miles (5 km) north of <span class="loc">Doncaster</span> in <span class="loc">South Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The village falls within the <span class="loc">Adwick Ward</span> of <span class="loc">Doncaster</span> MBC. The colliery village was designed and built in the early 20th century by the architect Percy Houfton as tied cottages for the miners of the neighbouring Brodsworth Colliery. In an era of model villages such as <span class="loc">Saltaire</span>, <span class="loc">Port Sunlight</span> and <span class="loc">Bournville</span>, Woodlands, with extensive open spaces, many different designs of houses, and overall living conditions superb for their time, possibly represents the height of the model village movement. The village is a conservation area. Lying between the historic Great North Road (the former A1, now the A638) and a Roman Road, the houses in the village are in short terraces, typically of four, and face each other across wide avenues. At the back they typically overlook a large square open space. The Roman Road is <span class="loc">Ermine</span> Street, the branch from Lincoln to <span class="loc">York</span> via <span class="loc">Doncaster</span> and <span class="loc">Tadcaster</span>. Locally, it is colloquially known as the Roman <span class="loc">Rigg</span>, more correctly as the <span class="loc">Roman Ridge</span>.</p>
