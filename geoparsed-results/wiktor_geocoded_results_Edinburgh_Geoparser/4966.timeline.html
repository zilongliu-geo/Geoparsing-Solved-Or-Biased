  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Oneida County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census the county had a population of 4,286. The county seat and largest city is <span class="loc">Malad City</span>. Most of the county's population lives in <span class="loc">Malad City</span> and the surrounding <span class="loc">Malad</span> Valley. The county is named for <span class="loc">Oneida Lake</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, the area from which most of the early settlers had emigrated. <span class="loc">Oneida County</span> was organized on <span class="date">January 22, 1864</span>, as the second county organized under Idaho Territory. Its original boundaries were set at the 113th meridian, the <span class="loc">Snake River</span>, the 112th <span class="org">Meridian</span> north of the <span class="loc">Snake River</span>, the <span class="loc">Rocky Mountains</span>, and the southern boundary of Idaho Territory. While older and more populous settlements existed within the boundaries of the new county, the original county seat was established at Soda Springs in present-day <span class="loc">Caribou County</span> because those older settlements were believed to be in Utah Territory until the southern boundary of Idaho Territory was surveyed in <span class="date">1870</span>. The county seat was moved to <span class="loc">Malad City</span> in <span class="date">1866</span> because of its population growth and location on the freight road and stagecoach line between Corinne, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, and the mines in <span class="loc">Butte</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>.</p><br><br>
