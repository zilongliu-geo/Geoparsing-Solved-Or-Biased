<p>Chicopee residents discuss conservation land purchase. Several residents in the area had protested land owner Yves Demers' plans to build single-family homes on the land. He is now negotiating to sell 30.23 acres to the city for conservation purposes while keeping 1.5 acres at the end of Nelson Street to build two single-family homes. The land has been appraised at $450,000, while he has signed an "offer to sell real estate" agreement with the city for $500,000. In December, the council granted Demers a zone change from industrial to Residential A on 31.7 acres there to build single family houses. Bissonnette told residents the city doesn't want to build a park on the conservation land. Some residents are concerned about increased traffic in the neighborhood if the land becomes a recreational area. "This is not going to be a park. The idea is to keep it in its most natural setting," Bissonnette said. The City Council's Recreation Committee will hold a public hearing on the grant application on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. in Council Chambers in City Hall. The mayor and city department heads also gave briefings on the Front Street reconstruction project, that has just begun, along with the upcoming <span class="loc">Center</span> Street reconstruction project, the CVS under construction at <span class="loc">Hampden</span> and <span class="loc">Center</span> streets, and construction of the bike path-canal park from Front Street near City Hall to Grape Street that should begin next month.</p>
