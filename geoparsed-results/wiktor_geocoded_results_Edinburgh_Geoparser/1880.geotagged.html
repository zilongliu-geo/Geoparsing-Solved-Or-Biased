<p><span class="loc">Salisbury</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Litchfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> of the <span class="loc">New York</span> metropolitan area. The town is the northwest-most in the State of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. The MA-NY-CT (Massachusetts-New York-Connecticut) Tri-State Marker is located just on the border of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>. The population was 3,977 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> was established and incorporated in 1741, and contains several historic homes, though some were replaced by larger modern structures in the late 20th century. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> was named for a town in <span class="loc">England</span>. Historian Ed Kirby tells us that traces of iron were discovered in what was to become <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> in 1728, with the discovery of the large deposit at <span class="loc">Old Hill</span> (later Ore Hill) in 1731 by John Pell and Ezekiel Ashley. Beginning before the Revolution, during the Federal period, and until around 1920, <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> was the seat of an important iron industry. Additional iron mines were opened, mostly in the Western end of the township, although historian Diana Muir dismisses them as "scarcely big enough to notice," with the further disadvantage of not being near a river large enough to ship iron to market at a reasonable cost. The solution, according to Muir, was to pour labor into the iron, working it into a quality of wrought iron so high that it could be used even for gun barrels. This fetched a high price and made <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> iron the celebrated choice of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>'s early nineteenth-century arms industry as well as the preeminent source of cast iron railroad car wheels until they were superseded by steel wheels. Peter P. Everts, an agent of the mid-19th-century mines, however, stated the quality of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> iron varied. The iron industry in <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> became inactive following World War I, a plan to revive it during World War II was never implemented, and the mines remain under water.</p>
