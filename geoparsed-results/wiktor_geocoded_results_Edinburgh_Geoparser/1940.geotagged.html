<p><span class="loc">Riverton</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Coos County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, on <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 42S, about 12 miles up the <span class="loc">Coquille River</span> from <span class="loc">Bandon</span>. Route 42S is the former alignment of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 101. The townsite of <span class="loc">Riverton</span> was platted in 1889. <span class="loc">Riverton</span> post office was established in 1890 and named for its situation on the river. Orlando A. Kelly, the first postmaster, was also said to have been the first settler there. In 1915 <span class="loc">Riverton</span> had a population of 200. At that time <span class="loc">Riverton</span> shipped coal mined locally by steamboat to <span class="loc">California</span>. The first coal mine opened in the county in 1854 and up to a quarter of people worked in what was then the region's most important industry. <span class="loc">Riverton</span> served as a coal-mining center for more than 50 years. In 1940, Riverton's population was 150, and the place served as a trading center for farmers who grew peas. The post office closed in 1961. Formerly Riverton Ferry crossed the <span class="loc">Coquille</span> there and as of 1969, it was still being operated by the county. At one time the community had a high school and a grade school. Circa 1901, there was a Christian Church and today there is a Riverton Community Church unaffiliated with the former one. As of 2010 there are no stores in <span class="loc">Riverton</span>.</p>
