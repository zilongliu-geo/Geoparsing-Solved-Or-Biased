<p><span class="loc">Biu</span> is a town and a Local Government Area (LGA) in southern <span class="loc">Borno State</span> of <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. The town is the administrative center of the LGA. The town was once the capital of the Biu kingdom, and is now capital of the Biu Emirate. <span class="loc">Biu</span> lies on the <span class="loc">Biu Plateau</span> at an average elevation of 626 meters. The region is semi-arid. The Biu kingdom became established around 1670 in the reign of Mari Watila Tampta. King Mari Watirwa (r. 1793â€“1838), whose capital was near <span class="loc">Biu</span> at <span class="loc">Kogu</span>, defeated Fulani invaders from the Gombe Emirate to the west. In 1878 Mari <span class="loc">Biya</span>, became the first Bura king to rule from <span class="loc">Biu</span>. The emir's palace is now situated in the town. With British rule, <span class="loc">Biu division</span> was created in 1918. <span class="loc">Mai</span> Ari Dogo was acknowledged as the first emir of <span class="loc">Biu</span> in 1920. The area became known as the Biu federation after 1957, when the <span class="loc">districts of Shani and Askira</span> were added to the emirate. Maidalla Mustafa dan Muhammad (b. 1915) became Mai Biu, also styled Kuthli, in 1959.</p>
