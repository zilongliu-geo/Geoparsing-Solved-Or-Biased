  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Daman</span> /dəˈmɑːn/ (Damão in <span class="per">Portuguese</span>), is a city and a municipal council in <span class="loc">Daman district</span> in the union territory of <span class="loc">Daman</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Diu</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>. <span class="loc">Daman</span> is divided by the <span class="loc">Daman</span> <span class="loc">Ganga River</span> into two parts, namely Nani-daman (Nani meaning "small") and Moti-daman (Moti meaning "big"). Ironically, Nani-daman is the larger of the two towns. It is the downtown area that holds most of the important entities like the major hospitals, supermarkets and major residential areas. While Moti-daman is mainly the old city inhabited. The <span class="per">Portuguese Diogo de Melo</span> arrived at the spot by chance in <span class="date">1523</span>, when heading towards Ormuz but caught in a violent storm and having his boat blown towards the coast of <span class="loc">Daman</span>. Soon after it was settled as a Portuguese colony and remained so for over <span class="date">400 years</span>. A larger fort was built in Motidaman in the 16th century to guard against the Mughals who ruled the area until the Portuguese arrived. It still stands <span class="date">today</span>, most of it preserved in its original form. <span class="date">Today</span> the majority of the municipal government offices are situated inside this fort.</p><br><br>
