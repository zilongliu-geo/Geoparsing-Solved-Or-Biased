  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alexandria (/ˌælɪɡˈzændrɪə/ or /ˌælɪɡˈzɑːndrɪə/; Arabic: الإسكندرية al-Iskandariyyah; Egyptian Arabic: اسكندرية Eskendereyyah; Coptic: Ⲣⲁⲕⲟⲧⲉ Rakotə) is the second largest city and a major economic centre in <span class="loc">Egypt</span>, extending about 32 km (20 mi) along the coast of the <span class="loc">Mediterranean Sea</span> in the north central part of the country. It is also the largest city lying directly on the Mediterranean coast. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is <span class="loc">Egypt</span>'s largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of <span class="loc">Egypt</span>'s imports and exports. It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from <span class="loc">Suez</span>. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination. Alexandria was founded around a small Ancient Egyptian town c. <span class="date">331 BC</span> by Alexander the Great. It became an important center of the Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Hellenistic and Roman and Byzantine <span class="loc">Egypt</span> for <span class="date">almost 1000 years</span> until the Muslim conquest of <span class="loc">Egypt</span> in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into <span class="loc">Cairo</span>). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven <span class="org">Wonders of the Ancient World</span>; its Great Library (the largest in the ancient world; <span class="date">now</span> replaced by a modern one); and the Necropolis, one of the Seven <span class="org">Wonders of the Middle Ages</span>. Alexandria was the second most powerful city of the ancient world after <span class="loc">Rome</span>. Ongoing maritime archaeology in the harbor of Alexandria, which began in <span class="date">1994</span>, is revealing details of Alexandria both before the arrival of Alexander, when a city named Rhacotis existed there, and during the Ptolemaic dynasty.</p><br><br>
