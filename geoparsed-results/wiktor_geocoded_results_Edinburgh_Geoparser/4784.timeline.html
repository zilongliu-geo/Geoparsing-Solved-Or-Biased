  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> is a Canadian urban community located in <span class="org">Nova Scotia's Halifax Regional Municipality</span>. Formerly a city, <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> is located on the eastern shore of <span class="loc">Halifax Harbour</span>. <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> has been nicknamed <span class="org">the City of Lakes</span>, after the large number of lakes located within its boundaries. On <span class="date">April 1, 1996</span>, the provincial government amalgamated all the municipalities within the boundaries of <span class="loc">Halifax County</span> into a single-tier regional government named the <span class="org">Halifax Regional Municipality</span> (HRM). <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> and its neighbouring <span class="loc">city of Halifax</span>, the town of <span class="loc">Bedford</span> and the Municipality of the <span class="loc">County of Halifax</span> were dissolved. The former <span class="loc">city of Dartmouth</span> forms part of the urban core of the larger regional municipality and is officially designated as part of the "capital district" by the <span class="org">Halifax Regional Municipality</span>. At the time that the <span class="loc">City of Dartmouth</span> was dissolved, the provincial government altered its status to a separate community to <span class="loc">Halifax</span>; however, its status as part of the metropolitan "Halifax" urban core existed prior to municipal reorganization in <span class="date">1996</span>. <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> is still an official geographic name that is used by all levels of government for legal purposes, postal service, mapping, 9-1-1 emergency response, municipal planning, and is recognized by the <span class="org">Halifax Regional Municipality</span> as a civic addressing community. The official place name did not change, due to the confusion with similar street names, land use planning set out by the former "<span class="loc">City of Dartmouth</span>," and significant public pressure. <span class="date">Today</span> the same development planning for Downtown Dartmouth and the rest of the region is still in force, as well as specific bylaws created prior to <span class="date">April 1, 1996</span>.</p><br><br>
