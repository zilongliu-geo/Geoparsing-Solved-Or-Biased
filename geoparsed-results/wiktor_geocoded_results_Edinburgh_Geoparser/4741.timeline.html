Savannah had served as the colonial capital; but it was considered too far from the center of the growing state. <span class="loc">Louisville</span> was named for <span class="per">Louis XVI</span>, who was still the <span class="per">King of France</span> and had aided the Continentals during the successful American Revolutionary War. Development of the city began later, and its state government buildings were completed in <span class="date">1795</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Louisville</span> served as the state capital of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> from <span class="date">1796</span> to <span class="date">1806</span>. The <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> courthouse, built in <span class="date">1904</span>, stands on the site of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>'s first permanent capitol building. Louisville's historic market house still stands in the center of downtown. The original market had sections for everything from farm produce and household goods to slaves. The <span class="loc">Old Market</span> is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. The market square became the hub of the transportation routes which centered on <span class="loc">Louisville</span> while the town was the state's capital.</p><br><br>
