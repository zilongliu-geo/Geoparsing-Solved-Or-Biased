  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alma (Arabic: علما‎) was a Palestinian Arab village in the <span class="loc">Safad</span> Subdistrict, Mandatory <span class="loc">Palestine</span>. It was depopulated during the <span class="date">1948</span> Arab-Israeli War on <span class="date">October 30, 1948</span> during Operation Hiram. It was located 10 km north of <span class="loc">Safad</span>. In <span class="date">1945</span> it had a population of 950. 'Alma had several nearby khirbas and architectural fragments with inscriptions from an ancient synagogue. Alma was situated in the heart of upper <span class="loc">Galilee</span> in the middle of a fertile plain, about 4 km south of the Lebanese border. Ceramics from the Byzantine era have been found here. The Crusaders called the village "Alme." Several ancient ruins remain and three inscribed architectural fragments in <span class="per">Hebrew</span> and <span class="per">Aramaic</span> from an ancient synagogue were found on the surface of the village site between <span class="date">1914</span> and <span class="date">1957</span>. While travelling though the region in the 12th century CE, Benjamin of <span class="loc">Tudela</span> noted that Alma contained fifty Jewish inhabitants and, "a large cemetery of the Israelites." Remains of a ruined watch-tower was found on the crest of the ridge, and a quarter of a mile south of those there were three perfect dolmens, not very large.</p><br><br>
