<p><span class="loc">Dundee</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Yates County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The population was 1,725 at the 2010 census. The name was taken from <span class="loc">Dundee</span>, the city in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> with a population of 160,000. The Village of <span class="loc">Dundee</span> is in the Town of <span class="loc">Starkey</span>. The village is in the Finger Lakes Region of <span class="loc">New York</span>, halfway between <span class="loc">Elmira</span> and <span class="loc">Geneva</span>. Dundee Airport (D48) is located northeast of the village. The community was known early by the name "Plainview". At first, the village did not thrive due to competition from another neighboring community, "Eddytown", but eventually prevailed over its rival. Around 1834, residents began to seek a new name for the village and, persuaded by a native of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, named the village "Dundee". He then moved to <span class="loc">Illinois</span> and persuaded the natives of his new home to rename their community "Dundee". In 1859, 1860, and 1861, the village was severely damaged by fires. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> was the original home of Seneca Foods. The Uriah Hair House, Dundee Methodist Church, First Presbyterian Church, and Dundee Village Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
