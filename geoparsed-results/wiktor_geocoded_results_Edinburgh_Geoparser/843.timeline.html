  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Marina, also Marina <span class="loc">El Alamein</span> (Arabic: مارينا العلمين‎  Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mæˈɾiːnæ l.ʕælæˈmeːn]), ancient Leukaspis or Antiphrae, is an up-scale resort town catering mainly to Egyptian elites. It is located on the northern coast of <span class="loc">Egypt</span>, with an 11 km (6.8 mi) long beach, about 300 km (190 mi) away from <span class="loc">Cairo</span>, in the <span class="loc">El Alamein</span> area. Leukaspis was a large port town, with a population around 15,000. The center of the town featured a basilica and a town hall that was converted into a Christian church. It was probably an important trading center between <span class="loc">Egypt</span> and <span class="loc">Libya</span>, and appears to have been a major center for Cretian imports. The settlement was destroyed in 365, when an earthquake off the coast of <span class="loc">Crete</span> created a tsunami. The town was not rebuilt, partially due to the crumbling state of the Roman Empire. Leukaspis was lost until <span class="date">1986</span>, when a group of engineers who were building roads in Marina revealed ancient houses and tombs. 200 acres (81 ha) of surrounding land was designated an archeological area, and excavations began in <span class="date">the 1990s</span>. Prior to the site's discovery, the port area of the settlement was destroyed to make a man-made lagoon for a resort.</p><br><br>
