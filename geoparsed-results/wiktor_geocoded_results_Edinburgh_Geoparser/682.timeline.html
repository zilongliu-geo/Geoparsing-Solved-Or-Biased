  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alma is a Statutory Town located in <span class="loc">Park County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town population was 270 at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. At an elevation of approximately 10,578 feet (3,224 m), it is the highest incorporated municipality in the <span class="loc">United States</span> with permanent residents. Alma, which is a town, did not take the title as highest incorporated city from <span class="loc">Leadville</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, as is commonly believed. <span class="loc">Leadville</span> is still the highest incorporated city in <span class="loc">North America</span>. Using administrative boundaries as a measure, not settled areas, in <span class="date">2006</span> <span class="date">Winter</span> Park, <span class="loc">Colorado</span> became the highest incorporated town due to its annexation of a ski area. Alma, however, has a contiguous residential area (on Mountain View Drive) extending to 11,680 feet (3,560 m) above sea level, while any such area in or near <span class="date">Winter</span> Park reaches only 9,550 feet (2,910 m), <span class="loc">Leadville</span> 10,360 feet (3,160 m). The town was named by a merchant named <span class="per">Mr. James</span>, after his wife. Alma is located at 39°17′03″N 106°03′48″W, along State Highway 9.</p><br><br>
