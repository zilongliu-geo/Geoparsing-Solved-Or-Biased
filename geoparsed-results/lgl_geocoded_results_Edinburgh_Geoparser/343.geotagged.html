<p>Man cited for driving drunk after crashing motorized barstool. <span class="loc">NEWARK</span> &#x97; It was classified as “all others” under vehicle type in the <span class="loc">Newark</span> police crash report, but that category doesn’t do a motorized barstool justice. Its 28-year-old creator and operator was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated after he rolled over the Frankenstein-esque lawnmower-barstool hybrid, according to a police report and court records. On March 4, Officer Michael Trotter, one of the two members of the traffic unit, responded to the 500 block of Kelley Lane in reference to assisting Newark Fire with a man who had suffered injuries from a crash. Subsequent investigation revealed that the man had been operating the motorized barstool on Kelley Lane when he crashed it while trying to make a turn, the report states. The man claimed the barstool could reach speeds of 38 mph on its five-horsepower engine but that he was traveling at about 20 mph when he crashed it at 5:40 p.m., according to Trotter’s report. He allegedly admitted to drinking about 15 beers during an interview with Trotter at the hospital, where he was transported after the crash. He was issued a citation for operating a vehicle while intoxicated and driving under suspension, according to court documents. The driver was arraigned last week and pleaded not guilty. He has demanded a jury trial. <span class="loc">Newark</span> police says operating any type of machinery after consuming alcohol often has devastating consequences.
