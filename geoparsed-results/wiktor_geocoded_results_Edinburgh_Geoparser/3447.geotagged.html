<p><span class="loc">Qala</span> (Maltese: Il-Qala, pronounced <span class="loc">Aala</span> in English) is a village on the island of <span class="loc">Gozo</span>, <span class="loc">Malta</span>, with a population of 2284 as of March 2014. Nearby is Ħondoq ir-Rummien, a coastline with salt pans and caves popular with snorkellers and divers. <span class="loc">Qala</span> is first referred to in a fifteenth-century portolan preserved at the Vatican Library. It has taken its name from the qala or port of Ħondoq ir-Rummien. It is the easternmost village of <span class="loc">Gozo</span> and has been inhabited since early times. The development of the present settlement began in the second half of the seventeenth century. It is a pleasant and rural place with many natural and historic attractions. Though <span class="loc">Qala</span> is the farthest village from <span class="loc">Gozo</span>'s capital, Victoria, it is the closest to the rest of the Maltese archipelago, and the rocky hillsides of <span class="loc">Qala</span> enjoy an unobstructed view of the islands of <span class="loc">Malta</span> and <span class="loc">Comino</span>. Breath taking scenes can be enjoyed, among other places, from the Qala Belvedere and from the small courtyard in front of the church known as Il-Madonna tal-Blat (Our Lady of the Rocks). This church faces <span class="loc">Comino</span> and legend has it that it was built so that the people of that island could follow Holy Mass from across the straits when rough weather precluded a priest from crossing there.</p>
