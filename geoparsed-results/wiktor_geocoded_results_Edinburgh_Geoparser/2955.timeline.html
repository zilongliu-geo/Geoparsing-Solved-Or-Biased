  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Daye</span> (Chinese: 大冶; pinyin: Dàyě) is a city of <span class="loc">eastern Hubei province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. Administratively, it is a county-level <span class="loc">city of Huangshi</span> City. Before the adoption of the Hanyu Pinyin, the name of the city was often transcribed in English as Tayeh. As it is usually the case with county-level cities, <span class="loc">Daye</span> includes both an urban core and a fair amount of rural land in all directions, with smaller townships (zhen) such as Dajipu (大箕铺). According to the Fifth Population Census of <span class="loc">China</span> (<span class="date">2000</span>), the entire county-level <span class="loc">city of Daye</span> had 813,600 residents, with a population density of 558 people per square kilometer. The <span class="loc">Daye</span> Lake south of <span class="loc">Daye</span>'s urban core is surrounded by parks and fishing ponds, and is a popular place for recreation. For a traveler who goes on G316 from <span class="loc">Wuhan</span> toward the south-east, <span class="loc">Daye</span> appears as a border between the more urban and more rural parts of the province. <span class="loc">Daye</span> sits on the south-eastern border of the heavily industrialized Wuhan/Ezhou/<span class="loc">Huangshi metropolitan</span> area; south of it, the much more rural <span class="loc">Yangxin County</span> begins.</p><br><br>
