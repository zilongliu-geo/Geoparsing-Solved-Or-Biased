<p><span class="loc">Kew</span> (/kjuÀê/) is a suburban district in the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Richmond upon Thames</span>, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north-east of <span class="loc">Richmond</span> and 7.1 miles (11.4 km) west by south-west of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>; its population at the 2011 Census was 11,436. <span class="loc">Kew</span> is the location of the <span class="loc">Royal Botanic Gardens</span> ("Kew Gardens"), now a World Heritage Site, which includes Kew Palace. <span class="loc">Kew</span> is also the home of important historical documents such as Domesday Book, which is on public display at The National Archives. Successive Tudor, Stuart and Georgian monarchs maintained links with <span class="loc">Kew</span>. During the French Revolution, many refugees established themselves there and it was the home of several artists in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since 1965 <span class="loc">Kew</span> has incorporated the former area of <span class="loc">North Sheen</span> which includes St Philip and <span class="loc">All Saints</span>, the first barn church consecrated in <span class="loc">England</span>. It is now in a combined Church of England ecclesiastical parish with St Luke's Church, <span class="loc">Kew</span>. Today, <span class="loc">Kew</span> is an expensive residential area because of its suburban hallmarks. Among these are sports-and-leisure open spaces, schools, transport links, architecture, restaurants, no high rise buildings, modest road sizes, trees and gardens. Most of <span class="loc">Kew</span> developed in the late 19th century, following the arrival of the District line of the Underground. Further development took place in the 1920s and 1930s when new houses were built on the market gardens of <span class="loc">North Sheen</span> and in the first decade of the 21st century when considerably more river-fronting flats and houses were constructed by the <span class="loc">Thames</span> on land formerly owned by <span class="loc">Thames</span> Water.</p>
