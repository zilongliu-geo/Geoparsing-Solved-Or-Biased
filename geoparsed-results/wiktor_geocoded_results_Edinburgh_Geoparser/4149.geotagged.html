<p><span class="loc">Truro</span> is a town in central <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. <span class="loc">Truro</span> is the shire town of <span class="loc">Colchester County</span> and is located on the south side of the <span class="loc">Salmon River</span> floodplain, close to the river's mouth at the eastern end of <span class="loc">Cobequid Bay</span>. The Mi'kmaq name for the <span class="loc">Truro</span> area, "Wagobagitik" meaning "end of the water's flow", was shortened by Acadian settlers to "Cobequid" who arrived in the area in the early 1700s and by 1727 had established a small village near the present downtown site of <span class="loc">Truro</span> known as "Vil <span class="loc">Bois Brule</span>" (Village in the burnt wood). Many Acadians in this region left in the Acadian Exodus which preceded the Expulsion of the Acadians in 1755, the town was resettled in 1761 by Presbyterians of predominantly Ulster Scottish origin who came from <span class="loc">Ireland</span> via <span class="loc">New England</span>. It is named after the <span class="loc">city of Truro</span> in <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Originally a small farming community, the construction of the <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> Railway between <span class="loc">Halifax</span>, and <span class="loc">Pictou</span> in 1858 caused the municipality to experience a fast rate of growth which increased even more when the railway connected to central <span class="loc">Canada</span> in 1872 and became the Intercolonial Railway. The Intercolonial, which later became the Canadian National Railway built a large roundhouse and rail yard in <span class="loc">Truro</span>. Further rail links to <span class="loc">Cape Breton</span> and to the <span class="loc">Annapolis</span> Valley through the Dominion Atlantic Railway in 1905 made the town even more a transportation hub for <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>. The railway also attracted industries such as the Truro Woolen Mills in 1870 (which later became Stanfield's) and provincial institutions like the provincial Normal School (later the Nova Scotia Teachers College) and the Nova Scotia Agricultural College. The town officially incorporated in 1875. Many figures from the town's past are featured in over 40 tree sculptures which were carved in tree trunks after <span class="loc">Truro</span> lost most of its Elm trees to Dutch Elm Disease in the 1990s. The history of the town and surrounding county is preserved at the Colchester Historical Museum (c.1900-1901), which is designated under the provincial Heritage Property Act.</p>
