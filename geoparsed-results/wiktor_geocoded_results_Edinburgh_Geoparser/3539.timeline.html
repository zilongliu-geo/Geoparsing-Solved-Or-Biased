  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wilmington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,253 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is named after <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> is on the county's north border and is southwest of <span class="loc">Plattsburgh</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">Whiteface region</span> of the <span class="loc">Adirondack</span> Park. The town was first settled circa <span class="date">1812</span>. The town was formed in <span class="date">1821</span> from the town of Jay. At that time the town was called "Dansville". In <span class="date">1822</span>, the name was changed, as suggested by a settler from <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, to "<span class="loc">Wilmington</span>" due to confusion with another "Dansville" in <span class="loc">New York</span>. In <span class="date">1848</span>, part of the town was partitioned off to form the town of St. Armand. At the beginning of the 20th century, the tourist industry began to develop in the town.
