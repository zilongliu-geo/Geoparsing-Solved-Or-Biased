<p><span class="loc">Halifax</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Plymouth County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,518 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Halifax</span> was first settled by Europeans, most notably the Bosworth family from <span class="loc">Bosworth Fields</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>, in 1669, growing with lumbering and agriculture. It was officially separated from the town of <span class="loc">Plympton</span> and incorporated in 1734, and was named for <span class="loc">Halifax</span>, <span class="loc">West Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The town was part of an early effort to create a canal between <span class="loc">Buzzards Bay</span> and <span class="loc">Massachusetts Bay</span>, when in 1795 a canal was proposed between the <span class="loc">Taunton River</span> and <span class="loc">North River</span>. However, the plan never succeeded, although the town's sawmills continued to grow, as did cranberry production, iron furnaces and a wool mill. The railroad came in the nineteenth century, providing access for people from the city to the shores of <span class="loc">Silver Lake</span> and the <span class="loc">Monponsett Ponds</span>. Today the town is mostly residential, with a small retail area growing at the center of town. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 17.3 square miles (45 km2), of which 16.1 square miles (42 km2) is land and 1.2 square miles (3.1 km2), or 6.81%, is water. Statistically, <span class="loc">Halifax</span> is the 235th largest town in the Commonwealth by land area, and is eighteenth out of the twenty-seven communities in <span class="loc">Plymouth County</span>. <span class="loc">Halifax</span> is bordered by <span class="loc">Hanson</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Pembroke</span> to the northeast, <span class="loc">Plympton</span> to the southeast, <span class="loc">Middleborough</span> to the southwest, and <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> and <span class="loc">East Bridgewater</span> to the west. <span class="loc">Halifax</span> is approximately 12 miles (19 km) west of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, 13 miles (21 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Brockton</span>, and 33 miles (53 km) south-southeast of <span class="loc">Boston</span>.</p>
