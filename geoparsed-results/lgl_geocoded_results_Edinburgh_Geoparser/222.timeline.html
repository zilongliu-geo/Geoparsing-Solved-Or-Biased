  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="date">Past year</span> has been ‘best’ for Dyer. The <span class="date">2008</span> <span class="loc">Walker County</span> Fair Queen made one of her last official appearances <span class="date">Tuesday</span> during the annual Committeeman’s Barbecue at the <span class="loc">Walker County</span> Fairgrounds. <span class="per">Jordan Dyer</span>, a 17-year-old <span class="org">Huntsville High School</span> student, has spent <span class="date">the last year</span> making more than 30 public appearances in <span class="loc">Huntsville</span> and in counties around the state as the current fair queen. <span class="date">Now</span>, just <span class="date">days</span> before the <span class="date">2009</span> <span class="loc">Walker County</span> Fair Queen is to be crowned, Dyer is all smiles as she fulfills her final duties. “This was probably the best year I’ve ever had,” <span class="per">Dyer</span> said. “I probably went to about 30 or 40 events throughout the year, including all kinds of fair functions, shows and meetings. “It was a really busy year, but I knew going into it that I was going to have that much to do, and I had a great time.” Dyer’s favorite part of being the fair queen was working with younger participants on events like the <span class="per">Prince</span> and <span class="per">Princess</span> Contest. “I learned a lot both while traveling around the state and while working with different groups in <span class="loc">Walker County</span>,” <span class="per">Dyer</span> said. “Not only did I make friendships that will last a lifetime, but I gained leadership and communication skills as well. “I didn’t realize how many kids would be looking up to me in this position, and I definitely had to stay on my best behavior for the entire year.” With a new fair queen to be crowned <span class="date">Saturday</span>, Dyer has very few remaining duties to fulfill as the current queen. “In addition to participating in the Committeeman’s Barbecue, I’m also going to be involved in the annual <span class="loc">Walker County</span> Fair Association Parade, and I’ll also be part of the rehearsals for the opening ceremonies,” she said. “Of course, I’ll be available to help the girls in <span class="date">this year</span>’s queen contest get ready for their events, as well. “I know the girls who are competing — especially those who end up in the queen’s court and the new queen herself — are going to have a great time. The whole experience was a lot of fun, and I would definitely do it again if I could.” While Dyer was showing her contest heifer in Houston on the day of the <span class="date">2009</span> queen participants’ contest presentations, she said she was very impressed with the video recording of the contest. “I think everybody did a really great job with their projects, and I think every one of the contestants has a really good shot at earning the crown,” she said. “Whoever doesn’t win, I hope they continue on and participate in the contest <span class="date">next year</span>. “Regardless of who wins the contest, I would just want to tell that person not to take the experience for granted. I think they should just have fun with it, be really respectful to the other contestants and not be stressed out.” On <span class="date">July 30</span>, Dyer will turn 18, and while she previously planned to attend <span class="per">Stephen F. Austin</span> University, she has considered changing her plans and applying to <span class="org">Sam Houston State University</span>. Wherever she attends college, <span class="per">Dyer</span> says she wants to major in nursing and participate in National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association events.</p><br><br>
