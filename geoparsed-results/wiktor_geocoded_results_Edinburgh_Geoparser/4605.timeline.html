  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sado</span> (佐渡市, Sado-shi) is a city located on <span class="loc">Sado</span> Island (佐渡島 or 佐渡ヶ島, both Sadogashima) in Niigata Prefecture, in the <span class="loc">Chūbu region</span> of <span class="loc">Japan</span>. Since <span class="date">2004</span>, the city has comprised the entire island, although not all of its total area of is urbanized. <span class="loc">Sado</span> is the sixth largest island of <span class="loc">Japan</span> in area following the four main islands and <span class="loc">Okinawa</span> Island (excluding the Northern Territories). As of <span class="date">April 1, 2011</span>, the city has an estimated population of 63,231 and a population density of 73.93 persons per km2. The total area is 855.26 km2. The large number of pottery artifacts found near <span class="loc">Ogi</span> in the South of the island demonstrate that <span class="loc">Sado</span> was populated as early as the Jomon period. The Nihon Shoki mentions that Mishihase people visited the island in 544 (although it is unknown whether Tungusic people effectively came). The island formed a distinct province, the <span class="loc">Sado Province</span>, separate from the <span class="loc">Echigo province</span> on Honshū, at the beginning of the 8th century. At first, the province was a single gun (district), but was later divided into three gun: <span class="loc">Sawata</span>, <span class="loc">Hamochi</span> and <span class="loc">Kamo</span>.</p><br><br>
