<p><span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the 2010 census, its population was 46,034. The county seat is <span class="loc">Newport</span>. The county is named for <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span>, 16th president of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Newport</span>, <span class="loc">OR</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> was created by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on February 20, 1893, from the western portion of <span class="loc">Benton</span> and <span class="loc">Polk</span> counties. The county adjusted its boundaries in 1923, 1925, 1927, 1931, and 1949. At the time of the county's creation, <span class="loc">Toledo</span> was picked as the temporary county seat. In 1896 it was chosen as the permanent county seat. Three elections were held to determine if the county seat should be moved from <span class="loc">Toledo</span> to <span class="loc">Newport</span>. Twice these votes failedâ€”in 1928 and 1938. In 1954, however, the vote went in <span class="loc">Newport</span>'s favor. While <span class="loc">Toledo</span> has remained the industrial hub of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, the city has never regained the position it once had. Like <span class="loc">Tillamook County</span> to the north, for the first decades of its existence <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> was isolated from the rest of the state. This was solved with the construction of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 101 (completed in 1925), and the Salmon River Highway (completed in 1930). In 1936, as one of many federally funded construction projects, bridges were constructed across the bays at <span class="loc">Waldport</span>, <span class="loc">Newport</span>, and <span class="loc">Siletz</span>, eliminating the ferries needed to cross these bays.</p>
