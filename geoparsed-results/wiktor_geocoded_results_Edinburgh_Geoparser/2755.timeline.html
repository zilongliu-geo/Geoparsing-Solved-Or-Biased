  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Phoenix is a village in <span class="loc">Cook County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,964 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is located approximately 19 miles (31 km) south of the <span class="loc">Chicago Loop</span> and is part of the Chicago–Naperville–Joliet, <span class="loc">IL-IN-WI Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The development of Phoenix is closely tied to its larger neighbor, Harvey. Harvey was established as an industrial city with no saloons. Many of its early factories were located between the <span class="org">Illinois Central Railroad</span> and Harvey's eastern boundary at <span class="loc">Halsted</span> Street. One local businessman, <span class="per">William McLatchy</span>, owned a large tract of land in an unincorporated area outside of Harvey. Soon, five saloons had opened in the area and a small housing subdivision known as <span class="loc">Phenix</span> Park was constructed during the 1890s. City leaders in Harvey, seeing businesses just outside their boundaries selling alcohol to local workers, sought to annex <span class="loc">Phenix</span> Park and render it "dry" or free of alcohol-related establishments. The residents of <span class="loc">Phenix</span> Park wanted to retain local control of their affairs as an independent village. On <span class="date">August 29, 1900</span>, an election was held to determine <span class="date">the future</span> status of the area. A total of 56 votes were cast with 38 (67.9%) voting in favor of incorporation and 18 (32.1%) against. Despite legal challenges from Harvey, the result was upheld.</p><br><br>
