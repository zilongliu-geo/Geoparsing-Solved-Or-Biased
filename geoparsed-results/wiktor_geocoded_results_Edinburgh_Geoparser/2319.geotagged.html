<p>Marino [Irish: Muiríne] is a <span class="loc">Northside</span> suburb located in <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. <span class="loc">Marino</span> encompasses the area within the boundaries of Sion Hill Road, Gracepark Road, Philipsburgh Avenue (north of Lynch's), <span class="loc">Malahide Road</span> and <span class="loc">Shelmartin Terrace</span>. Marino borders other <span class="loc">Northside</span> areas such as <span class="loc">Fairview</span>, <span class="loc">Donnycarney</span> and <span class="loc">Clontarf</span>. It is two kilometres from the GPO in O'Connell Street. The area is served by the <span class="loc">Clontarf</span> Road DART station. The townland of <span class="loc">Marino</span> was carved out of the townland of <span class="loc">Donnycarney</span> which was granted to the Corporation of Dublin following the dissolution of The Priory of All Hallows in the reign of King Henry VIII. The area was developed for housing in the late 1920s and 1930s on the former estate lands of the Earl of Charlemont in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Clonturk</span> (now <span class="loc">Marino</span>, <span class="loc">Fairview</span> and <span class="loc">Drumcondra</span>). It is notable as one of the first examples, in the newly formed Irish state, of an affordable housing project. It is heavily influenced by the garden city movement. The area consists of about 1,300 houses built for the most part of concrete, which was an unusual building material at that time in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. The houses were built by a private contractor using a proportion of immigrant German builders. The houses each cost £657 to build (approximately €40,000 at today's costs ).</p>
