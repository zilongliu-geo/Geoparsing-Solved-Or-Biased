<p><span class="loc">Kalbar</span> is a small town and locality in the Scenic Rim, <span class="loc">South East Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located near the Cunningham Highway and directly north of <span class="loc">Mount French</span> in the <span class="loc">Fassifern</span> Valley. The town is part of the Scenic Rim Region local government area. At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Kalbar</span> had a population of 723. Settlement began at the location in 1876 and by 1890 a small town had developed. The town was once known as <span class="loc">Fassifern</span> Scrub and then <span class="loc">Engelsburg</span> after the first settler of the town. The town has a very rich German history, reflected today in the many Anglo-German road and street names as well as the many local German settler descendant surnames. The name changed to <span class="loc">Kalbar</span> because of anti-German sentiment in 1916. The <span class="loc">Mount Edwards</span> railway line reached the town in the same year. Engelsburg Post Office opened on 7 July 1897 (a receiving office had been open from 1878. known as <span class="loc">Engels</span> for five years) and was renamed <span class="loc">Kalbar</span> in 1916. During the 1899 referendum to decide if <span class="loc">Australia</span> should become a federation, <span class="loc">Kalbar</span> registered the highest No vote of any town in <span class="loc">Queensland</span>. In 1920, the Kalbar School of Arts hall and half the businesses in town were destroyed by fire.</p>
