  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Fortuna</span> is the name of a district and a small city located in <span class="loc">San Carlos</span>, in the <span class="loc">province of Alajuela</span>, <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span>. "<span class="loc">La Fortuna</span>" is Spanish for "The Fortune", and aptly named due its ample supply of tourist attractions and extremely fertile lands. Originally called "El Bur√≠o", <span class="loc">La Fortuna</span> was founded in the <span class="date">mid 1930s</span> by settlers that came from <span class="loc">Ciudad Quesada</span>, <span class="loc">Grecia</span> (canton), <span class="loc">Alajuela</span> and other parts of the region. In <span class="date">1968</span>, the Arenal Volcano erupted to the west, causing extensive damage and casualties, including 82 deaths. The eruption did not reach the village of <span class="loc">La Fortuna</span>. This catastrophe, nonetheless, changed the geography of whole region, making it one of the most visited tourist destinations of <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span>. <span class="loc">Arenal</span> is often cited by scientists as being in the top 10 or top 20 of the world's most active volcanoes. <span class="loc">La Fortuna</span> is less than 10 km from the peak of <span class="loc">Arenal</span> and less than 20 km from the entrance to Arenal Volcano National Park (the entrance is west of the peak, whereas <span class="loc">La Fortuna</span> is east of the peak).</p><br><br>
