<p>Parker is a city located in <span class="loc">Armstrong County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located in the extreme northwestern portion of the county. The population was 840 at the 2010 census. The city was named for Judge John Parker, a lead surveyor of <span class="loc">Lawrenceburg</span> and founder/owner of Parker's Landing, the two villages which were combined to create Parker. Parker is sometimes referred to as the "<span class="loc">Smallest City</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.A.</span>". Parker was incorporated as a city on March 1, 1873, by special state legislation in the midst of the northwestern <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> oil boom. The new municipality was called "Parker" and was made up of the earlier villages of Parker's Landing (on the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> River) and <span class="loc">Lawrenceburg</span> (on the bluff above the river). Residents assumed that Parker would quickly become a major population center, and, at the height of the oil boom, the population of Parker grew to over 20,000. The boom quickly went bust, however, and by the 1880s the "city" returned to its historic, small village size, and a population of approximately 1,000.</p>
