<p>Sale is a city situated in the <span class="loc">Gippsland region</span> of the Australian state of Victoria. It has a population (2011) of 13,186. Sale has seen much development and redevelopment in the past decade, one example being the multimillion-dollar redevelopment of the city's Port of Sale. Two famous Gippsland explorers, Paul Strzelecki and Angus McMillan, passed through the immediate area around 1840. The first white settler was Archibald <span class="loc">McIntosh</span> who arrived in 1844 and established his '<span class="loc">Flooding</span> Creek' property on the flood plain country which was duly inundated soon after his arrival. In the 1840s, drovers heading south to <span class="loc">Port Albert</span> crossed <span class="loc">Flooding</span> Creek and were confronted with the difficult marsh country around the <span class="loc">Thomson</span> and <span class="loc">Latrobe</span> rivers. A punt operated across the <span class="loc">Latrobe</span> River until a toll bridge was erected. A Post Office named <span class="loc">Flooding</span> Creek opened here on 30 September 1848 being renamed, somewhat belatedly, as Sale on 1 January 1854. The first town plots went on sale in 1850. When the new settlement was gazetted in 1851 it was named 'Sale' â€” a tribute to General Sir Robert Sale, a British army officer who won fame in the first Afghan war before being killed in battle in <span class="loc">India</span> in 1845. An SBS TV documentary "<span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>: The Great Game"  claims that it is actually named after his wife, Lady Florentia Sale (1790-1853), who wrote a famous journal of her experiences during the First Afghan War which became a best seller in the 1840s and was serialised in The Times (<span class="loc">UK</span>) and possibly in <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Certainly, her letters to her husband were enthusiastically published in Australian papers.</p>
