<p><span class="loc">Villanueva</span> is a second class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Misamis Oriental</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It is approximately 30–40 minutes away from the city of <span class="loc">Cagayan de Oro</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 31,966 people. The presence of companies like Philippine Sinter Corporation (PSC), STEAG State Power Inc., <span class="loc">Purina</span>, and recent opening Coca Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc. contributes to the municipality's income although it is largely agricultural. <span class="loc">Villanueva</span> celebrates the feast of the <span class="loc">Our Lady of Guadalupe</span> every 12 December. In 2015, it celebrated its ″1st Bongloy Festival″. Long before the advent of Spanish colonization, the place was originally named “Bongloy” by the natives called the Magahats, because of the three gigantic Bongloy trees that grew in the place where the Catholic church and town plaza stands today. In 1830, the mission of <span class="loc">Jasaan</span>, an adjacent town to the north, was to establish separation from <span class="loc">Cagayan de Oro</span> and evangelization to as far as the towns of <span class="loc">Sumilao</span>, <span class="loc">Linabo</span> and <span class="loc">Malitbog</span> in the <span class="loc">province of Bukidnon</span>. Its center of civilization and the first Church was at “Daanglungsod” which is now the <span class="loc">Aplaya</span>, <span class="loc">Jasaan</span>, where an old kota (watchtower) still exists, thus marked the birth of Christianity in <span class="loc">Bongloy</span>.</p>
