<p>Alma is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Wabaunsee County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 832. For millennia, the land now known as <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, most of modern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was secured by the <span class="loc">United States</span> as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in 1861 <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In 1859, <span class="loc">Wabaunsee County</span> was founded. The first house was built at Alma in 1867. In 1887, the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Nebraska Railway built a main line from <span class="loc">Topeka</span> through Alma to <span class="loc">Herington</span>. The <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Nebraska Railway was foreclosed in 1891 and taken over by <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980. This line of the former <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> Railroad was sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad and later merged into the Union Pacific that operates and owns the line today. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the "<span class="loc">Rock Island</span>". The city was named after either the <span class="loc">city of Alma</span>, <span class="loc">Germany</span>, or for a stream in the <span class="loc">Ukraine</span>.</p>
