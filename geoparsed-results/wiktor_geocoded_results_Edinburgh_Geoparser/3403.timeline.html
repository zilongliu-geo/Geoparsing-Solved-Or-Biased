It occupies an area of 195 square kilometers, and has a population (<span class="date">2006</span>) of 8,992. Location of the city center is 14º11’12.91”N, 89º13’19.82”W.

History People are friendly and courteous to visitors. Most people from the neighboring “cantones” or hamlets display Caucasian features; they may be blond, with fair skin and blue eyes. This may be because the entire department of <span class="loc">Chalatenango</span> was populated by early Spanish settlers attracted by the boom of indigo cultivation in colonial times and sent there by Baron of Carardalet, governor of <span class="loc">Guatemala</span> in the late 18th century. A pdf document published by FISDL, (http://www.fisdl.gob.sv/index2.php?option 902) indicates that “As per <span class="per">Antonio Gutierrez</span> y <span class="loc">Ulloa</span> in <span class="date">1807</span> <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> was simply a hacienda of cattle and indigo belonging to <span class="per">Bernardino Aguilar</span>, five leagues N. <span class="per">E. of Tejutla</span>, away from the Royal Road. As per other traditions, that hacienda became a hamlet in <span class="date">1819</span> and then, fulfilling the <span class="per">Laws</span> and <span class="per">Orders</span> of Indias it became a village with the long name of <span class="per">San Jose</span> <span class="loc">Agua Caliente</span> de las <span class="loc">Flores</span>. The new municipality was incorporated to the Region of <span class="per">Tejutla</span>. From <span class="date">1824</span> to <span class="date">1833</span> it belonged to the department of <span class="loc">San Salvador</span>; to the department of <span class="per">Tejutla</span> in <span class="date">1833</span>; to the department of <span class="loc">San Salvador</span> from <span class="date">1833</span> to <span class="date">1835</span>; to the department of Cuzcatlan from <span class="date">1835</span> to <span class="date">1855</span>. From then on it has been a municipality of <span class="loc">Chalatenango</span>. In <span class="date">1890</span> it had 2,340 souls. Its name comes from two hot springs in the area and another one in the canton of Obrajuelo.”</p><br><br>
