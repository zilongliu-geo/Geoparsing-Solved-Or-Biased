<p>Linden is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Marengo County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,123 at the 2010 census. Settled prior to 1818, the community was first known as <span class="loc">Screamersville</span>, due to the cry of wild animals that could be heard during the night. It became the county seat in 1819 and was then known as the Town of <span class="loc">Marengo</span>. This was changed to <span class="loc">Hohenlinden</span> in 1823 to honor the county's earliest European settlers, French Bonapartist refugees to the Vine and Olive Colony. The name of <span class="loc">Hohenlinden</span> was chosen to commemorate a battle in 1800 at <span class="loc">Hohenlinden</span>, <span class="loc">Germany</span>, in which the French were victorious over the Austrians and Bavarians. The spelling was later simplified to Linden. Linden is located at 32°18′4″N 87°47′34″W (32.301154, -87.792650).
