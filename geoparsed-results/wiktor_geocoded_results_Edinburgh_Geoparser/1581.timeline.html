  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Miami</span> (/maɪˈæmə/ my-AM-ə) is a city in and county seat of <span class="loc">Ottawa County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 13,570, a decline of one percent from 13,704 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The city is named after the Miami tribe. <span class="loc">Miami</span> is the capital of the Miami Tribe of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Modoc Tribe</span> of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Ottawa Tribe</span> of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Peoria Tribe</span> of Indians and Shawnee Tribe. <span class="loc">Miami</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Joplin</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> metropolitan area. <span class="loc">Miami</span> began in a rather unique way, compared to other towns in Indian Territory. The <span class="org">Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture</span> quotes Velma Nieberding, author of the History of <span class="loc">Ottawa County</span>, as saying, "... it was settled in a business-like way by men of vision who looked into <span class="date">the future</span> and saw possibilities. It didn't just grow. It was carefully planned." <span class="per">W.C. Lykins</span> is credited as the driving force for the creation of the town. He petitioned the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Congress to pass legislation on <span class="date">March 3, 1891</span> to establish the town. He met with <span class="per">Thomas F. Richardville</span>, chief of the Miami tribe, who agreed to meet in turn with the <span class="org">U.S. Indian Commission</span> and the <span class="loc">Ottawa</span> tribe. That meeting resulted in Congress authorizing the secretary of the <span class="loc">Interior Department</span> to approve the townsite purchase from the Ottawas. <span class="per">Lykins</span>, <span class="per">Richardville</span> and <span class="per">Manford</span> <span class="loc">Pooler</span>, chief of the <span class="loc">Ottawa</span>, are identified in historical accounts as "fathers of <span class="loc">Miami</span>."</p><br><br>
