<p><span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Barron County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. The population was 2,170 at the 2010 census. The city is located partially within the Town of <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>. It was incorporated in 1885. <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is often called the “<span class="loc">Island City</span>” and the main part of the city, including the original settlement, is located on land surrounded by <span class="loc">Beaver Dam Lake</span>, originally settled by Chippewa Indian Tribe. <span class="loc">Beaver Dam Lake</span> was referred to as Che-wa-cum-ma-towangok or “Lake Made by the Beavers,” by the local tribe. The Chief of the Chippewa Tribe was Pon-gee Rau-gen, or “Little Pipe”. He continued to live in the area even after it was settled by European settlers and drowned in a canoe on <span class="loc">Beaver Dam Lake</span> in 1895. In 1874, A. Ritan and R. H. Clothier explored the area with the intention of settling in there. While exploring, they came across surveyors that informed them of the upcoming railroad line that the <span class="loc">North Wisconsin Railway</span> Company planned to lay in the area. A. Ritan, who lived near what is today <span class="loc">Turtle Lake</span> and the Dahlby Family, originally of Norwegian descent, from the town of <span class="loc">New Richmond</span>, both filed a homestead near the proposed railroad and built two log cabins, 300 feet north of the present high school location. In 1878, the <span class="loc">North Wisconsin Railroad</span> Company extended the rail lines through the area. Prior to the railroad, settlers were required to get provisions in <span class="loc">Rice Lake</span>, <span class="loc">Barron</span> or Clayton. In 1880, the Dahlby Family sold their cabin and moved to Chandler (now known as Spooner) and open a store. A. Ritan, also originally from <span class="loc">Norway</span>, lived in <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> for many years and helped develop the city before moving to <span class="loc">Portland</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>.</p>
