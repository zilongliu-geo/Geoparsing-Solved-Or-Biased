  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lena</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Stephenson County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The population was 2,912 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In <span class="date">1853</span>, a railroad survey by <span class="per">B. Dornblazer</span> determined a course through present-day <span class="per">Lena</span>. <span class="per">Samuel F. Dodds</span>, who owned 80 acres (320,000 m2) of land in the area, purchased an additional tract of 80 acres (320,000 m2) on behalf of the railroad company and grading work was begun. <span class="per">Dodds</span> owned a stone residence which still occupies Lot No. 1 on <span class="per">Lena Street</span>, while <span class="per">Dr. F. Voightheld</span> owned a log home (which has subsequently been demolished) near the train depot. At the time, these two buildings made up the extent of the town. The town was originally shaped as a parallelogram covering twenty-six blocks for a total of 304 housing lots. During the <span class="date">summer of 1853</span>, lots sold rapidly, commanding prices varying from $50 to $150 each. On <span class="date">New Year's Day 1854</span>, track was laid, and railway cars began running between <span class="per">Freeport</span> and <span class="per">Warren</span>. The population began to grow, mostly with English and Irish residents. In <span class="date">1854</span>, there were about a dozen families in <span class="per">Lena</span>.</p><br><br>
