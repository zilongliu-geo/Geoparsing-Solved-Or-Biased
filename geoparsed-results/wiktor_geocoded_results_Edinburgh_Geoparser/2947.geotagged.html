<p>Auburn is a small town in the southern edge of the <span class="loc">Clare</span> Valley, in the Mid North of South <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It lies in the northern Mount Lofty Ranges just east of the <span class="loc">Skilly Hills</span>. Auburn is bisected by the <span class="loc">Wakefield</span> River as it makes its way to the sea at <span class="loc">Port Wakefield</span>. It has strong poetical themes, being named from a poem and the birthplace of a famed poet. The first European to explore through the Auburn district, in April 1839, was John Hill, who was followed one month later by Edward John Eyre. On 10 March 1840 John Morphett selected a special survey of 4,000 acres on the <span class="loc">Wakefield</span> River as land agent for three English investors, Admiral George Lambert, Edward Rice M.P., and Robert Slaney M.P.. Very soon after, just outside the southwest corner of this survey, a pioneering character named William Tateham squatted on the <span class="loc">Wakefield</span> River, living in a riverbank dugout from where he provided hospitality to travellers. The spot, which later became the site of Auburn, was for a time named Tateham's Waterhole or Billy Tatum's because of this.</p>
