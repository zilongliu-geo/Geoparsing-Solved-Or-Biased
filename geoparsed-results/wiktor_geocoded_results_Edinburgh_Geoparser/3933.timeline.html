  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Woodville</span> is a suburb of Adelaide, situated about 8 kilometres northwest of the Central Business District of Adelaide. It lies within the City of <span class="per">Charles Sturt</span>. The postcode of <span class="loc">Woodville</span> is 5011. <span class="loc">Woodville</span> is bound by Cheltenham Parade to the west, Torrens Road to the north, Port Road to the south and <span class="loc">Park Street</span> to the east, excluding the area of Cheltenham Park Racecourse. <span class="loc">Woodville</span> was one of the first areas to be settled by European migrants in the mid-19th century, many establishing dairy farms in the vicinity. By <span class="date">1853</span> <span class="loc">Woodville</span> consisted of 24 houses, a forge and a wheelwrightâ€™s shop. The <span class="org">Woodville Post Office</span> opened around <span class="date">March 1856</span>. It has many fine examples of colonial and federation architecture and was considered to be a genteel area. Many European migrants settled in <span class="loc">Woodville</span> and the surrounds after World War II. It was a busy local centre in <span class="date">the 1950s and 1960s</span> when General Motors Holden had a car manufacturing plant in the nearby suburb of <span class="loc">Cheltenham</span> and because of its proximity to the <span class="per">Queen Elizabeth</span> Hospital in <span class="loc">Woodville</span> South. <span class="loc">Woodville</span> Road was the hub of local activity with numerous commercial businesses. During <span class="date">the 1980s and 1990s</span>, <span class="loc">Woodville</span> and its surrounds became home to many Vietnamese refugees from the <span class="org">Vietnam War</span>. Decline set in in <span class="date">the 1980s</span> upon the closure of the <span class="loc">Cheltenham</span> plant of General Motors Holden. <span class="loc">Woodville</span> became a depressed suburb, particularly during <span class="date">the 1990s</span>. Since then, <span class="loc">Woodville</span> is undergoing a revival and many are <span class="date">now</span> seeking residence in <span class="loc">Woodville</span> because of its architecture. <span class="loc">Woodville</span> Road, although not as a lively as it once was, is starting to develop a personality again. <span class="loc">Woodville</span>'s inhabitants are still multiethnic.</p><br><br>
