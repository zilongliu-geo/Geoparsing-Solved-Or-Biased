Three <span class="loc">Eastland County</span> residents were charged with arson after fires burned more than 260 acres and five structures in <span class="loc">Eastland</span> and <span class="loc">Callahan</span> counties, according to the <span class="org">Texas Fire Service</span>. <span class="per">Brian Freeman</span>, 23, <span class="per">Christina Utley</span>, 20, and <span class="per">Michael Thomas</span>, 24, each face five charges of arson and one charge of organized criminal activity, the service said in a statement. — <span class="per">Alex Branch</span> — Negative comments on MySpace apparently caused an argument <span class="date">Monday</span> that ended with one 14-year-old girl stabbing another girl in the chest with a pair of scissors at <span class="org">Handley Middle School</span>, police said. The victim, also 14, suffered "two small, shallow puncture wounds" that were not life-threatening, said Lt. <span class="per">Paul Henderson</span>, a police spokesman. She was taken to Cook Children’s Medical Center. The argument between the girls escalated at the school, police said. One girl grabbed a pair of scissors and stabbed the other girl repeatedly in the chest. The suspect was taken to a juvenile detention facility. — <span class="per">Alex Branch</span></p><br><br>
