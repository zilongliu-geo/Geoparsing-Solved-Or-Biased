<p><span class="loc">Kanal</span> (pronounced [kaˈnaːl] or [kaˈnaːu̯]; Italian: <span class="loc">Canale</span>, German: Kanalburg), frequently referred to as Kanal ob Soči ("Kanal on the Soča"; pronounced [kaˈnaːl ɔp ˈsoːtʃi] or [kaˈnaːu̯ ɔp ˈsoːtʃi]; Italian: <span class="loc">Canale d'Isonzo</span>), is a settlement mostly on the left bank of the Soča River in the Slovene Littoral, the traditional region in southwestern <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. It is an important crossing point over the Soča. At its eastern border, on the left bank of the Soča, runs the Bohinj Railway, the railway track linking the <span class="loc">Central Europe</span> and the Mediterranean. The name <span class="loc">Kanal</span> comes from the shape of the valley. The parish church of <span class="loc">Kanal</span> is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary and belongs to the <span class="loc">Diocese of Koper</span>. The current church was built in the Gothic style in the 1430s on the site of a 13th-century predecessor. The still preserved Gothic element is the chancel, whereas the nave was redesigned from 1632 until 1670 in the Baroque style and the facade was redesigned from 1787 until 1795 in the Neoclassical style. The original bell tower was built in 1632, but demolished in World War I and later rebuilt in the Renaissance Revival style. The left (northern) side chapel, dedicated to <span class="loc">Saint Anthony</span> of <span class="loc">Padua</span>, was consecrated in 1662, whereas the right (southern) side chapel, dedicated to the Mother of God, was built in 1698.</p>
