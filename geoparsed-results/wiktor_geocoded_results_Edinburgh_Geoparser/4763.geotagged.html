<p>Kettering is a city in <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> and <span class="loc">Greene</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, located almost entirely in <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>. It is a suburb of Dayton. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 56,163, making it the largest suburb in the <span class="loc">Dayton Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The area where the <span class="loc">city of Kettering</span> now lies was settled from the late 1700s to the mid-1800s, largely as farmland. The population in the area started to grow, prompting the creation of (now defunct) Van Buren Township in 1841. In November 1952, township voters approved incorporating as the Village of <span class="loc">Kettering</span>. (In 1953, the western portion of the village voted to secede, forming a new township, which is now the City of Moraine). By 1955, the village's population had grown to 38,118, which qualified it to claim city status, with the official proclamation by the state on June 24. The city is named for inventor Charles F. Kettering, who resided here in his home, Ridgeleigh Terrace, from 1914 until his death in 1958. Charles Kettering is known for his numerous inventions and contributions to the Dayton area.</p>
