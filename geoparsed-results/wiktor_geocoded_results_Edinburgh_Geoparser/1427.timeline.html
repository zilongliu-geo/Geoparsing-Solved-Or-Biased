  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is an area of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>, in <span class="loc">Merseyside</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, encompassing streets between <span class="loc">Tuebrook</span> and <span class="loc">Kensington</span> and stretching to <span class="loc">Old Swan</span>. It consists of a variety of houses; there are some traditional red-brick terraces, larger Victorian villas and also the notable and rather wonderful 300-year-old Georgian Fairfield Crescent which is off the equally old and wonderful <span class="loc">Prospect Vale</span>. Hidden gems in a conservation area which were they located in a different part of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> would be worth considerably more. The area also contains the Victorian <span class="loc">Newsham Park</span>, for which the area is notable. Friends of <span class="loc">Newsham Park</span> meet with council officers regularly at the <span class="loc">Newsham Park</span> park forum to discuss improvements to the park and are currently anticipating the start on site of the building of a new pavilion. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is <span class="date">now</span> also home to the new shopping development on Prescot Road, which brings much needed retail stores like <span class="loc">Iceland</span>, <span class="org">Tesco</span>, <span class="org">Greggs</span> and other shops into this once neglected neighbourhood centre. Another new facility is the community fire station on Beech Street which was opened in <span class="date">2010</span> by the <span class="per">Duchess of Gloucester</span>. It has been named "<span class="loc">Kensington</span>" Fire Station, despite being just inside the <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> border. Residents of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> with its <span class="date">300 year</span> old history are often cross when their area is referred to as "<span class="loc">Kensington</span>", and will write letters of complaint to the Liverpool Echo. They are fiercely proud of their history. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is paired with <span class="loc">Kensington</span> to form a <span class="loc">Liverpool City</span> Council Ward.</p><br><br>
