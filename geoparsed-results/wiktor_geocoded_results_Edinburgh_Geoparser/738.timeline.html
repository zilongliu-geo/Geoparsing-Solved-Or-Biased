  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Windsor</span> (/ˈwɪnzər/) is a town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of <span class="loc">Windsor and Maidenhead</span> in <span class="loc">Berkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is widely known as the site of <span class="loc">Windsor Castle</span>, one of the official residences of the British Royal Family. The town is situated 23 miles (37 km) <span class="loc">west of Charing Cross</span>, <span class="loc">London</span>. It is immediately south of the <span class="loc">River Thames</span>, which forms its boundary with <span class="loc">Eton</span>. The village of <span class="loc">Old Windsor</span>, just over 2 miles (3 km) to the south, predates what is <span class="date">now</span> called <span class="loc">Windsor</span> by around <span class="date">300 years</span>; in <span class="date">the past</span> <span class="loc">Windsor</span> was formally referred to as <span class="loc">New Windsor</span> to distinguish the two. The early history of the site is unknown, although it was almost certainly settled some <span class="date">years</span> before <span class="date">1070</span> when William the Conqueror had a timber motte and bailey castle constructed. The focus of royal interest at that time was not the castle, however, but a small riverside settlement about 3 miles (5 km) downstream, possibly established from the 7th century. <span class="loc">Windsor</span>, or Windlesora as it was called in the 11th century, is first mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The name originates from old English Windles-ore, or 'winch by the riverside'. The settlement had used an earlier name, but this is unknown. From about the 8th century, high status people started to visit the site occasionally, and possibly this included royalty. From the 11th century the site's link with king <span class="per">Edward</span> the Confessor is documented, but again, information about his use of the place is scant. After the Conquest of <span class="date">1066</span> royal use of the site increased, probably because it offered good access to woodlands and opportunities for hunting – a sport which also practised military skills. By the late 12th century, and the relocation of the royal household to an enlarged castle in <span class="date">1110</span>, the site was renamed <span class="loc">Old Windsor</span>.</p><br><br>
