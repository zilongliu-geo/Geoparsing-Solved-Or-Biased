  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is the fourth-least densely populated of the 64 counties of the state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 1,394, making it the fourth-least populated county in <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. The county seat and only incorporated municipality in the county is <span class="loc">Walden</span>. Most of <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a high relatively broad intermontane basin known as <span class="loc">North Park</span>, which covers 1,613 square miles (4,180 km2). This basin opens north into <span class="loc">Wyoming</span> and is rimmed on the west by the Park Range, on the south by the Rabbit Ears Range and the Never <span class="date">Summer</span> Mountains, and on the east by the <span class="loc">Medicine Bow Mountains</span>. Elevations range from 7,800 to 12,953 feet (3,948 m) above sea level and is home to the head waters of the <span class="loc">North Platte River</span>. The term park is derived from parc, the French word for game preserve. At one time <span class="loc">North Park</span> was filled with herds of deer, antelope and buffalo. There were so many buffalo in the area the Ute Tribe gave <span class="loc">North Park</span> the name "<span class="loc">Bull Pen</span>." <span class="date">Now</span> deer, elk, and cattle vie for the same area.</p><br><br>
