In mid-summer of 1847 a crew working for the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> government surveyed a six mile (10 km) square which approximates the current boundaries of Aurora. Then in December 1854 another crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description: This Township contains a few swamps some of considerable extent they are all unfit for cultivation. The River Enters the Town Near the NE Corner of section 24 and flows in a WSWesterly course with a Gentle current except a few Riffles where the current becomes Rapid.
