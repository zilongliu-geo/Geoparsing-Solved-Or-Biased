The population was 3,356 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Cuba</span> was platted in <span class="date">1857</span> when it was certain the railroad would be extended to that point.

Truman</span> visited <span class="loc">Cuba</span> during a tour of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66. He surveyed the property that would eventually become <span class="loc">Indian Hills Lake</span>. <span class="loc">Indian Hills Lake</span> was originally known as "<span class="loc">Indian Head Lake</span>" because the skull of a Native American was found during excavation. <span class="per">Bette Davis</span> and <span class="per">Amelia Earhart</span> also visited the town. Their visits are commemorated in the <span class="org">Viva Cuba Mural Project</span>. <span class="loc">Cuba</span> was designated as the Route 66 Mural City by the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> legislature in recognition of <span class="org">Viva Cuba's Outdoor Mural Project</span>.

The group commissioned twelve outdoor murals along the Route 66 corridor. Interstate 44 <span class="date">now</span> runs through <span class="loc">Cuba</span>. <span class="loc">Cuba</span> was also the site of the first Adopt a Highway program in the <span class="loc">Missouri</span>.

The guest cottages and old Wagon Wheel Cafe building underwent renovations beginning in <span class="date">2009</span>.</p><br><br>
