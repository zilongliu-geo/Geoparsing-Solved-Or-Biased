  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Grand jury indicts man for fleeing traffic stop. A 24-year-old Elkhart man who allegedly fled from an officer during the course of a traffic stop this past <span class="date">September</span> has been indicted by an <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> grand jury. <span class="per">William Lee Spafford</span> III, 24, of <span class="loc">Elkhart</span> was indicted <span class="date">March 4</span> on the felony charge of evading arrest/detention with a vehicle, according to records released by the <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> district clerk’s office. Shortly after 9 p.m. on <span class="date">Sept. 21</span>, <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> sheriff’s deputy <span class="per">Ronnie Howell</span> attempted to make a stop on a <span class="date">2001</span> Mercury Sabre for failure to yield the right of way, according to <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> <span class="per">Sheriff Greg Taylor</span>. The vehicle’s driver, later identified as <span class="per">Spafford</span>, turned on to CR <span class="date">2202</span> — also known as Salt Works Road — and stopped in the general vicinity of the <span class="org">Westwood Elementary School</span>, according to the sheriff. As the deputy was approaching the car, <span class="per">Spafford</span> accelerated from the scene, with <span class="per">Howell</span> giving pursuit, according to <span class="per">Taylor</span>. <span class="per">Spafford</span> drove at “unsafe speeds” at times during the ensuing pursuit of approximately eight miles until slamming on his brakes on FM 645 in the <span class="loc">Tennessee Colony</span> area, causing the deputy’s vehicle to strike the back of his <span class="org">Sabre</span>, the sheriff stated. The suspect then exited his vehicle and fled on foot, but was subsequently apprehended by <span class="per">Howell</span> following a short foot pursuit, according to <span class="per">Taylor</span>. The sheriff said <span class="per">Spafford</span> appeared “delusional” following his arrest, saying the Mexican MafiaÂ was “after him.” Â Other indictments recently handed down by the grand jury included: <span class="per">Joyce Glover</span>, 22, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, date of alleged offense, <span class="date">Nov. 23, 2008</span>. <span class="per">Michael Smith</span>, 49, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, date of alleged offense, <span class="date">Dec. 18, 2008</span>. <span class="per">Bruce James Hogue</span>, 44, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, date of alleged offense, <span class="date">Sept. 19, 2008</span>. Bobbie <span class="per">Lynn Kennemore</span>, 37, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, date of alleged offense, <span class="date">Nov. 16, 2008</span>. <span class="per">Ashley Lynn Turner</span>, 23, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, date of alleged offense, <span class="date">Nov. 26, 2008</span>. <span class="per">Jeffery Bernard McDaniel</span>, 41, <span class="loc">Grapeland</span>, date of alleged offense, <span class="date">Nov. 1, 2008</span>. <span class="per">Christopher McKay</span> Ridings, 20, <span class="loc">Tennessee Colony</span>, date of alleged offense, <span class="date">Dec. 19, 2008</span>.</p><br><br>
