  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Asan</span> (Chamorro: <span class="loc">Assan</span>) is a village located on the western shore of the <span class="loc">United States</span> territory of <span class="loc">Guam</span>. The municipality of Asan-Maina combines <span class="per">Asan</span> with <span class="per">Maina</span>, a community in the hills to the east. It was a primary landing site for <span class="loc">United States</span> Marines during Guam's liberation from the Japanese during World War II. <span class="per">Asan</span> <span class="loc">Beach Park</span> is part of the War in the Pacific National Historic Park. <span class="per">Asan</span> and <span class="per">Maina</span> are located in the <span class="loc">Luchan</span> (Western) District. <span class="per">Asan</span> derives its name from the Chamorro word hassan meaning scarce or rare. A meaning of the word maâ€™ina refers to an infant who, between the time of birth and baptism, is taken by the mother to Mass before sunrise; this ritual considered the presentation of the child to the temple or church. On <span class="date">July 21, 1944</span> the Americans landed in <span class="per">Asan</span> to recapture the island from occupying Japanese forces during the Battle of <span class="loc">Guam</span>. The 3rd Marine Division landed in <span class="per">Asan</span> at 08:28, and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed near <span class="loc">Agat</span> to the south. Japanese artillery sank 20 Landing Vehicle Trackeds, but by 09:00 tanks were ashore at both beaches. <span class="loc">United States</span> Marines fought Japanese forces fortified in the hills above the shore after establishing a beach head. During <span class="date">the following week</span>, Americans pursued retreating Japanese forces northward and eventually won the battle.</p><br><br>
