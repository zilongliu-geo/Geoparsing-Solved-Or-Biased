  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Livingston</span> is a township in <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the township's population was 29,366, reflecting an increase of 1,975 (+7.2%) from the 27,391 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 782 (+2.9%) from the 26,609 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. <span class="per">Livingston</span> was incorporated as a township by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on <span class="date">February 5, 1813</span>, from portions of Caldwell Township (<span class="date">now</span> Fairfield Township) and Springfield Township (<span class="date">now</span> in <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>). Portions of the township were taken to form <span class="loc">Fairmount</span> (<span class="date">March 11, 1862</span>, <span class="date">now</span> part of <span class="loc">West Orange</span>) and <span class="loc">Roseland</span> (<span class="date">March 10, 1908</span>). The township was named for <span class="per">William Livingston</span>, the first Governor of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>; his family's coat of arms serves as the township's seal. <span class="per">Livingston</span>'s history dates back to <span class="date">1699</span> when 101 <span class="loc">Newark</span> settlers wanted to move westward. They set up a committee to negotiate from <span class="loc">Lenni</span> Lenape Native Americans for the purchase of the Horseneck Tract which <span class="date">today</span> includes <span class="per">Livingston</span> and eight other municipalities to the north. Between <span class="date">1698</span> and <span class="date">1702</span>, the rules for property ownership were unclear. There were many disputes between settlers and the English proprietors. For some unknown reasons, the <span class="loc">Newark</span> settlers did not obtain a grant from the proprietors before negotiating with the natives. They finally obtained the deed directly from <span class="loc">Lenni</span> <span class="loc">Lenape</span> in <span class="date">1702</span> for Â£130. The settlements began until around the 1740s as the dispute between the proprietors and the settlers continued.</p><br><br>
