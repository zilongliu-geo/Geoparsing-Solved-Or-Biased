<p>Paradise is a northeastern suburb of Adelaide in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is bounded on the north side by the River Torrens. Amongst its neighboring suburbs are <span class="loc">Highbury</span>, <span class="loc">Dernancourt</span>, <span class="loc">Athelstone</span>, <span class="loc">Newton</span> and <span class="loc">Campbelltown</span>. Paradise is in the <span class="loc">City of Campbelltown</span> local government area. It was split across the South Australian <span class="loc">House of Assembly</span> electoral <span class="loc">districts of Morialta</span> (south-east part) and <span class="loc">Hartley</span> (north and west parts of Paradise) but has since all been incorporated into Morialta, and is in the Australian House of Representatives Division of <span class="loc">Sturt</span>. The suburb, originally "Shepley", was named "Paradise" by Joseph Ind, who had an orange orchard on the banks of the nearby <span class="loc">Torrens River</span>, and was named for his "Paradise Bridge Hotel" after a property called Paradise near his native <span class="loc">Tetbury</span>. The Ind Orchards were so productive and of such quality that the area was claimed to "truly be a paradise" for fruit. The Ind family settled the area, and built three significant properties of which only one remains in its original form. The first being Balmoral House which was built from the "cellar up" with the original immigrant Joseph Ind moving his family over once the cellar was complete and the ground floor was being built. Balmoral Road was the original entrance to the property. The property is now a retirement village after Christopher Ind and his mother sold and moved to <span class="loc">Sydney</span> with the balance of the family. At the time of the sale the property was in completely unrestored and excellent condition, containing original furnishings from its early days. It featured original horse stables, a croquet lawn and rare trees which had been brought from around the world. The family names are still found in the street names in the area, namely Ind and Christopher.</p>
