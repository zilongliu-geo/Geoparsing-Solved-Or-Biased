<p><span class="loc">Cleveland</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Bolivar County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. The population was 12,334 as of the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> has a fairly large commercial economy, with numerous restaurants, stores, and services along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 61. <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> is one of the two county seats (the other being <span class="loc">Rosedale</span>) of <span class="loc">Bolivar County</span>, which was named for the South American liberator <span class="loc">Simon Bolivar</span>. Named after President <span class="loc">Grover Cleveland</span>, the town began formation in 1869 as people moved inland from the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. The <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> &amp; Texas Railroad ran through the town and a portion of the railroad remains there today. Early records show the community was called <span class="loc">Fontaine</span> in 1884 and at some point Coleman's Station. Moses W. Coleman built the first home on the bayou in the area. In 1885, it was officially named Sims after Rueben T. Sims, who owned part of the land on which the town stood. The village of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> was chartered on March 25, 1886, and the United States Post Office recognized the town as such on August 5, 1887. It was Sims's son, B.C. Sims, who was responsible for the name change to <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>.</p>
