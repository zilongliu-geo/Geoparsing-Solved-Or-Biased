  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newcastle</span> (Welsh: Castell-newydd) is a small village in <span class="loc">Monmouthshire</span>, south east <span class="loc">Wales</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. It is located in quiet rolling countryside 6 miles (9.7 km) north west of <span class="loc">Monmouth</span> and 9 miles (14 km) east of <span class="loc">Abergavenny</span>, on the B4347 road, within the community of <span class="loc">Llangattock-Vibon-Avel</span>. <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> has a Norman motte and bailey castle site, from which it derives its name. Its history is obscure, but it is believed to have been founded by <span class="per">Hugh de Lacy</span>, lord of Ewyas in the 12th century, and in the reign of <span class="per">Edward III</span> it belonged to the <span class="loc">Huntley</span> family. The remains of the castle are on private land. The bailey is defended by a banked ditch, but the oval motte and surrounding wet ditch have been damaged by farm buildings. It commands extensive views to the west, towards the valley of the <span class="loc">River Trothy</span>. <span class="loc">Pool Farm</span>, nearby, is described as "one of the most completely surviving cruck-trussed hall houses in the county", and is a Grade II listed building. About 1 mile (1.6 km) north of the village is the Victorian Palladian mansion of <span class="loc">Hilston Park</span>, <span class="date">now</span> used as an outdoor education centre.</p><br><br>
