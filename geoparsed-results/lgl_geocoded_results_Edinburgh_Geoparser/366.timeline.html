  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Agency puts emphasis on <span class="loc">Ohio</span> 63 extension. By emphasizing plans to extend <span class="loc">Ohio</span> 63 west as a potential multi-modal project, county officials hope federal funding will become more likely. The <span class="loc">Butler County</span> Transportation Improvement District has passed a resolution to designate <span class="loc">Ohio</span> 63 as a multi-modal project. The project has the potential of opening up new transportation routes through <span class="loc">Monroe</span>, <span class="loc">Trenton</span> and <span class="loc">Seven Mile</span>. It also has the possibility of connecting the county to major routes such as Interstates 75 and 70 and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 127, as well as rail, said <span class="per">Ron Porter</span>, TID director. With so much emphasis at the federal level for incorporating multiple systems of transportation into projects, the prioritization could help obtain federal funding, said Bill Triick, TID board member and president of <span class="org">the Chamber of Commerce Serving</span> <span class="per">Middletown, Trenton</span> and <span class="per">Monroe</span>. The business community has been overwhelming in support of the project due to the lower transportation costs it would afford them by offering a more direct route, <span class="per">Triick</span> said. "That highway was never supposed to stop at Route 4. There is no major commercialization in the northern part of the county and that is due to lack of infrastructure," he said. The extension has been a priority for the county for <span class="date">many years</span>, but has had issues obtaining funding. The TID submitted the project, estimated to cost $138.2 million, to the <span class="org">Ohio Department of Development</span> for potential federal stimulus funding. The funding is still a major concern for the <span class="loc">city of Monroe</span>, which has yet to pass a resolution supporting the extension as requested by the TID. The roadway would reach five miles into the city, according to county engineer <span class="per">Greg Wilkens</span>. "The biggest concern is who is going to maintain that bridge across the river," said <span class="loc">Monroe</span> Mayor <span class="per">Robert Routson</span>. "It could potentially be St. Clair Twp., <span class="org">Madison</span> Twp., <span class="per">Trenton</span> or <span class="per">Monroe</span>. Someone has got to assume responsibility to maintain that bridge." While <span class="per">Routson</span> said he would support the project, he indicated the project would be more beneficial to the county and <span class="per">Trenton</span> than <span class="loc">Monroe</span>.</p><br><br>
