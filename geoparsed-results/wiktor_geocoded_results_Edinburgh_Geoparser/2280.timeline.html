  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Grant County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 51,208. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>. <span class="loc">Grant County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Platteville</span>, <span class="loc">WI</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. It is in the tri-state area of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, and <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, and is crossed by travelers commuting to <span class="org">Madison</span> from a number of <span class="loc">eastern Iowan cities</span>, and by residents of northern <span class="loc">Illinois</span> traveling to the <span class="loc">Twin Cities</span> or <span class="loc">La Crosse</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. What is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Grant County</span> was largely uninhabited prior to contact with Europeans, as it was a border region between the territories of the <span class="loc">Kickapoo</span>, <span class="loc">Menominee</span>, and <span class="loc">Illinois</span> tribes. The only Native American group to have a permanent settlement in the area was the Meskwaki, sometimes known as the Fox, who had a temporary village in what is <span class="date">now</span> the extreme northeast of the county during the mid-1700s. Between <span class="date">1520</span> and <span class="date">1620</span> this area was nominally ruled by <span class="loc">Spain</span>, though no Spaniard or anyone who claimed loyalty to <span class="loc">Spain</span> had ever come within five hundred miles of the region during this time, and as such, Spanish authority went completely unfelt in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Grant County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>.</p><br><br>
