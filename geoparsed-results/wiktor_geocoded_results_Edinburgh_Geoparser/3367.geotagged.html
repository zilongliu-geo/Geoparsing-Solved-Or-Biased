<p><span class="loc">Tunis</span> (Arabic: تونس‎  Tūnis) is both the capital and the largest <span class="loc">city of Tunisia</span>. The greater metropolitan area of <span class="loc">Tunis</span>, often referred to as Grand Tunis, holds some 2,700,000 inhabitants. Situated on a large <span class="loc">Mediterranean Sea</span> gulf (the <span class="loc">Gulf of Tunis</span>), behind the Lake of <span class="loc">Tunis</span> and the port of <span class="loc">La Goulette</span> (Ḥalq il-Wād), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its antic medina, a world heritage site. Beyond this district lie the suburbs of <span class="loc">Carthage</span>, <span class="loc">La Marsa</span>, and <span class="loc">Sidi Bou Said</span>. Just through the Sea Gate (also known as the <span class="loc">Bab el Bahr</span> and the <span class="loc">Porte</span> de <span class="loc">France</span>) begins the modern city, or <span class="loc">Ville Nouvelle</span>, transversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by popular press and travel guides as "the Tunisian Champs-Élysées"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. As the capital city of the country, <span class="loc">Tunis</span> is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life; it is also the centre of the country's commercial activity. The expansion of the Tunisian economy in recent decades is reflected in the booming development of the outer city where one can see clearly the social challenges brought about by rapid modernization in <span class="loc">Tunisia</span>.</p>
