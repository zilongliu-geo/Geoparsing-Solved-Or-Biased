<p><span class="loc">Wilton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,116 at the 2010 census. Situated beside <span class="loc">Wilson</span> Pond, the former mill town is today primarily a recreation area. The land replaced an invalidated 1727 grant by <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> to veterans for service in the French and Indian Wars. The first grant (now part of <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>) was originally dubbed Harrytown after a particularly dangerous Native American, then renamed <span class="loc">Tyngstown</span> for Captain William Tyng, leader of the expedition of "snowshoe men" that killed him in 1703. Abraham Butterfield, a settler from <span class="loc">Wilton</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, paid the cost of incorporation in 1803 to have the new town named after his former residence. <span class="loc">Wilton</span> is known for being the location of <span class="loc">Maine</span>'s first cotton mill, started in 1810 by Solomon Adams. In 1876, George Henry Bass (1855â€“1925) founded G.H. Bass &amp; Co. and became the best-known businessman in <span class="loc">Wilton</span>'s history. Bass shoes (including those worn by Charles Lindbergh during his Atlantic crossing and Admiral Byrd in his expeditions to <span class="loc">Antarctica</span>) were made exclusively in <span class="loc">Wilton</span> for more than a century until 1998. By then the Bass family had sold out, and in 1998 Bass' parent company, Phillips-Van Heusen, moved operations overseas.</p>
