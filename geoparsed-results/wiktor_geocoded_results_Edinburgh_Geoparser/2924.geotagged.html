<p><span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Traill County</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Traill County</span>. The population was 1,603 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> was founded in 1881. <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> sits in the fertile Red River Valley. Local agriculture has dominated the area's economy from the beginning. With its location on Interstate 29, halfway between the two metropolitan centers of Greater <span class="loc">Grand Forks</span> and Fargo-Moorhead, <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> has seen steady population growth in recent years and has become somewhat of a bedroom community. The area along the <span class="loc">Goose River</span> that is now <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> was first settled by German and Norwegian settlers around 1870. In 1880, the present day site of <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> was founded under the name "Comstock". Local folklore tells of the residents of nearby <span class="loc">Caledonia</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span> turning away a shabby surveyor because of his appearance. This man was then offered hospitality by residents in the tiny settlement of <span class="loc">Comstock</span>. The man turned out to be railroad baron James J. Hill. Hill was so impressed by the kindness showed to him by the residents of this small community that he decided to place his Great Northern Railway there instead of in <span class="loc">Caledonia</span>. The name of <span class="loc">Comstock</span> was changed to "<span class="loc">Hill City</span>" in September 1880 in honor of Mr. Hill. The city was then renamed "Hillsboro" in 1881 after it was discovered that there was already a "<span class="loc">Hill City</span>" in <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>.</p>
