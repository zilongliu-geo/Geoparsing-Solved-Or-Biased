<p><span class="loc">York</span> is the oldest inland town in Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, situated 97 kilometres (60 mi) east of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, and is the seat of the Shire of <span class="loc">York</span>. The <span class="loc">York district</span> and town taking its name from <span class="loc">York County</span>, Western <span class="loc">Australia</span> (in turn named after Prince Frederick, <span class="loc">Duke of York</span> and <span class="loc">Albany</span>), was first settled in 1831, two years after <span class="loc">Perth</span> was settled in 1829. A town was established in 1835 with the release of town allotments and the first buildings were erected in 1836. With the increasing population of the Swan River Settlement in 1830, it became evident that suitable land would have to be discovered for the growing of crops needed to provide necessary food. Ensign Robert Dale, a 20-year-old officer of the 63rd Regiment, led a small party in the first exploratory journey over the Darling Range during the winter months of 1830, into what was later to become known as the <span class="loc">Avon</span> Valley. As a result, Lieutenant-Governor Stirling decided that the new district should be thrown open for selection and this was done by Government Notice on 11 November 1830. By December 1830, 250,000 acres had been allotted, and in January 1831, 80,000 acres. Before the end of 1831 a further 6,030 acres in small lots had been taken up.</p>
