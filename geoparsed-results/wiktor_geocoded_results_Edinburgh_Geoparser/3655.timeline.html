  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Madar</span> is a village about 50 km (30 mi) north of the Yemeni capital of Sanaa. In <span class="date">2003</span> a local journalist noted the existence of dinosaur footprints in limestone bedrock and brought them to the attention of geologists at the <span class="org">University</span> of Sanaa. The main site of the finds, located at 15°46′49″N 44°14′25″E, is approximately 3 km (2 mi) west off the main road, and has been signposted and fenced by the <span class="loc">Yemen</span> Geological Survey. Additional tracks have been recognized nearby, within the villages of <span class="per">Arhab</span> and <span class="per">Bait</span> al Washr. At the main site it was determined that there were tracks of eleven sauropods and one ornithopod dating from <span class="date">150 million years ago</span>. Footprints of both juveniles and adults were found. The discovery is the first of dinosaur footprints in the <span class="loc">Arabian Peninsula</span>, and only a very few fossils have been previously identified in the peninsula. The discovery has since been signposted for tourists, and efforts are underway to list the site with UNESCO.
