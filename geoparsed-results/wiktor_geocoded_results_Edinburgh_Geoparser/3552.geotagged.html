<p>Lazo (Лазо́ ) is a village in the Russian Maritime Province of Primorsky Krai in the Russian <span class="loc">Far</span> East. The village was founded and named Monomakh Slobidka (Мономахова Слободка) in 1907 by settlers from <span class="loc">Bryansk</span> and <span class="loc">Chernihiv</span>. In 1933 it was renamed Vangou (Вангоу). On 26 August 1949, by a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the village was renamed again, now becoming Lazo (Лазо) in honour of the revolutionary hero Sergey Lazo (1894 - 1920). At the same time the <span class="loc">Sokolov District</span> in <span class="loc">Primorski Krai</span> was renamed as the "<span class="loc">Lazovsky District</span>". On 2 July 2007 the administrative head office for the "Call of the Tiger" National Park was established in Lazo, at <span class="loc">Lenin</span> Street 23. Lazo hit the headlines internationally at the end of 2005 when it was reported that a stray dog was killed by squirrels in a Lazo park. The dog had barked at the squirrels who were alleged to be in a state of heightened frustration due to the absence, that year, of pine cones in the trees.</p>
