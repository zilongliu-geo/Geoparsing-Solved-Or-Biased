<p>Weston is a small suburb on the south-eastern side of <span class="loc">Southampton</span>, <span class="loc">UK</span>, predominantly built on the Weston Grove Estate formerly owned by the Chamberlayne family. It also includes the area that was previously the Barnfield Estate. Weston includes part of <span class="loc">Mayfield</span> Park, which was previously the <span class="loc">Mayfield</span> Estate. Weston is bounded by <span class="loc">Woolston</span>, <span class="loc">Sholing</span>, <span class="loc">Netley</span> and <span class="loc">Southampton Water</span>. Weston was originally a small fishing community. The earliest references date to the end of the 10th century. John de Weston is recorded as a Burgess of <span class="loc">Southampton</span> in 1332. In the 17th and 18th centuries, there are occasional records of disputes over fishing rights The Seaweed Hut that used to stand on Weston Shore appears on 17th century maps. It was used to store the fishermen's equipment. In 1424, Ralph Chamberlayne's wife Alice inherited an estate on the east bank of the <span class="loc">River Itchen</span>. What that estate contained, how it subsequently changed hands and was split-up is not clear, but at least part of it remained connected with the Chamberlayne family as in 1781, William Chamberlayne inherited what was then the Weston Park Estate from Thomas Dummer.</p>
