  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in rural <span class="loc">Hernando County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The estimated population was 98,621 in <span class="date">2010</span> by the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> belongs to <span class="org">Florida's Nature Coast</span> and is in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area. <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> is a working class area located north of <span class="loc">Tampa</span>, FL. <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> first appeared on <span class="loc">Hernando County</span> Maps in the mid-1800s along what is <span class="date">today</span> Fort Dade Avenue just north of the community of <span class="loc">Wiscon</span>. The modern <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> was founded in <span class="date">1967</span> as a planned community, which was developed by the <span class="org">Deltona Corporation</span> and the <span class="org">Mackle Brothers</span> who built the community. The plans for the community are actually identical to the community of <span class="loc">Deltona</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>. The <span class="org">Mackle Brothers</span> sold many of the properties and land in the area through intense advertising. It appeared on maps of <span class="loc">Florida</span> as early as <span class="date">1856</span>. It has since become a sprawling semi-city in its own right, though it is an unincorporated area. The main entrance to the original development is marked by the <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> waterfall on <span class="loc">Spring Hill</span> Drive and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 19 (Commercial Way). Its location has Hernando Beach to the west, <span class="loc">Brooksville</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span> to the east, and <span class="loc">Tampa</span> to the south via the Suncoast Parkway, <span class="loc">US</span> 41, and I-75.</p><br><br>
