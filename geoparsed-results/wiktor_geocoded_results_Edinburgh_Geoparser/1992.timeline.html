  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lodi</span> (/ˈloʊ.daɪ/ LOW-dy) is a borough in <span class="loc">Bergen County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 24,136, reflecting an increase of 165 (+0.7%) from the 23,971 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 1,616 (+7.2%) from the 22,355 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. <span class="loc">Lodi</span> owes its name to the Italian <span class="loc">city of Lodi</span>, <span class="loc">Lombardy</span>. It was incorporated as a borough on <span class="date">December 22, 1894</span>, from portions of the now-defunct municipalities of <span class="loc">Lodi</span> <span class="per">Township</span> and <span class="per">Saddle</span> <span class="per">River Township</span>, at the height of <span class="loc">Bergen County</span>'s "Boroughitis" phenomenon then sweeping through <span class="loc">Bergen County</span>, based on the results of a referendum held on <span class="date">the previous day</span>. <span class="loc">Lodi</span> operates under the <span class="date">1923</span> Municipal Manager Law form of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> municipal government. The voters elect five members to a council who are elected at-large in non-partisan elections held as part of the <span class="date">May</span> municipal election to serve four-year terms of office on a concurrent basis. A mayor and deputy mayor are selected by the council from among its members. The council is an exclusively legislative body with responsibility for day-to-day operation of the borough assigned to a manager who acts as the municipal chief executive and executes laws and policies, prepares the budget for council consideration and attends and participates at meetings with a voice, but no vote. The manager recommends improvements and implements those approved, as well as oversees contracts and franchises and reports violations. It is the responsibility of the manager to appoint and remove department heads and make all additional appointments not made by the council.</p><br><br>
