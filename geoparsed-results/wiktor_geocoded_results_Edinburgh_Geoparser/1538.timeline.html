  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Elizabeth</span> is both the largest city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city had a total population of 124,969, retaining its ranking as <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>'s fourth largest city (by population). The population increased by 4,401 (3.7%) from the 120,568 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 10,566 (+9.6%) from the 110,002 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. In <span class="date">2008</span>, <span class="per">Elizabeth</span> was named one of "<span class="loc">America</span>'s 50 <span class="loc">Greenest Cities</span>" by Popular Science magazine, the only city in <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> selected. <span class="per">Elizabeth</span>, originally called "Elizabethtown" and part of the Elizabethtown Tract, was founded in <span class="date">1664</span> by English settlers. The town was not named for <span class="per">Queen Elizabeth I</span> as many people may assume, but rather for <span class="per">Elizabeth</span>, wife of <span class="per">Sir George Carteret</span>, one of the two original Proprietors of the colony of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. She was the daughter of <span class="per">Philippe de Carteret II</span>, 3rd <span class="per">Seigneur de Sark</span> and <span class="per">Anne Dowse</span>. The town served as the first capital of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. During the American Revolutionary War, <span class="loc">Elizabethtown</span> was continually attacked by British forces based on Manhattan and <span class="loc">Staten Island</span>, culminating in the Battle of <span class="loc">Springfield</span> which decisively defeated British attempts to gain <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. After independence, <span class="loc">George Washington</span> embarked from <span class="loc">Elizabethtown</span> by boat to Manhattan for his <span class="date">1789</span> inauguration. There are numerous memorials and monuments of the American Revolution in <span class="per">Elizabeth</span>.</p><br><br>
