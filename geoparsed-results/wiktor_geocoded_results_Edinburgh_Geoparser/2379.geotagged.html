<p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the 2010 census, the population was 8,135. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Butler County</span> and is known as the <span class="loc">Camellia City</span>. The movement to change the official <span class="loc">Alabama</span> state flower from the goldenrod to the camellia originated in <span class="loc">Greenville</span> with legislative sponsors LaMont Glass and H.B. Taylor. Greenville was first settled in 1819. Its original name was <span class="loc">Buttsville</span>, but after becoming the county seat in 1822, its name was changed to <span class="loc">Greenville</span>, in remembrance of the former locale in <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> of many of the original settlers. The first county seat was at <span class="loc">Fort Dale</span>, a fortification that was named for Sam Dale, who fought to defend the area during the Creek War. The site of <span class="loc">Fort Dale</span> lies on the north of the city near the Fort Dale Cemetery, along what is now <span class="loc">Alabama</span> Highway 185. The namesake of the county, Captain William Butler, was killed during the Creek War. He is buried in the Pioneer Cemetery, which is across from the oldest church in <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, the First United Methodist Church of <span class="loc">Greenville</span>.</p>
