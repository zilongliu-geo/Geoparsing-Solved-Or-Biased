<p><span class="loc">Vallecito</span> ("Little Valley" in Spanish; formerly, <span class="loc">Murphy's Old Diggings</span>, <span class="loc">Valacito</span>, <span class="loc">Vallicita</span>, <span class="loc">Vallicito</span>) is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Calaveras County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 442 at the 2010 census, up from 427 at the 2000 census. The town is registered as <span class="loc">California</span> Historical Landmark #273. Nearby is Moaning Cavern, the largest cave chamber in <span class="loc">California</span>, which the Miwok Indians used as a burial ground. <span class="loc">Vallecito</span> was one of <span class="loc">California</span>'s important early-day mining towns. Gold was discovered here by the Murphy brothers in 1849, and it was originally called "Murphys Diggings," which became "Murphys Old Diggings" when they moved on to greener pastures at "Murphys <span class="loc">New Diggings</span>" (which became the town of Murphys). The town was revitalized in 1852 when extremely rich deposits of gold were discovered running practically through the center of town. A post office was established in 1854, which is still in use today. The Vallecito Bell, cast at Troy, <span class="loc">New York</span> in 1853, was brought around <span class="loc">Cape Horn</span>. It was purchased from the ship with funds contributed by early-day residents and brought to <span class="loc">Vallecito</span> to be erected in a large oak tree in 1854. It was used to call the people together until February 16, 1939, when a severe wind blew the old tree down.</p>
