<p>Livermore, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> is an abandoned town that was located on the <span class="loc">Conemaugh River</span> between <span class="loc">Blairsville</span> and <span class="loc">Saltsburg</span> in <span class="loc">Derry Township</span>, <span class="loc">Westmoreland County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. The town was abandoned and partially razed in the early 1950s following authorization by the Flood Control Act of 1936 and Flood Control Act of 1938 for construction of the <span class="loc">Conemaugh River</span> Dam and Lake to prevent flooding of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. Much of the former town site now lies under the reservoir and floodplains. The town was established along the <span class="loc">Conemaugh River</span> within <span class="loc">Derry Township</span> in 1827 by John Livermore, naming the town after himself. The <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> legislature had established the Board of Canal Commissioners for the Commonwealth in 1825, and authorized a public canal and railroad project across the state, the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Canal system. The Main Line Canal's Western Division, which stretched 103 miles from <span class="loc">Johnstown</span> to <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, was constructed past <span class="loc">Livermore</span> along the <span class="loc">Conemaugh</span>. The <span class="loc">West Penn Railroad</span> extended past <span class="loc">Livermore</span> alongside the canal in 1854, and a station was built in 1864, providing connections to <span class="loc">Blairsville</span> and <span class="loc">Saltsburg</span>. Grading from <span class="loc">Blairsville</span> to the <span class="loc">Allegheny River</span> was completed in 1857, and the same year, the state sold the canal to the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Railroad. Another grade was built in 1882 to bypass a hill. These tracks were used for 25 years until 1907, when a new straight line bypassed the canal curves. A new station was also built.</p>
