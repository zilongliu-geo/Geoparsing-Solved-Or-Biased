  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Richmond</span> is a far western suburb of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Hawkesbury</span>. It is located at a latitude of 33° 35' 54" South and a longitude of 150°45' 04" east, 19 metres above sea level on the alluvial <span class="loc">Hawkesbury River</span> flats, at the foot of the <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span>. It is about 65 km by road from <span class="loc">Sydney</span>. The Darug people were the native people to the area in <span class="date">1788</span>. The area was originally explored by British settlers in <span class="date">1789</span> and was known by them as '<span class="loc">Richmond Hill</span>'. This name was given by <span class="per">Governor Phillip</span>, in honour of <span class="per">Charles Lennox</span>, the third <span class="per">Duke of Richmond</span> who was Master General of Ordnance in the <span class="loc">Pitt</span> administration. The local area was the third area to have European settlement in <span class="loc">Australia</span> after <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and <span class="loc">Parramatta</span>. The first 22 European settlers came to the area in <span class="date">1794</span>. They came to farm a total of 30 acres (12 ha) in what is <span class="date">now</span> Pitt Town Bottoms. They needed good farming land to help overcome the desperate need for food in the new colony. By <span class="date">1799</span> this region was producing about half the grain produced in the colony.</p><br><br>
