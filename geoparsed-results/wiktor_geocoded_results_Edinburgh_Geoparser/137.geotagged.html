<p><span class="loc">Candelaria</span> was a town in <span class="loc">Mineral County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, approximately 121 miles southeast of <span class="loc">Fallon</span>. Today the site of <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> is dominated by the Kinross Gold Candelaria Mine on Mt. <span class="loc">Diablo</span>, and security guards strictly enforce a "no trespassing" policy in the town site. The area where <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> developed first attracted notice in 1864 when Mexican prospectors working the area near Mt. <span class="loc">Diablo</span> discovered silver deposits on the northern slopes of the mountain. However, word of the find was slow to spread, and Candelaria wasn’t truly a town, or even a camp, until a group of European prospectors, mainly German and Slovakian, came into the area in 1879 and established a camp, which soon became a boomtown. The earlier Mexican presence in the area had named the location <span class="loc">Candelaria</span>, and this name stuck. As the population grew, the beginnings of what became one of Candelaria’s greatest difficulties became all too apparent: there was insufficient water locally to support any significant permanent population. <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> was what was known as a “dry camp”. A larger spring in the next valley over (nine miles away) supplied water to <span class="loc">Candelaria</span>, but the costs for transporting this water to the camp drove the price to the princely sum (at the time) of $1.00 per gallon. The nearby spring was only sufficient to supply the water needs of the town's populace; little to none could be spared for the use of milling and processing the ore from the mines. The stamp mill in <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> had to operate as a dry mill, which spread toxic dust throughout the area. Unlike other camps where a wet milling process was used, Candelaria miners suffered from an extremely high incidence of “miners consumption” (respiratory disease). Inhabitants of the area breathed in the fine particulate dust created by the dry stamping process, which brought about respiratory tract infections and diseases which often ended in death.</p>
