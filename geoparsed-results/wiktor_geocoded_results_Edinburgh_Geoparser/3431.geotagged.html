<p>Meta is a city in <span class="loc">Osage County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 229 at the 2010 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Jefferson City</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area and is also the world headquarters of Diamond Pet Foods. Meta is located at 38°18′45″N 92°10′5″W (38.312471, -92.167999). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.35 square miles (0.91 km2), all of it land. The Following information is about the <span class="loc">city of Babbtown</span> and what effect the Rock Island Railroad had on the town of Meta. This area of <span class="loc">Osage County</span> was settled by German Lutherans in the 1860s, and a small catholic church, St. John's Lutheran Church, at <span class="loc">Babbtown</span> was built in 1871. The congregation still meets in the original building, which was constructed in 1873. When termites were discovered in the hewn log sills in the 1990s, congregation members rebuilt the foundation by jacking up the walls section-by-section and cutting out and replacing the termite-riddled timbers and wall structure. By the late 19th century, the neighboring <span class="loc">city of Babbtown</span> had developed into a prominent town in the area, with a general store and post office across from the church, a blacksmith shop, and a Lutheran school, which was built in the late 1890s and held classes from 1900-1930. The old schoolhouse was expanded in the 1970s and again in the 1990s, and is now used as a parish building. Around 1900, however, the Rock Island Railroad was built through what is today the town of Meta, and as that town grew, <span class="loc">Babbtown</span> dwindled away. The town of Meta was named after Meta Rowan, the wife of Nathan J. Rowan.</p>
