It is a suburb of the nearby <span class="loc">city of Newark</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, Harrison's population was 13,620, reflecting a decline of 804 (-5.6%) from the 14,424 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 999 (+7.4%) from the 13,425 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. Once considered "the beehive of industry", the town is undergoing a residential renewal, particularly along the <span class="loc">Passaic River</span>.

In <span class="date">1755</span>, the first steam engine in <span class="loc">North America</span> was set up at the Schuyler Copper Mine in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">North Arlington</span> to help drain water from the mine.</p><br><br>
