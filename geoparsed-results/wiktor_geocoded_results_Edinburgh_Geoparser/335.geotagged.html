<p><span class="loc">Clifton</span> is a small linear village and civil parish 3 miles (4.8 km) south east of <span class="loc">Penrith</span> in <span class="loc">Cumbria</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The civil <span class="loc">parish of Clifton</span> has its western boundary defined by the <span class="loc">River Lowther</span>, to the north and east lie the civil <span class="loc">parishes of Brougham</span> and <span class="loc">Great Strickland</span>, to the south is the civil <span class="loc">parish of Lowther</span>. The village of <span class="loc">Clifton</span> has a church, primary school, and a pub. Most of the hamlet of <span class="loc">Clifton Dykes</span> (on the C3047 road) also lies within the parish. The name of this was shown as Longchimney on the first edition Ordnance Survey map of 1897, and then as Clifton Dikes on the later second edition. The current spelling was settled on more recently. <span class="loc">Clifton Dykes</span> has been suggested as the (pre-Roman conquest) centre of the Carvetti, an Iron Age and Roman-period 'tribe', one that possibly led a resistance against Roman forces in 69 A.D. under the leadership of Venutius. This is based upon the evidence of a large (c.7 acre) Iron Age enclosure discovered there, plus assumptions about its strategic importance on the <span class="loc">Eden</span> Valley communication routeway. However, this has been disputed: the Carvetii may have always been centred on <span class="loc">Carlisle</span> even before the Romans set up Luguvalium and Venutius may not have been Carvetiian.</p>
