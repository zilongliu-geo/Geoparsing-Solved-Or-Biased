<p><span class="loc">Hopewell</span> is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 22,591. The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines the <span class="loc">city of Hopewell</span> with Prince George County for statistical purposes. <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> is in the Tri-Cities area of the <span class="loc">Richmond Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area (MSA). The city was founded to take advantage of its site overlooking the James and Appomattox Rivers. <span class="loc">City Point</span>, the oldest part of <span class="loc">Hopewell</span>, was established in 1613 by Sir Thomas Dale. It was first known as "<span class="loc">Bermuda City</span>," which was changed to <span class="loc">Charles City</span>, lengthened to Charles <span class="loc">City Point</span>, and later abbreviated to <span class="loc">City Point</span>. (At this time, <span class="loc">Bermuda</span>, the Atlantic archipelago, was considered part of the Colony of Virginia and appeared on its maps.) Hopewell/<span class="loc">City Point</span> is the oldest continuously inhabited English settlement in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> no longer being inhabited. "Charles <span class="loc">City Point</span>" was in <span class="loc">Charles City</span> Shire when the first eight shires were established in the Colony of Virginia in 1634. <span class="loc">Charles City</span> Shire soon became known as Charles <span class="loc">City County</span> in 1637. In 1619 Samuel Sharpe and Samuel Jordan from <span class="loc">City Point</span>, then named <span class="loc">Charles City</span>, were burgesses at the first meeting of the House of Burgesses.</p>
