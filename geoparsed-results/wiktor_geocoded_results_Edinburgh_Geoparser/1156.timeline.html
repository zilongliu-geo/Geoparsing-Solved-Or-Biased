  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Ceres</span> is a village in Fife, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, located in a small glen approximately 2 miles over the <span class="loc">Ceres Moor</span> from <span class="loc">Cupar</span> and 7 miles from <span class="loc">St Andrews</span>. The former parish of that name included the settlements of <span class="loc">Baldinnie</span>, <span class="loc">Chance Inn</span>, <span class="loc">Craigrothie</span>, <span class="loc">Pitscottie</span> and <span class="loc">Tarvit Mill</span>. It is one of the most historic and picturesque villages in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> and one of the few Scottish villages to have a village green, known as the "Bow Butts" since its use as an archery practice ground in medieval times. The <span class="loc">Ceres Burn</span> runs through the village and alongside the green. An old packhorse bridge, known as the "Bishop's Bridge" has spanned the burn since the 17th century and still stands close to a more modern road bridge. The village's most memorable feature is possibly the 18th century statue of "The Provost". It is thought to depict the Rev. <span class="per">Thomas Buchanan</span> (related to the 17th century theologian <span class="per">George Buchanan</span>), who became the last church provost of <span class="loc">Ceres</span> in <span class="date">1578</span>. The figure portrays him as a toby jug and is probably satirical. The sculptor, a local stonemason named <span class="per">James Howie</span>, also carved a panel below the figure depicting the Battle of <span class="loc">Bannockburn</span>.</p><br><br>
