  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Luzon /luːˈzɒn/ is the largest and most populous island in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> and the 15th largest in the world. Located in the northern region of the archipelago, it is the economic and political center of the nation, being home to the country's capital city, Manila, as well as <span class="loc">Quezon City</span>, the country's most populous. With a population of 48 million as of <span class="date">2010</span>, it is the fourth most populous island in the world, containing about 53% of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>' total population. <span class="loc">Luzon</span> may also refer to one of the three primary island groups in the country. As such, it includes the Luzon mainland, the <span class="loc">Batanes</span> and <span class="loc">Babuyan</span> groups of islands to the north, <span class="loc">Polillo Islands</span> to the east, and the outlying islands of <span class="loc">Catanduanes</span>, <span class="loc">Marinduque</span>, <span class="loc">Masbate</span>, <span class="loc">Romblon</span>, <span class="loc">Mindoro</span>, and <span class="loc">Palawan</span>, among others, to the south. The name <span class="loc">Luzon</span> is thought to derive from the <span class="loc">Tagalog</span> word lusong, which is a large wooden mortar used in dehusking rice. <span class="loc">Luzon</span> was once split among Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms, Muslim principalities, and ethnoreligious tribes, who had trading connections with <span class="per">Borneo, Malaya</span>, <span class="loc">Java</span>, <span class="loc">Indochina</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>, <span class="loc">Okinawa</span>, <span class="loc">Korea</span>, <span class="loc">Japan</span> and <span class="loc">China</span> before the Spanish established their rule. From just before the first millennium, the <span class="loc">Tagalog</span> and Kapampangan peoples of south and central <span class="loc">Luzon</span> had established several Indianized kingdoms, notably among them those of <span class="loc">Tundok</span> and <span class="loc">Namayan</span>. The Laguna Copperplate Inscription, the first Philippine document written in 900AD, names places in and around <span class="loc">Manila Bay</span> as well as <span class="loc">Medan</span> in <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>. These kingdoms were based on leases between village rulers (Datu) and landlords (Lakan) or Rajahs, to whom tributes and taxes were levied. These kingdoms were coastal thalassocracies based on trade with neighboring Asian political entities at that time. Some parts of <span class="loc">Luzon</span> were Islamized when the <span class="loc">Sultanate of Brunei</span> expanded its realms from <span class="loc">Borneo</span> to the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> and set up the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Maynila</span> as its puppet-state. In addition, other kingdoms like the Huangdom of <span class="loc">Ma-i</span> and the Huangdom of <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span> had become tributary states to <span class="loc">China</span> and were largely Sinified kingdoms.</p><br><br>
