  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newstead</span> is a riverside suburb of the <span class="loc">city of Brisbane</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is situated 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) north of the <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> central business district. The north-west portion of the suburb, centred on Breakfast Creek Road, is predominantly commercial, with the remainder of the suburb <span class="date">now</span> mainly residential. At the last census, over 67% of the households in <span class="loc">Newstead</span> consisted of couples without children and a further 20% were single person households. Over 82% of dwellings in the area are units and 15% are stand-alone houses. <span class="loc">Newstead</span> is known for trendy cafes and restaurants, upmarket studio apartments and renovated older homes with well-established gardens. It is one of the more expensive suburbs in which to purchase a property in <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, with the mean unit price for the <span class="date">2006</span> calendar year reaching $1,400,000. The suburb's present role as an up-market residential suburb belies its industrial past. Timber yards, asbestos works, wharves and woolstores once dominated the eastern side of the suburb. The tall iron structure of the No. 2 gasholder on Skyring Terrace is a remnant of the Newstead Gasworks, which was established in <span class="date">1887</span> as <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>'s second gas works. The structure, however, was originally located at the <span class="loc">Petrie Bight</span> gasworks, where it was erected in <span class="date">1873</span>.</p><br><br>
