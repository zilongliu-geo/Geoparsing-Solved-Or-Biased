<p><span class="loc">Sakhalin</span> (Russian: Сахалин, pronounced [səxɐˈlʲin]) is a large Russian island in the <span class="loc">North Pacific Ocean</span>, lying between 45°50' and 54°24' N. It is <span class="loc">Russia</span>'s largest island, and is administered as part of Sakhalin Oblast. <span class="loc">Sakhalin</span>, which is about one fifth the size of <span class="loc">Japan</span>, is just off the east coast of <span class="loc">Russia</span>, and just north of <span class="loc">Japan</span>. The indigenous peoples of the island are the <span class="loc">Ainu</span>, Oroks and Nivkhs. <span class="loc">Sakhalin</span> has been claimed by both <span class="loc">Russia</span> and <span class="loc">Japan</span> over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. This has led to bitter disputes between the two countries over control of the island. <span class="loc">Russia</span> seized the island from the Japanese near the end of World War II. Most <span class="loc">Ainu</span> moved to <span class="loc">Hokkaido</span> when the Japanese were displaced from the island in 1949. The island is known in Russian as Сахалин (Sakhalin). In Chinese, it is known as <span class="loc">Kuye</span> (simplified Chinese: 库页; traditional Chinese: 庫頁; pinyin: Kùyè). In Japanese, it is known as <span class="loc">Karafuto</span> (樺太) or, borrowing the Russian appellation, as Saharin (サハリン). The spelling <span class="loc">Saghalien</span> may be found in historical texts.</p>
