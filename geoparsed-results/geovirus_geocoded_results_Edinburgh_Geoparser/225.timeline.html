  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Georgia</span> – <span class="per">Zurab Zhvania</span>, Prime Minister of <span class="org">Georgia</span>, was found dead of gas poisoning at a friend's home. The <span class="loc">China</span> Daily quotes Interior Minister <span class="per">Vano Merabishvili</span>: "This is a tragic accident... It was a gas poisoning." Zhavani was visiting in the home of <span class="per">Raul Usupov</span>, deputy governor from the <span class="loc">Kvemo-Kartli region</span>, when an apparent carbon monoxide leak from a gas space heater overcame and killed both him and his host. Carbon monoxide poisoning is not unknown in <span class="loc">Georgia</span>; 45 deaths by carbon monoxide poisoning are reported by the official <span class="org">Russian Information Agency</span>. Power supplies are not entirely reliable, and central heating systems are not universal, so small portable heaters are common even in the capital. <span class="per">President Mikhail Saakashvili</span> called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss responding to the death. "(<span class="per">Zhvania</span>'s death) is a huge blow for our country and personally for me as a president and as a person," quotes the <span class="loc">China</span> Daily, "I have lost my closest friend, my most loyal adviser, my biggest ally." Once a protegé of <span class="per">Eduard Shevardnadze</span>, and widely viewed as his chosen successor, <span class="per">Zhvania</span> chose to join the opposition in supporting <span class="per">Saakashvili</span>. He has been viewed as a moderating influence on <span class="per">Saakashvili</span>, who appointed <span class="per">Mr. Zhvania</span> after taking office <span class="date">one year ago</span>. Zhavania joined <span class="org">Georgia's Green Party</span> in <span class="date">the 1980s</span>. He was chair of <span class="org">Georgia</span>'s Parliament from <span class="date">1995</span>-<span class="date">2001</span>. "He played an important role in helping <span class="loc">Georgia</span> meet its aspirations for greater peace, prosperity and euro-Atlantic integration," <span class="org">NATO</span> chief <span class="per">Jaap de Hoop Scheffer</span> said in his expression of condolences.</p><br><br>
