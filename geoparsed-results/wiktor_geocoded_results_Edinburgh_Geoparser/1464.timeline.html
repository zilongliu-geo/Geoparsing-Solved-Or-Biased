  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a small town in country Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located 180 km north of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> with a mixture of rural and semi-rural communities on the northern <span class="loc">Campaspe River</span>, between <span class="loc">Bendigo</span> and the <span class="loc">Murray River</span> port of <span class="loc">Echuca</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Rochester</span> had a population of 3,106. The area around the <span class="loc">Campaspe River</span> was known as Yalooka, and for <span class="date">thousands of years</span> was home to the Pinpandoor, the local tribe of Aboriginees. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> (via Rowechester) was named after <span class="per">Dr John Pearson Rowe</span>, who had a hotel here before the township was gazetted in <span class="date">1855</span>. The Post Office opened on <span class="date">11 May 1863</span> and the town was reached by the railway line from <span class="loc">Bendigo</span> (connecting it to <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>) in <span class="date">1864</span>. The town is famous as the birthplace in <span class="date">1904</span> of Australian racing and endurance cyclist, Sir <span class="per">Hubert Opperman</span>, affectionately known as <span class="loc">Oppy</span>. There is a museum dedicated to <span class="loc">Oppy</span> in <span class="loc">Moore</span> street, and a statue of him winning the 24-hour Bol D'Or race in <span class="loc">Paris</span> in <span class="date">1928</span>. On his 90th birthday <span class="loc">Oppy</span> donated one of his trusty Malvern Star bicycles to the museum.</p><br><br>
