  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 203,206. The county seat is <span class="loc">Medford</span>. The county is named for <span class="per">Andrew Jackson</span>, the seventh president of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Medford</span>, <span class="loc">OR</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. There are 11 incorporated cities and 34 unincorporated communities in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>; the largest is <span class="loc">Medford</span>, which has been the county seat since <span class="date">1927</span>. <span class="loc">Modoc</span>, <span class="loc">Shasta</span>, <span class="loc">Takelma</span>, <span class="loc">Latgawa</span>, and <span class="loc">Umpqua</span> Indian tribes are all native to the region of present <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>. In the early 1850s, both the Klickitats from the north and the <span class="loc">Deschutes</span> from the south raided and settled the area. The Territorial Legislature created <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> on <span class="date">January 12, 1852</span>, from the southwestern portion of <span class="loc">Lane County</span> and the unorganized area south of <span class="per">Douglas</span> and <span class="per">Umpqua</span> Counties. It included lands which <span class="date">now</span> lie in Coos, <span class="per">Curry, Josephine</span>, <span class="loc">Klamath</span> and Lake Counties. Gold discoveries in the <span class="loc">Illinois River</span> valley and the <span class="loc">Rogue River</span> valley near <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span> in <span class="date">1852</span>, and the completion of a wagon road connecting the county with <span class="loc">California</span> to the south and <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> to the north led to an influx of non-native settlers.</p><br><br>
