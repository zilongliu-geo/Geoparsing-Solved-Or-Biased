<p><span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is located 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district, in the local government areas of the <span class="loc">City of Fairfield</span> and the <span class="loc">City of Holroyd</span>. The suburb is in the Greater <span class="loc">Western Sydney region</span>. Smithfield's altitude ranges from 21 to 48 m (69 to 157 ft) above sea level (towards the west, around <span class="loc">Brenan</span> Park, are the relatively highly elevated places). Geologically, the suburb sits on the <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> Plain. The suburb is a mix of residential, industrial and commercial areas, but is mostly characterized by low-density housing. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> was the location for the SBS TV show Housos, being one of the many locations for that TV show. Aboriginal people from the Cabrogal tribe, a sub-group of the Gandangara tribe, have lived in the <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> area for over 30,000 years. European settlement began in the area in the early 19th century. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> was originally known as Chilsholm's Bush. In 1867, <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> was a semi-rural settlement populated by vine growers, gardeners, wood timber cutters, orchards and tanneries. Early settlers were attracted to <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> by its good soil, dependable water supply and easy access to the Colony's established towns. Some of the best farming land was in the district to the west and southwest of the <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> area.</p>
