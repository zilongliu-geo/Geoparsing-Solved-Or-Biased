<p><span class="loc">Fontana</span> (Maltese: Il-Fontana) is a village on the island of <span class="loc">Gozo</span>, <span class="loc">Malta</span>, with a population of 985 people as of March 2014. <span class="loc">Fontana</span> originated from the suburb of Victoria on the Rabat-Xlendi road. Its local name is "It-Triq tal-Għajn", (the way to the spring), and it took its name from a spring at the bottom of the road leading to Xlendi, known locally as "l-Għajn il-Kbira", (the big spring). <span class="loc">Fontana</span> is the Italian word for a spring. On the lower part of <span class="loc">Fontana</span>, on the right-hand side of the road to Xlendi, one cannot help but notice the evergreen <span class="loc">Lunzjata</span> Valley going up to the village of Kerċem. Local farmers are busy around all year long in this fertile part of <span class="loc">Gozo</span>. Most of the fishermen that operated from the fishing village of Xlendi lived in <span class="loc">Fontana</span>. Also some other people used to go hunting in the adjacent <span class="loc">Lunzjata</span> Valley. Late in the nineteenth century, they began setting aside part of the proceeds from their catches to construct a church. The foundation stone of the church was laid on 29 January 1893. The church was consecrated twelve years to that day on 29 January 1905, and was dedicated to the <span class="loc">Sacred Heart</span> of Jesus. The church was established as the <span class="loc">parish of Fontana</span> on 27 March 1911 under Bishop Giovanni Maria Camilleri. The spectacular village feast is celebrated each year around the 2nd and 3rd week of June. The <span class="loc">Sacred Heart</span> Catholic Church in <span class="loc">Fontana</span> is also a parish church, and considered to be a national sanctuary of the <span class="loc">Sacred Heart</span>.</p>
