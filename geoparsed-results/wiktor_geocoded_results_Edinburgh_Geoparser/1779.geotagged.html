The words were written by Fred U. Wolfe, an agriculture teacher at <span class="loc">Gold Sand</span>. Sung to the tune "Maryland, My Maryland" ("O Christmas Tree"), the song was incorporated in the Bicentennial programs of 1979. At the evening convocation of January 29, Mrs. Beth Norris announced to the audience that Wolfe (retired and residing in North, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>) was aware his song was part of the program that night.
