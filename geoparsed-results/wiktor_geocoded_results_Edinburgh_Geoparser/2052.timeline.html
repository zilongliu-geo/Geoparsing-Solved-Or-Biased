  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Richland</span> is a city in Camden, <span class="loc">Laclede</span>, and <span class="loc">Pulaski</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The population was 1,863 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Richland</span> is located at 37°51′32″N 92°24′10″W (37.858875, -92.402788). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.29 square miles (5.93 km2), of which, 2.27 square miles (5.88 km2) is land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) is water. Waynesville-St. <span class="org">Robert Regional Airport</span> (<span class="loc">Forney</span> Field) serves the community with air service. Even though it is located within Fort <span class="per">Leonard Wood</span>, it is jointly run by the <span class="loc">cities of Waynesville and St. Robert</span> and is available for civilian use by private pilots and scheduled commercial passenger service. An airfield in Richland's industrial park is available for private pilots but has no scheduled commercial service. The major east-west route is Interstate 44; before that, the main highway was <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66, which still exists as a scenic route through the area and passes through <span class="loc">Devil's Elbow</span>, <span class="per">St. Robert</span>, <span class="loc">Waynesville</span>, <span class="loc">Buckhorn</span>, and <span class="loc">Hazelgreen</span>. Names for <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66 vary - at different places, it is called Teardrop Road, Highway Z, Old Route 66, Historic Route 66, and Highway 17. State-posted signs mark most of the alignment of the road.</p><br><br>
