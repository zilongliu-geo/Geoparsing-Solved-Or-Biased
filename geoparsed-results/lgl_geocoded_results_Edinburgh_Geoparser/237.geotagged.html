The mother in the Rinehart incest case on Monday entered a plea of not guilty to two counts of child endangerment. Attorneys for Linda Rinehart, who appeared in Cass County Circuit Court, also filed a motion to prohibit cameras in the courtroom during pretrial proceedings. Her husband, Danial Rinehart, is accused of having an incestuous relationship with one of the couple’s teenage daughters that lasted five years and produced four babies. He has been charged with second-degree murder, incest, statutory rape, child endangerment and abandonment of a corpse. Authorities say Linda Rinehart knew of the abuse but did nothing to stop it. She is next due in court May 11. One of the babies survived. The boy is in state custody.
