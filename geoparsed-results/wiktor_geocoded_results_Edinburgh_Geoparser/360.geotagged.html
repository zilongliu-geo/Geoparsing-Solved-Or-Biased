<p>Kingston is a borough in <span class="loc">Luzerne County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, on the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span> opposite Wilkes Barre. As of the 2010 census, the population was 13,182. Kingston was named after Kingston, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, and incorporated as a borough in 1857. Kingston has adopted a home rule charter which became effective in January 1976. Kingston has a rich history as a pivotal pioneer in American education. In 1775, a new school was erected on the site of one established in 1773, which is said to have been the first public school in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. The borough is also home to the Upper School campus of <span class="loc">Wyoming Seminary</span>, a prestigious college preparatory school founded in Kingston in 1844. The school was founded with a total of just 31 students—17 boys and 14 girls—enrolling in the first year. Today, <span class="loc">Wyoming Seminary</span>'s historic campus hosts roughly 450 students and its Lower School grounds in Forty Fort host students from pre-K through eighth grade. In June 1972, Kingston was devastated by the flooding of Hurricane Agnes. The hurricane, at the time the most significant natural disaster in American history, wreaked havoc on Kingston and neighboring Wilkes-Barre, causing a state of emergency. The natural disaster earned national attention and a visit from President Richard Nixon who recruited <span class="loc">Wyoming Seminary</span> graduate Frank Carlucci, Nixon's head of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, as a point man to oversee flood recovery efforts.</p>
