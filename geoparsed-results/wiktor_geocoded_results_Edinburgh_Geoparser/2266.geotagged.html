<p><span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 20,497. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Carrizozo, while its largest community is <span class="loc">Ruidoso</span>. It was once the largest county in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In the late 1870s the so-called Lincoln County War broke out between ranchers and the owners of the county's largest general store. William Bonney, better known as Billy the Kid, became involved on the side of the ranchers after his friend and employer was killed. In the end, Bonney killed the deputy that killed his friend, another deputy, and the county sheriff. Several other people were slain in the conflict, which included the other leader of the rancher faction. His death ended the conflict. In 1878, the new territorial governor, retired Union General Lew Wallace, offered an amnesty to the combatants in order to bring a long-lasting truce between the factions. Today, <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a much more peaceful county. Most of the population is centered in the southern portion of the county in the Greater Ruidoso Area. The town of Carrizozo serves as the county seat and is located in the <span class="loc">Tularosa</span> Basin northwest of <span class="loc">Ruidoso</span>. <span class="loc">Ruidoso</span> boasts several small suburbs and neighbor communities including <span class="loc">Ruidoso Downs</span>, <span class="loc">Hollywood</span>, <span class="loc">Mescalero</span>, and Alto which contribute to the Ruidoso Micropolitan Statistical Area's population of 21,224. <span class="loc">Ruidoso</span> serves as the second largest city in south central <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> behind Alamogordo which is 46 miles southwest of the village. <span class="loc">Ruidoso Downs</span> located on the southern end of the county and southeast of <span class="loc">Ruidoso</span> operates the <span class="loc">Ruidoso Downs</span> Racetrack and Casino. The track hosts both thoroughbred and quarter horse racing, notably the All American Futurity, the richest race in quarter horse racing. Historical figures from <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> include Billy the Kid and Smokey Bear, whose names help drive the tourism trade that is heavily popularized within the county.</p>
