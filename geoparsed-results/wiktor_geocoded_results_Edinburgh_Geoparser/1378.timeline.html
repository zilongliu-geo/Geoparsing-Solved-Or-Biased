  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cleveland</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, within Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area and <span class="loc">Liberty County</span>. The population was 7,954 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In <span class="date">1854</span>, a church and convent was built by <span class="per">Father Peter</span> <span class="loc">La Cour</span> near the town's present site. The town began forming in <span class="date">1878</span> when <span class="per">Charles Lander</span> <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, a local judge, donated 63.6 acres (257,000 m2) of land to the <span class="loc">Houston</span> East &amp; <span class="loc">West Texas Railway</span> (<span class="date">now</span> part of the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific Railroad) for use as a stop, requesting that the town be named for him. Since <span class="date">1900</span> <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> has served as the junction of this line and the Gulf, <span class="loc">Colorado</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> (<span class="date">now</span> the BNSF Railway). The town was not incorporated until <span class="date">1935</span>. The forests around <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, including <span class="loc">Sam Houston National Forest</span>, which is located just to its north, are a resort for many inhabitants of the <span class="loc">Houston</span> area, who come to camp, hike, hunt, and fish. <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> has several historic sites and public recreational facilities, including two parks. The <span class="org">Austin Memorial Library Center</span> offers a wide range of services to the community, and the <span class="org">Texan Theater</span> and the annual livestock show and rodeo, Dairy <span class="date">Days</span>, provide entertainment. Commercially, <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> has been a shipping point for timber, lumber, and lumber byproducts since the 1870s. A large medical community, oil, gas, cattle, farm products, and sand and gravel are important to the town's economy. The general trend toward urbanization of the entire area is reflected by the fact that in <span class="date">1965</span> <span class="loc">Liberty County</span> was added to the <span class="org">Houston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> grew from 1,200 in <span class="date">1930</span> to 7,605 according to the census of <span class="date">2000</span>.</p><br><br>
