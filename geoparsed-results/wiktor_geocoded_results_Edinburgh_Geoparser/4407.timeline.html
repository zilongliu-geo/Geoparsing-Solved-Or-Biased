  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">White River</span> is a township located in <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, on the intersection of Highway 17 and Highway 631. It was originally set up as a rail town on the Canadian Pacific Railway in <span class="date">1885</span>. In <span class="date">1961</span>, it was finally made accessible by car via Highway 17 of the Trans-Canada Highway. The forest industry was the largest employer until <span class="date">2007</span>, when the Domtar mill shut down. The township is perhaps best known for being the home of <span class="loc">Winnie</span> the Pooh. In <span class="date">August 1914</span>, a trapped black bear cub was sold to Captain <span class="per">Harry Colebourn</span> in <span class="loc">White River</span>, and <span class="per">Colebourn</span> named it <span class="loc">Winnipeg</span>, or <span class="loc">Winnie</span>, after his hometown of <span class="loc">Winnipeg</span>. Over the <span class="date">years</span>, the animal became the basis for the popular literary character. The town celebrates "<span class="loc">Winnie</span>'s Hometown Festival" every third week in <span class="date">August</span>. The <span class="loc">White River</span> railway station is the western terminus of the <span class="loc">Sudbury</span> – <span class="loc">White River</span> train. <span class="loc">White River</span> advertises itself as "The Coldest Spot in <span class="loc">Canada</span>" with recorded temperatures as low as −58 °C (−72 °F). However, this is a myth, as the coldest temperature in <span class="loc">Canada</span> has been recorded in Snag, <span class="loc">Yukon</span>, at −62.8 °C (−81.0 °F) on <span class="date">3 February 1947</span>. Even in <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, the coldest recorded temperature was in <span class="loc">Iroquois Falls</span> at −58.3 °C (−72.9 °F) (<span class="date">23 January 1935</span>), which is the lowest temperature reported in Eastern <span class="loc">Canada</span> too. <span class="loc">White River</span>'s reputation for coldest area is probably based on the fact that for <span class="date">many years</span> its reported temperature was deemed "the coldest in the nation <span class="date">today</span>" from the handful of stations reporting daily temperature extremes in newspapers and on radio, climatological stations data being only available monthly to Environment <span class="loc">Canada</span>.</p><br><br>
