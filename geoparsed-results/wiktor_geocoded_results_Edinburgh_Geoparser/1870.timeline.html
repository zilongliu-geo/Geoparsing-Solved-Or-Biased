  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Flora</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. The population was 1,546 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Jackson Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The town is named for <span class="per">Flora Mann Jones</span>, an early resident. Graves in <span class="per">Flora</span>'s cemetery date to <span class="date">1821</span>. A post office was established in <span class="date">1883</span>. That same year, <span class="per">Flora</span> became a stop on the newly constructed <span class="per">Yazoo</span> and <span class="per">Mississippi</span> Valley Railroad. The railroad depot is <span class="date">now</span> a museum, and is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. <span class="per">Flora</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1886</span>. In <span class="date">1941</span>, the <span class="per">Mississippi</span> Ordnance Plant was constructed north of <span class="per">Flora</span> to produce propellant and igniter charges for large-caliber guns. The site also had firing ranges for sub-machine guns, rifles, anti-aircraft guns, live grenades, and demolition explosives. A notable employee was science fiction writer <span class="per">Cyril M. Kornbluth</span>. The plant was operated by General Tire, and supported a policy that African-American men were to be employed only as janitors, yard workers, freight loaders, truck drivers and maintenance workers, and could only work in production jobs if white men were not available. African-American women could only be employed as maids and cafeteria helpers. In <span class="date">1942</span>, a local group of African-American citizens met to protest the company's policy.</p><br><br>
