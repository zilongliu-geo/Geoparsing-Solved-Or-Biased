<p>Gordon is a suburb on the Upper <span class="loc">North Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> 15 kilometres (9 mi) north-west of the Sydney Central Business District and is the administrative centre for the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council. <span class="loc">East Gordon</span> is a locality within Gordon and <span class="loc">West Gordon</span> within <span class="loc">West Pymble</span>. The name 'Gordon' first appears as the name of the survey parish covering most of the upper north shore, assigned by the NSW Surveyor-General Sir Thomas Mitchell. This is believed to commemorate Sir Willoughby Gordon, with whom he had served during the Peninsular War and who was the quartermaster-general of the regiment in which Mitchell had served. The survey parish, and later suburb and municipality of Willoughby also commemorates his name. Settlement of the area commenced about 1820. The early settlement at Gordon was originally known as Lane Cove. The earliest school at 'Lane Cove', as Gordon was then known, was established at the behest of Governor Macquarie in 1816. The first Lane Cove Post Office opened on 1 February 1860. The name of the village and Post Office was changed to Gordon, after the Gordondale estate of Robert McIntosh, on 1 June 1879. Gordon Railway Station on the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> Line was built in 1888.</p>
