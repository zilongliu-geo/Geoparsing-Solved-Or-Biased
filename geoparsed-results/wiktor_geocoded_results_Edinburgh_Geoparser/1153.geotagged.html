<p><span class="loc">Ceres</span> is the administrative centre and largest town of the Witzenberg Local Municipality in the Western Cape Province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. <span class="loc">Ceres</span> serves as a regional centre for the surrounding towns of Wolseley, <span class="loc">Tulbagh</span>, <span class="loc">Op-die-Berg</span> and <span class="loc">Prince Alfred Hamlet</span>. It is situated in the <span class="loc">Warmbokkeveld</span> (Afrikaans: "warm antelope field") Valley about 170 km north-east of Cape Town. <span class="loc">Ceres</span> is located at the north-eastern entrance to <span class="loc">Michell's Pass</span> and was the old route north between Cape Town and <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span>, which was later replaced by the N1 highway, which traverses the Breede River Valley to the south. It was named after the Roman goddess of agriculture, <span class="loc">Ceres</span>, a name which is fitting as the valley in which the town is situated is extremely fertile and is a major producer of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>'s deciduous fruit. <span class="loc">Ceres</span> experiences a typical Mediterranean climate tempered by its altitude. The town experiences warmer temperatures in summer, due to its inland location with infrequent rainfall, however winters are cool to quite cold and wet, with frequent snowfalls on the surrounding higher-lying ground, rarely falling on the valley floor itself. Total annual precipitation averages 1088 mm, with average temperatures ranging from a February maximum of 29,9 °C to a July minimum of 2,4 °C.</p>
