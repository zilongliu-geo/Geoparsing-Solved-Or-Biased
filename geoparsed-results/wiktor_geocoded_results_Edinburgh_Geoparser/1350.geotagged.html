<p><span class="loc">Lake County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 7,832, making it the fifth-least populous county in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Tiptonville</span>. It is the state's northwesternmost county, sharing a border with <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> and separated from <span class="loc">Missouri</span> to the west by the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span> occupies much of the northern part of the county. The history of <span class="loc">Lake County</span> has been largely defined by <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span>, a natural lake created by the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811 and 1812. The county was established by the state legislature in 1870. It was originally included in <span class="loc">Obion County</span>, but was created as a separate county due to difficulties its residents had to cross the swampy wetlands around <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span> to reach Obion's county seat. <span class="loc">Tiptonville</span> was designated as <span class="loc">Lake County</span>'s seat of government. In 1862, during the Civil War, the Battle of <span class="loc">Island Number Ten</span> took place in the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River, just off the shores of what is now <span class="loc">Lake County</span>. In 1907, a violent conflict took place in Lake and <span class="loc">Obion counties</span> when a private company, the <span class="loc">West Tennessee Land</span> Company, gained control of <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span> and announced plans to drain it. A band of local renegades, known as the "Night Riders of <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span>," harassed the company's employees, eventually kidnapping and killing one. Governor Malcolm Patterson personally led the Tennessee National Guard into the area, and arrested hundreds of suspected Night Riders. The state gained title to the lake in 1914, and the lake was designated as a hunting and fishing reserve by Governor Austin Peay in 1925. This was the precedent for the area to be preserved as the modern <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span> State Park.</p>
