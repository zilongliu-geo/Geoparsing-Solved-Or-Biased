  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Isabella County</span>, located in Central Michigan. The population was 26,016 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Part of the city (with a population of 8,741) is located within the <span class="loc">Isabella Indian Reservation</span>, the base of the federally recognized <span class="loc">Saginaw</span> <span class="loc">Chippewa</span> Tribal Nation. This is the site of the Tribe's Soaring Eagle Casino. The city is home to the main campuses of Central <span class="org">Michigan University</span>, one of the largest universities in the state with 20,000 students at <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>, and <span class="org">Mid Michigan Community College</span>. The student population nearly doubles the population of the city during the academic year. Until the mid-19th century, this area was occupied by historical bands of the Ojibwa people, known by English speakers as the <span class="loc">Chippewa</span>. In the early <span class="date">decades</span> of the century, they ceded vast amounts of land to the <span class="loc">United States</span> government, which wanted to extinguish Native American land titles to enable settlement by European Americans. The federal Graduation Act of <span class="date">1854</span> allowed European-American settlers to purchase land from the government at discount rates, and the first white settlers began to arrive in what became <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>. Under the Treaty of <span class="date">1855</span>, the Ojibwa bands (<span class="loc">Saginaw</span> <span class="loc">Chippewa</span> Tribe) from the <span class="loc">Saginaw</span>, <span class="loc">Swan Creek</span>, and Black rivers were relocated to land in <span class="loc">Isabella County</span> (<span class="loc">Isabella Indian Reservation</span>). Many non-natives soon moved to <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>, predicting prosperous relations with the natives. The Homestead Act of <span class="date">1862</span> also attracted many new settlers, including new European immigrants, to <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> to develop their stake on free lands offered by the <span class="loc">US</span> government in exchange for their labor in developing it for residence and agriculture.</p><br><br>
