  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Knox County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 432,226, making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Knoxville</span>, the third-most populous city in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. <span class="loc">Knox County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Knoxville</span>, <span class="loc">TN</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county is at the geographical center of <span class="org">the Great Valley of East</span> <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. Near the heart of the county is the origin of the <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> River at the union of the <span class="loc">Holston</span> and <span class="loc">French Broad</span> rivers. <span class="loc">Knox County</span> was created on <span class="date">June 11, 1792</span>, by Governor <span class="per">William Blount</span> from parts of <span class="loc">Greene</span> and <span class="loc">Hawkins</span> counties, one of the few counties created when the state was still known as the Southwest Territory. It is one of nine <span class="loc">United States</span> counties named for American Revolutionary War general and first <span class="loc">United States</span> Secretary of War <span class="per">Henry Knox</span>. Parts of <span class="loc">Knox County</span> later became <span class="per">Blount</span> (<span class="date">1795</span>), Anderson (<span class="date">1801</span>), <span class="loc">Roane</span> (<span class="date">1801</span>), and Union (<span class="date">1850</span>) counties. In <span class="date">1783</span>, an expedition into the Upper <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> Valley led by <span class="per">James White</span> and <span class="per">Francis Alexander Ramsey</span> explored what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Knox County</span>. White moved to what is <span class="date">now</span> the <span class="loc">Riverdale</span> community in the eastern part of the county in <span class="date">1785</span>, and <span class="date">the following year</span> constructed a fort a few miles to the west that would evolve into the <span class="loc">city of Knoxville</span>. <span class="per">Blount</span> chose the fort as the capital of the Southwest Territory in <span class="date">1790</span>, and gave the new town the name "<span class="loc">Knoxville</span>" after his superior, <span class="per">Henry Knox</span>.</p><br><br>
