<p><span class="loc">Barga</span> is a medieval town and comune of the <span class="loc">province of Lucca</span> in <span class="loc">Tuscany</span>, central <span class="loc">Italy</span>. It is home to around 10,000 people and is the chief town of the "Media Valle" (mid valley) of the <span class="loc">Serchio</span> River. <span class="loc">Barga</span> lies 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of the provincial capital, <span class="loc">Lucca</span>. It is overlooked by the village of <span class="loc">Albiano</span>, a localit√† of <span class="loc">Barga</span>, which in the 10th century was the site of a castle protecting the town. <span class="loc">Pania della Croce</span>, a mountain of the <span class="loc">Apuan Alps</span>, dominates the surrounding chestnut trees, grape vines and olive groves. In the 9th century, <span class="loc">Barga</span> is mentioned as a family feud of the Lombard family of Rolandinghi. In the 11th century, <span class="loc">Barga</span> obtained from Matilda of <span class="loc">Tuscany</span> broad privileges including tax exemptions. However, formally <span class="loc">Barga</span> was still subordinate to <span class="loc">Lucca</span>. When Matilda died, she left all her properties, including the <span class="loc">Serchio</span> Valley, to the Church, which was not really a popular decision, and caused a war. Despite the war, <span class="loc">Barga</span> was not looted, apparently, because of the presence of the nuncius, sent to the valley by the Pope Gregory IX. As the result of the war, the <span class="loc">diocese of Lucca</span> was abolished and split between several parties, including <span class="loc">Pisa</span>. <span class="loc">Barga</span> took advantage of it, and in the 13th century helped <span class="loc">Pisa</span> against <span class="loc">Lucca</span>, but in 1236 was finally subordinated to <span class="loc">Lucca</span>. After these events, <span class="loc">Barga</span> has developed as an important trade city which had connections with <span class="loc">Modena</span> over mountain roads. The city grew as a castle surrounded by a line of walls, of which two gates (Porta Reale and Porta Macchiaia) have survived. The town was well known during the Middle Ages for the manufacture of silk threads which were exported to major centres such as <span class="loc">Florence</span>, its mills powered by the hydraulic power of the nearby creeks. In the Middle Ages, <span class="loc">Lucca</span> and <span class="loc">Pisa</span> battled frequently to conquer the wealthy town and the surrounding territory, and for a time <span class="loc">Barga</span> was part of the Florentine dominion, later Duchy and Grand Duchy of <span class="loc">Tuscany</span>. Between 1331 and 1859 <span class="loc">Albiano</span> owed its allegiance to the Florentine State. It became part of the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Italy</span> in 1861. Since 1923 <span class="loc">Barga</span> is part of the <span class="loc">province of Lucca</span>.</p>
