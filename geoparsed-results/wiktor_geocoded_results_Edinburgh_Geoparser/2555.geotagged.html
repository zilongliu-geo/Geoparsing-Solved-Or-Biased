As of the 2010 census the city had a population of 16,641.

Following a hurricane, which came through the city on August 13, 2004, Hurricane Charley, a revitalization of the City took place that resulted in buildings being restored or built to hurricane resistant codes. The new buildings, restorations and amenities concurrently preserved the City's historic past while showcasing state-of-the art modern facilities and small city charm. During this time, <span class="loc">Laishley</span> Park and Marina was built and a waterfront path along the harbor Harborwalk, a Linear Park that winds through the city next to a scenic stream and various trails were created throughout the City for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.</p>
