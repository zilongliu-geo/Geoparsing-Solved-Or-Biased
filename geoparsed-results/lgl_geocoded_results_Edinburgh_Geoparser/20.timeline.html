  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>New School to Open in <span class="loc">Old Town</span> . <span class="date">This fall</span>, the classical education is coming back to Alexandria, but almost half <span class="date">a year</span> and several large hurdles remain before the school can officially open its doors. The move to establish the <span class="org">Washington Latin School</span>, led by <span class="per">T.R. Ahlstrom</span> and Headmaster <span class="per">Tom Soule</span>, is gearing up for the start to its academic calendar on <span class="date">September 8</span> at a location yet to be determined in <span class="loc">Old Town</span>. The school hopes to attract students with a rigorous, classics-based curriculum and a significantly reduced tuition, due to the current economy. Students enrolling for the school’s first year will pay an annual tuition of $14,000, plus other fees, during the <span class="date">2009</span>-<span class="date">2010</span> and <span class="date">2010</span>-<span class="date">2011</span> school <span class="date">years</span>, roughly $10,000 less than the original sticker price. Once the school’s financial base is strong enough, <span class="per">Ahlstrom</span> and <span class="per">Soule</span> plan to admit students on a partial- or full-scholarship basis — the founders are aware that the $24,000 average price tag is not possible for everyone — making it financially viable for students from lower-income backgrounds to attend. “My take on this, and T.R. and I have talked about this before, is ‘classics for everyone,’” <span class="per">Soule</span> said. “Far too often that kind of education isn’t available to people of all socio-economic backgrounds.” <span class="per">Ahlstrom</span> said that the results found at the <span class="loc">Washington</span> Latin Public Charter School in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span>, one of two public Latin schools that he has helped found in <span class="date">the last seven years</span> — Bronx Latin in New <span class="loc">York City</span> is the other — prove that people of all economic backgrounds can thrive in the demanding, classical setting. Currently, there are three locations in <span class="loc">Old Town</span> being looked at as the school’s initial home, <span class="per">Soule</span> and <span class="per">Ahlstrom</span> said. The educational philosophy at the <span class="org">Washington Latin School</span> in Alexandria is somewhat similar to Ahlstrom’s previous two endeavors, but is setting out as an independent, privately funded school rather than one receiving public funds. “This is my third school in <span class="date">the last seven years</span>,” <span class="per">Ahlstrom</span> said. “The other projects were very successful, and we believe this one will be more successful because we’ve chosen not to do it as a public school, but as an independent, co-educational classical school. “I’m not trying to be a basher of public schools, I’m a product of them. The fact of the matter is that there is one kind of school in this country for prosperous people and another kind of education for everyone else.” Both <span class="per">Ahlstrom</span> and <span class="per">Soule</span> worked at the <span class="loc">Washington</span> <span class="org">Latin School</span> Charter School before leaving in <span class="date">late 2007</span> to start the independent school venture. <span class="per">Soule</span> said that by then, they “had reached a ceiling” with what they were able to do educationally at the charter school and wanted to move on to a new situation that would allow for more independence. According to <span class="per">Soule</span> and <span class="per">Charter</span> School Board meeting minutes, the D.C. Charter School Board disagreed with <span class="per">Ahlstrom</span>’s proposal to move the school from <span class="per">Northwest D.C.</span> to Penn Quarter and ultimately nixed the idea. The charter school’s current headmaster, <span class="per">Martha Cutts</span>, came on after <span class="per">Ahlstrom</span> and <span class="per">Soule</span> left, but said that in the time since the school has continued to flourish, swelling to 341 students <span class="date">this year</span> from 179 only <span class="date">two years before</span>. In <span class="date">2008</span>, the school opened a second campus in D.C. for its eighth and ninth graders, and applications for the upcoming school year are up 74 percent, <span class="per">Cutts</span> said. While it appears the charter school is established and growing, the <span class="org">Washington Latin School</span> in Alexandria has its own set of hurdles to clear. Getting students and their families to move away from their current schools could be considered one of the project’s biggest obstacles, but <span class="per">Ahlstrom</span> and <span class="per">Soule</span> are confident that the niche they’re trying to fill with the <span class="org">Washington Latin School</span> is one that will not struggle to attract students. “There’s no problem getting kids and families to commit,” <span class="per">Ahlstrom</span> said. “Every school we’ve ever done, there’s a long line at the door. There will be here, too. The real challenge is funding without getting public money.” <span class="org">Donna Molinari of Alexandria Country Day School</span> said that the <span class="org">Latin School</span> is starting in much the same way that ACDS did in <span class="date">the 1980s</span>, and that based on the differences in curriculum the new school probably would not affect its enrollment too much. “I think they have their reputation behind them to help propel them forward, and it’s a curriculum that’s been around for a while, and that will help them,” <span class="loc">Molinari</span> said. “Of course, the hurdles are those that all new schools face, and are affected even more so in a tough economic climate.” During a <span class="date">March 17</span> public meeting at <span class="org">Charles Beatley Library</span>, <span class="per">Ahlstrom</span> dove into some of the financing they’re looking for with the new school. Aside from tuition for the students enrolling in the first year — fifth grade, sixth grade and seventh grade only — the school is looking for 10 “founding families,” each of whom would pay $100,000 in the first year, covering the child’s tuition through graduation. In addition, the school is looking for 12 individuals or corporations to contribute $200,000 each over <span class="date">the next five years</span> in order to solidify the school’s financial base. “Is it hard work? Yes. Is it more difficult because of this economy? Of course,” <span class="per">Ahlstrom</span> said. “We’ve asked the question, ‘How can we turn this negative economy in a positive thing?’ And I think we’ve done that.” The plan is to add a new higher and lower grade each year, but for the first year the school is hoping to draw about 50 students, enough for a single cohort of fifth, sixth and seventh grade students. <span class="loc">Alexandria City</span> Public Schools, experiencing its own enrollment increase, are not expecting the new school to affect what they do to any great extent, but are eager to see what comes about, Director of Communications <span class="per">Amy Carlini</span> said. “We’ll have to wait and see how it works out,” <span class="per">Carlini</span> said. “It’s going to be interesting to see what happens.”</p><br><br>
