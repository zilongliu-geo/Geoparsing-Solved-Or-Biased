<p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Livingston Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 487 at the 2010 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Baton Rouge</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is located at 30°25′45″N 90°32′53″W (30.429173, -90.548065). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.4 square miles (3.6 km²), all of it land. The town's name comes from the numerous artesian springs in the area. The ZIP Code of <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is 70462. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> began in the 18th century at one of the northernmost points considered to be navigable on the <span class="loc">Natalbany River</span>. Between <span class="loc">Springfield</span> and <span class="loc">Lake Maurepas</span>, <span class="loc">Ponchatoula Creek</span> joins the <span class="loc">Natalbany</span> and increases its flow. The town was also connected to the Natchez Trace. Via the <span class="loc">Natalbany</span>, <span class="loc">Lake Maurepas</span>, <span class="loc">Lake Pontchartrain</span>, and <span class="loc">Bayou Saint John</span>, <span class="loc">Springfield</span> had access to <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> by water. Similarly, at the time (prior to the damming of the channel by levees) along the <span class="loc">Amite River</span> and <span class="loc">Mississippi River</span>, <span class="loc">Bayou Manchac</span> provided shallow-water access between <span class="loc">Springfield</span> and <span class="loc">Baton Rouge</span>. By 1810 <span class="loc">Springfield</span> was one of the areas of interest in the rebellion against <span class="loc">Spain</span>, which produced the short-lived Republic of West <span class="loc">Florida</span>. Bricks from an old Spanish fort can still be found, roughly 200 yards in front of today's post office. At this time the area was part of St. Helena Parish, with <span class="loc">Livingston Parish</span> created in 1832 from the southern portion of <span class="loc">St. Helena</span>.</p>
