<p><span class="loc">Altoona</span> is a city in Eau <span class="loc">Claire County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,056 as of July 1, 2013. The city is a railroad terminal on the Union Pacific Railroad. The settlement of <span class="loc">Altoona</span> began in 1881 when the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, St. Paul, <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span> and <span class="loc">Omaha Railway</span> selected the site for a new terminal to replace the overcrowded existing terminal in <span class="loc">Eau Claire</span>. The railroad had originally planned to put the new terminal in <span class="loc">Fall Creek</span>, but the city of <span class="loc">Eau Claire</span> lobbied for a site closer to the existing one, and representatives from <span class="loc">Eau Claire</span> and the railroad walked the tracks from <span class="loc">Fall Creek</span> to <span class="loc">Eau Claire</span> to determine a suitable site. When the location of present-day <span class="loc">Altoona</span> - approximately three miles east of the existing <span class="loc">Eau Claire</span> terminal - was found to have sufficient flat land and access to water (via the <span class="loc">Eau Claire River</span>), the railroad began construction of the new terminal and the community of "<span class="loc">East Eau Claire</span>" was platted in October. Residents began moving into the community in early 1882 and the railroad terminal became operational in May of that year. However, confusion between the "<span class="loc">Eau Claire</span>" and "<span class="loc">East Eau Claire</span>" stations quickly caused the railroad to rename the new terminal "Altoona" on October 14, 1882. <span class="loc">Altoona</span> was incorporated as a city on April 5, 1887.</p>
