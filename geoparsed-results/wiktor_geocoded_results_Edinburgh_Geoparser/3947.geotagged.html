<p><span class="loc">Picton</span> is a small town in the <span class="loc">Macarthur Region</span> of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, in the Wollondilly Shire. The town is located 80 kilometres south-west of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, close to Camden and Campbelltown. It is also the administrative centre of Wollondilly Shire. <span class="loc">Picton</span> was first explored by Europeans in 1798 and remained beyond the limits of legal settlement until 1821. Following the discovery of good land in the interior and the settlement of <span class="loc">Bong Bong</span> and the <span class="loc">Goulburn</span> areas, Governor Macquarie authorised the building of the new Great South Road between <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and the Southern Highlands in 1819. This opened up the <span class="loc">Picton</span> area to settlers, including Henry Colden Antill, who established a 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) property in 1822. <span class="loc">Picton</span> developed when a new line of the Great South Road was cut over the Razorback Range from Camden, and especially after the railway arrived in 1863. <span class="loc">Picton</span> is the only town in the Southern Hemisphere where you can pass through it twice when travelling by train. It was established as <span class="loc">Stonequarry</span> in 1841 and was renamed <span class="loc">Picton</span> in 1845. It remained a stopping point on the Great South Road, later renamed the Hume Highway, until it was bypassed in December 1980.</p>
