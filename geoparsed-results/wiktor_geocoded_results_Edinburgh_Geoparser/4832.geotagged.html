<p><span class="loc">Norfolk</span> (local /ˈnɔːrfɔːrk/) is a town in <span class="loc">Litchfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,787 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> is perhaps best known as the site of the <span class="loc">Yale</span> Summer School of Music – Norfolk Chamber Music Festival, which hosts an annual chamber music concert series in "the Music Shed," a performance hall located on the Ellen Battell Stoeckel estate to the west of the village green. <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> has important examples of regional architecture, notably the Village Hall (now Infinity Hall, a shingled 1880s Arts-and-Crafts confection, with an opera house upstairs and storefronts at street level); the Norfolk Library (a shingle-style structure, designed by George Keller, ca 1888/1889); and over thirty buildings, in a wide variety of styles, designed by Alfredo S. G. Taylor (of the <span class="loc">New York</span> firm Taylor &amp; Levi) in the four decades before the Second World War. <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> was first settled in 1744 and incorporated in 1758, later than most surrounding towns because of the dense woods, rocky soil and high elevation. Originally a farming community, nineteenth-century <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> saw the rise of numerous small factories, many of which fabricated tools and farming implements from local iron ore, and mills, which took advantage of fast-flowing mountain streams.</p>
