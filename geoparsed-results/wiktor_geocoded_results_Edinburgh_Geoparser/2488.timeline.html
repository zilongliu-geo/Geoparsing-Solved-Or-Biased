  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Iba</span> is a community in the <span class="org">Ifelodun Local Government Area</span> of Ọṣun State, <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. <span class="loc">Iba</span> is in the <span class="org">Ifelodun Local Government Area</span> in the northeast of Ọṣun State a few kilometers northeast of <span class="loc">Ikirun</span>, east of <span class="loc">Inisa</span> and southeast of <span class="loc">Okuku</span>. The <span class="org">Jalumi War</span> of <span class="date">1 November 1878</span> took place in the hilly country of the northeast of Osun State in the area that includes <span class="loc">Ikirun</span>, <span class="loc">Iba</span>, <span class="loc">Inisa</span>, <span class="loc">Okuku</span> and Eko-Ende. It was one of the series of civil wars in Yorubaland between <span class="date">1793</span> and <span class="date">1893</span>. The town is mentioned in a report of <span class="date">1911</span> of a visit by the resident <span class="per">Captain Cyril Hammond Elgee</span> and the Ibadan chiefs to hear a boundary dispute between <span class="loc">Iba</span> and nearby <span class="loc">Okuku</span>. The dispute was unresolved until <span class="date">the late 1930s</span>. The ruling house of <span class="loc">Iba</span> claims that they came from <span class="loc">Ife</span> long before the people of <span class="loc">Ikuku</span> came to the region. In <span class="date">2011</span>, a dispute over which ruling house should become the next traditional ruler, or <span class="loc">Eburu</span> of <span class="loc">Iba</span>, became a subject of litigation after the demise of <span class="loc">Oba</span> <span class="per">Ibrahim Bamigbade</span>. <span class="loc">Olugbuyi</span> ruling house claimed that the title should alternate between the <span class="loc">Olugbuyi</span> and <span class="loc">Okiti</span> ruling houses, and that the <span class="per">Ijadunoye</span> and <span class="per">Alamu</span> were families in the <span class="loc">Okiti</span> ruling house. <span class="per">Alamu</span> and <span class="per">Ijadunoye</span> ruling houses claimed that the <span class="per">Ijadunoye</span> and <span class="per">Alamu</span> were separate ruling houses and there had never been any <span class="loc">Okiti</span> ruling house in <span class="loc">Iba</span> history, and the stool should rotate to them too. in <span class="date">2014</span>, <span class="org">Justice Afolabi of High Court</span> of Osogbo ruled in favor of <span class="org">Alamu Ruling House</span> and ordered the installation of <span class="per">Prof. Adekunle Okunoye of Alamu</span> Ruling House having been duly nominated by his ruling house and unanimously approved by the kingmakers.</p><br><br>
