  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Auburn is a small town in the southern edge of the <span class="loc">Clare</span> Valley, in <span class="org">the Mid North of South</span> <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It lies in the northern Mount Lofty Ranges just east of the <span class="loc">Skilly Hills</span>. Auburn is bisected by the <span class="loc">Wakefield</span> River as it makes its way to the sea at <span class="loc">Port Wakefield</span>. It has strong poetical themes, being named from a poem and the birthplace of a famed poet. The first European to explore through the Auburn district, in <span class="date">April 1839</span>, was <span class="per">John Hill</span>, who was followed <span class="date">one month later</span> by <span class="per">Edward John Eyre</span>. On <span class="date">10 March 1840</span> <span class="per">John Morphett</span> selected a special survey of 4,000 acres on the <span class="loc">Wakefield</span> River as land agent for three English investors, Admiral <span class="per">George Lambert</span>, <span class="per">Edward Rice M.P.</span>, and <span class="per">Robert Slaney M.P</span>.. Very soon after, just outside the southwest corner of this survey, a pioneering character named <span class="per">William Tateham</span> squatted on the <span class="loc">Wakefield</span> River, living in a riverbank dugout from where he provided hospitality to travellers. The spot, which later became the site of Auburn, was for a time named <span class="per">Tateham</span>'s Waterhole or <span class="per">Billy Tatum</span>'s because of this.</p><br><br>
