<p>The <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> /ˈnjuːˌkɑːsəl/ metropolitan area is the second most populated area in the Australian state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> and includes most of the <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> and <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span> local government areas. It is the hub of the Greater <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> area which includes most parts of the local government areas of <span class="loc">City of Newcastle</span>, City of <span class="loc">Lake Macquarie</span>, <span class="loc">City of Cessnock</span>, <span class="loc">City of Maitland and Port Stephens Council</span>. 162 kilometres (101 mi) NNE of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Hunter River</span>, it is the predominant city within the Hunter Region. Famous for its coal, <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> is the largest coal exporting harbour in the world, exporting over 97 Mt of coal in 2009–10 with plans to expand annual capacity to 180 Mt by 2013. Beyond the city, the Hunter Region possesses large coal deposits. Geologically, the area is located in the central-eastern part of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> basin. <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> and the lower Hunter Region were traditionally occupied by the Awabakal and Worimi Aboriginal People, who called the area Malubimba. In September 1797 Lieutenant John Shortland became the first European to explore the area. His discovery of the area was largely accidental; as he had been sent in search of a number of convicts who had seized HMS <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> as she was sailing from <span class="loc">Sydney</span> Cove. While returning, Lt. Shortland entered what he later described as "a very fine river", which he named after <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>' Governor John Hunter. He returned with reports of the deep-water port and the area's abundant coal. Over the next two years, coal mined from the area was the <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> colony's first export.</p>
