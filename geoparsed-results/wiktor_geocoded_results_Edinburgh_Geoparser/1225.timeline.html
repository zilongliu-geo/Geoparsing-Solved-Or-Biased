  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Jamestown</span>, also known as Webersvallei ("Weber's Valley"), is a quiet rural settlement on the southern outskirts of <span class="loc">Stellenbosch</span> in the Cape <span class="loc">Winelands District</span> of the Western Cape province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It is situated next to Blaauwklippen Vineyards, on the eastern side of route R44 from <span class="loc">Stellenbosch</span> to <span class="loc">Somerset West</span> and the Strand coastal resort. The main access from the R44 is via Webersvallei Road, the main road in <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> with watererven – long, narrow agricultural plots on the south bank of <span class="loc">Blouklip</span> River – on the north side of the road and residential plots on the south side of the road. Over time, <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> has transformed from a subsistence farming village into a primarily residential area as residents have sought work elsewhere in order to survive. A heritage committee was established in <span class="date">2010</span> to document the history of <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> for the benefit of future generations, to restore old buildings and to facilitate increased involvement in local festivals and commemorative events. The village was named after <span class="per">James Rattray</span> (<span class="date">1859</span>–<span class="date">1938</span>), a <span class="loc">Stellenbosch</span> businessman who owned a butchery in <span class="loc">Dorp</span> Street. He was the grandson of Scottish teacher <span class="per">James Rattray</span> (c. <span class="date">1795</span>–<span class="date">1864</span>) who immigrated to the <span class="loc">Cape Colony</span> in <span class="date">1822</span>, one of several British people recruited to the colony by Scottish missionary <span class="per">George Thom</span> at the request of the governor <span class="per">Lord Charles Somerset</span>. In <span class="date">1902</span> <span class="per">Rattray</span> and <span class="per">Rhenish</span> missionary <span class="per">Jacob Weber</span> (<span class="date">1856</span>–<span class="date">1937</span>), who was born in <span class="loc">Lennep</span> in <span class="loc">Germany</span> and sent to <span class="loc">Stellenbosch</span> in <span class="date">1882</span>, acquired a portion of the Blaauwklippen farm. The land was divided into plots and sold to coloured families, and most of the associated debt was paid off within <span class="date">twenty years</span>. Street names such as Everbearing, Festival, Nared, <span class="loc">Pajaro</span>, <span class="loc">Rolinda</span>, Tiobelle, <span class="org">Titan</span>, <span class="loc">Torrey</span>, <span class="per">Tribute</span> and <span class="per">Whiteheart</span> in the residential area are based on strawberry varieties, after the main crop grown there since <span class="date">1902</span>. Other crops grown there include beans, lettuce, potatoes and tomatoes.</p><br><br>
