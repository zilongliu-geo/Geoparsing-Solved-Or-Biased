  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Kara is an old township situated near <span class="loc">Sirathu</span>, on the banks of <span class="loc">Ganges</span>, 69 km (43 mi) west of the <span class="loc">city of Allahabad</span> in <span class="loc">Kaushambi district</span> in <span class="loc">Uttar Pradesh</span> state in <span class="loc">India</span>. It was capital of a very big region for <span class="date">centuries</span> under the <span class="loc">Delhi</span> <span class="per">Sultanate</span> and <span class="per">Jaunpur</span> <span class="per">Sultanate</span> rule. It has been sometimes spelt at Karrah, <span class="loc">Kada</span> and <span class="loc">Kurrah</span> but actually it is Kara(in Hindi कड़ा and Urdu کڑہ )and often called with its sister town across the river <span class="loc">Ganges</span> called <span class="loc">Manikpur</span>. Still it is called Kara-Manikpur. Kara falls in <span class="loc">Kaushambi district</span> while <span class="loc">Manikpur</span> has <span class="date">now</span> become a part of <span class="loc">Partapgarh District</span>. <span class="date">Centuries</span> ago it was the seat of the Governor of the Sirkar of Kara ("the <span class="loc">Province of Kara</span>"). Between the 7th century and the 16th century it retained its charm and importance as the capital, but in <span class="date">1526</span>, the Mughal emperor <span class="loc">Akbar</span> made <span class="loc">Allahabad</span> the capital and thus reduced Kara to a subdivision of the province. During British Rule, <span class="loc">Allahabad</span> gained so much importance that Kara went into oblivion and <span class="date">today</span> it is a town of dilapidated havelis, forts, and monuments unknown. Hundreds of thousands of graves are lying in an area with a diameter of 7–8 km (5 miles). This stunning fact which emboldens its claim that it had been certainly inhabited by many people during its history.</p><br><br>
