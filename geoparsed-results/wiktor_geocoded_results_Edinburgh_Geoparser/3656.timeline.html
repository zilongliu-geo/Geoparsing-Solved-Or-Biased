  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Polom</span> (pronounced [pɔˈlɔm] or [ˈpɔːlɔm]; German: <span class="loc">Ebenthal</span> or <span class="loc">Ebental</span>; Gottscheerish: Ebentou, Ebntol) is a settlement in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is <span class="date">now</span> included in the Southeast <span class="loc">Slovenia</span> Statistical Region. <span class="loc">Polom</span> first appeared in written records under its German name, <span class="loc">Ebenthal</span>, in <span class="date">1763</span>–<span class="date">1787</span>. The Slovenian name <span class="loc">Polom</span> may be derived from the common noun polom 'place where the wind or snow has felled trees', or from the prepositional phrase pod lomom, literally 'below where a ridge transitions into a steep slope' or 'below a thicket'. The German name Ebent(h)al means 'level valley' and is derived from the geography of the village. <span class="loc">Polom</span> was a Gottschee German village. According to the land registry of <span class="date">1574</span>, <span class="loc">Polom</span> had only one and a half full-sized farms, divided into two three-eighths-farms and <span class="date">three quarter</span>-farms, corresponding to between 40 and 45 residents. In <span class="date">1770</span> there were 26 houses in the village. A part-time school was established in the village in <span class="date">1858</span>, and a regular school in <span class="date">1859</span>. Before the Second World War the village had 36 houses and a population of 148. During the Second World War the entire population of the village was evicted, with the exception of one family. There was a Partisan stronghold in the village during the war. <span class="loc">Polom</span> was not burned during the war, but it came under aerial bombardment from Italian, German, and Allied forces. No classes were held in the village school between <span class="date">1941</span> and <span class="date">1948</span>. After the war, settlers from various parts of <span class="loc">Slovenia</span> moved to the village. The Polom volunteer fire department became a founding unit of the Kočevje municipal fire department on <span class="date">28 August 1955</span>.</p><br><br>
