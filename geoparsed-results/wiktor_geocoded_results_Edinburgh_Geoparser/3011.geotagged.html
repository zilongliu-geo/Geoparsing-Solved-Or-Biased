<p><span class="loc">Roseville</span> is an unincorporated community and neighborhood within the <span class="loc">city of Newark</span> in <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It borders <span class="loc">Bloomfield</span> and <span class="loc">East Orange</span>. To the neighborhood's immediate east is the <span class="loc">Newark City</span> Subway and Branch Brook Park. <span class="loc">Roseville</span> is divided into Upper Roseville north of 3rd <span class="loc">Ave</span> and Lower Roseville south of 3rd <span class="loc">Ave</span>. Originally called "Rowesville," <span class="loc">Roseville</span> was farmland at the time of the Civil War, but during the conflict most of the area was turned into Union Army training and camping grounds. Residential development began with the construction of Newark's first streetcar line in 1862, and expanded greatly in the 1880s. Growth was also spurred by the <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, <span class="loc">Lackawanna</span>, &amp; Western Railroad, which maintained a train station in <span class="loc">Roseville</span> for many years (closed in 1982 by <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Transit). For generations, <span class="loc">Roseville</span> received Newarkers who had acquired the prosperity to leave the crowded tenements of the Ironbound and the central part of the city. At the turn of the century, the northern section of the district was predominantly Irish-American, but the rest of the neighborhood was not associated with any single ethnic group. Most of the residents, however, were Catholic and St. Rose of Lima Church was an important part of neighborhood life. In the 1950s and 1960s, the proportion of African American residents increased. However, since the 1970s, increasing numbers of Hispanic families have moved into the neighborhood, hailing from <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>, <span class="loc">Dominican Republic</span> and various Latin American mainland countries.</p>
