<p>Buffalo is a town and county seat of <span class="loc">Harper County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,299 at the 2010 census. It was named after <span class="loc">Buffalo Creek</span> Valley, for which it is located. In 1907, the town was "staked out" and a post office was established with the name Buffalo, which was derived from nearby <span class="loc">Buffalo Creek</span>. In 1908, a county seat election gave title to Buffalo and it was incorporated in the same year. Buffalo's founders issued instructions for all buildings to be built of stone, thereby many of those structures survived the test of time. The <span class="loc">Harper County</span> Journal, consolidated from the Buffalo Republican and the <span class="loc">Harper County</span> Democrat, has been published weekly since 1924. Other early newspapers included the Buffalo News, the Buffalo Bugle, the Buffalo Republican and the Post. The population peaked in 1960 at 1,618. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, Buffalo has a total area of 0.8 square miles (2.1 km2), all land. The city lies in the northwestern corner of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> at the Panhandle's eastern entrance, along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 183/64, 12 miles (19 km) south of the Kansas state line. It is 30 miles (48 km) northeast of the Texas state line and 174 miles (280 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Oklahoma City</span>.</p>
