  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Mr Alexander Litvinenko</span>, reputed to have been an Ex-Russian spy who had defected to <span class="loc">Britain</span>, died last night in mysterious circumstances. He had alleged many associations between people in high places and organised international crime, implying that <span class="per">President Putin</span> and <span class="per">Romano Prodi</span> among others had been involved personally. He had sought political asylum in <span class="loc">UK</span> in <span class="date">2000</span> and became a naturalised citizen in <span class="date">October this year</span>, just <span class="date">weeks</span> before his death. <span class="per">Mr Litvinenko</span> was said to have been investigating the shooting of Russian journalist and human rights activist <span class="per">Anna Politkovskaya</span>, a well-known critic of Russian activities in <span class="loc">Chechnya</span>, in her apartment in <span class="loc">Moscow</span> <span class="date">October 7, 2006</span>. It is reported that he had met two Russians in an hotel room, one said to be former member of the KGB in connection with the affair and he went on to meet <span class="per">Mario Scaramella</span> at a sushi bar in <span class="loc">Piccadilly</span> where some papers were exchanged. Some hours after this he was taken ill. <span class="per">Mr Litvinenko</span> was admitted to <span class="org">Barnet General Hospital</span>, north <span class="loc">London</span> on <span class="date">November 1, 2006</span> complaining of feeling sick. By <span class="date">November 11</span>, he was said to be suffering from serious poisoning. <span class="date">A week later</span> he was transferred to University College Hospital in central <span class="loc">London</span>. <span class="date">A week later</span> he was said to have been poisoned by ingesting thallium, once used in rat poison, but, in the opinion of some doctors, there were signs of radioactive poisoning, including loss of weight and shedding of hair. Various explanations of his condition were offered. Last night he suffered a heart attack, after having left a message blaming <span class="per">President Putin</span> for having him killed. The radioactive isotope polonium-210 was found in his blood and urine as reported by the United Kingdom's Health Protection <span class="org">Agency</span>. The post-mortem was cancelled. Subsequently the <span class="org">Agency</span> examined conditions in the hospitals in which <span class="per">Mr Litvinenko</span> has been treated. Police visited the Itsu sushi restaurant in <span class="loc">Piccadilly</span>, his home in <span class="loc">Muswell Hill</span> and the Millennium Hotel, Grosvenor Square where the meeting on <span class="date">November 1</span> had been held. Traces of radiocactivity were found in all three places. It is speculated that the polonium was probably eaten by <span class="per">Litvinenko</span> as a substance that could be combined with a salt-like substance, such as polonium nitrate. It was reported that a meeting had been held in Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA) used for high level emergency planning and control, to consider the implications of these events. The Foreign Office asked <span class="loc">Moscow</span> for a response to the accusation of Russian involvement and <span class="per">President Putin</span> himself dismissed the allegations saying (before the cause of death had been established) that there was no proof of an unnatural death and that the case was being used as a "political provocation".</p><br><br>
