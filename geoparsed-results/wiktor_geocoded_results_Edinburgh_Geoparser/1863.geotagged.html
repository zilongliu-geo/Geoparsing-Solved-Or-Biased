<p><span class="loc">Farmington</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Tualatin River</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Willamette</span>, about eight miles southwest of <span class="loc">Beaverton</span>, at the intersection of <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 10 and River Road. It is about a mile west of the junction of OR 10 with <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 219. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> was one of the earliest settlements in <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and was prominent for a time as an important milling and grain-shipping point on the <span class="loc">Tualatin</span> when steamships were the principal means of shipping grain along the <span class="loc">Willamette River</span>. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> was the site of an early Christian Church, founded by 1845 pioneers in Sarah and Philip Harris, who arrived in <span class="loc">Oregon</span> via the Meek Cutoff. At that time the locale was called "Bridgeport". Baptisms were in the <span class="loc">Tualatin River</span>. Philip Harris began ferry service, which became known as the Harris-Landess Ferry, across the <span class="loc">Tualatin River</span>; he later built a bridge at the same location. Today there is modern bridge there named in his honor. In 1851 there was a post office named Harris Ferry at this locale; Philip Harris was the postmaster.</p>
