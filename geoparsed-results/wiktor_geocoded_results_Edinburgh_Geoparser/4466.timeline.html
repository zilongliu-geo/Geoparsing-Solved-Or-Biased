  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hanover</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hanover Township</span>, <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, along the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>. The population was 3,546 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Hanover</span> is the home of <span class="org">Hanover College</span>, a small Presbyterian liberal arts college. <span class="loc">Hanover</span> is also the home of <span class="org">Southwestern High School</span>. The "Point," located on the campus of <span class="org">Hanover College</span>, is the only place along the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> that three bends can be viewed in the river. During the late eighteenth century, the area <span class="date">today</span> known as the state of <span class="loc">Indiana</span> was a part of the Northwest Territory, which originally consisted of the later states of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, and parts of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. At that time, there were few European settlements on the northern bank of the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>. <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, on the southern banks of the <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, originally included as a part of Virginia, and in <span class="date">1792</span> granted statehood, was more densely settled by Europeans. It is likely that prior to the early nineteenth-century European settlement of the Hanover area, its predominant inhabitants were <span class="loc">Shawnee</span>. <span class="per">Captain George Logan</span> (<span class="date">1780</span>-<span class="date">May 12, 1875</span>) grew up in a farming household in the area of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. In the <span class="date">late winter</span> of <span class="date">1801</span>, young <span class="per">Logan</span> loaded a barge with produce and embarked on a journey westward on the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>, ultimately to sell the produce in <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. At the time, he later noted, there were no European settlements in the area between present-day <span class="loc">Carrollton</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> and <span class="loc">Louisville</span>. According to <span class="per">Logan</span>, both banks of the river were covered in thick forest. He also reported seeing Native American hunters and fishermen, a large number of buffalo and deer, and heard the cries of coyotes.</p><br><br>
