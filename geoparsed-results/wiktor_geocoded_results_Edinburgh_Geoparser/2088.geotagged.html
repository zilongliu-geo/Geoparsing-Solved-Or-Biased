<p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 21,720. The county seat is Madras. The county is named after <span class="loc">Mount Jefferson</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was created on December 12, 1914, from a portion of <span class="loc">Crook County</span>. The county owes much of its agricultural prosperity to the railroad, which links Madras with the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span>, and was completed in 1911, and to the development of irrigation projects in the late 1930s. The railroad was completed despite constant feuds and battles between two lines working on opposite sides of the <span class="loc">Deschutes</span> River. Madras was incorporated in 1911, and has been the permanent county seat since a general election in 1916. The first (temporary) county seat was <span class="loc">Culver</span>, which was selected by a three-man commission appointed by the governor. Due to repeated tie votes over several days (with one vote each cast for <span class="loc">Culver</span>, <span class="loc">Metolius</span> and Madras). The deadlock was eventually broken by allowing the <span class="loc">Metolius</span> Commissioner to post the tie-breaker, by voting for <span class="loc">Culver</span>. [1]</p>
