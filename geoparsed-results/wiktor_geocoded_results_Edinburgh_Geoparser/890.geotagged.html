<p><span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, settled in 1796. The town was a coach stop on the Cincinnati-Zanesville Road, later known as the <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> Pike, with an inn, two taverns, a grist mill and a carding mill to process its agricultural products. It would remain a rather sleepy hamlet until the 1960s when it became an affluent bedroom community for people working in <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>. It retains its historic downtown with many other 19th-century houses scattered throughout the community. It is currently accessed from exit 15 off Interstate 71 and exit 50 off Interstate 275, and it is the eastern terminus of the Ronald Reagan <span class="loc">Cross County</span> Highway about five miles northeast of the <span class="loc">Cincinnati city</span> line. The population was 10,251 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is located at 39°14′50″N 84°20′51″W (39.247359, -84.347556). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.30 square miles (13.73 km2), of which 5.29 square miles (13.70 km2) is land and 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2) is water. <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is one of the oldest settlements in <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>, almost as old as Columbia-Tusculum. A log cabin was the first tavern of the community; this was a resting place for teamsters and travelers on the main road. In 1806-7 a number of people from <span class="loc">Montgomery</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> settled around this point for trade and farming, and named the village for their former home.</p>
