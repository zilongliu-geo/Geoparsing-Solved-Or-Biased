  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Jefferson is a city in <span class="loc">Greene County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along the <span class="loc">North Raccoon River</span>. The population was 4,345 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Greene County</span>. It is the home of the <span class="org">Mahanay Memorial Bell Tower</span>, 168 feet (51 m) tall, located on the town square, and visible for miles. The tower is named for Floyd Mahanay, a philanthropist and former resident. Jefferson is bisected east to west by the old Lincoln Highway (formerly <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 30). A new <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 30 is located about one mile to the north. While platted and settled <span class="date">a few years earlier</span>, "<span class="loc">New Jefferson</span>" was organized in the <span class="date">winter of 1855</span>â€“56 and officially incorporated in <span class="date">January 1872</span>. It began as a farming community and remains so <span class="date">today</span>. The first settlers of the new city were the family of <span class="per">George S. Walton</span> who built there in <span class="date">1855</span>. During the Civil War, Jefferson as well as <span class="loc">Greene County</span> contributed its sons to raising Company H, 10th <span class="loc">Iowa</span> Infantry (<span class="date">1861</span>) and Company E, 39th <span class="loc">Iowa</span> Infantry (<span class="date">1862</span>). The railway came to Jefferson in the <span class="date">decades</span> after the Civil War. Jefferson's first mayor was Mahlon Head, elected in <span class="date">1872</span>. Jefferson's library was completed in <span class="date">1904</span> through the generosity of the <span class="loc">Carnegie</span> library fund. The stretch of Lincoln Highway that runs through Jefferson was completed circa <span class="date">1924</span>.</p><br><br>
