<p><span class="loc">Grant County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Washington</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 89,120. The county seat is Ephrata, and the largest city is <span class="loc">Moses Lake</span>. The county was formed out of <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> on February 24, 1909 and is named for <span class="loc">U.S.</span> President Ulysses S. Grant. <span class="loc">Grant County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Moses Lake</span>, <span class="loc">WA</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. Native American cultures in the area included the Interior Salish, Wenatchi, <span class="loc">Okanagan</span>. The first white settlers began to arrive in the mid-to-late-19th century, primarily with the goal of raising livestock. One government official described the area in 1879 as, "â€¦a desolation where even the most hopeful can find nothing in its future prospects to cheer." When railroads arrived they also brought new settlers, and the economy began a shift from ranching to dryland farming. This transition required the people to have ready access to water, and irrigation became a necessity. The first large-scale irrigation attempts began in 1898, but it would be years before real success. With the influx of dryland farming, the county soon boasted access to three major railway systems; the Great Northern Railway, Northern Pacific Railroad and the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Milwaukee</span> &amp; St. Paul Railroad. In addition, the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span> in this area was navigable. This allowed crops to be transported out of the area easily. Towns like Wilson's Creek, Quincy and Ephrata began to thrive.</p>
