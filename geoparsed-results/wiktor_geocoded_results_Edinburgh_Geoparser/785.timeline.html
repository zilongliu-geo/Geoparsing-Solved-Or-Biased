  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Zaragoza</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [saɾaˈɣosa]) is a municipality in the Chimaltenango department of <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>. The early name of the valley where <span class="loc">Zaragoza</span> is located was Chicaj, which evolved into Chicoj or Chixoc, which in kakchiquel means "<span class="per">Francisco Oj</span>", who was the kakchikel chief who owner the land in <span class="date">1711</span>. It was also known as the "Peach Valley". In <span class="date">1761</span> several Spanish families wanted to move to that place and commissioned several members to get government approval; once the permission was granted, the villa was called "<span class="per">Valle de Nuestra</span> Señora del <span class="per">Pilar de Heredia</span>" (English:"Our Lady of the Pond of <span class="loc">Heredia</span> Valley)". One of the earliest references to the town during the Spanish Colony can be found in <span class="per">Compendio de la Historia</span> de la <span class="loc">Ciudad de Guatemala</span> (English:Brief account of <span class="loc">Guatemala City</span> history) who in <span class="date">1818</span> wrote Domingo Juarros. He pointed out that the Spanish villa belong to Patzicía's "curato" in the mayor municipality of <span class="loc">Chimaltenango</span>. After the independence of Central <span class="loc">America</span> in <span class="date">1821</span>, <span class="org">the Constitution of the State</span> of <span class="loc">Guatemala</span> from <span class="date">11 October 1825</span>, specified the town in the territory, and the villa appeared in Circuit #8 (Sacatepéquez), within <span class="loc">Chimaltenango</span> and then, by the Constitutional Assembly of <span class="date">1839</span>, the town was assigned to <span class="org">Chimaltenango Department</span>. Finally, by an executive action of <span class="date">27 January 1892</span>, the town was elevated to municipality, and its name was changed to "<span class="loc">Zaragoza</span>" because most of the Spanish people who lived there was from <span class="loc">Zaragoza</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>.</p><br><br>
