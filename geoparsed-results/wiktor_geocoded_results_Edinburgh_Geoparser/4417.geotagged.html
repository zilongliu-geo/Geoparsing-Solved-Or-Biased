<p><span class="loc">Clarke County</span> is a county in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 14,034. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Berryville</span>. <span class="loc">Clarke County</span> is included in the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, <span class="loc">DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The first settlement of the <span class="loc">Virginia Colony</span> in the future <span class="loc">Clarke County</span> was in 1736 by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron who built a home, <span class="loc">Greenway Court</span>, on part of his 5 million acre (20,000 kmÂ²) property, near what is now the village of <span class="loc">White Post</span>. <span class="loc">White Post</span> was named for the large signpost pointing the way to Lord Fairfax's home. As it lay just west of the Blue Ridge border demarcated under Governor Spotswood at <span class="loc">Albany</span> in 1722, the area was claimed along with the rest of the <span class="loc">Shenandoah</span> Valley by the Six Nations Iroquois (who had overrun it during the later Beaver Wars in around 1672), until the Treaty of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> in 1744, when it was purchased from them by Governor Gooch. Many of the early settlers of what became <span class="loc">Clarke County</span> were children of Tidewater planters, who settled on large land grants from Lord Fairfax. Two-thirds of the county was settled by the plantation group, and the plantation lifestyle thrived until the Civil War. County status came in 1836 when it was divided off from <span class="loc">Frederick County</span>. <span class="loc">Clarke</span> was known for its large crops of wheat.</p>
