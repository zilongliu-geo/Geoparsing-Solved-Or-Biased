  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Las Animas</span> is the Statutory City that is the county seat and the only incorporated municipality in <span class="loc">Bent County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city population was <span class="date">2410</span> at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. <span class="loc">Las Animas</span> is located in southeast <span class="loc">Colorado</span> east of Pueblo, near the historic Bent's Fort. <span class="loc">Las Animas</span> is located on the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River, just west of its confluence with the <span class="loc">Purgatoire River</span> (or "Purgatory River"). A famous legend says that the town and the <span class="loc">Purgatoire River</span> were named for a group of conquistadors, probably part of Coronado's expedition, who died without the last rites sacrament of a priest. According to Catholic belief, their souls would go to Purgatory as a result. The original Spanish name for <span class="loc">Las Animas</span> ("The Souls," in Spanish) was purported to be <span class="loc">La Ciudad</span> de <span class="loc">Las Animas</span> Perdidos en <span class="loc">Purgatorio</span>, "The city of lost souls in Purgatory." According to the book <span class="loc">Trinidad</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span> Territory by <span class="loc">Morris</span> <span class="per">F. Taylor</span>, this explanation is not consistent with Spanish Catholic belief. Souls in purgatory are not lost; they are in limbo for <span class="date">a short time</span> of purification before ascending to heaven. According to <span class="per">Taylor</span>, the French developed the connotation of souls in Purgatory.</p><br><br>
