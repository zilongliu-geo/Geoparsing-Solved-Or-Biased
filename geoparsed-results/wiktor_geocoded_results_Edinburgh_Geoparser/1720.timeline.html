  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Sagadahoc County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,042 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Home to Reid State Park, the town is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Located on an island accessible by car from the mainland, <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> includes the villages of <span class="loc">Five Islands</span>, <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>, <span class="loc">Bay Point</span>, <span class="loc">Marrtown</span>, <span class="loc">West Georgetown</span> and <span class="loc">Robinhood</span>. It is a popular tourist destination. Abenaki Indians called the island Erascohegan, meaning "good spear-fishing." <span class="per">John Parker</span>, a fisherman from <span class="loc">Bedfordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, purchased it in <span class="date">1649</span> from Chief <span class="per">Mowhotiwormet</span>, commonly known as Chief <span class="per">Robinhood</span>, for a hogshead of rum and some pumpkins. <span class="per">Parker</span> built the first permanent homestead on what eventually became known as <span class="per">Parker</span>'s Island. The <span class="loc">Kennebec River</span> valley was attacked and burned in <span class="date">1676</span> during <span class="per">King Philip</span>'s War, then again in <span class="date">1689</span> at the outset of <span class="per">King William</span>'s War, and was not resettled until after the <span class="date">1713</span> Treaty of <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>. The town of Newtown-on-Arrowsic was rebuilt in <span class="date">1714</span> on the southern end of <span class="loc">Arrowsic Island</span>, which was incorporated in <span class="date">1716</span> by the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> as Georgetown-on-Arrowsic, named for Fort <span class="loc">St. George</span>. The town's boundaries were extended to encompass <span class="per">Parker</span>'s Island, <span class="loc">Woolwich</span>, <span class="loc">Phippsburg</span> and Bath (which included <span class="loc">West Bath</span>). Abandoned during <span class="org">Dummer's War</span> and beleaguered during the French and Indian Wars, the region resettled slowly in the 1750s until peace was assured with the <span class="date">1759</span> Fall of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>.</p><br><br>
