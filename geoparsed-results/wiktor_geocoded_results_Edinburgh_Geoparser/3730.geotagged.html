<p>Nora is an ancient Roman and pre-Roman town placed on a peninsula near <span class="loc">Pula</span>, near to <span class="loc">Cagliari</span> in <span class="loc">Sardinia</span>. According to legend, Nora was founded by a group of Iberians from Tartessus led by Norax, a mythological hero (the son of Eriteide and the god <span class="loc">Hermes</span>). It is believed to be the first town founded in <span class="loc">Sardinia</span> and to have been settled by the ancient Sherden or the Nuraghi people, and later colonized by Phoenicians. The Nora Stone, a Phoenician inscription found at Nora in 1773, has been dated by palaeographic methods to between the late 9th century and early 8th century BCE, and has been interpreted as referring to a Phoenician military victory and conquest of the area. After a period of domination by <span class="loc">Carthage</span> the town came under Roman control after the conquest of <span class="loc">Sardinia</span> in 238 BC. It went into decline from the 4th century AD and appears to have been abandoned during the 8th century. Nora was an important trading town in its time, with two protected harbours, one on each side of the peninsula. Several different building styles can be seen in the excavated buildings.</p>
