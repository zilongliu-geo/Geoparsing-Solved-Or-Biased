  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Montgomery</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Chatham County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,523 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Savannah Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="per">Montgomery</span> is located south of the center of <span class="loc">Chatham County</span> at 31°56′36″N 81°6′24″W (31.943237, -81.106648). It occupies a neck of land bordered on the west by the <span class="loc">Vernon River</span>, on the east by the Moon River, and on the south by the <span class="loc">Burnside River</span>, all of which are tidal. The northeast border of the CDP is formed by <span class="loc">Georgia</span> SR 204 Spur, which leads to <span class="loc">Skidaway Island</span>. Downtown Savannah is 13 miles (21 km) north of the <span class="per">Montgomery</span> town center. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 6.1 square miles (15.7 km2), of which 5.2 square miles (13.5 km2) is land and 0.85 square miles (2.2 km2), or 13.94%, is water. <span class="per">Montgomery</span> is believed to be the location of an early settlement in the Savannah area (prior to <span class="per">General Oglethorpe</span>'s land grant in <span class="date">1733</span>) founded by three brothers, <span class="per">William, James</span>, and <span class="per">Robert Montgomery</span>, who were baronets, under a land grant of <span class="date">1677</span>. They failed to maintain a permanent settlement, due to poor location and disease, and so lost the English land grant. The brothers moved to the more established <span class="loc">Virginia Colony</span>. The name of the settlement continues in this area of Savannah as well as <span class="loc">Montgomery Street</span> and <span class="loc">Montgomery Crossroad</span>.</p><br><br>
