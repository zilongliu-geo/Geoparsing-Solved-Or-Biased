<p>Lodi /ˈloʊd.aɪ/ LOHD-eye is a city located in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Joaquin County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, in the northern portion of <span class="loc">California</span>'s Central Valley. The population was 62,134 at the 2010 census. Its estimated population as of July 1, 2013 was 63,338. <span class="loc">Lodi</span> is best known for being a center of wine production (the "Zinfandel Capital of the World"), although its vintages have traditionally been less prestigious than those of <span class="loc">Sonoma</span> and <span class="loc">Napa</span> counties. However, in recent years, the Lodi Appellation has become increasingly respected for its Zinfandel wine and other eclectic varietals. National recognition came from the Creedence Clearwater Revival song "Lodi." Nearby <span class="loc">Woodbridge</span> is the home of the well known winery, <span class="loc">Woodbridge</span> by Robert Mondavi. Mondavi grew up in <span class="loc">Lodi</span>, and Mondavi Winery is considered one of the most influential in the American wine industry. <span class="loc">Lodi</span> gained international attention in 2005 when local residents <span class="loc">Hamid</span> and <span class="loc">Umer</span> <span class="loc">Hayat</span> were arrested and charged in the first terrorism trial in the state of <span class="loc">California</span>. When a group of local families decided to establish a school in 1859, they settled on a site near present-day <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> Lane and Turner Road. In 1869, the Central Pacific Railroad was in the process of creating a new route, and pioneer settlers Ezekiel Lawrence, Reuben Wardrobe, A.C. Ayers and John <span class="loc">Magley</span> offered a townsite of 160 acres (0.65 km2) to the railroad as an incentive to build a station there. The railroad received a "railroad reserve" of 12 acres (49,000 m2) in the middle of town, and surveyors began laying out streets in the area between <span class="loc">Washington</span> to Church and Locust to Walnut. Settlers flocked from nearby <span class="loc">Woodbridge</span>, <span class="loc">Liberty City</span>, and <span class="loc">Galt</span>, including town founders John M. Burt and Dan Crist.</p>
