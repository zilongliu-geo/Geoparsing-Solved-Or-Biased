<p><span class="loc">Beaconsfield</span> /ˈbɛkənzfiːld/ is a market town and civil parish within the South Bucks district in <span class="loc">Buckinghamshire</span> centred 23.6 miles (38 km) WNW of <span class="loc">London</span> and 17 miles (27 km) SSE of the county's administrative town, <span class="loc">Aylesbury</span>. Four towns are within five miles: Slough, <span class="loc">Amersham</span>, <span class="loc">Gerrards Cross</span> and <span class="loc">High Wycombe</span>. The town is adjacent to the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and has a wide area of Georgian, neo-Georgian and Tudor revival high street architecture, known as the <span class="loc">Old Town</span>. It is celebrated for the first model village in the world and, in education, a direction and technical production institute, the National Film and Television School. The parish comprises <span class="loc">Beaconsfield</span> town and land mainly given over arable land. Some beech forest remains to supply an established beech furniture industry in <span class="loc">High Wycombe</span>, the making of modal and various artisan uses. <span class="loc">Beaconsfield</span> is recorded in property returns of 1185 where it is spelt Bekenesfeld, literally beechen field which would less archaically be read as 'clearing in the beeches'. Nearby <span class="loc">Burnham Beeches</span> is a forest named after the beech genus.</p>
