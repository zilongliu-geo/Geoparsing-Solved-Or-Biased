<p><span class="loc">Jawa</span> is the site of the oldest urban development in <span class="loc">Jordan</span>, dating from the late 4th millennium BC. It is located in one of the dryest areas of the Eastern Jordanian desert. The nearest dependable water is 60 km South-East at <span class="loc">Azraq</span>. Some contacts with the late stages of Uruk culture just before 3000 BC are indicated. The town was built by a group of perhaps 2,000 migrants coming from the North or East. They had some understanding of urban life, as well as hydrology. It extended over 100,000 m2 and consisted of a walled town and extensive earthworks to divert winter floods from the Wadi into a series of reservoirs. This work would have had to be completed by the first winter after the groups arrival; otherwise they would not have survived the following summer. It is estimated the work would have taken a minimum workforce of 700. The population had large herds of sheep, goats and some cattle. Estimates based on bone counts indicate there may have been as many as 10,000 sheep and goats as well as 800 cattle. There were also 200 equids and 160 dogs. From seed remains it is apparent that some of the water was also used for irrigation agriculture. The inhabitants ate barley, wheat, chickpeas, lentils and grapes.</p>
