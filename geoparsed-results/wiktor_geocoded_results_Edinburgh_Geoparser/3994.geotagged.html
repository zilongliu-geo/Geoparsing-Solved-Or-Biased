<p>Villa de Arevalo commonly known as simply Villa or Arevalo is one of the seven districts of <span class="loc">Iloilo City</span>, in the Philippine <span class="loc">province of Iloilo</span>. It was originally founded as La <span class="loc">Villa Rica</span> de Arévalo by a Spanish official who built his mansion along the coastal settlement in the 16th century. It was absorbed by <span class="loc">Iloílo City</span> during the 20th century along with the towns of <span class="loc">Mandurriao</span>, <span class="loc">La Paz</span>, <span class="loc">Molo</span> and the <span class="loc">city of Jaro</span>. Its church possesses the third oldest Santo Niño (Infant Jesus) figurines in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. Arevalo is sometimes given the title "Flower Capital of <span class="loc">Iloilo</span>",where potted plants, flowers, bouquets, wreaths can be bought. Arevalo is also famous for its firecrackers and fireworks. Its prominent attraction is the Villa Beach along the coast which boasts several resorts and an outdoor nightlife such as open air restaurants and bars. Established on 1581 by Gobernador Ronquillo de Peñalosa as "La <span class="loc">Villa Rica</span> de Arevalo", named after his hometown Arévalo, <span class="loc">Spain</span>, it is one of the first places in the Philippine archipelago to be named in Spanish. It became the capital of the settlement in the province on 1582. It was invaded by the British in 1588 and followed by more raids by <span class="loc">Moros</span> in 1600 and by the Dutch in 1609, 1614 and 1616. The continuous raids forced the capital to be relocated near the mouth of <span class="loc">Iloilo River</span>, which is the current location of <span class="loc">Iloilo City</span> Proper. It was incorporated as a district of <span class="loc">Iloilo City</span> on July 16, 1937.</p>
