<p><span class="loc">Madison County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 37,536. The county seat and largest city is <span class="loc">Rexburg</span>. <span class="loc">Madison County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Rexburg</span>, <span class="loc">ID</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Idaho Falls-Rexburg-Blackfoot, ID Combined Statistical Area. The area was originally settled by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). Before February 1913, the county was part of neighboring <span class="loc">Fremont County</span>. The newly established county was named for American president James Madison. BYU-Idaho, formerly Ricks College (named after early local LDS settler Thomas Edwin Ricks) is located here. <span class="loc">Madison County</span> was declared a national disaster area after the <span class="loc">Teton</span> Dam flood of June 5, 1976. Similar to other <span class="loc">Idaho counties</span>, an elected three-member county commission heads the county government. Other elected officials include clerk, treasurer, sheriff, assessor, coroner, and prosecutor. With a strongly conservative and Mormon population, <span class="loc">Madison County</span> is one of the most staunchly Republican counties in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Since 1980 no Republican presidential candidate has failed to carry the county with less than 59 percent of the vote. In that same period Republican presidential candidates polled more than 90 percent of the county's vote on three occasions, Ronald Reagan in 1984, George W. Bush in 2004, and Mitt Romney in 2012. John McCain came close to this level in 2008, drawing 85 percent of the vote.</p>
