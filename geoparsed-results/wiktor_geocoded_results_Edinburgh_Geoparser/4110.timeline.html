  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is a county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 15,279. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Floyd</span>. <span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is included in the Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford, <span class="loc">VA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Floyd County</span>'s recorded history begins with the arrival of traders, trappers and hunters in Southwest Virginia in the 18th century. The earliest known travel way through present day <span class="loc">Floyd County</span> was the Trader's Path, running from east to west across the <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> River where <span class="loc">Back Creek</span> enters the river, by <span class="per">John Mason</span>'s, <span class="per">R. Poage</span>'s, the headwaters of <span class="loc">Back Creek</span> and southwest over <span class="loc">Bent Mountain</span>. The trail continued westward through the <span class="loc">Little River</span> area to the Lead Mines. The first known attempts to settle the area appear to have been made during the 1740s. In <span class="date">1745</span> the <span class="org">Virginia Council</span> granted <span class="per">James Patton</span>, of <span class="loc">Augusta County</span>, among others, 100,000 acres (400 km2) on the <span class="loc">New River</span> and the westward flowing waters, including the <span class="loc">Little River</span> area. In <span class="date">1749</span> the Royal Company of Virginia also received a grant on the westward flowing waters, putting the two companies in competition with one another to settle the area. The first surveying of the land occurred in the late 1740s.</p><br><br>
