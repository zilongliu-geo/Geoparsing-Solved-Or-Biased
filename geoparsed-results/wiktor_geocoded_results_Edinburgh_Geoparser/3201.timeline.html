  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Warren</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Macomb County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The <span class="date">2010</span> census places the city's population at 134,056, making <span class="per">Warren</span> the largest city in <span class="loc">Macomb County</span>, the third largest city in <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, and Metro <span class="loc">Detroit</span>'s largest suburb. The city is home to a wide variety of businesses, including General Motors Technical Center, the United States Army <span class="loc">Detroit</span> Arsenal, home of the United States Army <span class="org">TACOM Life Cycle Management Command</span> and the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC), the headquarters of <span class="org">Big Boy Restaurants International</span>, and Asset Acceptance. The current mayor is <span class="per">James R. Fouts</span>, who was elected to his first mayoral term in <span class="date">November 2007</span>. Beebe's Corners, the original settlement in what would become the <span class="loc">city of Warren</span>, was founded in <span class="date">1830</span> at the corner of Mound Road and Chicago Road; its first resident was <span class="per">Charles Groesbeck</span>. Beebe's Corners was a carriage stop between <span class="loc">Detroit</span> and <span class="loc">Utica</span>, and included a distillery, mill, tavern, and trading post. It was not until <span class="date">1837</span> that the now-defunct <span class="per">Warren</span> Township was organized around the settlement, first under the name Hickory, then renamed <span class="loc">Aba</span> in <span class="date">April 1838</span>, and finally renamed <span class="per">Warren</span> shortly thereafter. It was named for War of <span class="date">1812</span> veteran, and frontier cleric, <span class="per">Rev. Abel Warren</span>. However, when it was originally organized the township was named for <span class="per">Rev. Warren</span> who was a Methodist Episcopal preacher who left his native <span class="loc">New York</span> in <span class="date">1824</span> for Shelby Township. He went throughout the present-day <span class="loc">Macomb</span>, <span class="loc">Lapeer</span>, <span class="loc">Oakland</span>, and St. <span class="loc">Clair Counties</span>, baptizing, marrying, and burying pioneers of the area, as well as establishing congregations and preaching extensively. He was the first licensed preacher in the State of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>.</p><br><br>
