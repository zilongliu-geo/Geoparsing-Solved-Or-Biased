<p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is a village in Dane (mostly) and <span class="loc">Jefferson counties</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. The population was 1,457 at the 2010 census. Of this, 1,348 were in <span class="loc">Dane County</span>, and 109 were in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>. The <span class="loc">Dane County</span> portion of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Madison Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, while the <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> portion is part of the Watertownâ€“Fort Atkinson Micropolitan Statistical Area. Cambridge settlement dates back to October 15, 1847 when farmer Joseph Keyes filed plans with the Register of Deeds of <span class="loc">Dane County</span>. The first structure in the area was a dam on the northern part of the <span class="loc">Koshkonong</span> River. By the late 1880s, <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> had grown into a community of about 700 people with shops, hotels, and a post office. Future inventor Ole Evenrude lived there. In 1890 a devastating fire broke out, destroying most of the businesses and parts of Main Street. The town was rebuilt by 1910, following the fire, and the invention of the automobile ignited tourism and nearby Lake Ripley became a destination for many Chicago travelers. During the 1980s-1990s, <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> was known as the "salt glaze pottery capital of the world" because of the potteries located there.</p>
