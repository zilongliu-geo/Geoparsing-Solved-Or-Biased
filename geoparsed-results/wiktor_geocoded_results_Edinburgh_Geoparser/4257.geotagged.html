<p><span class="loc">Croydon</span> is a large town in <span class="loc">south London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, the principal settlement of the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Croydon</span>. It is located 9.5 miles (15.3 km) south of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. It is one of the largest commercial districts outside of Central London, bearing one of the largest shopping districts and a developed night-time economy. It is identified in the London Plan as one of 11 metropolitan centres in <span class="loc">Greater London</span>. It has a population of 52,104 in the 2011 census, comprising the <span class="loc">Addiscombe</span>, <span class="loc">Broad Green</span> and <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> wards. Historically a part of <span class="loc">Surrey</span>, at the time of the Norman conquest of <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">Croydon</span> had a church, a mill, and around 365 inhabitants, as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. <span class="loc">Croydon</span> expanded during the Middle Ages as a market town and a centre for charcoal production, leather tanning and brewing. The Surrey Iron Railway from <span class="loc">Croydon</span> to <span class="loc">Wandsworth</span> opened in 1803 and was the world's first public railway. Later nineteenth century railway building facilitated <span class="loc">Croydon</span>'s growth as a commuter town for <span class="loc">London</span> (including the <span class="loc">City of London</span>). By the early 20th century, <span class="loc">Croydon</span> was an important industrial area, known for car manufacture, metal working and its airport. In the mid 20th century these sectors were replaced by retailing and the service economy, brought about by massive redevelopment which saw the rise of office blocks and the Whitgift Centre, for many decades the largest shopping centre in <span class="loc">London</span> until 2008. <span class="loc">Croydon</span> was amalgamated into <span class="loc">Greater London</span> in 1965.</p>
