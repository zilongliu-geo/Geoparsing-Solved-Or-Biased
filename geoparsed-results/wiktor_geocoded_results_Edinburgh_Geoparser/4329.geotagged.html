<p><span class="loc">Nashville</span> (also known as Nashville-on-the-Brazos) was a community on the southeast bank of the <span class="loc">Brazos River</span> in present-day <span class="loc">Milam County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is now a ghost town. The town was surveyed in the fall of 1835 with Sterling C. Robertson as its founder. It was named in honor of <span class="loc">Nashville</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, Robertson's birthplace. The town served as the headquarters for Robertson's Colony. In January 1836, the settlement was attacked by Indians in the area. Two people were killed. This led to the formation of Sterling C. Robertson's Ranger Company. The rangers constructed Fort Milam at the falls of the <span class="loc">Brazos</span> and a second at the three forks of the <span class="loc">Little River</span>. <span class="loc">Nashville</span> was also designated the seat of justice for Milam municipality in 1836. Following the <span class="loc">Texas Revolution</span>, <span class="loc">Nashville</span> was considered by the <span class="loc">Texas</span> Congress as a possible site for the capital of the Republic of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. From 1837 to 1846, the town served as the <span class="loc">Milam County</span> seat. It began to slowly decline after 1846, when the state legislature moved the county seat to Cameron. In 1868, the arrival of the <span class="loc">Houston</span> and Texas Central Railroad at nearby <span class="loc">Hearne</span> provided the remaining residents with the incentive to move. The town's post office closed that same year.</p>
