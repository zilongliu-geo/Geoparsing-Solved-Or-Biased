  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Polk County</span> is a county located in the State of <span class="loc">Florida</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 602,095. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Bartow</span>, and its largest city is <span class="loc">Lakeland</span>. <span class="loc">Polk County</span> comprises the Lakeland-Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area. In <span class="date">2010</span>, the center of population of <span class="loc">Florida</span> was located in <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, near the city of <span class="loc">Lake Wales</span>. <span class="loc">Polk County</span> is home to one public university, one state college, and four private universities. One Fortune 500 company – <span class="org">Publix Super Markets</span> (106 in <span class="date">2012</span>)—has headquarters in the county. The first people to call <span class="loc">Polk County</span> home arrived close to <span class="date">12,000 years ago</span> during the last ice age as the first paleo-indians following big game southward arrived on the peninsula of <span class="loc">Florida</span>. By this time, the peninsula had gone through several expansions and contractions due to changing sea level; at times the peninsula was much wider than it is <span class="date">today</span>, while at other times it was almost entirely submerged with only a few small islands exposed. These first paleo-indians, nomadic hunter/gatherers who did not establish any permanent settlements, eventually gave way to the "archaic people", the ancestors of the Indians who came in contact with the Spaniards when they arrived on the peninsula. These Indians thrived on the peninsula and it is estimated that there were over 250,000 in <span class="date">1492</span> when <span class="loc">Columbus</span> set sail for the <span class="loc">New World</span>. As was common elsewhere, contact with Europeans had a devastating effect on the Indians. Smallpox, measles, and other diseases, to which the Indians had no immunity, caused widespread epidemic and death. Those who had not succumbed to diseases such as these were often either killed or enslaved as Spanish explorers and settlers arrived. Within a few hundred <span class="date">years</span>, nearly the entire pre-columbian population of <span class="loc">Polk County</span> had been wiped out. The remnants of these Indians joined with refugee Creek Indians from <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and The <span class="loc">Carolinas</span> to form the Seminole Indian Tribe.</p><br><br>
