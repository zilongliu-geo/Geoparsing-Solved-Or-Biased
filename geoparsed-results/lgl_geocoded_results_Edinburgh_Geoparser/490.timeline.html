  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Investors flock to buy California bonds. SACRAMENTO â€” Investors <span class="date">this week</span> flocked to California's first major bond sale in <span class="date">nine months</span>, a development that will soon free up billions of dollars for public works projects put on hold because of the state's budget mess. State Treasurer <span class="per">Bill Lockyer</span> announced that the state sold $6.54 billion in general obligation bonds on <span class="date">Monday</span> and <span class="date">Tuesday</span>, easily surpassing a $4 billion target he had set going into the sale. His office said <span class="date">late Tuesday</span> it was the largest long-term general obligation bond sale "ever in the country." The tax-exempt bonds carry yields ranging from 3.2 to 6.1 percent, depending on when they mature (from <span class="date">2013</span> to <span class="date">2038</span>). "This is a great result for California's workers, businesses and economy," <span class="per">Lockyer</span> said in a statement. <span class="loc">California</span> has been shut out of the debt market because of its budget mess and the tight national credit market. And without the ability to sell bonds, the state was forced to freeze about $2.6 billion in financing since <span class="date">December</span> for more than 5,000 infrastructure projects. With the deficit addressed for the time being with the plan signed by Gov. <span class="per">Arnold Schwarzenegger</span> <span class="date">last month</span>, officials said recently that they expect soon to unfreeze $500 million in infrastructure funds that had been put on hold. But after <span class="date">this week</span>'s sale, they are expected to unlock an additional $2.6 billion for public works projects, although it could take <span class="date">several weeks</span> to disburse the money. <span class="per">Roxanne Miller</span>, a lobbyist for the city of <span class="loc">San Jose</span>, said that can't happen soon enough. Dozens of projects in <span class="loc">San Jose</span> are awaiting financing from the state's so-called <span class="org">Pooled Money Investment Account</span>, including a $15 million traffic light synchronization project; $5.5 million for improvements to public trails; and several million dollars for affordable housing projects. With the state's finances in shambles, <span class="loc">San Jose</span> has had to front the money to keep many of those projects going, <span class="per">Miller</span> said. But that can continue only for so long. "We're getting to the point where everyone needs some indication, some certainty that the money will be there," she said. Miller added that a $10 million project to upgrade Highway 101 at Tully Road, scheduled to begin construction within <span class="date">months</span>, will be put on hold if state infrastructure funds aren't unleashed soon. She called the successful bond sale "a big deal for all of us." The state's move to freeze infrastructure funds was at odds not only with <span class="per">Schwarzenegger</span>'s stated priorities but with the federal stimulus package approved <span class="date">last month</span>. <span class="date">Last week</span>, the governor held a news conference to tout 57 projects in line to receive the first injection of federal stimulus dollars for transportation, totaling $626 million. Santa <span class="loc">Clara County</span> projects on that list include $33 million for a rehab of Highway 280 from the Cypress Avenue pedestrian over-crossing to Tantau Avenue, and maintenance of a stretch of Highway 35 near <span class="loc">Los Gatos</span>.</p><br><br>
