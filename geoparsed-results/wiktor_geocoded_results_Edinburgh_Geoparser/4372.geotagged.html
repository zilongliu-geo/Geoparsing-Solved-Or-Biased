<p>Clovis is a city in <span class="loc">Fresno County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The 2014 population was estimated to be 102,189. Clovis is located 6.5 miles (10.5 km) northeast of downtown <span class="loc">Fresno</span>, at an elevation of 361 feet (110 m). The <span class="loc">city of Clovis</span> began as a freight stop along the San Joaquin Valley Railroad. Organized on January 15, 1890, by Fresno businessmen Thomas E. Hughes, Fulton Berry, Gilbert R. Osmun, H.D. Colson, John D. Gray, and William M. Williams, in partnership with Michigan railroad speculator Marcus Pollasky, the SJVRR began construction in <span class="loc">Fresno</span> on July 4, 1891, and reached the farmlands of Clovis Cole and George Owen by October of that year. The railroad purchased right-of-way from both farmers, half from each – the east side from Cole and the west side from Owen – and ran tracks up the borderline between the two properties. The railroad agreed to establish a station on the west side of the tracks and to call it "Clovis". The Clovis station, after which the town was named, was positioned on the Owen side of the track.</p>
