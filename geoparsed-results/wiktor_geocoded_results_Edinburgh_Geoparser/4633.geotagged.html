<p><span class="loc">Zelenogorsk</span> (Russian: Зеленого́рск; before 1948 <span class="loc">Terijoki</span>, a name still used in Finnish and Swedish), is a municipal town in <span class="loc">Kurortny District</span> of the federal <span class="loc">city of St. Petersburg</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located in part of the <span class="loc">Karelian Isthmus</span> on the shore of the <span class="loc">Gulf of Finland</span>. Population: 14,958 (2010 Census); 12,074 (2002 Census); 13,032 (1989 Census). It has a station on the St. Petersburg-Vyborg railroad. It is located about 50 kilometers (31 mi) northwest of central <span class="loc">Saint Petersburg</span>. From 1323 to 1721 the Zelenogorsk area was a part of <span class="loc">Sweden</span>. It was ceded to <span class="loc">Russia</span> in 1721, becoming "Old <span class="loc">Finland</span>", which again was united with the Grand-Duchy of <span class="loc">Finland</span> in 1811. Until 1917, <span class="loc">Terijoki</span> was part of the Grand-Duchy of <span class="loc">Finland</span>, ruled by the Grand Dukes of <span class="loc">Finland</span>, who were the Tsars of <span class="loc">Russia</span>, (1812–1917). Even though all of <span class="loc">Finland</span> was part of the Russian Empire, a customs border was located at <span class="loc">Terijoki</span>. A valid Passport was needed for crossing the border between <span class="loc">Russia</span> and the Grand Duchy of <span class="loc">Finland</span>.</p>
