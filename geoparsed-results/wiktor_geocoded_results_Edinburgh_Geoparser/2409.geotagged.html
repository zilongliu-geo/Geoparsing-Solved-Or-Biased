<p>Jefferson is a village in <span class="loc">Ashtabula County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,120 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Ashtabula County</span>. Modern-day Jefferson sports the world's only perambulator museum and a historical complex including several restored 19th-century buildings. Joshua Giddings' law office has also been restored as a museum. Annual village events include the <span class="loc">Ashtabula County</span> Fair, the Strawberry Festival, Jefferson Days, and the Covered Bridge Festival. Jefferson was officially founded by Gideon Granger—U.S. Postmaster General during Thomas Jefferson's administration—in 1803. He envisioned the new settlement as a "Philadelphia of the West," and early plans for the village were based upon the layout of that city. A cabin was erected by Granger's agent in 1804, but the settlement's first permanent residents arrived only in 1805: the Samuel Wilson family. Wilson, misled by land agents, moved to <span class="loc">Ohio</span> in late autumn expecting to find a thriving <span class="loc">city on Granger</span>'s land. Instead, he found a wilderness, broken only by trees emblazoned with Philadelphian street names, marking where future streets would be built. Wilson himself died after two weeks of herculean effort to prepare for the winter, but his family stayed on as the first citizens of Jefferson.</p>
