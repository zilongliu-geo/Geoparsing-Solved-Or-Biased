  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Miramar</span> is a small seaside village near the towns of <span class="loc">Gulpilhares</span> and <span class="loc">Arcozelo</span>, in the municipality of <span class="loc">Vila Nova de Gaia</span>, in the subregion of Greater <span class="loc">Porto</span>, <span class="loc">Portugal</span> (Grande <span class="loc">Porto</span>). It is an upmarket residential area south of the river <span class="loc">Douro</span>, most known for its beach – <span class="per">Praia de Miramar</span> (<span class="per">Miramar</span> Beach) – and the small chapel called Senhor da <span class="loc">Pedra</span> (Lord of the Rock), which forms the central attraction of a yearly festival. This chapel is also featured in the film clip "<span class="loc">San Simon</span>", directed by Richard Tomes with music by the <span class="per">Pikoul</span> Sisters. Indeed, <span class="per">Miramar</span> is home to a number of artists and intellectuals, including <span class="per">Marina Pikoul</span>, <span class="per">David Wyn Lloyd</span>, <span class="loc">Lars</span> <span class="per">Wessman</span> and <span class="per">Diane</span> <span class="loc">Braz</span>, amongst others. There are many large houses and mansions in <span class="per">Miramar</span>, as well as in the nearby <span class="loc">Praia da Aguda</span> and <span class="loc">Praia da Granja</span>. Along the beach there are several cafés ("esplanadas"). Despite its pleasant location, <span class="per">Miramar</span> is not an international tourist destination. However, during the warm <span class="date">summer</span> <span class="date">months</span>, many Portuguese from the surrounding areas of <span class="loc">Porto</span>, <span class="loc">Gaia</span> and <span class="loc">Espinho</span> spend their <span class="date">days</span> at the beach of <span class="per">Miramar</span>, and also at neighbouring beaches of the <span class="loc">Costa Verde</span>.</p><br><br>
