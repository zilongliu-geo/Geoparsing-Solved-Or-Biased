<p>Columbus is an unincorporated community located within <span class="loc">Mansfield Township</span> in <span class="loc">Burlington County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The area is served as <span class="loc">United States</span> Postal Service ZIP Code 08022. Most of <span class="loc">Mansfield Township</span>'s governmental offices are located in and around Columbus. It is also the main business district in the township with many businesses lining the main roads in the area. It is located at the junction of County Route 543 (which passes east and west through the area) and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 206 (<span class="loc">US</span> 206) which is a major highway that heads north and south. <span class="loc">US</span> 206 originally passed through the center of Columbus on Atlantic Avenue and New <span class="loc">York</span> Avenue until it was moved to a short four-lane bypass of downtown in the late 1950s/early 1960s. The old surface route became state-maintained New Jersey Route 170 but became a county-maintained road (Burlington CR 690) in 1986. The area had been settled in the 18th century and featured a tavern named <span class="loc">Black Horse Tavern</span>. The community was originally known as <span class="loc">Black Horse</span> after the tavern, a vote was held in 1795 to determine <span class="loc">Burlington County</span>'s county seat which featured <span class="loc">Black Horse</span> as one of three top vote-getters. <span class="loc">Black Horse</span> and the <span class="loc">City of Burlington</span> narrowly lost to <span class="loc">Mount Holly</span>. The settlement was renamed Columbus around 1827 and was named for Christopher Columbus.</p>
