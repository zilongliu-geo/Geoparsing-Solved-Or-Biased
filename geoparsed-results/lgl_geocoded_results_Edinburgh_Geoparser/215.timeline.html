  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Webster</span> Theatre Sold To Mass. Concert Promoter. "The <span class="loc">Webster</span> was the premiere movie theater in <span class="loc">Hartford</span>," <span class="per">Robertson</span> said. "It was the first air-conditioned movie theater, it was done in an Art-Deco style. When I'd walk in there, my Aunt Bea would be in the box office, my father would be running around, we could order anything we wanted, Eskimo Pies, or whatever." Robertson and her father, <span class="per">Albert H. Shulman</span>, reopened the venue as a live-music hall in <span class="date">1996</span>, and it has hosted hundreds of concerts since, from to <span class="per">Gillian Welch</span>, along with shows by the Flaming Lips, <span class="org">Queens of the Stone Age</span> and many more. "I think one of my favorite, favorite concerts was <span class="date">the two nights</span> we had of Godsmack" in <span class="date">1999</span>, <span class="per">Robertson</span> said, recalling singer Sully <span class="loc">Erna</span> as "one of the nicest people I could run into." "The staff did a beautiful job, and it was just such a success, from start to finish," she said. <span class="per">Shulman</span> died in <span class="date">2003</span>, and Robertson bought out her siblings to continue running the <span class="loc">Webster</span>. Tragedy struck the <span class="loc">Webster</span> <span class="date">last year</span>, when booker <span class="per">Ben Wu</span> disappeared while on the island of <span class="loc">Tortola</span> to attend the wedding of Robertson's daughter, <span class="per">Stephanie Decker</span>. <span class="per">Wu</span> is presumed to have drowned. Robertson, who had in <span class="date">the past</span> fielded inquiries about selling the theater, said the incident helped her decide to sell if she got the right offer. Peters made the right offer. "He is the right person for the <span class="loc">Webster</span> and the right person for <span class="loc">Hartford</span>," <span class="per">Robertson</span> said.</p><br><br>
