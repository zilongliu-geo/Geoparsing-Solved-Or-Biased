  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Rosario</span> (Ilocano: Ili ti <span class="loc">Rosario</span>, <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>: <span class="org">Baley na</span> <span class="per">Rosario</span>) is a first class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">La Union</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> Philippine census, it has a population of 52,679 people, with average annual income of Php 86,125,676.88. It has a land area of 7,398 hectares (18,280 acres). The Kennon Road starts from this town and ends at <span class="loc">Baguio City</span>. It is being proposed that this town will be the terminus of the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway. <span class="per">Rosario</span> is 215 kilometres (134 mi) away from <span class="loc">Metro Manila</span>. <span class="per">Rosario</span> links <span class="per">Ilocos</span> and <span class="per">Cordillera</span> Provinces. The flight distance between <span class="per">Manila</span> and <span class="per">Rosario</span> is 189 km. <span class="per">Rosario</span> came from the phrase “rosas del rio” (beautiful landscape with narrow valleys, wild animals, birds, rivers, brooks, dense forest and riverscape, as discovered by Spaniards). Another version or story, is that the long range of foothill far west of the <span class="loc">Poblacion</span> appearing like big Rosary beads was source of the town's name (giant and long rocky rosary). <span class="per">Rosario</span> is the southernmost town of <span class="loc">La Union</span> and the <span class="loc">Ilocos Region</span>, hence called the “<span class="org">Gateway</span> to Ilocandia”. <span class="per">Rosario</span>'s national highway passes along a mountain at barangay <span class="loc">Agat</span> (of <span class="loc">Sison</span>, <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>), then into the Bued bridge (the boundary marker between <span class="loc">La Union</span> and <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>).</p><br><br>
