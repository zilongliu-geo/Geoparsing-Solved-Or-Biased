<p>Davenport (English pronunciation: /ˈdævənpɔːrt/) is the largest city located along the <span class="loc">Mississippi River</span> in <span class="loc">Scott County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Davenport is the county seat of and largest city in <span class="loc">Scott County</span>; it is also the largest of the <span class="loc">Quad Cities</span>, a metropolitan area with a population estimate of 382,630 and a CSA population of 474,226, making it the 90th largest CSA in the nation. Davenport was founded on May 14, 1836 by Antoine LeClaire and was named for his friend, George Davenport, a colonel during the Black Hawk War stationed at nearby <span class="loc">Fort Armstrong</span>. According to the 2010 census, the city had a population of 99,685 (making it <span class="loc">Iowa</span>'s third-largest city). However, the city is currently appealing this figure, arguing that the Census Bureau missed a section of residents that would place the total population over 100,000, and indeed, even the Census Bureau's own estimate for Davenport's 2011 population is 100,802. Located approximately half way between <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and <span class="loc">Des Moines</span>, Davenport is on the border of <span class="loc">Iowa</span> and <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The city is prone to frequent flooding due to its location on the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. There are two main universities: Saint Ambrose University and Palmer College of Chiropractic, which is where the first chiropractic adjustment took place. Several annual music festivals take place in Davenport, including the <span class="loc">Mississippi Valley Blues Festival</span>, The <span class="loc">Mississippi Valley Fair</span>, and the <span class="loc">Bix</span> Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival. An internationally known 7-mile (11 km) foot race called the <span class="loc">Bix</span> 7 is run during the festival. The city has a Class A minor league baseball team, the <span class="loc">Quad Cities</span> River Bandits. Davenport has 50 plus parks and over 20 miles (32 km) of recreational paths for biking or walking.</p>
