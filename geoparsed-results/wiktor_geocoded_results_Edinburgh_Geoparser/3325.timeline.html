  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Paradise was a small town in <span class="loc">Muhlenberg County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town was located 10.5 miles east-north-east of <span class="loc">Greenville</span> and was formerly called <span class="per">Stom</span>'s Landing (sometimes incorrectly spelled Stum). It was once a trading post along the <span class="loc">Green River</span>, but it no longer exists. It was torn down in <span class="date">1967</span> by the Tennessee Valley Authority due to health concerns over its proximity to a nearby coal-burning electric plant, Paradise Fossil Plant. Paradise was settled in the early nineteenth century when it was known as <span class="per">Stom</span>'s Landing, for <span class="per">Leonard Stom</span> who founded the ferry there. It may have once been named <span class="loc">Monterey</span>. The origin of its final name of Paradise is not known. It is postulated the name was descriptive, for settlers who considered the setting to be paradise. A post office was established at Paradise on <span class="date">March 1, 1852</span>; it closed in <span class="date">1967</span>. In <span class="date">1959</span>, the TVA built a coal plant at the former site of Paradise. The coal-fired plants remain controversial and the Paradise permits in particular, have been criticized by environmentalists for non-compliance with the Clean Air Act. Since construction of new scrubbers on Unit 3 at Paradise, the plant's emissions from the massive unit have dropped dramatically in <span class="date">recent years</span>; this in turn has led to a dramatic drop in toxic emissions from the plant overall.</p><br><br>
