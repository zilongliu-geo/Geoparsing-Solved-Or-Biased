  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is a county located in North Central Missouri. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 4,979. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Unionville</span>. The county was organized <span class="date">February 28, 1845</span> and named for <span class="per">Israel Putnam</span>, a hero in the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span> and a general in the American Revolutionary War. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> was established <span class="date">February 28, 1845</span> from parts of <span class="per">Adair</span> and <span class="per">Sullivan</span> counties. <span class="date">The following year</span> a portion of <span class="per">Putnam</span> was removed to form of <span class="loc">Dodge County</span>. Both <span class="per">Putnam</span> and <span class="per">Dodge</span> extended nearly nine miles further north until a 18561 ruling by the <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> on a border dispute with <span class="loc">Iowa</span> assigned the contested land to <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. Both counties were left with less than the statutory minimum area for a county as set by the state legislature, so <span class="loc">Dodge County</span> was dissolved and its area added to <span class="per">Putnam</span>. In its early <span class="date">years</span>, the county seat changed frequently, often with contentious debate. <span class="per">Putnamville, Bryant</span> Station (both no longer in existence), and <span class="loc">Hartford</span> all served until a central location called Harmony, later renamed <span class="loc">Unionville</span>, was chosen. In the <span class="date">1860</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> had 9,240 residents, with eighteen sawmills and three flour mills. Coal had been an abundant since its earliest settlement. Following the arrival of the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> &amp; Southwestern Railway in <span class="date">1873</span>, coal mining became a major industry, especially in the east of the county. At one time three railroads crossed <span class="loc">Putnam county</span>: the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Milwaukee</span> and <span class="per">St. Paul</span>; the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and Quincy; and the <span class="loc">Iowa</span> and <span class="per">St. Louis</span>. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> lost over two-thirds of its population between the <span class="date">years</span> <span class="date">1900</span> and <span class="date">2000</span> (see census data below), when the <span class="loc">United States</span> changed from a rural to an urban country.</p><br><br>
