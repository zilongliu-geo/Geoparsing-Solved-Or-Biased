  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Davis</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span> and the most populous city in <span class="loc">Yolo County</span>. It had a population of 65,622 in <span class="date">2010</span>, not including the on-campus population of the <span class="org">University of California</span>, <span class="per">Davis</span>, which was 5,786. <span class="per">Davis</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Sacramento–Arden-Arcade–Roseville Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="per">Davis</span> grew into a Southern Pacific Railroad depot built in <span class="date">1868</span>. It was then known as "Davisville", named after <span class="per">Jerome C. Davis</span>, a prominent local farmer. However, the post office at <span class="loc">Davisville</span> shortened the town name simply to "<span class="per">Davis</span>" in <span class="date">1907</span>. The name stuck, and the <span class="loc">city of Davis</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">March 28, 1917</span>. From its inception as a farming community, <span class="per">Davis</span> has been known for its contributions to agricultural policy along with veterinary care and animal husbandry. Following the passage of the <span class="org">University</span> Farm Bill in <span class="date">1905</span> by the California State Legislature, Governor <span class="per">George Pardee</span> selected <span class="per">Davis</span> out of 50 other sites as <span class="date">the future</span> home to the <span class="org">University of California</span>'s <span class="loc">University Farm</span>, officially opening to students in <span class="date">1908</span>. The farm, later renamed <span class="org">the Northern Branch of the College</span> of Agriculture in <span class="date">1922</span>, was upgraded into the seventh UC general campus, the <span class="org">University of California</span>, <span class="per">Davis</span>, in <span class="date">1959</span>.</p><br><br>
