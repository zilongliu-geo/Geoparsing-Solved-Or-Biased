  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Duncan</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Platte County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 351 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The transcontinental railroad reached the site of <span class="per">Duncan</span> in <span class="date">1866</span>. Among the first settlers in the area were Polish and Swiss immigrants. In <span class="date">June 1869</span>, the post office of <span class="loc">Cherry Hill</span> was established on the site. In <span class="date">October 1871</span>, the townsite of Jackson was laid out by officials of the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific Railroad. Jackson was chosen in <span class="date">1879</span> as the southern terminus of the <span class="loc">Omaha</span>, <span class="loc">Niobrara</span>, and Black Hills Railroad, a <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific subsidiary, purportedly because <span class="per">Jay Gould</span> was angry at <span class="loc">Columbus</span> for promoting a rival railroad in the region. In <span class="date">1880</span>, the settlement's name was changed to <span class="per">Duncan</span>, owing to the existence of another Jackson in <span class="loc">Dakota County</span>. The new name honored General Wood <span class="per">B. Duncan</span>, a prominent onetime local resident. In <span class="date">the following year</span>, an ice jam destroyed the <span class="loc">Omaha</span>, <span class="loc">Niobrara</span>, and Black Hills Railroad bridge across the <span class="loc">Loup River</span>; the line was later moved to branch off the main line of the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific at <span class="loc">Columbus</span>.</p><br><br>
