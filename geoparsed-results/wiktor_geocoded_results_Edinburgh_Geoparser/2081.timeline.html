  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Puerto Escondido</span> (English: "Hidden Port") is a small port and tourist center in the municipality of <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="per">Pedro Mixtepec</span> Distrito 22 in the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Oaxaca</span>. Prior to <span class="date">the 1930s</span>, there was no town. The bay had been used as a port intermittently to ship coffee, but there was no permanent settlement due to the lack of potable water. The name "<span class="loc">Puerto Escondido</span>" had roots in the legend of a woman who escaped her captors and hid here. The Nahuatl word for this area was Zicatela, meaning “place of large thorns". <span class="date">Today</span>, it refers to the area’s most famous beach. <span class="loc">Puerto Escondido</span> is one of the most important tourist attractions on the Oaxacan coast. It caters to a more downscale and eclectic clientele than neighboring <span class="loc">Huatulco</span>, mostly surfers, backpackers and Mexican families. The main attractions are the beaches: Zicatela Beach hosts major surfing competitions, while other beaches have gentle waves. West from the town is a large lagoon area popular for fishing and birdwatching. The area around <span class="loc">Puerto Escondido</span> had been inhabited by indigenous peoples for <span class="date">centuries</span>, but no towns of any size were established during the pre-Hispanic or colonial eras. The bay was known as <span class="per">Bahia de la Escondida</span> (<span class="org">Bay of the Hidden Woman</span>) due to a legend associated with this place. The story states that a fierce pirate, <span class="per">Andrés Drake</span>, brother of <span class="per">Sir</span> <span class="per">Francis Drake</span>, anchored his ship in the bay when the area was completely uninhabited, to rest for <span class="date">a few days</span> unmolested by authorities.</p><br><br>
