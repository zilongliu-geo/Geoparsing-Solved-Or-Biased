  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kew</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 6 km east from <span class="org">Melbourne's Central Business District</span>. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Boroondara</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> Census, <span class="loc">Kew</span> had a population of 23,876. Formerly a city in its own right, the <span class="loc">cities of Kew</span>, <span class="per">Hawthorn</span> and <span class="per">Camberwell</span> were amalgamated in <span class="date">1994</span> to form the <span class="loc">City of Boroondara</span>. The suburb borders the <span class="loc">Yarra River</span> to the west and north, with Hawthorn to its south and <span class="loc">Balwyn</span> to its east. Prior to the establishment of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, the area was inhabited by the Wurundjeri peoples. In the 1840s European settlers named it the <span class="loc">Parish of Boroondara</span> â€“ meaning "a place of shade" in the Woiwurrung language. In <span class="date">1838</span> Dight travelled down the <span class="loc">Yarra</span> from <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> and decided to locate a water-powered mill on a site adjacent to the falls; the impressive three-storey mill opened in <span class="date">1840</span>. <span class="per">John Hodgson</span> established a squatters run at <span class="loc">Studley Park</span>, on the eastern bank of the <span class="loc">Yarra River</span>, in <span class="date">1840</span>. <span class="org">Studley House</span>, also known as <span class="per">Burke Hall</span>, built in <span class="date">1857</span>, was named after <span class="per">Hodgson</span>'s birthplace of <span class="loc">Studley</span>, <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span> and the house is <span class="date">now</span> on <span class="org">the Register of the National Estate</span>. The house was built in the Victorian Period Italianate Revival style. Modifications were made to the house in <span class="date">1875</span> and <span class="date">1919</span>. The house was also owned by former bookmaker, ALP lobbyist, influential Irish-Catholic and millionaire, <span class="per">John Wren</span> and was donated to <span class="org">Xavier College</span> by the land developer T. M. Burke. It illustrates the importance of a residence in indicating success and status in nineteenth and early twentieth century <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> society. The nearby <span class="loc">Villa Alba</span>, built before <span class="date">1863</span>, is open to the public.</p><br><br>
