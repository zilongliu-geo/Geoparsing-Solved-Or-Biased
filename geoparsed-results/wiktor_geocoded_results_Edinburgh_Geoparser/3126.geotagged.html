<p>Shelton is a city in <span class="loc">Fairfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 39,559 at the 2010 census. Shelton was settled by the English as part of the town of <span class="loc">Stratford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, in 1639. On May 15, 1656, the Court of the Colony of Connecticut in Hartford affirmed that the town of <span class="loc">Stratford</span> included all of the territory 12 miles (19 km) inland from <span class="loc">Long Island Sound</span>, between the <span class="loc">Housatonic River</span> and the <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> town line. In 1662, <span class="loc">Stratford</span> selectmen Lt. Joseph Judson, Captain Joseph Hawley and John Minor had secured all the written deeds of transfer from the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation for this vast territory that comprises the present-day towns of <span class="loc">Trumbull</span>, <span class="loc">Shelton</span> and <span class="loc">Monroe</span>. Shelton was split off from <span class="loc">Stratford</span> in 1789, as Huntington (named for Samuel Huntington). The current name originated in a manufacturing village started in the 1860s named for the Shelton Company founded by Edward N. Shelton â€” also founder of Ousatonic Water Power Company. The rapidly growing <span class="loc">borough of Shelton</span> incorporated as a city in 1915 and was consolidated with the town of Huntington in 1919 establishing the present <span class="loc">city of Shelton</span>.</p>
