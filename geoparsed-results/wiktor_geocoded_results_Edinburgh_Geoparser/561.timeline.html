  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Altamira</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Puerto Plata</span> province of the <span class="loc">Dominican Republic</span>. The town's name is the subject of at least two different origin traditions. One asserts that when <span class="per">Christopher Columbus</span> first arrived in the area, he took note of the height of the mountains and exclaimed: "Look at the heights." Another reports that the name is based on the geographical resemblance of the region to <span class="loc">Spain</span>'s Altamira Caves. On <span class="date">October 29, 1889</span>, President <span class="per">Ulises Heureaux</span> declared the town a municipality. To <span class="date">this day</span>, <span class="date">October 29th</span> is celebrated in <span class="loc">Altamira</span> with municipal festivities. In its earliest <span class="date">days</span>, <span class="loc">Altamira</span> functioned as a set of large agricultural ranches, populated by families transferred there from nearby conucos (small farms). For this reason, some still call Altamira's signature tobacco plantations the "Ranches of <span class="loc">Puerto Plata</span>." At the time of the Devastations of Ozoria, the community helped maintain communication between the Valley of the <span class="loc">Cibao</span> and Port Silver. It also served as a refuge and hideout for settlers who refused to abandon the region. During the period of the Annexation, <span class="loc">Altamira</span> became a part of the <span class="loc">Province of Santiago</span> by Law No. 40 of <span class="date">1845</span>. After <span class="org">the War of Restoration</span> brought national independence, Altamira's importance grew, as not just an area of strategic military importance, but also as a demographic and commercial center.</p><br><br>
