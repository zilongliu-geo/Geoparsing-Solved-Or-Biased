The county was incorporated on <span class="date">January 10, 1816</span> and named for <span class="per">Andrew Jackson</span>. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is included in the Carbondale-Marion, <span class="loc">IL Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is located in the southern portion of <span class="loc">Illinois</span> known locally as "<span class="loc">Little Egypt</span>". Human occupation of <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> began <span class="date">about 11,500 years ago</span>. Extensive documentation of the areas indigenous peoples has been conducted and is ongoing. Exploration from the European explorers began with the Joliet-Marquette exploration along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. It was not until the 18th and 19th century when pioneer farmers began to settle in the area's inexpensive land along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River and in the forested Shawnee hills with its one-hundred-foot trees. As early as <span class="date">1813</span>, <span class="per">Conrad Will</span>, namesake of <span class="loc">Will County</span>, conducted a large salt extraction operation using slave labor on the banks of the <span class="loc">Big Muddy River</span>, south of <span class="date">today</span>'s Murphysboro. As this was in the "free" Northwest <span class="per">Territory, Will</span> had to have a legal exemption to own slaves.</p><br><br>
