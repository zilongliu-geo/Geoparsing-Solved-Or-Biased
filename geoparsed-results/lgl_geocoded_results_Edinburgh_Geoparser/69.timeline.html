  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Keeping track of every dollar. NOTICE: This is the final article in a series that looks back over <span class="date">the past</span> couple of <span class="date">years</span> at the accomplishments of the District 7 Board of Education and ahead to the anticipated challenges it faces. The day-to-day business operations, the working relationships with government entities and officials, and the financing of the school district are all critically important areas and the focus of <span class="date">today</span>’s final article. When in <span class="date">April, 2007</span>, taxpayers approved the $58.3 million referendum to build <span class="per">Albert Cassens</span> Elementary, Goshen Elementary and make major renovations to EHS South and <span class="loc">Glen Carbon</span> Elementary, and convert the Alternative School to the new Worden Elementary, the <span class="org">Board of Education</span> made some commitments to taxpayers that <span class="loc">Edwardsville District</span> 7 Superintendent Ed Hightower noted as two important financial achievements. “During the campaign, the <span class="org">Board of Education</span> made a promise that the tax rate would not change, and as a matter of fact, it dropped slightly,” <span class="loc">Hightower</span> said. “That’s been accomplished.” <span class="loc">Hightower</span> pointed out that the second promise the <span class="org">Board of Education</span> had made was that the building bond component of the district’s tax rate would remain consistent for the <span class="date">20 year</span> term to payoff the $58.3 million. The board assured that the building bond rate would not increase or would be less from the then current rate of approximately .58. The current rate is at approximately .54 which <span class="loc">Hightower</span> noted as a second achievement. <span class="loc">Hightower</span> emphasized that the bond rate was at this lower rate due to conservative planning in regards to estimating the Equalized Assessed Valuation (EAV). The State of Illinois’ Web site defines the EAV as “the result of applying the state equalization factor to the assessed value of a parcel of property. Tax bills are then calculated by multiplying the EAV (after any deductions for homesteads) by the tax rate.” Although the district had seen EAV growth rates averaging between 11 and 12 percent, the board estimated a rate much lower to be conservative. The EAV growth rate is estimated at 8.5 percent for the <span class="date">2008</span> levy but future <span class="date">years</span> will be even lower. “The <span class="date">2009</span> levy for the 2010-11 fiscal year will be at 7 percent and continue thereafter for the life of the bonds,” <span class="loc">Hightower</span> said. “That’s pretty conservative. That’s all built in.” “When we set the <span class="date">20 year</span> issue up, we tried to be conservative,” Assistant Superintendent of Business Operations <span class="per">Dave Courtney</span> said. “After the first couple of <span class="date">years</span>, we had done an estimate on EAV that was at 7 percent rather than the 10, 11, 12, 13 percent that we were seeing before.” <span class="per">Courtney</span> noted that by using the 7 percent figure “we were able to maintain a consistent rate on the entire <span class="date">20 year</span> term.” While speaking about financing, the topic of the district’s loss of revenue arose. When asked about the $1.5 million loss of revenue to the school district as the result of TIFs (Tax Increment Financing) as suggested by mayoral candidate <span class="per">Wesley Tippit</span> in his door-to-door campaigning, <span class="loc">Hightower</span> emphatically responded, “Let me just say that. . . it is misleading and it is totally inaccurate. It’s nowhere near $1.5 million dollars.” The <span class="loc">City of Edwardsville</span> currently has three <span class="loc">TIF districts</span>: TIF I and TIF II in the downtown area, and TIF III at <span class="org">Gateway Commerce Center</span>. The <span class="loc">Edwardsville City</span> Council approved in <span class="date">2008</span> a fourth TIF plan for an area in downtown <span class="loc">Edwardsville</span> from the intersection of East College to the intersection of Illinois Route 159 and Old Alton Edwardsville Road. To illustrate his point, <span class="loc">Hightower</span> went on to explain that <span class="per">Courtney</span> estimated a loss of only $66,000 for TIF I and about $54,000 for TIF II. In addition, <span class="per">Courtney</span> provided estimates of losses to TIF III at approximately $127,000 and TIF IV is currently at about $3,000. <span class="loc">Hightower</span> also felt the TIFs provided numerous benefits. “When you look at what has happened there (downtown) in <span class="date">the last 20 years</span>,” <span class="loc">Hightower</span> said. “Look at the development, look at the number of improvements that have been made and the number of people employed. That is adding a benefit to this community.” “It is so unfair that the school district would be used in this type of a campaign – it’s untrue," <span class="loc">Hightower</span> said. " When you consider all of the improvements that have been made and you ask yourself the question, ‘Has the quality of life improved? Has economic development improved in this area?’ The answer would be yes.” Another accomplishment of the board was its role in the construction of Governors’ <span class="loc">Parkway</span> from 157 to District Drive and Glen Crossing Road in <span class="loc">Glen Carbon</span>. <span class="loc">Hightower</span> stated that extending Governors’ <span class="loc">Parkway</span> allowed 30 to 35 percent of the traffic to be diverted off of Goshen Road in addition to providing Vicksburg residents with another exit onto Governors’ <span class="loc">Parkway</span>. He said that the new road allowed for a reduction in bus transportation in that area which was a savings to the district and that the new road improves traffic flow throughout the <span class="loc">city of Edwardsville</span>. He also noted that the completed extension would soon allow for travel from 157 all the way to 143 near the Interstate 55 entrance ramp. <span class="loc">Hightower</span> attributed the success of this project to a collaboration of many key individuals. “Mayor <span class="per">Gary Niebur</span> has done an incredible job of leading and working collaboratively with the school district and Representative <span class="per">Jay Hoffman</span> in getting the millions of dollars to complete Governors’ <span class="loc">Parkway</span> from 157 all the way to 143,” <span class="loc">Hightower</span> said. “Without collaboration, without working together, this could not have been done, and a great deal of credit goes to Mayor <span class="per">Gary Niebur</span> and city officials for their hard work in getting this done.” According to <span class="loc">Hightower</span>, the same group effort occurred in <span class="loc">Glen Carbon</span> in getting Glen Crossing complete. “We were able to work collaboratively with Mayor Jackstadt, the village trustees and Representative <span class="per">Hoffman</span> was able to bring that money to the area,” he said. Noting that phase one of the project had been in the Village of <span class="loc">Glen Carbon</span>’s budget, but phase two was not, <span class="loc">Hightower</span> added that, “If <span class="org">Goshen Elementary School</span>, if <span class="org">Cassens Elementary School</span> would not have been part of the two road construction projects, that money would not have been filtered to this area as expeditiously as it was.” Looking ahead at the challenges the <span class="org">Board of Education</span> will face in <span class="date">the next two years</span>, <span class="loc">Hightower</span> said that the major challenge is “the uncertainty at the state level and the impact that the national economy is having.” “The number two challenge will be, financially, that we keep focus, live within our means, and not be tempted to use our reserves as our primary bridge for funding day to day operations of the school district,” he said. “We must continue to hold the line, be fiscally responsible and do everything that we can to not impact student learning.” He further stated that the goals would be ”keeping class sizes where they are currently, not cutting teachers, keeping employees to the extent that we can, intact, and maintaining a three-year financial plan that will guide and lead the district without having to use our reserves – other than for the unanticipated occurrences that happens in the district.” Should the district be fortunate and receive stimulus funds, <span class="loc">Hightower</span> said that the district will be in a more stabilized position. But he also stressed that the current budget reductions to increase revenues were “not anything that any other responsible entity around the country should be doing at this time.” “We have an obligation and a responsibility of running the district like it’s a business with an understanding that we have an obligation to educate our students, and that we will do,” <span class="loc">Hightower</span> said.</p><br><br>
