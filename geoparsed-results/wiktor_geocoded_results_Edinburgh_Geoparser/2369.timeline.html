  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Durham</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Incorporated in <span class="date">1966</span>, the city is surrounded by <span class="loc">Tigard</span> and <span class="loc">Tualatin</span> and is adjacent to the <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span> Village shopping complex. The population was 1,351 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city was named for <span class="per">Albert Alonzo Durham</span>, founder of the nearby town of <span class="loc">Oswego</span>. <span class="per">Durham</span> operated a sawmill and a flour mill on <span class="loc">Fanno</span> Creek, which flows through the city, from <span class="date">1866</span> until his death in <span class="date">1898</span>. The site, located along the Boones Ferry Road to <span class="loc">Portland</span>, was originally known as Durhams Mills. In <span class="date">1908</span>, the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Electric Railway established a stop called <span class="per">Durham</span> at the location. Residents of the city voted for incorporation in <span class="date">1966</span> to protect the location from industrialization of its residential areas. <span class="date">Today</span>, the community is primarily residential. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.41 square miles (1.06 km2), all of it land. It sits at 197 feet (60 m) above sea-level. The main road through <span class="per">Durham</span> is Upper Boones Ferry Road, with Interstate 5 about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) east of the city. Part of the western boundary of the city is the <span class="loc">Tualatin River</span>, with the only park, <span class="loc">Durham City</span> Park, also on the western edge of <span class="per">Durham</span>.</p><br><br>
