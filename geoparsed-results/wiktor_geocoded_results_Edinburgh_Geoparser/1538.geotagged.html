<p>Elizabeth is both the largest city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city had a total population of 124,969, retaining its ranking as <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>'s fourth largest city (by population). The population increased by 4,401 (3.7%) from the 120,568 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 10,566 (+9.6%) from the 110,002 counted in the 1990 Census. In 2008, Elizabeth was named one of "<span class="loc">America</span>'s 50 <span class="loc">Greenest Cities</span>" by Popular Science magazine, the only city in <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> selected. Elizabeth, originally called "Elizabethtown" and part of the Elizabethtown Tract, was founded in 1664 by English settlers. The town was not named for Queen Elizabeth I as many people may assume, but rather for Elizabeth, wife of Sir George Carteret, one of the two original Proprietors of the colony of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. She was the daughter of Philippe de Carteret II, 3rd Seigneur de Sark and Anne Dowse. The town served as the first capital of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. During the American Revolutionary War, <span class="loc">Elizabethtown</span> was continually attacked by British forces based on Manhattan and <span class="loc">Staten Island</span>, culminating in the Battle of <span class="loc">Springfield</span> which decisively defeated British attempts to gain <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. After independence, <span class="loc">George Washington</span> embarked from <span class="loc">Elizabethtown</span> by boat to Manhattan for his 1789 inauguration. There are numerous memorials and monuments of the American Revolution in Elizabeth.</p>
