  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Wamba</span> is a Spanish town and municipality located in the southeast part of the shire of Torozos Montes, in the <span class="loc">province of Valladolid</span> . It borders the municipalities of Peñaflor de <span class="loc">Hornija</span>, <span class="loc">Villanubla</span>, Ciguñuela, <span class="loc">Valladolid</span> (for an enclave of the municipality), <span class="loc">Castrodeza</span> and Torrelobatón. Notably <span class="per">Wamba</span> is the only municipality in <span class="loc">Spain</span> whose name contains the letter w. This town is located on the <span class="per">Camino de Santiago</span> de <span class="loc">Madrid</span>. Its name comes from the Gothic <span class="per">King Wamba</span> , who was elected king in that city in the <span class="date">year 672</span> . At that time it was called Gérticos and <span class="per">King Recceswinth</span> had a villa there resting. As <span class="per">Receswinth</span> died in this town, the nobles elected <span class="per">Wamba</span> immediately <span class="date">that day</span>. Church of <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> is known of the existence of a Visigoth church there, which are preserved remains of decoration in the Archaeological Museum of <span class="loc">Valladolid</span>, and it seems likely that during the repopulation of this area there existing church was rebuilt from the times <span class="per">Receswinth</span> and that, by its nature, should be the first Mozarabic church in the area and possibly unlike other nearby places like San Cebrián de Mazote, <span class="per">Wamba</span> was repopulated by people coming from the north and that this is a much closer to the Visigothic and Asturian influences that may contribute to the building Christians who came from Al-Andalus.</p><br><br>
