  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Guinea</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Caroline County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Guinea</span> is 8.5 miles (13.7 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Bowling Green</span>. The modern spelling of the name has been altered from the earlier "Guiney" or "Guiney's", so called after an old <span class="loc">Caroline County</span> family, the Guineys (also spelled Guinney, Gwinny, or Ginny in various records). <span class="loc">Guinea</span> was the site of a Civil War era railroad station on the <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">Fredericksburg</span> and <span class="loc">Potomac Railroad</span> known as Guiney's Station. About four thousand captured Union soldiers were collected at Guiney's station after the Battle of <span class="loc">Chancellorsville</span>. <span class="per">General Robert E. Lee</span> ordered the wounded General <span class="per">Stonewall Jackson</span> to be taken away from the field hospital at the front lines near <span class="loc">Chancellorsville</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span> to a safer location at Guiney's Station. The location is notable as being the place where Confederate General <span class="per">Stonewall Jackson</span> died on <span class="date">May 10, 1863</span>. The human remains of General <span class="per">Stonewall Jackson</span> were placed on a one-car train at Guiney's Station on the <span class="date">morning of Monday, May 11, 1863</span> for transport to <span class="loc">Richmond</span>.</p><br><br>
