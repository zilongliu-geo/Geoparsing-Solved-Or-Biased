<p>Walpole is a town in <span class="loc">Cheshire County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,734 at the 2010 census. The town's central settlement, where 605 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Walpole</span> census-designated place (CDP), and is east of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 12. The town also includes the villages of <span class="loc">North Walpole</span> and <span class="loc">Drewsville</span>. The town was first granted in 1736 by Colonial Governor Jonathan Belcher of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> as Number 3, third in a line of <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> fort towns. It would be settled as early as 1736, and called <span class="loc">Great Falls</span> or <span class="loc">Lunenburg</span>. Colonel Benjamin Bellows, for whom <span class="loc">Bellows Falls</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, is named, built a large fort here for defense against Indian attack. After the border between <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> was fixed (with Number 3 on the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> side of the line), the town was regranted by Governor Benning Wentworth as Bellowstown, after its founder. It would be incorporated in 1756. The grant was renewed in 1761, when the town was renamed Walpole, in honor of Sir Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, and first Prime Minister of <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>.</p>
