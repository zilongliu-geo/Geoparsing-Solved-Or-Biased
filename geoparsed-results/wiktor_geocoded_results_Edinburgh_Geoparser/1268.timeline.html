  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pella</span> (Greek: Πέλλα), is best known as the ancient and wealthy capital of the kingdom of <span class="loc">Macedon</span> in the time of Alexander the Great. On the site of the ancient city is the Archaeological Museum of <span class="loc">Pella</span>. A common folk etymology is traditionally given for the name <span class="loc">Pella</span>, deriving it from the Ancient Macedonian word pélla (πέλλα), "stone" and forming with the prefix a- the Doric apella, meaning in this case fence, enclosure of stone. The word apella originally meant fold, fence for animals, and then assembly of people. However, the local form of Greek was not Doric, and the word exactly matches standard Greek pélla "stone", possibly referring to a famous landmark from the time of its foundation.  Another proposed etymology is that <span class="loc">Pella</span> originally meant "defensible citadel on a cliff", and this etymology is backed by the numerous ancient cities throughout <span class="loc">Greece</span> with similar name i.e. <span class="loc">Pellana</span>, Pallene, <span class="loc">Palle</span>, <span class="loc">Pelle</span>, <span class="loc">Pelion</span>, Palamede, Pellene, etc. <span class="loc">Pella</span> is first mentioned by Herodotus of <span class="loc">Halicarnassus</span> (VII, 123) in relation to <span class="loc">Xerxes</span>' campaign and by Thucydides (II, 99,4 and 100,4) in relation to Macedonian expansion and the war against Sitalces, the king of the Thracians. According to <span class="loc">Xenophon</span>, in the beginning of the <span class="date">4th century BC</span> it was the largest Macedonian city. It was probably built as the capital of the kingdom by Archelaus I, replacing the older palace-city of Aigai although there appears to be some possibility that it may have been created by Amyntas. In antiquity, <span class="loc">Pella</span> was a strategic port connected to the <span class="loc">Thermaic</span> Gulf by a navigable inlet, but the harbour and gulf have since silted up, leaving the site landlocked.</p><br><br>
