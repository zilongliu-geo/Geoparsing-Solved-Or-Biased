<p><span class="loc">Berkeley</span> (/ˈbɑːrkliː/) is a small town and parish in <span class="loc">Gloucestershire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies in the <span class="loc">Vale of Berkeley</span> between the east bank of the <span class="loc">River Severn</span> and the M5 motorway, within the Stroud administrative district. The town is noted for <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> Castle, where the imprisoned Edward II was murdered. <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> lies mid-way between <span class="loc">Bristol</span> and <span class="loc">Gloucester</span>, on a small hill in the <span class="loc">Vale of Berkeley</span>. The town is on the <span class="loc">Little Avon River</span>, which flows into the <span class="loc">Severn</span> at <span class="loc">Berkeley Pill</span>. The Little Avon was tidal, and so navigable, for some distance inland (as far as <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> itself and the <span class="loc">Sea Mills</span> at Ham) until a 'tidal reservoir' was implemented at <span class="loc">Berkeley Pill</span> in the late 1960s. An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches from <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> in the south to <span class="loc">Hinton</span> in the north. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 4,181. <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> was first recorded in 824 as Berclea, from the Old English for "birch lee". <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> was a significant place in medieval times. It was a port and market-town, and the meeting place of the hundred of <span class="loc">Berkeley</span>. After the Norman Conquest, a Flemish noble named Roger de Tosny was appointed Provost of the manor of <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> by his brother-in-law (or perhaps uncle) Earl William FitzOsbern. His family took the name "de <span class="loc">Berkeley</span>", and it was he who began the construction of <span class="loc">Berkeley</span> Castle, which was completed by his son, also Roger. A younger son of the elder Roger, John de <span class="loc">Berkeley</span>, went north to <span class="loc">Scotland</span> with Queen Maud, becoming the progenitor of the Scottish <span class="loc">Barclay</span> family.</p>
