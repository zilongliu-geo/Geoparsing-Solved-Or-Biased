In 1571, the first Spanish troops under Captain Juan de Salcedo arrived in the upland village of <span class="loc">Sampaloc</span>, which became a parish in 1586, and then a municipality in 1647, and was renamed "<span class="loc">San Pablo</span> de <span class="loc">Los Montes</span>" in honor of <span class="loc">Saint Paul</span> the First Hermit. In 1756 it was placed under the jurisdiction of <span class="loc">Batangas province</span> but was returned in 1883 to <span class="loc">Laguna</span>.</p>
