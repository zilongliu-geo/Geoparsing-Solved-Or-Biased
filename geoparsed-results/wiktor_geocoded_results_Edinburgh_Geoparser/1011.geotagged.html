<p><span class="loc">Somerset</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Pulaski County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city population was 11,196 according to the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> was first settled in 1798 by Thomas Hansford and received its name from <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, where some of the early settlers had formerly lived. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> became the <span class="loc">Pulaski County</span> seat in 1802, and it was incorporated as a city in 1887. A significant Civil War battle was fought in January 1862, at Mill Springs (now "Nancy") about 8 miles (13 km) west of <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, and a museum is at the site. A smaller battle was fought nearby at Dutton's Hill in 1863. The completion of Lake Cumberland in 1950 transformed <span class="loc">Somerset</span> from a sleepy rural community into one of the largest recreation centers in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, drawing more than 1.7 million visitors annually, especially between the Memorial and Labor Day holidays. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> is located at 37°4′59″N 84°36′34″W (37.082966, -84.609387), and the downtown (central) part of the city is at an elevation of around 750–800 feet above sea level. The city is located at the eastern end of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>'s <span class="loc">Mississippian</span> Plateau (or <span class="loc">Pennyroyal</span> Plateau); however, the micropolitan area extends eastward into the Appalachian Plateau (or Eastern <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> Coalfield), and northward to <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>'s [[Bluegrass region |Outer Bluegrass]] region. Thus, the area shows significant variations in landforms and scenery.</p>
