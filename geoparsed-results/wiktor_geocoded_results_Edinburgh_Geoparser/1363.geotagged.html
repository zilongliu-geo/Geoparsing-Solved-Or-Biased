<p>Concord is a suburban industrial neighbourhood in the <span class="loc">City of Vaughan</span> in <span class="loc">York Region</span>, located <span class="loc">north of Toronto</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. According to the 2001 Census, the neighbourhood has 8,255 residents (including the community of <span class="loc">Carrville</span>). It is accessed by two provincial highways: Highway 407 and Highway 400. Concord is bordered by Steeles Avenue to the south, <span class="loc">Black Creek</span> to the west (roughly Highway 400), the Upper <span class="loc">West Don River</span> to the east (roughly <span class="loc">Dufferin</span> Street) and Rutherford Road to the north. Prior to the 1950s, when Highway 400 was first opened, Concord was an agricultural community, covered mostly by farmlands. Housing developments also began in the 1950s, east of <span class="loc">Keele Street</span>, as well as construction of a CN railway by-pass of <span class="loc">Toronto</span> with a 4 km freight yard. This decade also saw an industrial park added near Jane Street. In the 1970s, the industrialization of the northern part of the Greater Toronto Area began. The area east of <span class="loc">Keele</span> consists of industrialized buildings and a plaza on Highway 7, with industrial buildup continuing into the 1980s. A residential area, Glen Shields, was built in the 1970s and 1980s in the southeast, west of Dufferin. 1992 also saw the commencement of the construction of Highway 407, which opened in 1997, with three Concord interchanges. Another residential section, <span class="loc">Dufferin</span> Hill, was built in the 2000s in the northeast, near Dufferin and Rutherford. In the early 2000s, construction of the Vaughan Mills shopping mall began, being completed in 2004.</p>
