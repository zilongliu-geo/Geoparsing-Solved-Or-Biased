  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Trujillo</span> is a city and a municipality on the northern Caribbean coast of the Honduran department of Colón, of which the city is the capital. The municipality has a population of about 30,000 (<span class="date">2003</span>). The city is located on a bluff overlooking the Bay of <span class="loc">Trujillo</span>. Behind the city rise two prominent mountains, Mount Capiro and Mount Calentura. Three Garifuna fishing villages—Santa Fe, <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>, and Guadelupe—are located along the beach. <span class="loc">Trujillo</span> has received plenty of attention as the potential site of a proposed Honduran charter city project, according to an idea originally advocated by American economist <span class="per">Paul Romer</span>. Often referred to as a <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> in <span class="loc">Honduras</span>, and advocated by among others the Trujillo-born Honduran president <span class="per">Porfirio Lobo Sosa</span>, the project has also been met with skepticism and controversy, especially due to its supposed disregard for the local Garifuna culture. <span class="per">Christopher Columbus</span> landed in <span class="loc">Trujillo</span> on <span class="date">August 14, 1502</span>, during his fourth and final voyage to <span class="loc">the Americas</span>. <span class="per">Columbus</span> named the place "<span class="per">Punta de Caxinas</span>". It was the first time he touched the Central American mainland. He noticed that the water in this part of the Caribbean was very deep and therefore called the area <span class="loc">Golfo de Honduras</span>, i.e., The Gulf of the Depths (see: <span class="loc">Bay of Honduras</span>).</p><br><br>
