<p>1,000 turkeys in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> have been confirmed by <span class="loc">UK</span> government officials as dying of a strain of avian flu and a further 1,600 have died since the infection was initially reported. The birds, believed to be from a Bernard Matthews owned farm in <span class="loc">Suffolk</span> fell ill and died this week after contracting the H5 strain of the flu. It is likely that all other poultry on the farm will be culled. The department were swift in carrying out a full investigation and sent samples to be tested at facilities in <span class="loc">Weybridge</span>. This report comes less than a year after a mass culling of 50,000 birds in <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> after an outbreak of the H7 strain.</p>
