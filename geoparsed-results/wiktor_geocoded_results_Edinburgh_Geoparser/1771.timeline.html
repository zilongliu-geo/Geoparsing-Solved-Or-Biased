  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Belovo</span> (Russian: Белово) is a town in <span class="loc">Kemerovo Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Bachat</span> River 170 kilometers (110 mi) south of <span class="loc">Kemerovo</span>. Population: 76,764 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census); 82,425 (<span class="date">2002</span> Census); 93,108 (<span class="date">1989</span> Census). The village of <span class="loc">Belovo</span> for the first time is mentioned in <span class="date">1726</span>. It was named after a fugitive peasant Fyodor Belov, who built a small taiga house, a so-called zaimka, on the bank of the <span class="loc">Bachat</span> River. The year of <span class="date">1855</span> was a new page in the history of settlement: the mining of mineral resources on the found coal field began. In <span class="date">1938</span>, <span class="loc">Belovo</span> was granted town status. The town developed as a conglomeration of departmental settlements, whose population was directly or indirectly involved with the coal mines, a power station, and the railway. Within the framework of administrative divisions, <span class="loc">Belovo</span> serves as the administrative center of <span class="loc">Belovsky District</span>, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with four urban-type settlements (Bachatsky, <span class="loc">Gramoteino</span>, <span class="loc">Inskoy</span>, and <span class="loc">Novy Gorodok</span>) and two rural localities, incorporated separately as Belovo Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Belovo Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as <span class="loc">Belovsky Urban</span> <span class="loc">Okrug</span>.</p><br><br>
