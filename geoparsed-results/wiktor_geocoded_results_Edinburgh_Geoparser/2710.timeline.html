  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tampa</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Weld County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The rural community is served by an 80643 ZIP code. Old timers in the area advise that <span class="loc">Tampa</span> was a departure point for an old railroad spur called the <span class="loc">Tampa</span> Spur. <span class="loc">Tampa</span> was located on the old CB&amp;Q line (<span class="date">now</span> BNSF, <span class="loc">Burlington Northern</span>, <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>), about halfway between <span class="loc">Roggen</span> and <span class="loc">Keenesburg</span>. Old timers advise that the <span class="loc">Tampa</span> Spur was a 1.5-mile-long railroad spur between <span class="loc">Tampa</span> and a place to the south called <span class="loc">Sheehan</span>, near the Prospect Valley, and that the spur functioned as a sugar beet dump. (A beet dump was an elevated facility that allowed farmers to deposit newly harvested produce into open railroad cars.) According to these old timers, the <span class="loc">Tampa</span> Spur was built in <span class="date">1882</span>. It was still on the railroad maps in <span class="date">1983</span>, but does not appear on current railroad maps. <span class="loc">Tampa</span> is located at 40.149982 degrees north, 104.455512 degrees west (27.1499982, -104.455512); or about 5.5 miles northeast of <span class="loc">Keenesburg</span>. The elevation for the community is 4,813 feet above sea level. The community is adjacent to Interstate 76.</p><br><br>
