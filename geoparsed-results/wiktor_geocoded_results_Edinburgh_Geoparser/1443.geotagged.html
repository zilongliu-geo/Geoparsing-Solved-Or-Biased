<p><span class="loc">Plymouth</span> was the capital of the island of <span class="loc">Montserrat</span>, an overseas territory of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> located in the <span class="loc">Leeward Island</span> chain of the <span class="loc">Lesser Antilles</span>, <span class="loc">West Indies</span>. Constructed on historical lava deposits near the (then inactive) <span class="loc">Soufriere Hills</span> volcano, the town was evacuated when the volcano resumed erupting in 1995, and was abandoned permanently in 1997 after it was burnt and mostly buried by a series of pyroclastic flows and lahars. For centuries it had been the only port of entry to the island. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is still de jure the capital of <span class="loc">Montserrat</span>, giving it the unusual distinction of being the only ghost town which is the capital of a political territory. Beginning in July 1995, a series of huge eruptions at the Soufri√®re Hills volcano sent pyroclastic flows and ash falls across a wide area of southern <span class="loc">Montserrat</span> including the capital, <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>. It was immediately clear that the city was in grave danger; on 21 August 1995, tephra fell on <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, and in December residents were evacuated as a precaution. Residents were allowed back a few months later but on 25 June 1997, a massive eruption produced pyroclastic surges that killed 19 people and reached nearly to the island's airport on the eastern side of the island. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> was again evacuated.</p>
