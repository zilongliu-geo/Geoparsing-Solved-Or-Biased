<p>Clinton is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,606 at the 2010 census. For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place Clinton, please see the article Clinton (CDP), <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Clinton was first settled in 1654 as a part of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>. It was officially incorporated as a separate town on March 14, 1850, and named after the DeWitt Clinton Hotel in <span class="loc">New York</span>, a favorite place of the town's founders, Erastus Brigham Bigelow and his brother Horatio. Clinton became an industrialized mill town, using the <span class="loc">Nashua River</span> as a source for water power. In 1897, construction began on the <span class="loc">Wachusett</span> Dam, culminating in the filling of the <span class="loc">Wachusett</span> Reservoir in 1908. This flooded a substantial portion of Clinton and neighboring towns, which had to be relocated. A noteworthy feature of the <span class="loc">Boston</span> metropolitan public water service was begun in 1896 in the <span class="loc">Wachusett</span> lake reservoir at Clinton. The basin excavated there by ten years of labour, lying 385 ft. above high-tide level of <span class="loc">Boston</span> harbour, had a capacity of 63,068,000,000 gallons of water and was the largest municipal reservoir in the world in 1911, yet was only part of a system planned for the service of the greater metropolitan area.</p>
