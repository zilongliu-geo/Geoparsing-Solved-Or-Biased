<p><span class="loc">Nono</span> is one of the woredas in the <span class="loc">Oromia Region</span> of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. It is named after the Nono Oromo, a subgroup of the Macha Oromo, who live in this area. Part of the West Shewa Zone, <span class="loc">Nono</span> is bordered on the southwest by the <span class="loc">Gibe River</span> which separates it from the Jimma Zone, on the northwest by <span class="loc">Dano</span>, on the north by Cheliya, on the northeast by Tikur, on the east by the Southwest Shewa Zone, and on the southeast by the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region.
