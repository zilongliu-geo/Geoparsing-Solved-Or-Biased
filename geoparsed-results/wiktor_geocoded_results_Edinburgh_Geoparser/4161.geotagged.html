<p><span class="loc">Makin</span> or Makeen is a small town in <span class="loc">South Waziristan</span>, <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>, located on the Y-junction between Sararogha and Wana, just south of <span class="loc">Razmak</span> in <span class="loc">North Waziristan</span>. It is mainly populated by members of the Mehsud tribe. The Pakistani military has called it "the nerve center" of the Pakistani Taliban. Just north of <span class="loc">Makin</span> is the village of <span class="loc">China</span>, and the Taliban stronghold of <span class="loc">Ladha</span> is a few kilometers to the south. The Jan Alam Hospital is located in <span class="loc">Makin</span>'s bazaar. The bazaar is the commercial hub of the Mehsud tribe. As of 2005, tribesmen entering <span class="loc">Makin</span> bazaar had to deposit weapons at a checkpoint, to be returned on departure. The <span class="loc">Makin</span> Tehsil has seven middle schools (including two for girls) and two high schools (none for girls). <span class="loc">Makin</span> was the base of Baitullah Mehsud, the former leader of Tehrik-i-Taliban until his death in an August 2009 drone attack. In 2007, Baitullah Mehsud was at "Anwar Shahâ€™s house" in <span class="loc">Makin</span> when he allegedly claimed responsibility for the assassination of Benazir Bhutto during an intercepted phone call.</p>
