<p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 203,206. The county seat is <span class="loc">Medford</span>. The county is named for Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Medford</span>, <span class="loc">OR</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. There are 11 incorporated cities and 34 unincorporated communities in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>; the largest is <span class="loc">Medford</span>, which has been the county seat since 1927. <span class="loc">Modoc</span>, <span class="loc">Shasta</span>, <span class="loc">Takelma</span>, <span class="loc">Latgawa</span>, and <span class="loc">Umpqua</span> Indian tribes are all native to the region of present <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>. In the early 1850s, both the Klickitats from the north and the <span class="loc">Deschutes</span> from the south raided and settled the area. The Territorial Legislature created <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> on January 12, 1852, from the southwestern portion of <span class="loc">Lane County</span> and the unorganized area south of Douglas and Umpqua Counties. It included lands which now lie in Coos, Curry, Josephine, <span class="loc">Klamath</span> and Lake Counties. Gold discoveries in the <span class="loc">Illinois River</span> valley and the <span class="loc">Rogue River</span> valley near <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span> in 1852, and the completion of a wagon road connecting the county with <span class="loc">California</span> to the south and <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> to the north led to an influx of non-native settlers.</p>
