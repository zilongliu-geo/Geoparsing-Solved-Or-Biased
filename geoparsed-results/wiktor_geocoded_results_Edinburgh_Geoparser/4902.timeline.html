  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Oak Park is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Sacramento</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The McGeorge School of Law, University of the Pacific <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> Campus, <span class="org">Sacramento High School</span>, and <span class="org">Christian Brothers</span> High School are located in this neighborhood. Oak Park is informally bounded by <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 50 to the North, Stockton Blvd. to the East, CA-99 to the West and Fruitridge Road to the South. It is situated within the city limits and provides easy access to the ever growing/changing Downtown of <span class="loc">Sacramento</span>. The streets intersect with avenues and there is one main street that runs through all of Oak Park, <span class="per">Martin Luther King Jr.</span> Boulevard, formerly known as <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> Boulevard. <span class="date">The early 1900s</span> saw Oak Park as a culturally thriving and economically vibrant, destination neighborhood, due in part to its strong sense of community and its ties with and proximity to the Historic site of the <span class="loc">California</span> State Fair grounds. <span class="date">The 1960s</span> Interstate freeway expansion program subdivided many historic <span class="loc">Sacramento</span> neighborhoods like Oak Park creating isolated areas of poverty or relative prosperity. Oak Park's sense of community started to decline in <span class="date">the early 1960s</span> as a result of the freeway expansion, declining property values and families moving out to the suburb communities <span class="date">now</span> made easily accessible by the freeway expansion programs. During <span class="date">the 1980s</span> / 90's further deterioration of the living standards were exacerbated by frequent occurrences of petty theft, street crime, drug activities and gang related violence. Recently, the early 2000s saw a slew of real estate speculators and building contractors buying up low priced homes in some parts of Oak Park that were either abandoned or sold off as unmanageable then turning them around and reselling them as reasonably priced starter homes, often with financial government assistance. At the same time many new high paying jobs moved into the area in connection with the expansion of the <span class="org">University of California</span> <span class="org">Davis Medical Center</span> located to <span class="org">the North of Oak Park</span>, the revitalization of <span class="loc">Broadway</span> and <span class="loc">Stockton Boulevard</span> and the expansion of the McGeorge Law School campus.</p><br><br>
