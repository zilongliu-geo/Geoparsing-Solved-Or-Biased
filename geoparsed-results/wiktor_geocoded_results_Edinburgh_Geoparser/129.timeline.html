It has a population of 3200 and lies at an altitude of about 430m. <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> lies close to the continental divide and just 60 km from the <span class="loc">Mosquito Coast</span> at the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span>, but is only connected to the Pacific coast with a paved road to the Pan-American Highway and the <span class="loc">city of Santiago</span> de <span class="loc">Veraguas</span>. <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> is known throughout <span class="loc">Panama</span> for its natural beauty.

The park is home to at least 300 bird species, 300 species of orchids and a host of rare flora and fauna. The <span class="loc">Santa Maria River</span> and its tributaries spring from the park.
