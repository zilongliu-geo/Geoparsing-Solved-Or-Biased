<p><span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is an inner-city suburb of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is located 4 kilometres south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district and is part of the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Sydney</span>. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> took its name from the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> in 1815, when Allied and Prussian forces under the Duke of Wellington and Bl√ºcher defeated the French forces under Napoleon Bonaparte. In the 1820s <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> began supporting industrial operations including the Fisher and Duncan <span class="loc">Paper Mill</span> and the Waterloo Flour Mills owned by William Hutchinson and Daniel Cooper. William Hutchinson, superindendent of convicts and public works, had been granted 1,400 acres (5.7 km2) of land in 1823. He sold <span class="loc">Waterloo Farm</span> to Daniel Cooper (1785-1853) and Solomon Levey (1794-1833). Cooper later bought out Levey's share and on his death the Waterloo Estate passed onto his son, also named Daniel Cooper, who was the first speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is historically a working class region. Since early 2000s, the region has undergone some degree of gentrification with a rising business district focusing on technology-oriented firms and the development of more green space such as parks. By 2006, median individual income in <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> was slightly higher than the Australian average. The suburb maintains numerous public housing apartments.</p>
