<p><span class="loc">Florence</span> /ˈflɔːrəns/ is a city located in <span class="loc">Florence County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city is the county seat of the <span class="loc">Florence County</span> and the primary city within the <span class="loc">Florence</span> metropolitan area. The area forms the core of the historical "<span class="loc">Pee Dee</span>" region of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, which includes the eight counties of northeastern <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, along with sections of southeastern <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population at 37,326, representing an increase of .7 percent. In 1965, <span class="loc">Florence</span> was named an <span class="loc">All-American City</span>, presented by the National Civic League. The city was founded as a railroad hub and became the junction of three major railroad systems, including the <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> and <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, the Northeastern, and the <span class="loc">Cheraw</span> and <span class="loc">Darlington</span>. As of 2013, the city retains its status as a major hub, both for industry and infrastructure, while establishing itself as a regional center for business, medicine, culture and finance. The <span class="loc">City of Florence</span> was chartered in 1871 and incorporated in 1890 following the 1888 creation of <span class="loc">Florence County</span>. Prior to its charter, the city was part of one of the original townships laid out by the Lords Proprieters in 1719. The area was gradually settled through the late 19th and early 20th century. Early settlers practiced subsistence farming and produced indigo, cotton, naval stores and timber, which were shipped down the <span class="loc">Pee Dee River</span> to the port at <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> and exported. In the mid-19th century two intersecting railroads were built, The <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> and <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, and the Northeastern. Gen. W. W. Harllee, the president of the W &amp; M road built his home at the junction, and named the community <span class="loc">Florence</span>, after his daughter.</p>
