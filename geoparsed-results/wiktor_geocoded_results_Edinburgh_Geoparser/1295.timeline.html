  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 122,979. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Jonesborough. The county's largest city and a regional educational, medical and commercial center is <span class="loc">Johnson City</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is Tennessee's oldest county, having been established in <span class="date">1777</span> when the state was still part of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Johnson City</span>, <span class="loc">TN</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area, commonly known as the "Tri-Cities" region. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is rooted in the Watauga settlements, which were established in the early 1770s in the vicinity of what is <span class="date">now</span> Elizabethton, in adjacent <span class="loc">Carter County</span>. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War in <span class="date">1776</span>, the Wataugans organized the "<span class="loc">Washington District</span>," which was governed by a committee of safety. <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> initially refused to recognize the settlements as legal, but finally agreed to annex the district after the settlers thwarted an invasion by hostile Cherokees. The settlements were governed as the <span class="loc">Washington District</span>, which originally included all of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The district was reorganized as <span class="loc">Washington County</span> in <span class="date">1777</span>.</p><br><br>
