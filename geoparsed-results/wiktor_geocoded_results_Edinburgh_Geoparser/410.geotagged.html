<p><span class="loc">Salem</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Henry County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 383 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Salem</span> was settled originally by Quakers with the intent that it be a community of Friends. In 1835 Aaron Street, while wending his way westward, came upon an uninhabited spot and declared “Now have mine eyes beheld a country teeming with every good thing…Hither will I come with my flocks and my herds, with my children and my children’s children, and our city shall be called <span class="loc">Salem</span>, for thus was the city of our fathers, even near unto the seacoast.” Independently another Quaker, Isaac Pigeon, who may have visited the spot before Street, brought his family to the area. They became the first citizens of <span class="loc">Salem</span>, and with Peter Boyer, began to recruit other Quakers to migrate westward to join them. As early as 1837, Friends meetings were held in private homes, and after the village was laid out in 1839 by Aaron Street, Jr., and Peter Boyer, a meeting house was built. From the early years members of other Christian denominations settled in <span class="loc">Salem</span>, so it was never an exclusively Quaker community.</p>
