In 2011 the population was 1,174, almost 100 higher than the 1,078 counted at the time of the 2001 census. According to the 2011 Census, there are 761 Gaelic speakers (62%) on <span class="loc">Barra</span>. The area of <span class="loc">Barra</span> is roughly 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi), the main village being <span class="loc">Castlebay</span> (<span class="loc">Bàgh a' Chaisteil</span>). The west of the island has white sandy beaches backed by shell-sand, machair and the east has numerous rocky inlets. <span class="loc">Kisimul</span> Castle at <span class="loc">Castlebay</span> is located on a rock in the bay, so giving the village its name. A smaller castle can be found in the middle of Loch St Clare on the west side of the Island in <span class="loc">Tangasdale</span>. The highest elevation on the island is <span class="loc">Heaval</span>, halfway up which is located a prominent white marble statue of the <span class="loc">Madonna</span> and Child, called "Our Lady of the Sea", which was erected during the (Marian year) of 1954. The predominant faith on the island is Catholicism and the Catholic church dedicated to Our Lady of the Sea is immediately apparent to all who arrive into <span class="loc">Castlebay</span>.</p>
