<p><span class="loc">Bexley</span> is a suburban city in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,057 at the 2010 census. Founded as a village over a hundred years ago, the <span class="loc">City of Bexley</span> is an old, tree-lined suburb of <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> state capital, situated on the banks of <span class="loc">Alum Creek</span> next to Driving Park and <span class="loc">Wolfe</span> Park, just east of the Franklin Park Conservatory. It is horizontally bisected by the National Road (Main Street), serving as a reminder of <span class="loc">Bexley</span>'s origins as a merger between the prestigious <span class="loc">Bullitt</span> Park neighborhood to the north, and the Lutheran college community of Pleasant Ridge to the south. This history of joining economic and educational privilege remains evident in <span class="loc">Bexley</span> to this day. The historic suburb is perhaps best known, however, for its large houses and estates, located primarily in <span class="loc">Bullitt</span> Park. The most famous of these include the Jeffrey Park Mansion (aka "Kelveden"), the home of the president of The Ohio State University, and the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> Governor's Mansion. Located in northern <span class="loc">Bexley</span>, the Governor's Mansion—originally built as a private residence in 1925 and given to the state in 1955—has served as the official residence of <span class="loc">Ohio</span> governors since 1957, though Governor James A. Rhodes (in his final two terms in office) and current Governor John Kasich, both of whom were residents of central <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, chose to remain in their private homes while in office.</p>
