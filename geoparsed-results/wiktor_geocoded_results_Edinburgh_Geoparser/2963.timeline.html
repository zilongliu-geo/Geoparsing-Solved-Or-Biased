  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Hope (Welsh: <span class="loc">Yr Hob</span>) is a small village in <span class="loc">Flintshire</span>, north-east <span class="loc">Wales</span>. The village is located approximately 3 miles / 4.5 km from the Wales-England border, on the course of the <span class="loc">River Alyn</span>. <span class="loc">Yr Hob</span> was originally the name of a commote within the cantref of Maelor in the medieval Kingdom of <span class="loc">Powys</span>. Hope belongs to a small group of closely related villages in its local area, including <span class="loc">Caergwrle</span>, <span class="loc">Abermorddu</span> and <span class="loc">Cefn-y-bedd</span>. One of the major features in the area is <span class="loc">Hope Mountain</span> (Mynydd yr Hob), to the west of the village, along with the extensive farmland of Shordley. At the <span class="date">2001</span> Census, the population was 2,522, increasing to 4,224 at the <span class="date">2011</span> Census. In <span class="date">2007</span>, the secondary school Castell Alun High, which is located in the village, became the only school in <span class="loc">North Wales</span> to be awarded 7 Grade 1s by Estyn, the school inspection service for <span class="loc">Wales</span>. The judgement makes Castell Alun one of the top schools in <span class="loc">Wales</span>. Hope has good transport links with local towns and cities, notably <span class="loc">Wrexham</span>, <span class="loc">Chester</span> and <span class="loc">Mold</span>, with the Borderlands Line running directly through Hope railway station giving access to <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> via the <span class="loc">Wirral</span> Peninsula.</p><br><br>
