  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Mohamed Tamalt</span>, a journalist imprisoned in <span class="loc">Algeria</span> for insulting President <span class="per">Abdelaziz Bouteflika</span>, died in hospital while serving his sentence. His lawyer on <span class="date">Sunday</span> announced his death. <span class="per">Tamalt</span>, 42, lived in <span class="loc">England</span>, basing himself in <span class="loc">London</span>, and had UK-Algerian dual citizenship. He was arrested on <span class="date">June 27</span> near his parents' Algiers home after writing a poem on Facebook. <span class="org">Human Rights Watch</span> said he began a hunger strike immediately. On <span class="date">June 11</span> he was fined 200,000 dinars (Â£1,400; US$1,800) and imprisoned for <span class="date">two years</span>. This was upheld on appeal. <span class="per">Tamalt</span> fell into a coma which his lawyer, Amine Sidhoum, said lasted <span class="date">three months</span>. He was undergoing treatment in <span class="loc">Bab</span> el-Oued hospital. <span class="org">Human Rights Watch</span> had asked <span class="loc">Algeria</span> to release him when reportedly in critical condition in <span class="date">August</span>. Reporters Without Borders called <span class="per">Tamalt</span>'s death a shocking blow to Algerian free speech. "Why was there such a conviction just for words on Facebook which did no harm to anyone?" asked the organisation's North African head, <span class="per">Yasmine Kacha</span>. <span class="org">Amnesty International</span> have sought an "independent and transparent investigation into the circumstances" of <span class="per">Tamalt</span>'s death. <span class="per">Tamalt</span> was convicted of insulting <span class="per">President Bouteflika</span> and defaming a public organisation, both breaches of the national Penal Code. <span class="per">Sidhoum</span> told al-Jazeera the occasion marked "the first time since <span class="loc">Algeria</span> gained its independence from <span class="loc">France</span> that a journalist died in jail because of what he wrote on the Internet." He also said he was "really sad at the lack of support from his fellow Algerian journalists, who left him and abandoned him." </p><br><br>
