  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kelso</span> is an abandoned small settlement in <span class="loc">Otago</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, located ten kilometres north of <span class="loc">Tapanui</span> on the <span class="loc">Crookston Burn</span>, close to its junction with the larger <span class="loc">Pomahaka River</span>. Its population during <span class="date">the 1960s and 1970s</span> was close to 300, with most of its economy based on sheep farming. A small dairy factory was a focal point in the village's early <span class="date">years</span>. The township was first surveyed in <span class="date">1875</span>, and the first settlement began <span class="date">the following year</span>. It was named for the Scottish home town of one of the town's first settlers, <span class="per">James Logan</span>. Originally intended as the main settlement in the <span class="loc">West Otago</span> area, this title eventually went to nearby <span class="loc">Tapanui</span>. The town was linked to <span class="loc">Waipahi</span> and the Main South Line railway on <span class="date">1 December 1880</span> with the opening of the <span class="loc">Tapanui</span> Branch line. On <span class="date">1 April 1884</span>, this line was extended from <span class="loc">Kelso</span> to <span class="loc">Heriot</span>. The township was frequently subject to flooding, notably in <span class="date">1913</span> and <span class="date">1917</span>. It was inundated with flood water during two major floods of the <span class="loc">Clutha River</span> catchment in <span class="date">1978</span> and <span class="date">1980</span>. The former led to the closure of the railway, and after the latter flood it was decided to relocate the settlement entirely.</p><br><br>
