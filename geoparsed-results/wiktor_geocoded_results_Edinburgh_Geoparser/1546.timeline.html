  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tonga</span> ([ˈtoŋa]; Tongan: Puleʻanga Fakatuʻi ʻo <span class="loc">Tonga</span>), officially the <span class="loc">Kingdom of Tonga</span>, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 islands are inhabited. The total surface area is about 750 square kilometres (290 sq mi) scattered over 700,000 square kilometres (270,000 sq mi) of the southern <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. It has a population 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of <span class="loc">Tongatapu</span>. <span class="loc">Tonga</span> stretches over about 800 kilometres (500 mi) in a north-south line – about a third of the distance from <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> to <span class="loc">Hawaii</span>. It is surrounded by <span class="loc">Fiji</span> and <span class="loc">Wallis and Futuna</span> (<span class="loc">France</span>) to the northwest, <span class="loc">Samoa</span> to the northeast, <span class="loc">Niue</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Kermadec</span> (part of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>) to the southwest, and <span class="loc">New Caledonia</span> (<span class="loc">France</span>) and <span class="loc">Vanuatu</span> to the farther west. <span class="loc">Tonga</span> became known as the <span class="loc">Friendly Islands</span> because of the congenial reception accorded to Captain <span class="per">James Cook</span> on his first visit in <span class="date">1773</span>. He arrived at the time of the ʻinasi festival, the yearly donation of the First Fruits to the Tuʻi <span class="loc">Tonga</span> (the islands' paramount chief) and so received an invitation to the festivities. According to the writer <span class="per">William Mariner</span>, the chiefs wanted to kill Cook during the gathering but could not agree on a plan.</p><br><br>
