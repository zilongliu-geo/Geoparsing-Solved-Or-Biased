<p><span class="loc">Golovin</span> (formerly Chinik Siŋik in Iñupiaq, Cingik in Central Alaskan Yup'ik) is a city in <span class="loc">Nome Census Area</span>, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the 2010 census the population was 156. <span class="loc">Golovin</span> is located at 64°32′41″N 163°1′39″W (64.544612, -163.027459). <span class="loc">Golovin</span> is on a point of land between <span class="loc">Golovnin Bay</span> and <span class="loc">Golovnin Lagoon</span> on the <span class="loc">Seward Peninsula</span> in western <span class="loc">Alaska</span>. It is about 105 km (65 mi) east of <span class="loc">Nome</span>. The area receives its name from Russian Vice-Admiral Vasily Mikhailovich Golovnin, (1776–1831). The town name is misspelled while the bay and lagoon retain the correct spelling. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.7 square miles (9.6 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Golovin</span> was originally an Inupiat village called Chinik. <span class="loc">Golovin</span> was named for Captain Vasily Golovnin of the Russian Navy, who visited <span class="loc">Alaska</span> to inspect the workings of the Russian-American Company in 1807-1809, in the Diana, and in 1817-1819, in the <span class="loc">Kamchatka</span>, while circumnavigating the world. Lt. Lavrenty Zagoskin, from the Imperial Russian Navy sent to <span class="loc">Alaska</span> to scout locations for trading posts, reported the village as "Ikalikguigmyut" in 1842. In 1867, the Mission Covenant of <span class="loc">Sweden</span> established a church and school south of the current site of <span class="loc">Golovin</span>. Around 1890, John Dexter established a trading post that became the center for swapping prospecting information for the entire <span class="loc">Seward Peninsula</span>. Gold was discovered in 1898 at Council and <span class="loc">Golovin</span> became a supply point for the gold fields. Supplies were unloaded from ships at <span class="loc">Golovin</span> and shipped across <span class="loc">Golovnin Lagoon</span> and up the Fish and Niukluk Rivers to Council.</p>
