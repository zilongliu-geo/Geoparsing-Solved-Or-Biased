<p><span class="loc">Pleasanton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Atascosa County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,934 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Pleasanton</span>'s official motto is "The City of Live Oaks and Friendly Folks." It is part of the San Antonio-New <span class="loc">Braunfels Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Pleasanton</span> honors its cowboy heritage with the "Mr. Cowboy" sculpture in front of City Hall and across from the giant oak tree downtown. The roots of the cattle kingdom can be traced to <span class="loc">Atascosa County</span> in the 1860s, which calls itself "the birthplace of the cowboys." The sculpture is a gift of Ben and Mona Parker. The Longhorn Museum in east <span class="loc">Pleasanton</span> on Highway 97 contains artifacts and memorabilia of the cowboy years. The Cowboy Homecoming, begun in 1966, is an annual event held at the <span class="loc">Atascosa River Park</span> in <span class="loc">Pleasanton</span>. <span class="loc">Pleasanton</span> was established in 1858 when conflicts with the Indians caused the settlers to move the location of the county seat from <span class="loc">Amphion</span>. The settlers chose the current town site because of its location at the mouth of <span class="loc">Bonita Creek</span>. John Bowen (died 1867), <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>'s first Anglo-American postmaster, founded and named the town of <span class="loc">Pleasanton</span> after his good friend and fellow early <span class="loc">Texas</span> Settler John <span class="loc">Pleasants</span>.</p>
