The population was 17 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census.

Following the <span class="date">2010</span> census <span class="per">Brewster</span> became the smallest incorporated county seat in the <span class="loc">United States</span> replacing Amidon, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span> for the title.
