  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hegang</span> (Chinese: 鹤岗; pinyin: Hègǎng, also known as <span class="per">Haoli</span> and <span class="per">Heligang</span>), is a prefecture-level city in <span class="loc">Heilongjiang province</span> of the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, situated in the southeastern section of the Lesser Khingan Range, facing <span class="loc">Jiamusi</span> across the <span class="loc">Songhua</span> River to the south and <span class="loc">Russia</span>'s <span class="loc">Jewish Autonomous Oblast</span> across the <span class="loc">Amur River</span> to the north. <span class="loc">Hegang</span> is one of the principal coal-producing cities in <span class="loc">China</span>. <span class="loc">Hegang</span> covers an administrative area of 14,679.88 km2 (5,667.93 sq mi) and according to the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, has a population of 1,058,665 inhabitants. Its built-up area is home to 664,471 inhabitants spread out over 5 urban districts including <span class="loc">Dongshan</span> being urbanized, even though still largely rural. The region of <span class="loc">Hegang</span> was a desolate and uninhabited area until the late 1890s. In <span class="date">1906</span>, the area of <span class="loc">Hegang City</span> was under the administration of <span class="loc">Tangyuan County</span> under the Qing Dynasty. Since then, the government has been encouraging people to farm in the region. In <span class="date">1914</span>, coalfield was discovered in <span class="per">Haoli</span>, and Heilongjiang Government approved to set up Xinghua Mines (興華煤礦) which is jointly invested by merchants including Shen Songnian (沈松年). The area was also renamed <span class="loc">Xingshan</span> (興山) after the Xinghua Coal Mine. The <span class="loc">Hegang</span> mines were founded in <span class="date">1916</span> by a Chinese entrepreneur with Russian capital. <span class="loc">Hegang</span> has witnessed rapid economic growth thanks to its rich coal resources. In <span class="date">1926</span> a railway was built between <span class="loc">Hegang</span> and <span class="loc">Jiamusi</span>, some 30 miles to the south on the <span class="loc">Songhua</span> River. A coal carrier fleet was privately financed in <span class="date">1930</span> by General <span class="per">Zhang Xueliang</span>. On <span class="date">August 1932</span>, <span class="loc">Hegang</span> mines were occupied by the Japanese as the Japanese Empire advanced through <span class="loc">Manchuria</span>. The mines were further developed during the Japanese occupation of <span class="loc">Manchuria</span>. On <span class="date">August 11, 1945</span>, <span class="loc">Hegang</span> was occupied by the Soviet Red Army, and was relegated to the Communist Force. Since several major coal mines in southern <span class="loc">Manchuria</span> were controlled by Kuomintang Forces, <span class="loc">Hegang</span> became one of the main coal-producing area of Communist Force in the Chinese Civil-War, playing an important role in guaranteeing the acquisition of weapons and other war materials. <span class="loc">Hegang</span> was renamed in <span class="date">1949</span>, and set up as a prefecture-level city in Heilongjiang.</p><br><br>
