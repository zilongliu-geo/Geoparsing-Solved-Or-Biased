  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Clifton</span> is an incorporated town located in southwestern <span class="loc">Fairfax County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with a population of 282 at the time of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census. Incorporated by the General Assembly on <span class="date">March 9, 1902</span>, <span class="loc">Clifton</span> is currently one of only three towns in the county, the other two being <span class="loc">Vienna</span> and <span class="loc">Herndon</span>. <span class="loc">Clifton</span>'s history begins pre-colonially, when the area was used as hunting grounds by the local <span class="org">Dogue Native American</span> tribe. A railroad siding was constructed here during the Civil War, and the area became titled as <span class="loc">Devereux</span> Station. A nearby neighborhood on the outskirts of the <span class="loc">Clifton</span> ZIP code has this name. Development of a village at the siding began in <span class="date">1868</span> when a railroad depot, named <span class="loc">Clifton</span> Station, was constructed. Unlike most areas in Northern <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, the land around <span class="loc">Clifton</span> is far less built up than nearby areas, especially to its east and southwest. This was out of the worry that the overdevelopment near the <span class="org">Bull</span> Run and <span class="loc">Occoquan River</span> would be environmentally damaging to the <span class="loc">Occoquan</span> Reservoir. Consequently, as development edged near the area in <span class="date">the late 1970s</span> and <span class="date">early 1980</span>, an ordinance was enacted stating that only one building could be placed on 5-acre (20,000 m2) parcels that have not already been divided. <span class="date">Today</span>, the southern and eastern portions of the area are heavily forested, with single-family homes, while the northern area became equestrian areas.</p><br><br>
