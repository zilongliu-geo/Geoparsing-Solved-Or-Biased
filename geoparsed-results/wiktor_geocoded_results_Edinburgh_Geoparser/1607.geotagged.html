<p><span class="loc">Newton</span> (or Newton-in-the-Isle) is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">Fenland district</span> of <span class="loc">north Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, four miles to the north of <span class="loc">Wisbech</span>. It was formerly also known as <span class="loc">Newton</span> in the Isle or <span class="loc">Newton</span> on the Isle, where "isle" refers to the <span class="loc">Isle of Ely</span>. The village is situated on the Silt Fen, a sea bank formed thousands of years ago. Unlike the salt marshes to the north or the formerly water-logged fens to the south, this narrow strip (also known as the <span class="loc">Townland</span>) has been inhabited for many centuries. Its location as a corridor for trade brought wealth to the villages during medieval times in an otherwise relatively poor area. <span class="loc">Newton</span>, however, was not listed in the Domesday Book and was thus probably settled later, with its first mention appearing in 1210. The College of St Mary by the Sea was founded here during the reign of Henry IV by Sir John Colville. The lands were given to the rectory of <span class="loc">Newton</span> when the college was dissolved by Henry VIII. <span class="loc">Newton</span>, <span class="loc">South Cambridgeshire Media</span> related to <span class="loc">Newton</span>, <span class="loc">Fenland</span> at Wikimedia Commons</p>
