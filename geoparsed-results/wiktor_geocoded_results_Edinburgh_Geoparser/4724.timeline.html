  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Newmarket is a market town in the English <span class="loc">county of Suffolk</span>, approximately 65 miles (105 kilometres) north of <span class="loc">London</span>. It is generally considered the birthplace and global centre of thoroughbred horse racing and a potential World Heritage Site. It is a major local business cluster, with annual investment rivalling that of the Cambridge Science Park, the other major cluster in the region. It is the largest racehorse training centre in <span class="loc">Britain</span>, the largest racehorse breeding centre in the country, home to most major British horseracing institutions, and a key global centre for horse health. Two Classic races, and an additional three British Champions Series races are held at Newmarket every year. The town has been a centre for British royalty since <span class="per">James I</span>, and was also a home to <span class="per">Charles I</span>, <span class="per">Charles II</span> and many monarchs since. The current monarch, <span class="per">Queen Elizabeth</span>, regularly visits the town to see her horses in training. Newmarket has over fifty horse training stables, two large racetracks, The <span class="loc">Rowley</span> Mile and The <span class="date">July</span> Course and one of the most extensive and prestigious horse training grounds in the world. The town is home to over 3,000 racehorses, and it is estimated that one in every three local jobs is related to horse racing. The town is home to the National <span class="org">Horseracing Museum</span>, the Home of Horseracing project, Tattersalls, the racehorse auctioneers and two of the world's foremost equine hospitals for horse health. The town is surrounded by over sixty horse breeding studs. On account of its leading position in the multibillion-pound horse racing and breeding industry, it is also a major export centre.</p><br><br>
