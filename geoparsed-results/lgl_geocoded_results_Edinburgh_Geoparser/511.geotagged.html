<p>Longtime bus driver retires. Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, Ohio — After 32 years driving the same bus route, Jerry Purdin knows the riders by name. "Instead of riders, they felt more like a family, each and every one of them," he said. Purdin, 71, drove the <span class="loc">Springfield City</span> Area Transit Villa Road route for the last time on Thursday, March 26, joined by his family. He will retire effective today, march 31, after 35 years working for the Springfield Bus Co. In his time, Purdin has seen a lot of changes. The first buses he drove lacked wheelchair lifts, window defrosters and air conditioners. In summer, drivers kept the doors open to stay cool. He enjoyed his relationship with the riders and his colleagues. "I got to talk to people every day and I like people," he said. "Throughout the years, I met all kinds of people." Purdin once drove presidential candidate and former <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Sen. Bob Dole around <span class="loc">Ohio</span> when he chartered a bus. "Every time we stopped the bus, you had guys standing there from D.C. and they had these big guns," Purdin said. Rhonda Moore has worked with Purdin for 18 years. She didn't know if she would like him. On her first day driving alone, he yelled at her for a bad parking job. "But he's a big softy, he's been fun," she said. "He's like a big kid." Purdin likes to go all out and dress up for holidays, said Michelle Taber, SCAT operations manager. "He was always on time, always here and always had a smile on his face," she said. He intends to travel to <span class="loc">Hawaii</span> and drive to <span class="loc">Florida</span>. "I love driving," Purdin said. "That's a bus driver's holiday — to drive."</p>
