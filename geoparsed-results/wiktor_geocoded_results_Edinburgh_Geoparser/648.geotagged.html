<p><span class="loc">Bor</span> is a town and <span class="loc">district of Niğde</span> Province in the Central <span class="loc">Anatolia region</span> of <span class="loc">Turkey</span>, 14 km (8.7 mi) north of the <span class="loc">city of Niğde</span>, on a high plain (altitude 1,100 m (3,600 ft)). The district's population is 59,919 of which 38,320 live in the town of <span class="loc">Bor</span>. The area is situated just north of the <span class="loc">Taurus Mountains</span>, not far from the <span class="loc">Cilician Gates</span> (Gülek Boğazı), the mountain pass leading to <span class="loc">Cilicia</span> and <span class="loc">Syria</span>, and has long been a place of commercial and military importance. The Hittites and Assyrians gave the area the name Tuwanuwa. In the times of Cyrus the Younger and Alexander the Great it was named Dana and then by the <span class="loc">Romans</span>, <span class="loc">Tyana</span>, (Θυάνα in Ancient greek). The remains of these civilizations can be found in the village of <span class="loc">Kemerhisar</span>. <span class="loc">Bor</span> is a more modern settlement nearby. The plain has been settled since the time of the Hittites, and subsequently controlled by Assyrians, Phrygians, Persians and Ancient Macedonians. The Romans (and from 395 AD onwards <span class="loc">Byzantium</span>) built the ancient <span class="loc">city of Tyana</span> the most southern-most centre of <span class="loc">Cappadocia</span>. During the Byzantine period the town was the <span class="loc">eastern Mediterranean region</span>’s most important Christian centre, as indicated also by its former Turkish name of Kilisehisar (‘City of the Churches’).</p>
