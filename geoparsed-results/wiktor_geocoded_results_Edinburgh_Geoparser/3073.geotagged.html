The population was 5,398 at the 2000 census, and 5,558 in 2010. It is part of the Ottawa–Streator Micropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is located at 41°19′38″N 89°12′3″W (41.327154, -89.200752).

The hills on either side of this valley were, and are to some extent today, laced with springs that still feed <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span>. There were numerous springs in the town itself. One in the vicinity of the once Hunter-Doherty Lumber yard was so large and fast-flowing that the Indians had an encampment there. Remains of this encampment were visible in the early days of the town. There was a large spring that flowed from the side of the hill between East St. Paul Street and East <span class="loc">Devlin</span> Street, down a gully into <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span>. Springs still feed the pond of water at the foot of Number One slag dump on East St. Paul Street. This area is now the "Coal Mine Park" owned by Spring Valley PRIDE. The first drinking water supply was piped from large springs on North Sixth Street.</p>
