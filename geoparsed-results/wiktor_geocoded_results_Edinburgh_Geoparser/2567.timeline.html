  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Helena is an unincorporated community in the town of Arena in <span class="loc">Iowa County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. In the 19th century Helena was a village that played an important role in the manufacture and shipping of lead shot. The buildings of Helena played a key role in the <span class="loc">Black Hawk</span> War of <span class="date">1832</span>, despite being abandoned at the time. Although always situated on the <span class="loc">Wisconsin River</span>, Helena has existed in three different locations. The first village of Helena was staked out by <span class="per">Henry Dodge</span> as a river port convenient to recently discovered lead deposits around <span class="loc">Dodgeville</span>, <span class="loc">Blue Mounds</span>, and <span class="loc">Mineral Point</span>. In <span class="date">1831</span> <span class="per">Daniel Whitney</span>, an entrepreneur from <span class="loc">Green Bay</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, formed a company to build a shot tower on a nearby bluff. Helena was emptied during <span class="date">1832</span> when most of its inhabitants joined militias to fight in the <span class="loc">Black Hawk</span> War. Following the Battle of <span class="loc">Wisconsin Heights</span>, <span class="loc">Black Hawk</span> and his allies fled across the <span class="loc">Wisconsin River</span>. To follow them the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> army under the command of <span class="per">Henry Atkinson</span> marched 15 miles (24 km) and arrived in Helena on <span class="date">July 26, 1832</span>. They tore down many of the buildings to make rafts. Approximately 1,300 men were ferried across the <span class="loc">Wisconsin River</span> at Helena over <span class="date">the next two days</span>. They caught up with their opponents on <span class="date">August 1</span> and conclusively ended the war with the Bad Axe Massacre.</p><br><br>
