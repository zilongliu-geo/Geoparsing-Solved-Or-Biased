<p><span class="loc">China</span> is an unincorporated community in Shelby Township, <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. It spans Shelby and Madison Townships and was for years largely defined by the existence of a general store in Madison Township and the former <span class="loc">St. Anthony</span>'s Catholic Church in Shelby township. Razor's Fork runs between the two sections. <span class="loc">Indiana</span> State Road 62 runs parallel to Razor's Fork in Madison Township, and then crosses the stream and heads north to <span class="loc">Canaan</span>. The origin of the name is not known. In her history of <span class="loc">St. Anthony</span>'s Church, area resident Elma Schafer related a story, which she said was confirmed by Catholic priests, that <span class="loc">China</span> stemmed from the name of Father Munnschina, a priest. In the late 1960s, Mrs. Frances Ringwald, whose daughter Edith and son William "Bud" Thomas, operated the <span class="loc">China</span> store, said she was told that the site had mulberry trees, which suggested silk, which suggested <span class="loc">China</span>. However, <span class="loc">China</span> post office opened on January 30, 1833 and closed on November 29, 1838, years before the arrival of the German Catholics who founded <span class="loc">St. Anthony</span>'s and who were served by Munnschina. The first <span class="loc">China</span> postmaster was Moses Wilder, a Presbyterian minister who had arrived in nearby Madison by 1830, as an agent of the American Tract Society.</p>
