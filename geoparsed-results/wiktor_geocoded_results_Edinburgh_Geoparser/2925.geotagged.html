<p><span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Pocahontas County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 260 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> was named for pioneer John (Richard) Hill, from <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, who built a log cabin near what is now <span class="loc">Lobelia</span>. Most of the early settlers were Scots-Irish and worked in agriculture and stock raising. In the 1800s the town of <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> centered on the educational institution Little Levels Academy. Established in 1842, the school closed 18 years later at the onset of the Civil War. In 1865, the county purchased the building and ran it as a public school through the 1880s, and it became a school of higher order for boys called Hillsboro Academy. The basement of the Methodist Church served as a school of high order for girls called Hillsboro College, or Little Levels Seminary. Eventually the brick Academy was torn down and replaced by a wood frame school for both boys and girls. Later the school was re-built in brick as Hillsboro High School. <span class="loc">Millpoint</span>, in northern <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span>, was once the site of a small industrial village, "including within its limits proper a store, a blacksmith shop, two flour mills, and three homes." One of the mills has been restored and can be seen along Rt. 219.</p>
