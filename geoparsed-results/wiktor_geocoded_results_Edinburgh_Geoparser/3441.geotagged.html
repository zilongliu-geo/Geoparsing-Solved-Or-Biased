<p>Sterling, <span class="loc">Virginia</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Loudoun County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. The population as of the 2010 United States Census was 27,822. It is located northwest of <span class="loc">Herndon</span>, east of <span class="loc">Ashburn</span>, and west of <span class="loc">Great Falls</span>, and includes part of Washington Dulles International Airport and the former AOL corporate headquarters. Sterling is also home to the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office LWX (serving the <span class="loc">Baltimoreâ€“Washington Metropolitan</span> Area), as well as the Sterling Field Support Center, the National Weather Service test, research, and evaluation center for weather instruments. In the beginning of 1962, large farms made up the 1,762 acres (713 ha) of what today is called Sterling Park. Route 7, also known as Leesburg Pike, bordered what used to be Jesse Hughes's dairy farm. Hughes arrived in <span class="loc">Loudoun County</span> in the early 20th century and was a longtime head of the county's Democrats. Fred Franklin Tavenner, who was somewhat related to Benjamin Franklin, operated vast stretches of <span class="loc">Sterling Farm</span> at the southwest fringes of Sterling Park. Tavenner had purchased land from Albert Shaw, Jr., who had inherited it from his father Albert B. Shaw, editor and publisher of the American Review of Reviews. One of Shaw's spreads, totaling 1,640 acres (660 ha), was called "The Experimental Farm" because it was one of the first area farms to receive a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> grant for applying "scientific methods", as Tavenner called them. According to Tavenner, refugees from the Soviet Union ran the farm while Shaw remained in New <span class="loc">York City</span>.</p>
