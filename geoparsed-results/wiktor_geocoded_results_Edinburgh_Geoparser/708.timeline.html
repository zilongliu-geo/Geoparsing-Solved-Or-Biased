  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Weston</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Platte County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,641 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Lewis</span> and <span class="per">Clark</span> Expedition camped out near the location of <span class="date">today</span>'s city hall. <span class="per">Weston</span> was the oldest settlement in the <span class="loc">Platte Purchase</span> of <span class="date">1836</span> and was therefore also the farthest western settlement (thus, "<span class="loc">West Town</span>") in the <span class="loc">United States</span> until the admission of <span class="loc">Texas</span> as a state in <span class="date">1845</span>. Another suggested origin is related to a story about a discharged <span class="org">US Army</span> dragoon by the name of <span class="per">Joseph Moore</span>. He bought the land and then had First Sergeant <span class="per">Tom Weston</span> of D Company, First Dragoons, stationed at Fort Leavenworth across the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River, lay out a town plan. It is this individual the town is named for. <span class="per">William Buffalo</span> <span class="per">Bill Cody</span> was at one time a resident of <span class="per">Weston</span>, and the town was a major "jumping off" point for the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail, the <span class="loc">Oregon Trail</span> and the <span class="loc">California Gold Rush</span>. <span class="per">Weston</span> was at one time the second largest port on the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> river, surpassing both <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> and <span class="per">St. Joseph</span>; however, a flood in <span class="date">1881</span> shifted the river into an old channel some 2 miles away. In <span class="date">1850</span> over 265 steamboats <span class="date">a year</span> docked at the Port of <span class="per">Weston</span>.</p><br><br>
