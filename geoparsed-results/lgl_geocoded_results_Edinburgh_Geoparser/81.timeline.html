  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Connecticut lawmakers consider apologizing for slavery. <span class="loc">HARTFORD</span> â€” Connecticut legislators are considering making their state the first in <span class="loc">New England</span> to apologize for slavery and other racist policies of old. A legislative committee heard testimony <span class="date">Monday</span> on a resolution that would issue a formal, general apology and express the General Assembly's "profound contrition" for the official acts that sanctioned and perpetuated slavery <span class="date">hundreds of years ago</span>. The state's African-American Affairs Commission, a liaison between black communities and the government, is urging legislators to pass the resolution, which it has called "an exercise in reconciliation" and not an effort to determine fault for slavery. The commission's legislative analyst, <span class="per">Frank Sykes</span>, told the legislature's Government Administration and Elections Committee that "opportunities like this must be seized," especially in light of the "giant stride" the country took <span class="date">last November</span> in electing its first black president, <span class="per">Barack Obama</span>. "While this is encouraging," <span class="per">Sykes</span> said, "it should inspire us and challenge us to continue peeling away at the layers of racial discrimination and intolerance. "<span class="loc">New Jersey</span> <span class="date">last year</span> became the first Northern state to apologize for slavery, and at least five other states have done so. Of Connecticut's population of 3.5 million people, about 10 percent are black, according to <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census estimates for <span class="date">2007</span>. <span class="per">John A. Stewart</span>, an associate professor of sociology at the <span class="org">University of Hartford</span>, said he believes the differences between blacks and whites in the state stem from Connecticut's participation in slavery. Among full-time workers in the state, black men earn 70 percent of what white men earn. Black men in the state also are four times more likely than white men to live below the federal poverty line, and black children under 5 are seven times more likely than white children to live in poverty, <span class="per">Stewart</span> said, citing <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census data. "Slavery has left a cultural burden on both the exploited and the exploiters that still permeates our society," <span class="per">Stewart</span> said. The resolution says slavery was practiced in <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> from the 17th through 19th <span class="date">centuries</span>. There were about 5,100 slaves in the colony by the mid-1770s, about 3 percent of the population at the time. In <span class="date">1723</span>, the colony passed an act creating a 9 p.m. curfew for slaves to prevent what it called the "Disorder of <span class="loc">Negro</span> and Indian <span class="per">Servants</span> and <span class="per">Slaves</span> in the Night Season." Violation of the curfew was punishable by a whipping for the servant and a fine for the master. The resolution mentions how Connecticut's wealth grew as merchants participated in the <span class="org">Triangle Trade</span>, which carried slaves, crops and goods among <span class="loc">West Africa</span>, the <span class="loc">Caribbean</span> and <span class="loc">America</span>. It also mentions how Connecticut legislators rejected emancipation bills in <span class="date">1777</span>, <span class="date">1779</span> and <span class="date">1780</span> and how the new state Constitution in <span class="date">1818</span> specifically denied the right of blacks to vote. But it later mentions how <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> changed its ways and played a key role in abolition efforts, culminating in the outlawing of slavery in <span class="date">1848</span>. The resolution would need to be voted on by the Government Administration and Elections Committee, possibly <span class="date">next week</span>, before going to the <span class="org">House of Representatives</span> and then <span class="org">the Senate</span>.</p><br><br>
