  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Korba</span> (Tunisian Arabic: قربة‎  qorbā), ancient Curubis, is a town in <span class="loc">Tunisia</span> on the eastern shore of the <span class="loc">Cap Bon</span>. It was the place of exile of the Carthaginian bishop <span class="per">Cyprian</span> in the year leading up to his martyrdom. Modern Korba is in the Nabeul Governorate and had a population of 34,807 in <span class="date">2004</span>. Ancient geographers and itineraries mention the town Curubis on the African coast between <span class="loc">Clupea</span> (modern <span class="loc">Kelibia</span>) and <span class="loc">Neapolis</span> (modern <span class="loc">Nabeul</span>). The earliest historical record is an inscription from the time of the Roman civil war, which records that the Pompeian generals <span class="per">P. Attius</span> <span class="per">Varus</span> and <span class="per">Gaius</span> Considius Longus fortified the town in <span class="date">46 BC</span>. In the <span class="date">years</span> after the civil war the town was made a Roman colony, colonia Iulia Curubis (Pliny the Elder refers to it as libera, "free"), perhaps as part of <span class="per">Julius Caesar</span>'s attempt to rid his army of older soldiers and at the same time hold <span class="loc">Africa</span> against Pompeian forces. In the year AD 257, the Carthaginian bishop <span class="per">Cyprian</span> was exiled there; his biographer Pontius, who accompanied him into exile, praises the place (12): "provisum esse divinitus … apricum et conpetentem locum, hospitium pro voluntate secretum et quidquid apponi eis ante promissum est, qui regnum et iustitiam dei quaerunt." ("by God's favour a sunny and appropriate place was provided, a refuge secluded as he wished, and whatever was previously promised to be set before those who seek the kingdom and justice of God").</p><br><br>
