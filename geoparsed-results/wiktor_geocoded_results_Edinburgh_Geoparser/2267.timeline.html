  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 21,720. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Hamlin</span>. The county was created in <span class="date">1867</span> and named for <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span>. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Charleston-Huntington-Ashland, WV-OH-KY Combined Statistical Area. The county is probably best known as the birthplace of <span class="per">Chuck Yeager</span>. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> was created by an act of the <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> Legislature on <span class="date">February 23, 1867</span>, from parts of <span class="loc">Boone</span>, <span class="loc">Cabell</span>, <span class="loc">Kanawha</span> and <span class="loc">Putnam</span> counties. By <span class="date">1869</span>, the county had returned much of its <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> territory and absorbed the northern portion of <span class="loc">Logan County</span> and a portion of <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>. In <span class="date">1869</span>, Harts Creek Township (later district) was created from this latter region. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is one of five counties created by <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> since the Civil War. <span class="loc">Hamlin</span>, seat of government for the county, was established in <span class="date">1853</span>. <span class="per">Jesse, John</span>, <span class="per">David, William</span>, and <span class="per">Moses McComas</span> were the first Anglo settlers in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>. They cultivated 20 acres (81,000 m2) of corn, the first ever grown in the area near present-day <span class="loc">West Hamlin</span>, in <span class="date">1799</span>. <span class="date">Later that year</span>, they returned to eastern Virginia to get their families. Their families were initially left behind because it was not known if there were any hostile Native Americans in the area, or if the soil would be suitable for cultivation. <span class="per">John Lucas</span>, <span class="per">William Hinch</span>, and <span class="per">John Johnson</span> soon joined the McComases in the county. They built cabins in the county around <span class="date">1800</span>. About <span class="date">1804</span>, <span class="per">William Wirt</span> <span class="loc">Brumfield</span> settled at the mouth of Big Ugly Creek.</p><br><br>
