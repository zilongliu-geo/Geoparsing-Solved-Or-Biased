  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Edison is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Skagit County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 133 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is included in the Mount Vernon–Anacortes, <span class="loc">Washington Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. First settled in <span class="date">1869</span> by <span class="per">Ben Samson</span>, it was later named for inventor <span class="loc">Thomas Edison</span>. In <span class="date">1897</span> Edison became the headquarters of a national utopian socialist project known as <span class="loc">Equality Colony</span>, backed by an organization known as <span class="org">the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth</span>. The socialist colony was established on 280 acres just outside Edison and it engaged in farming and timber milling and included a school as well as blacksmith and copper-working shops. The Edison-based Brotherhood also published a newspaper called Industrial Freedom for national circulation to its approximately 3,000 supporters. The socialist community folded shortly after <span class="date">1903</span>, by which time only about 100 colony remembers remained. Edison is located at 48°33′45″N 122°26′11″W (48.562531, -122.436514). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.6 square miles (1.5 km²), all of it land. Famed journalist <span class="per">Edward R. Murrow</span> (<span class="date">1908</span>-<span class="date">1965</span>) graduated from <span class="org">Edison High School</span>.</p><br><br>
