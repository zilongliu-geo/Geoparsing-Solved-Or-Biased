<p><span class="loc">Somerset</span> is a city located in <span class="loc">Bexar County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located less than 20 miles south of Downtown <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> and is part of the San Antonioâ€“New <span class="loc">Braunfels metropolitan</span> area. The population was 1,631 at the 2010 census. English speaking European settlers had already arrived in the area by the early 1800s. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> was named for an organized settlement that had been begun in 1848, in what is now <span class="loc">Atascosa County</span>, by a group of Baptist families from <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The present site was named <span class="loc">Somerset</span> when the First Townsite Company was formed on the Artesian Belt Railroad right-of-way on May 25, 1909, by A. M. Pyron, Carl Kurz, and Jonas A. Kerr. In 1913, while drilling for artesian water, Kurz discovered oil. A boom followed. The <span class="loc">Somerset</span> oilfield extended from <span class="loc">Somerset</span> to below <span class="loc">Pleasanton</span> and was the largest known shallow field in the world at that time. Two oil refineries in the field and a pipeline into <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> handled the high-gravity crude. The town grew rapidly from fifty residents in 1925 to 700 in 1928; it was served by a state bank, a ten-room hotel, and several machine and blacksmith shops. A post office opened there in 1920. A nearby lignite coal mine also added to the booming economy of the area.</p>
