  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mountain View</span> is an Unincorporated community in northwest <span class="loc">Clayton County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is bounded on the east and south by <span class="loc">Forest Park</span>, on the north by the <span class="loc">Fulton County</span> line, and on the west by Hartsfield-Jackson <span class="org">Atlanta International Airport</span>. <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> was originally called Rough &amp; Ready. The name came from the <span class="per">Rough</span> and <span class="per">Ready</span> Tavern, which was a stagecoach stop on the line from <span class="loc">Macon</span> to Upper <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. The town was later the site of the first railroad station south of <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> on the <span class="loc">Macon</span> and Western Railroad, 13 miles from the terminus at <span class="loc">East Point</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. In <span class="date">August 1864</span>, prior to the Battle of <span class="loc">Jonesborough</span>, the <span class="per">Rough</span> and <span class="per">Ready</span> Tavern served briefly as headquarters for Confederate General <span class="per">William J Hardee</span>. Its name was changed when it was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1956</span>. The name "<span class="loc">Mountain View</span>" refers to the fact that, on <span class="date">a clear day</span>, one can see <span class="loc">Stone Mountain</span> 20 miles to the east. The slogan, "<span class="org">Gateway</span> to <span class="loc">Clayton County</span>," was featured on the city seal. <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> was a city from <span class="date">1956</span> to <span class="date">January 1978</span>, when the <span class="org">Georgia General Assembly</span> voted to repeal the city charter. A five-member delegation of <span class="loc">Clayton County</span> legislators proposed a bill to abolish the city in order to clean up corruption in the city government. During his four terms in office (<span class="date">1972</span>-<span class="date">1977</span>) Mayor <span class="per">Ray King</span>, though popular with his constituents, was charged with bribery, nepotism, conspiracy, assault, and violating the city charter by accepting an illegal salary. Rather than reform the city leadership, <span class="loc">Clayton County</span> sought to dissolve <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> entirely. State Representative <span class="per">Rudolph Johnson</span> of <span class="per">Morrow</span>, chair of the delegation said, “They’ve had controversy out there for <span class="date">20 years</span>. It’s an accumulation of things, really.”</p><br><br>
