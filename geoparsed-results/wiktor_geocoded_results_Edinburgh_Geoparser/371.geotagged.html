<p>Kingston is a small village and parish in the East of <span class="loc">England</span> region and the <span class="loc">county Cambridgeshire</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. Situated 7 miles to the west of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, the population at the time of the 2001 census was 214. The ancient parish is 1,907 acres (772 ha) in size, at an altitude of between 80 and 250 feet. The land is largely agricultural, with <span class="loc">Kingston Wood</span> covering around 100 acres. The discovery of Bronze Age and Iron Age flint tools and pottery in the parish indicate that Kingston's location on a gravel spur above two streams has been occupied for millennia. Additional finds in the <span class="loc">Old Rectory</span> garden suggest there may also have been a Roman villa site here. The name Kingston, meaning "the king's manor", implies that the village was, prior to the Norman Conquest, a royal vill. It remained in the possession of the crown at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. The village thrived in medieval times, and was the third most-populous parish in Longstow hundred in 1327. In 1306 the lord of the manor, Constantine Mortimer, was granted the right to hold a weekly market on Tuesdays, as well as two annual fairs around the festivals of St Margaret and <span class="loc">St Luke</span> (19–21 July and 17–19 October). The market and fairs lapsed at some point over the next few centuries and the population fell sharply to leave Kingston as one of the smallest parishes by population. There are a number of late medieval houses remaining, and many others date from the 17th and 18th centuries. There are 21 listed buildings and structures in the village.</p>
