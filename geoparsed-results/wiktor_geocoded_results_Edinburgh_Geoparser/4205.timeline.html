  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Picacho</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Imperial County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> 29 miles (47 km) south-southeast of <span class="loc">Palo Verde</span>, at an elevation of 203 feet (62 m). <span class="loc">Picacho</span>, <span class="date">now</span> a ghost town, was an early mining town on the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span>. It was named <span class="loc">Picacho</span> (Spanish for "big peak") after a nearby mountain of the same name. The original townsite itself is beneath <span class="org">Imperial</span> Reservoir, but remains of some of the ore mills are above the lake level. The area is within <span class="org">Picacho State Recreation Area</span>. The site is <span class="date">now</span> registered as <span class="loc">California</span> Historical Landmark #193. Spaniards probably mined placer gold in the area as early as <span class="date">1780</span>. The area became very active when prospector <span class="per">Jose Maria Mendivil</span> discovered gold veins in the nearby hills in the early 1860s. Prospectors originally used the dry placering method because the scarcity of water did not permit regular gold panning methods. Dry placering consisted of shoveling sand and gravel onto a blanket and shaking the blanket until only the heavier gold particles remain. A "blanketful" of gold could yield over $20 in gold at <span class="date">1860</span>'s prices.</p><br><br>
