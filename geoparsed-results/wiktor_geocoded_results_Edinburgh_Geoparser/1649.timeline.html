  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> de la <span class="per">Ribera de Tarma</span> is the capital <span class="loc">city of Tarma</span> Province in <span class="loc">Junín Region</span>, Perú. The <span class="loc">city of Tarma</span> is located in the center of the <span class="loc">Tarma Province</span>; 232 kilometers east of the <span class="loc">city of Lima</span>, in the mountain ranges of the <span class="loc">Andes</span>. Its location is the point of nexus between the central coast (departments of <span class="loc">Lima</span> and <span class="loc">Ica</span>), the <span class="loc">Andean provinces</span> of the department of Junín and the Central Forest (<span class="loc">provinces of Chanchamayo and Satipo</span>). The city is situated within a fertile valley, where many important civilizations lived in <span class="date">the past</span>, from pre-Inca cultures to the <span class="loc">Inca</span> Culture. <span class="org">Evidence</span> can be found through archaeological remains. Recent archaeological excavations show that prior to <span class="loc">Inca</span> occupation, the gorges of <span class="per">Tarma</span> were settled by many ethnic groups. The Chinchaycocha were to the northwest, mainly what is <span class="date">today</span> <span class="loc">Oroya</span> and northern part of the valley. The xauxa settled to the southern part, south of <span class="loc">Tarma</span> river. A small group called <span class="loc">Palcamayo</span> settled to the east section. When the <span class="loc">Inca</span> arrived, they built up a new province in <span class="per">Tarma</span>. They took away people and territory from the former ethnic groups and building a strategic political province, which allowed them to better control the large ethnic groups of Chinchaycocha, <span class="per">Xauxa</span> and <span class="per">Wanka</span>. <span class="per">Tarma</span> became a sort of puffer zone for the <span class="loc">Inca</span>. The capital of the <span class="loc">Inca province</span> was <span class="loc">Tarmatambo</span>.</p><br><br>
