<p>Albany is a northern suburb of <span class="loc">Auckland</span>, one of the several cities in northern <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. The name derives from Alba (Gaelic for <span class="loc">Scotland</span>) and its Latinisation. It is located to the north of the <span class="loc">Waitemata Harbour</span>, 15 kilometres northwest of the <span class="loc">Auckland city</span> centre. The suburb is in the <span class="loc">Albany ward</span>, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of <span class="loc">Auckland City</span>. One of the city's newest suburbs, it was until relatively recently a town in its own right, and still has a feeling of not being truly a part of the city, which lies predominantly to the southeast of it. Much of the land to the north of <span class="loc">Albany</span> is still semi-rural. The Māori name for the area was <span class="loc">Okahukura</span> (literally, 'place of rainbows' or 'place of butterflies'). The town was originally known as <span class="loc">Lucas Creek</span>, but was renamed in 1890 after Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, a son of Queen Victoria. In 2005, there were plans to turn a major swath of Albany into a planned mini-urban centre, described as a "happy mix of businesses, hotels, shops, apartments, and entertainment (including) an environment of parks and lakes and of tree-lined streets, paths and cycleways linking to the new Albany park-and-ride bus station and the rapid-busway lanes along the Northern Motorway to downtown <span class="loc">Auckland</span>", according to a newspaper report. It would be home to 10,000 people. Authorities wanted sound-proofed apartments against outside noise. Initial plans called for hotels, library, municipal swimming pool as well as the headquarters for the North Shore City Council. In some respects, development has proceeded accordingly, but the 2008–09 economic downturn has blunted some of this activity.</p>
