  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Bethany is a town in New <span class="loc">Haven County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,563 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Bethany was first settled in <span class="date">1717</span>, but it was not until <span class="date">May 1832</span> that Bethany separated from <span class="loc">Woodbridge</span> to become incorporated as a town. This slightly remote, sparsely populated, residential town retains its rural character. There is some dairying and agriculture. The town is dotted with reservoirs serving <span class="loc">Naugatuck</span> and, principally, <span class="loc">New Haven</span>. There have been inhabitants in Bethany since before <span class="date">1638</span>, predominantly Naugatucks of the Paugusset tribe and Mattabessitts of the Wanguck tribe. The first European settlers arrived in the area around <span class="date">April 1638</span>, creating the towns of <span class="loc">Milford</span> and <span class="loc">New Haven</span>, with their boundary split down the middle of what is <span class="date">now</span> Bethany. The area of the boundary was settled in <span class="date">1678</span>, <span class="date">twelve years</span> after New <span class="loc">Haven County</span> was organized. In <span class="date">1717</span>, the Amity Parish was accepted by the General Assembly of the <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> Colony and in <span class="date">1832</span>, Bethany was incorporated as a town. The town is named after the biblical place. In the mid-to-late 19th century, the population of the town and the land decreased as parts were annexed by the neighboring town of <span class="loc">Woodbridge</span> and the new town of <span class="loc">Beacon Falls</span> was incorporated into the general geography of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. The population would continue to decrease until about <span class="date">the 1940s</span>, when the population would spike.</p><br><br>
