  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Riverton</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Coos County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, on <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 42S, about 12 miles up the <span class="loc">Coquille River</span> from <span class="loc">Bandon</span>. Route 42S is the former alignment of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 101. The townsite of <span class="loc">Riverton</span> was platted in <span class="date">1889</span>. <span class="loc">Riverton</span> post office was established in <span class="date">1890</span> and named for its situation on the river. Orlando <span class="per">A. Kelly</span>, the first postmaster, was also said to have been the first settler there. In <span class="date">1915</span> <span class="loc">Riverton</span> had a population of 200. At that time <span class="loc">Riverton</span> shipped coal mined locally by steamboat to <span class="loc">California</span>. The first coal mine opened in the county in <span class="date">1854</span> and up to a quarter of people worked in what was then the region's most important industry. <span class="loc">Riverton</span> served as a coal-mining center for <span class="date">more than 50 years</span>. In <span class="date">1940</span>, Riverton's population was 150, and the place served as a trading center for farmers who grew peas. The post office closed in <span class="date">1961</span>. Formerly Riverton Ferry crossed the <span class="loc">Coquille</span> there and as of <span class="date">1969</span>, it was still being operated by the county. At one time the community had a high school and a grade school. Circa <span class="date">1901</span>, there was a Christian Church and <span class="date">today</span> there is a <span class="org">Riverton Community Church</span> unaffiliated with the former one. As of <span class="date">2010</span> there are no stores in <span class="loc">Riverton</span>.</p><br><br>
