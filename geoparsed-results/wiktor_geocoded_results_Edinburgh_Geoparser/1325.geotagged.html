<p>Caldwell is a city in <span class="loc">Sumner County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 1,068. Caldwell was founded in 1871. It is named for Senator Alexander Caldwell. Caldwell was incorporated as a city in 1879. The first post office in Caldwell was established in May 1871. The <span class="loc">Chisholm</span> Trail ran along the east side of the community from 1867 to 1871. In 1887, the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Nebraska Railway built a branch line north-south from <span class="loc">Herington</span> to <span class="loc">Caldwell</span>. This branch line connected <span class="loc">Herington</span>, Lost Springs, <span class="loc">Lincolnville</span>, Antelope, <span class="loc">Marion</span>, <span class="loc">Aulne</span>, <span class="loc">Peabody</span>, <span class="loc">Elbing</span>, <span class="loc">Whitewater</span>, <span class="loc">Furley</span>, <span class="loc">Kechi</span>, <span class="loc">Wichita</span>, Peck, Corbin, Wellington, Caldwell. This branch line was extended to <span class="loc">Pond Creek</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> in 1888, and connected <span class="loc">Caldwell</span>, <span class="loc">Renfrow</span>, <span class="loc">Medford</span>, Jefferson (the original <span class="loc">Pond Creek</span>). By 1893, it was incrementally built to <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. This railroad foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and <span class="loc">Texas</span> Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the "<span class="loc">Rock Island</span>."</p>
