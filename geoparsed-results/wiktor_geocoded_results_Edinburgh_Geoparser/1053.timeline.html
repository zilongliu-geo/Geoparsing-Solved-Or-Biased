It is the administrative seat of the Municipality of <span class="loc">Villanueva</span>. <span class="loc">Villanueva</span> was founded on <span class="date">February 4, 1692</span> under the name Villagutierre del Águila. Like many towns in <span class="loc">Mexico</span> the name of the patron saint of the town was added to the name and it became <span class="per">Villa de San</span> <span class="per">Judas Tadeo de Villa</span> Gutierre del Águila. However, since it was the last town founded in that area of <span class="loc">Zacatecas</span>, it was called <span class="loc">Villa Nueva</span> (new town), and that is the name that stuck. <span class="loc">Villanueva</span> is one of the 58 municipalities of the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Zacatecas</span>. It is located at the southern part of <span class="loc">Zacatecas</span> and is bordered in all directions by a number of <span class="loc">Zacatecas</span> municipalities. Among the municipalities bordering it are <span class="loc">Jerez</span> to the north, Genero Codina to the east, <span class="loc">Tabasco</span> to the south and <span class="loc">Tepetongo</span> to the west. Some parts of <span class="loc">Villanueva</span> have mountainous terrains. It is also crossed by different rivers and other bodies of fresh water. It has a sub-humid temperature and an annual average of 16.9°C.</p><br><br>
