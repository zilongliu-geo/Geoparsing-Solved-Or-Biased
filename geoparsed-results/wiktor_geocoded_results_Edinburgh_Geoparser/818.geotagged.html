<p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, in the <span class="loc">Boston</span> metropolitan area. Situated directly north of the <span class="loc">city of Boston</span>, across the <span class="loc">Charles River</span>, it was named in honor of the University of Cambridge in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, an important center of the Puritan theology embraced by the town's founders. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is home to two of the world's most prominent universities, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> has also been home to Radcliffe College, once one of the leading colleges for women in the <span class="loc">United States</span> before it merged with <span class="loc">Harvard</span>. According to the 2010 Census, the city's population was 105,162. As of July 2014, it was the fifth most populous city in the state, behind <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">Worcester</span>, <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, and <span class="loc">Lowell</span>. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> was one of the two seats of <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span> prior to the abolition of county government in 1997; <span class="loc">Lowell</span> was the other. The site for what would become <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> was chosen in December 1630, because it was located safely upriver from <span class="loc">Boston</span> Harbor, which made it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships. Thomas Dudley, his daughter Anne Bradstreet and her husband Simon, were among the first settlers of the town. The first houses were built in the spring of 1631. The settlement was initially referred to as "the newe towne". Official <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> records show the name capitalized as Newe Towne by 1632, and a single word, <span class="loc">Newtowne</span>, by 1638. Located at the first convenient <span class="loc">Charles River</span> crossing west of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, Newe Towne was one of a number of towns (including <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">Dorchester</span>, <span class="loc">Watertown</span>, and <span class="loc">Weymouth</span>), founded by the 700 original Puritan colonists of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span> under governor John Winthrop. The original village site is in the heart of today's Harvard Square. The marketplace where farmers brought in crops from surrounding towns to sell survives today as the small park at the corner of John F. Kennedy (J.F.K.) and Winthrop Streets, then at the edge of a salt marsh, since filled. The town included a much larger area than the present city, with various outlying parts becoming independent towns over the years: Newton (originally <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> Village, then <span class="loc">Newtown</span>) in 1688, <span class="loc">Lexington</span> (<span class="loc">Cambridge Farms</span>) in 1712, and both <span class="loc">West Cambridge</span> (originally <span class="loc">Menotomy</span>) and <span class="loc">Brighton</span> (<span class="loc">Little Cambridge</span>) in 1807. Part of <span class="loc">West Cambridge</span> joined the new town of <span class="loc">Belmont</span> in 1859, and the rest of <span class="loc">West Cambridge</span> was renamed <span class="loc">Arlington</span> in 1867; <span class="loc">Brighton</span> was annexed by <span class="loc">Boston</span> in 1874. In the late 19th century, various schemes for annexing <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> itself to the <span class="loc">city of Boston</span> were pursued and rejected.</p>
