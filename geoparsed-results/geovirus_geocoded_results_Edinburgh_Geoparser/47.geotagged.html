<p>According to <span class="loc">US</span> health officials, <span class="loc">New York</span> state governor David Paterson has declared a state of emergency in the state as a result of the H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The Associated Press news agency reports that the six-page declaration was issued because at least 75 people have died of H1N1 related illnesses in <span class="loc">New York</span> since April. Three have died from H1N1 related illnesses just this past week. The declaration also says that human cases of the virus are on the rise. Paterson says he issued the declaration because "a disaster has occurred throughout <span class="loc">New York</span> state, for which the affected local governments are unable to respond adequately." The declaration will allow health officials more access to the H1N1 vaccine and the seasonal flu shot. It will also allow for an increase in the number of vaccine doses available in the state and will allow more health care facilities to administer the vaccine, including dentists and pharmacists. Schools with health centers will also be allowed to administer both vaccines.</p>
