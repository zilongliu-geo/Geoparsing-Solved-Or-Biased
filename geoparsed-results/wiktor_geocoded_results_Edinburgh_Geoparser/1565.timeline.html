  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Henderson</span> is a major suburb of <span class="loc">Auckland</span>, in the <span class="loc">North Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. It is located 13 kilometres to the west of <span class="loc">Auckland</span> city centre, and two kilometres to the west of the <span class="loc">Whau River</span>, a southwestern arm of the <span class="loc">Waitemata Harbour</span>. The population was 4,026 in the <span class="date">2006</span> Census, an increase of 123 from <span class="date">2001</span>. The suburb is in the <span class="loc">Waitakere ward</span>, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of <span class="loc">Auckland City</span>. It was named after early colonial settler <span class="per">Thomas Henderson</span>, who started a timber mill in the area in ca. <span class="date">1847</span> to process the kauri trees which were cut from the <span class="loc">Henderson</span> Valley, and upstream from the eastern flanks of the <span class="loc">Waitakere Ranges</span>. <span class="per">Henderson</span> features a large shopping and theatre complex, <span class="org">the Australian</span>-owned Westfield WestCity shopping centre, with numerous other shops and large-scale stores also in the area. On the outskirts of <span class="per">Henderson</span> is the Corban's Wine Estate, a major <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> export wine brand. The <span class="org">Corban's Estate Arts Centre</span> hosts the annual InterACT Disability Arts Festival. <span class="per">Henderson</span> Train Station has recently been expanded to accommodate a second track and a bus depot is planned nearby. The public transport hub has been dubbed "Baby Britomart". The West Wave pool in <span class="per">Henderson</span>, owned by the <span class="org">Auckland Council</span>, was built to host the Aquatics at the <span class="date">1990</span> Commonwealth Games.</p><br><br>
