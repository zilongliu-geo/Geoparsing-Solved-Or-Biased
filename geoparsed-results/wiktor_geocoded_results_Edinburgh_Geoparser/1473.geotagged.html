<p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Racine</span> and <span class="loc">Walworth</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, with the majority of the city located in <span class="loc">Racine County</span>. The population of the portion of the city inside <span class="loc">Racine County</span> was 10,464 as of the 2010 census. Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the area, Native American mounds were constructed near the present location of <span class="loc">Burlington</span>. For example, around 1830, a small Potawatomi village stood in what is now the Town of <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, though it wasn't larger than the present-day city. The earliest certain European presence in what is now <span class="loc">Burlington</span> was in the fall of 1799, when a group of French explorers and missionaries led by Francis Morgan de Vereceones made a portage from the <span class="loc">Root River</span> to the <span class="loc">Fox River</span>, reaching the Fox at approximately <span class="loc">Burlington</span>'s present location. The first European settlers in <span class="loc">Burlington</span> were Moses Smith (the son of a Revolutionary War veteran) and William Whiting. Smith and Whiting had been in the area previously, making a so-called "jackknife claim" to the land (carving their names and the date on trees in the vicinity) on December 15, 1835. The men then left the encampment and returned with Lemuel Smith (Moses' brother) as well as Benjamin Perce, another member of the group. The four men searched for arable land and built a cabin on the east side of the <span class="loc">Fox River</span> (on what is now Wehmhoff-Jucker Park.) Other settlers arrived in the spring and summer of 1836, mostly from <span class="loc">New England</span>; they named their settlement <span class="loc">Foxville</span>. That year, the residents of <span class="loc">Foxville</span> unanimously decided to change their settlement's name to "<span class="loc">Burlington</span>" after the city <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>; the Foxville name continued to be used, however, until that name was officially changed on July 15, 1839.</p>
