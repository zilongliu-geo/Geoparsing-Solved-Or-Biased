  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Brighton</span> /ˈbraɪtən/ is a seaside resort and the largest part of the <span class="loc">City of Brighton and Hove</span> situated in <span class="loc">East Sussex</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically in the Rape of <span class="loc">Lewes</span> in <span class="loc">Sussex</span>, <span class="per">Brighton</span> forms a part of the <span class="per">Brighton</span>/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation. <span class="per">Brighton</span> is at the heart of the Greater <span class="loc">Brighton City</span> Region, a partnership of local authorities and other organisations that signifies <span class="per">Brighton</span>'s wider regional economic significance. Over half of the city's area is open downland, most of which lies within the South Downs National Park and forms part of the UNESCO-recognised <span class="per">Brighton</span> and <span class="per">Lewes</span> Downs biosphere reserve. Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The ancient settlement of "Brighthelmstone" was documented in the Domesday Book (<span class="date">1086</span>). The town's importance grew during the Middle Ages as the <span class="loc">Old Town</span> developed, but it languished in the early modern period, affected by foreign attacks, storms, a suffering economy and a declining population. During the modern period, <span class="per">Brighton</span> began to attract more visitors following improved road transport to <span class="loc">London</span> and becoming a boarding point for boats travelling to <span class="loc">France</span>. The town also developed in popularity as a health resort for sea bathing as a purported cure for illnesses.</p><br><br>
