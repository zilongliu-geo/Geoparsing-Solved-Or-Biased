  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Marcos</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">North County</span> region of <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city's population was 83,781. It is the site of California State University, <span class="loc">San Marcos</span>. The city is bordered by <span class="loc">Escondido</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Encinitas</span> to the southwest, <span class="loc">Carlsbad</span> to the west, and Vista to the northeast. According to historical legends, the <span class="org">San Luis Rey Mission</span> flocks were robbed by a small band of Native Americans in the late 18th century. Fleeing the Spanish troops, the Native Americans escaped to the hills. While pursuing the Native Americans, in <span class="date">1797</span> the Spaniards came upon a fertile valley, which was named <span class="loc">Los Vallecitos</span> de <span class="loc">San Marcos</span> (<span class="loc">Little Valleys</span> of <span class="loc">Saint Mark</span>) to honor the day of discovery: <span class="date">April 25</span>, St. Mark’s Day. On <span class="date">April 22, 1840</span>, <span class="per">Governor Juan B. Alvarado</span> granted Rancho Vallecitos de <span class="loc">San Marcos</span> to his relative, <span class="per">Jose</span> María <span class="per">Alvarado</span>. <span class="per">Jose Alvarado</span> was killed at the Pauma Massacre in <span class="date">1846</span>, and the land was left to his wife; she then sold the land to <span class="per">Lorenzo Soto</span>. In the late 1850s, <span class="per">Soto</span> sold part of his land to Cave Couts, and his family was soon raising livestock. Although Cave Couts owned the land, <span class="per">Major Gustavus</span> French <span class="loc">Merriam</span> from <span class="loc">Topeka</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, made the first permanent settlement. <span class="loc">Merriam</span> homesteaded 160 acres (0.65 km2) in the north Twin Oaks Valley and began wine and honey production.</p><br><br>
