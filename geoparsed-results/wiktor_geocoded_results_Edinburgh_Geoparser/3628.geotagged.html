<p>Davenport is a city in <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,888 at the 2010 census. While the <span class="loc">city of Davenport</span> itself is very small, the area north of the city close to Interstate 4 and <span class="loc">US</span> 27 is experiencing explosive growth. It is part of the Lakelandâ€“Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area. The current mayor is Darlene Bradley, who is serving from 2015 to 2017. The first white settlement in the area now known as Davenport was in 1838 when the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> military set up Fort Davenport during the Second Seminole War, about 12 miles north of the present site of Davenport. The fort was one of a number built at 20 mile intervals along a trail from <span class="loc">Fort Brooke</span> to <span class="loc">Fort Mellon</span>. The fort only lasted a few years. The fort was named for Colonel William Davenport, who served as the local <span class="loc">U.S.</span> commander in the war. There is no known documentary evidence to support an alternative claim that the city was named for a railroad conductor. The modern <span class="loc">city of Davenport</span> had its start in the 1880s when the <span class="loc">South Florida Railroad</span> was extended to that point. The settlement was first known as <span class="loc">Horse Creek</span>, for the creek first recorded on a U.S. Army survey of 1849 which flows past the site to enter <span class="loc">Snell Creek</span> and eventually <span class="loc">Lake Hatchineha</span> in the <span class="loc">Kissimmee River</span> system. A post office was established at <span class="loc">Horse Creek</span> in 1884, and the name of the post office was changed to Davenport in 1886. Davenport was incorporated in 1915.</p>
