<p><span class="loc">La Manga</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [la ˈmaŋɡa]), or <span class="loc">La Manga</span> del Mar <span class="loc">Menor</span> (meaning "The Sandbar of the Minor Sea") is a seaside spit in the Region of <span class="loc">Murcia</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>. The strip is 22 km long and 100 metres wide (average), separating the <span class="loc">Mediterranean Sea</span> from the Mar <span class="loc">Menor</span> (Minor Sea) lagoon, from <span class="loc">Cabo de Palos</span> to the <span class="loc">Punta</span> del Mojón. Historically, it was known by the Romans as <span class="loc">Palus</span> and later by the Moors as Al Buhayrat Al Qsarand. In the 17th century its name changed to Mar Chico, meaning "small sea" and later as El Mar <span class="loc">Menor</span>. Originally, it was a bay opening into the Mediterranean; at either end, volcanic reefs gradually held back the sand and sediment that was dragged along by the sea currents to form a sandy column of dunes and rock vegetation and long beaches in contact with two seas. <span class="loc">La Manga</span> sandbar is cut off by natural channels that keep the two seas in contact with each other; the so-called golas allow water from the Mediterranean into the lake. As such, the space was untouched until the 1960s, when <span class="loc">La Manga</span> was discovered as a tourist resort and underwent a transformation which included the urbanisation of the area and the construction of tourist infrastructures.</p>
