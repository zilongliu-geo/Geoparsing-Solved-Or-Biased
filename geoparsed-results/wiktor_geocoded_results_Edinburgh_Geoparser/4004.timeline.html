  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Samangan</span> (previous: Eukratidia; then <span class="loc">Aybak</span> or <span class="loc">Aibak</span>) is a provincial town, medieval caravan stop, and the headquarters of the <span class="loc">Samangan Province</span> in the district of the same name in the northern part of <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>. As an ancient town and <span class="per">major Buddhist</span> centre during the 4th and 5th <span class="date">centuries</span> under the then Kushan rulers, it has the ruins of that period at a place known <span class="date">now</span> as Takht-e-Rustam, which is located on a hill above the town. The earliest known history is linked to the identification of the place by Ptolemy as the place of the <span class="loc">Varni</span> or Uarni and the fortified <span class="loc">city of Samangan</span> on the banks of the <span class="loc">Khulm</span> River, identical to the city on the <span class="loc">Dargydus</span> River, south east of Zariaspa/Balkh. The ruins found here establish the city's founding by Eucratides I, the <span class="per">King of Bactria</span>. It was then known as Eukratidia, the size of the present <span class="loc">Khulm city</span>. Historicity of the town is dated to the Kushan Dynasty reign during the 4th and 5th <span class="date">centuries</span> when it was a famous <span class="per">Buddhist</span> centre. Witness to this period is seen <span class="date">now</span> in the form of ruins at a place called the Takht-e-Rostam, which is located 3 km from the town on a hilltop. Arabs and Mongols came to this place when it was already famous as a <span class="per">Buddhist</span> religious centre.</p><br><br>
