<p><span class="loc">Halifax</span> is a minster town, in the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale in <span class="loc">West Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The town has been a centre of woollen manufacture from the 15th century onward, originally dealing through the Piece Hall. <span class="loc">Halifax</span> is known for Mackintosh's chocolate and toffee products including <span class="loc">Rolo</span>, Quality Street and Rowntrees. The Halifax Bank and Yorkshire Bank were also founded in <span class="loc">Halifax</span>. <span class="loc">Dean Clough</span>, one of the largest textile factories in the world at more than 1⁄2 mile (800 m) long, was in the north of the town. The premises have since been converted for office and retail use including a gym, theatre, Travelodge and radio station. The town's name was recorded in about 1091 as Halyfax, from the Old English halh-gefeaxe, meaning "area of coarse grass in the nook of land". This explanation is preferred to derivations from the Old English halig (holy), in hālig feax or holy hair, proposed by 16th-century antiquarians. The incorrect interpretation gave rise to two legends. One concerned a maiden killed by a lustful priest whose advances she spurned. Another held that the head of John the <span class="loc">Baptist</span> was buried here after his execution. The legend is almost certainly medieval rather than ancient, although the town coat of arms carries an image of the saint. Another explanation is a corruption of the Old English hay and ley a clearing or meadow. This etymology is based on <span class="loc">Haley Hill</span>, the nearby hamlet of <span class="loc">Healey</span> (another corruption), and the common occurrence of the surnames Hayley/Haley around <span class="loc">Halifax</span>. The erroneous derivation from halig has given rise to the demonym Haligonian, which is of recent origin and not in universal use.</p>
