  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Sycamore family serving as <span class="date">March</span> for Babies am bas sadors. <span class="per">Annika Jones</span> quickly drifts off to sleep <span class="date">Saturday</span>. Nestled in her mother’s arms, content from having just finished a bottle, she sighs softly as she naps. <span class="per">Kristina</span> and <span class="per">Tim Jones</span>, both 27, refer to 9-month-old <span class="per">Annika</span> as their “little miracle.” The couple lost their first child, Hailey, in <span class="date">May 2006</span> just 15 minutes after she was born during <span class="per">Kristina</span>’s 26th week of pregnancy. Two miscarriages followed before <span class="per">Annika</span> was born <span class="date">June 13</span>. “I don’t think, up until the day I went to the hospital, that I would go in and have a C-section and come home with a baby,” <span class="per">Kristina</span> said. The <span class="per">Jones</span> family is <span class="date">this year</span>’s am bas sador family for the <span class="date">March</span> for Babies in <span class="loc">DeKalb County</span>. A fundraiser for the <span class="date">March</span> of Dimes, it will be held <span class="date">April 25</span> in <span class="loc">Hopkins Park</span> in <span class="loc">DeKalb</span>. The county’s walk raised more than $54,000 <span class="date">last year</span>, and <span class="per">Lisa Kijowski</span>, chairwoman of the <span class="date">March</span> for Babies of <span class="loc">DeKalb County</span>, would like to exceed that <span class="date">this year</span>. The <span class="per">March of Dimes</span> is a nonprofit that works to improve the health of babies through research and education. Its goals are to prevent birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality, according to the organization’s Web site. An estimated half-million babies are born premature annually in the country, according to <span class="date">March</span> of Dimes. The <span class="per">Jones</span> family said the organization has provided support and information to them, and they lauded the group for the funding it provides for research and educational efforts. This is the third year they have taken part in the local walk. Team Hailey, which consists of about 30 friends and family members, has raised a combined $13,000 during those <span class="date">three years</span> for the <span class="date">March</span> of Dimes. They accepted the role of <span class="date">2009</span> ambassador family for the local walk so they should share their story, <span class="per">Tim</span> said. “More often, you hear the good stories, where the baby survived,” he said. “We weren’t as fortunate. But it’s a story that people need to hear because it does happen.” <span class="per">Kijowski</span> said the ambassador family usually is “someone who has been truly touched” and has a direct connection with the <span class="date">March</span> of Dimes. “I think people have a tendency to forget when there is not the sight of a physical family or babies there to share their story,” <span class="per">Kijowski</span> said. “Usually, when the ambassador family has shared their story, there’s not a dry eye in the house.” The Joneses’ story starts with Hailey, who was born with Ebstein’s anomaly, a heart defect in which the tricuspid valve is abnormally formed. The tricuspid valve normally has three “flaps,” or leaflets, according to the American Heart Association. With Ebstein’s anomaly, one or two flaps are stuck to the wall of the heart. <span class="per">Kristina</span> had gone to the doctor because she hadn’t felt Hailey move much; after an ultrasound, the doctor told the Joneses that the baby was in distress and needed to be born immediately through a Caesarean section. At <span class="date">26 weeks</span>, Hailey had a 40 percent chance of survival. <span class="per">Tim</span> and <span class="per">Kristina</span> said they were in shock at the news. When a pediatrician told them there would be some decisions to make after the birth, “we both knew what that meant,” <span class="per">Kristina</span> said. “I don’t even think we had time to think. It went really fast,” <span class="per">Kristina</span> recalled. “She lived 15 minutes. That’s it.” <span class="per">Tim</span> and family members were told first; <span class="per">Tim</span> told <span class="per">Kristina</span> when she awoke after surgery. “I don’t know how we went through it,” <span class="per">Kristina</span> said. “I don’t know how we’re here smiling. It’s unnatural. Parents aren’t supposed to see their child die.” Doctors advised <span class="per">Kristina</span> and <span class="per">Tim</span> to wait <span class="date">a year</span> before trying to have another child, which they said was hard but gave them time to grieve. Frequent visits with doctors and specialists led to <span class="per">Annika</span>’s birth <span class="date">last year</span>. Hailey is never far from their minds, <span class="per">Kristina</span> said, and being able to help other babies in her name is an honor. “We can raise this money for other babies, so when other babies are born at <span class="date">26 weeks</span> with a heart condition, <span class="date">one day</span>, none of them dies,” she said. “That’s our passion. We don’t want to see families go through what we went through.” <span class="date">March</span> for Babies For information about the <span class="date">March</span> for Babies in <span class="loc">DeKalb County</span>, call <span class="per">Lisa Kijowski</span> at 815-899-5743.
