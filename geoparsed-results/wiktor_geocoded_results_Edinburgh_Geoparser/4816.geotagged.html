<p><span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 72,321. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Cookeville. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is part of the Cookeville, TN Micropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is named in honor of Israel Putnam, who was a hero in the French and Indian War and a general in the American Revolutionary War. The county was initially established on February 2, 1842, when the Twenty-fourth Tennessee General Assembly enacted a measure creating the county from portions of Jackson, <span class="loc">Overton</span>, <span class="loc">Fentress</span>, and White counties. After the survey was completed by Mounce Gore, the Assembly instructed the commissioners to locate the county seat, to be called "Monticello," near the center of the county. Contending, however, that the formation of Putnam was illegal because it reduced their areas below constitutional limits, Overton and Jackson counties secured an injunction against its continued operation. Putnam officials failed to reply to the complaint, and in the March 1845 term of the Chancery Court at <span class="loc">Livingston</span>, Chancellor Bromfield L. Ridley declared Putnam unconstitutionally established and therefore dissolved. The 1854 act reestablishing Putnam was passed after Representative Henderson M. Clements of <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> assured his colleagues that a new survey showed that there was sufficient area to form the county. <span class="loc">White Plains</span>, near modern <span class="loc">Algood</span>, acted as a temporary county seat.</p>
