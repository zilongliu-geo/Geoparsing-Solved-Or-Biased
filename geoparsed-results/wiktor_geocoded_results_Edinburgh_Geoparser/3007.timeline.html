  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Roseville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ramsey County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, just north of <span class="loc">Saint Paul</span> and east of <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span>. It is one of two <span class="loc">Twin Cities</span> suburbs that are adjacent to both <span class="loc">Saint Paul</span> and <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span> (the other is <span class="loc">Lauderdale</span>). The land comprising <span class="loc">Falcon Heights</span>, <span class="loc">Lauderdale</span>, and southern <span class="loc">Roseville</span> was part of <span class="loc">Saint Paul</span> until <span class="loc">Roseville</span> incorporated in <span class="date">1948</span> and <span class="loc">Falcon Heights</span> and <span class="loc">Lauderdale</span> in <span class="date">1949</span>. <span class="loc">Roseville</span>'s property taxes are some of the lowest in the <span class="loc">Twin Cities</span> metropolitan area, owing in part to the extensive commercially zoned land. Several major shopping centers are in <span class="loc">Roseville</span>, including <span class="org">Rosedale Center</span> and the <span class="loc">Har</span> <span class="date">Mar</span> Mall. The city's per-capita retail spending is slightly higher than that of <span class="loc">Bloomington</span> (home of the <span class="loc">Mall of America</span>), and it has the greatest number of restaurants per capita in the area. The first Target store was built in <span class="date">1962</span> in <span class="loc">Roseville</span> and replaced in <span class="date">2005</span> with a SuperTarget; <span class="loc">Roseville</span> is also home to the first <span class="loc">Barnes</span> &amp; Noble bookstore outside New <span class="loc">York City</span> and the first <span class="org">McDonald's</span> and Dairy Queen restaurants in the state of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. The Dairy Queen is currently on the Preservation Alliance of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>'s list of the 10 Most Endangered Historic Places.</p><br><br>
