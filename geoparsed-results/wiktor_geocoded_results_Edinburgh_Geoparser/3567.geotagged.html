<p><span class="loc">Medford</span> is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Suffolk County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 24,142 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Medford</span> is a community in the southwest part of the Town of <span class="loc">Brookhaven</span>. It is served by the Patchogue-Medford School District, except for extreme southeastern <span class="loc">Medford</span>, which is served by the South Country Central School District, and extreme northeastern <span class="loc">Medford</span>, which is served by the Longwood Central School District. Some neighborhoods in <span class="loc">Yaphank</span> have <span class="loc">Medford</span>'s zip code (11763). The Long Island Rail Road established the <span class="loc">Medford</span> Station in 1843 in a flat wilderness in the Long Island Central Pine Barrens. The station connected to the <span class="loc">Patchogue</span> Stage Road between <span class="loc">Patchogue</span> and <span class="loc">Port Jefferson</span>, and a post office was established. In 1850 the LIRR auctioned the land around the station. The O.L. Schwenke Land &amp; Investment Co. bought 4 square miles (10 km2) and then subdivided the land into 25-by-100-foot (7.6 by 30.5 m) lots which sold for $10 to $75. The land remained poor for farming. According to legend, in a marketing attempt a mock factory with a phony roof was built near the tracks, and when a train neared, tar paper was burned to give the impression that a booming industry existed in the community.</p>
