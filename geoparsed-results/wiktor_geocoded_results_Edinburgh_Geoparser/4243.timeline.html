  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Compton</span> is a city in southern <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, situated south of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. <span class="loc">Compton</span> is one of the oldest cities in the county and on <span class="date">May 11, 1888</span>, was the eighth city to incorporate. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city had a total population of 96,455. It is known as the "<span class="loc">Hub City</span>" due to its geographic centrality in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>. Neighborhoods in <span class="loc">Compton</span> include Sunny Cove, Leland, Downtown <span class="loc">Compton</span>, and <span class="loc">Richland</span> Farms. The city is generally a working class city with some middle-class neighborhoods, and is home to a relatively young community, at an average <span class="date">25 years</span> of age, compared to the American median age of 35 (2010 data). In <span class="date">1784</span>, the Spanish <span class="org">Crown</span> deeded a tract of over 75,000 acres (300 km2) to <span class="per">Juan Jose Dominguez</span> in this area. The tract was named <span class="loc">Rancho San Pedro</span>. <span class="per">Dominguez</span>'s name was later applied to the <span class="loc">Dominguez Hills</span> community south of <span class="loc">Compton</span>. The tree that marked the original northern boundary of the rancho still stands at the corner of <span class="per">Poppy</span> and <span class="per">Short</span> streets. The rancho was subdivided and parcels were sold within the Californios of Alta <span class="loc">California</span> until the lands were ceded after the Mexican-American war in <span class="date">1848</span>. American immigrants acquired most of the rancho lands after <span class="date">1848</span>.</p><br><br>
