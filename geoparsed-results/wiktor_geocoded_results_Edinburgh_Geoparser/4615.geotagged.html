<p><span class="loc">Greenmount</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">district of Tottington</span> amongst the <span class="loc">West Pennine Moors</span>, within the northern area of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, in <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically a part of <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, <span class="loc">Greenmount</span> is 13 miles (21 km) north of <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, 1 mile (2 km) to the northeast of <span class="loc">Tottington</span>, and 2 miles (3 km) to the south of <span class="loc">Ramsbottom</span>. The village of <span class="loc">Greenmount</span> now has its own community web page. The name <span class="loc">Greenmount</span> came into existence in 1848 when the Sunday School was built. It was originally spelt <span class="loc">Green Mount</span>. Some residents of the older generation, who were born in <span class="loc">Greenmount</span>, still write it as two separate words. <span class="loc">Greenmount</span> was, in 1848, part of the outskirts of the village of <span class="loc">Tottington</span>. At first, people who lived near to the Sunday School included the name of <span class="loc">Greenmount</span> in their address and gradually this was extended to the surrounding area and so <span class="loc">Greenmount</span> became a village. The only boundaries which can be traced are the ward boundaries, which came into existence after the Local Government Act of 1894. These were changed in 1979.
