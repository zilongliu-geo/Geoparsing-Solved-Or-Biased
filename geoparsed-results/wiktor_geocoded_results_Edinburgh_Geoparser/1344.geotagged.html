<p><span class="loc">Lake County</span> is a county in the northeastern corner of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 703,462, making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Waukegan. Originally part of <span class="loc">McHenry County</span>, the townships composing <span class="loc">Lake County</span> were carved out into a separate county in 1839. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> is one of the collar counties of the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, <span class="loc">IL-IN-WI Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is located along the shore of Lake Michigan. According to the 2000 census, <span class="loc">Lake County</span> is the 31st richest county by per capita income. The lakefront communities of <span class="loc">Lake Forest</span>, <span class="loc">Lake Bluff</span>, and Highland Park are part of the affluent <span class="loc">North Shore</span> area. Naval Station <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> is located in the city of <span class="loc">North Chicago</span> in <span class="loc">Lake County</span>. It is the United States Navy's Headquarters Command for training, and the Navy's only recruit training center. The county, which was primarily unsettled prairie and was still home to its native Potawatomi Indians, was created by the Illinois State Legislature in 1839. At that time, <span class="loc">Libertyville</span>, then known as Independence Grove, was the first county seat. In 1841, however, the county's residents voted to move the county government to Little Fort, now <span class="loc">Waukegan</span>, where the commissioners had purchased a section of land from the state. <span class="loc">Lake County</span>'s first courthouse was built on part of that land in 1844 and the remainder was sold to pay for the $4,000 construction cost.</p>
