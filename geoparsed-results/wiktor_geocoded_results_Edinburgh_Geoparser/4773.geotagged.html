<p><span class="loc">Venice</span> is a residential, commercial and recreational beachfront neighborhood on the <span class="loc">Westside</span> of the city of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. <span class="loc">Venice</span> was founded in 1905 as a seaside resort town. It was an independent city until 1926, when it merged with <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. Today, <span class="loc">Venice</span> is known for its canals, beaches, and the circus-like Ocean Front Walk, a two-and-a-half-mile pedestrian-only promenade that features performers, mystics, artists and vendors. In 1839, a region called <span class="loc">La Ballona</span> that included the southern parts of <span class="loc">Venice</span>, was granted by the Mexican government to <span class="loc">Machados</span> and <span class="loc">Talamantes</span>, giving them title to <span class="loc">Rancho</span> <span class="loc">La</span> Ballona Later this became part of the <span class="loc">Port Ballona</span>. <span class="loc">Venice</span>, originally called "Venice of <span class="loc">America</span>," was founded by tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney in 1905 as a beach resort town, 14 miles (23 km) west of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. He and his partner Francis Ryan had bought two miles (3.24 km) of oceanfront property south of <span class="loc">Santa Monica</span> in 1891. They built a resort town on the north end of the property, called Ocean Park, which was soon annexed to <span class="loc">Santa Monica</span>. After Ryan died, Kinney and his new partners continued building south of Navy Street. After the partnership dissolved in 1904, Kinney, who had won the marshy land on the south end of the property in a coin flip with his former partners, began to build a seaside resort like the namesake Italian city took it.</p>
