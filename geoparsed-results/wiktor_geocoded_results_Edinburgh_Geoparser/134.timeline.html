  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The Municipality of <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> (Filipino: Bayan ng <span class="loc">Candelaria</span>) is a first class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Quezon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 110,570 people. <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> is the second largest industrial center of the province, after <span class="loc">Lucena City</span>. Among the municipalities in <span class="loc">Quezon Province</span>, <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> has the most desiccated coconut factories and oil refineries, such as <span class="org">Peter Paul Philippine Corporation</span>, <span class="org">Primex Coco Products Inc.</span>, Pacific Royal Basic Foods, SuperStar Corporation, <span class="org">Tongsan Industrial Development Corporation</span>, and others, which employ thousands of people.
