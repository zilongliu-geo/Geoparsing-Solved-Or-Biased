<p><span class="loc">Douglas County</span> (county code DG) is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. As of the 2010 census, the county population was 110,826, making it the fifth-most populous county in <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat and most populous city is Lawrence. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> comprises the Lawrence, <span class="loc">KS Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which is also included in the Kansas City-Overland <span class="loc">Park-Kansas City</span>, MO-KS Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> was opened for settlement on May 15, 1854, and was named for Stephen A. Douglas, a senator from <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The county was practically at the center of the Bleeding Kansas years as leaders in <span class="loc">Lecompton</span>, the territorial capital, wanted <span class="loc">Kansas</span> to be a slave state and leaders in Lawrence wanted <span class="loc">Kansas</span> to be a free state. Because of this, multiple events took place, including the drafting of the Lecompton Constitution admitting <span class="loc">Kansas</span> as a slave state, the sacking of Lawrence, and the Battle of <span class="loc">Black Jack</span>. The first railroad in <span class="loc">Douglas County</span>, the Union Pacific, was built through that territory in 1864. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> is currently served by county commissioners Mike Gaughan, Nancy Thellman, and Jim Flory.</p>
