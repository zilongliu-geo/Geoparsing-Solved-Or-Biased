  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Manhattan among added services. Despite losing $2.1 billion in revenue for <span class="date">2008</span>, <span class="per">American Airlines</span> announced <span class="date">Monday</span> that its subsidiary, American Eagle, would introduce six new regional services, including one from <span class="org">Manhattan Regional Airport</span>. At a news conference <span class="date">Monday</span>, American Airlines representative <span class="per">Dale Morris</span> joked about the company not having gone bankrupt and said that <span class="date">a year ago</span>, high fuel prices would not have permitted the new route from Manhattan to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Scheduled to begin <span class="date">Aug. 25</span>, the twice-daily, non-stop service would offer 50 seats on an Embraer jet. Ticket fares have not been announced. They are expected to cost, one-way, about $40 to $100 more than a flight from <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> International to Dallas, when purchased two to <span class="date">three weeks</span> in advance, said <span class="per">Richard Jankovich</span>, airport advisory board chairman.</p><br><br>
