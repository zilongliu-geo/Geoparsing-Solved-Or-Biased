<p>Dingle (Irish: An <span class="loc">Daingean</span> or Daingean Uí Chúis, meaning "Ó Cúis' fort") is a town in <span class="loc">County Kerry</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. The only town on the <span class="loc">Dingle Peninsula</span>, it sits on the Atlantic coast, about 50 kilometres (30 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">Tralee</span> and 71 kilometres (40 mi) northwest of <span class="loc">Killarney</span>. Principal industries in the town are tourism, fishing and agriculture: Dingle Mart (livestock market) serves the surrounding countryside. In 2006 Dingle had a population of 1,920. Dingle is situated in a <span class="loc">Gaeltacht region</span>. There used to be two secondary schools but they have now amalgamated to produce Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne. A friendly dolphin named Fungi lives in the harbour. In <span class="loc">Ireland</span> the town was developed as a port following the Norman invasion of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. By the thirteenth century more goods were being exported through Dingle than <span class="loc">Limerick</span>, and in 1257 an ordinance of Henry III imposed customs on the port's exports. By the fourteenth century, importing wine was a major business. Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond, who held palatine powers in the area, imposed a tax on this activity around 1329. By the sixteenth century, Dingle was one of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>'s main trading ports, exporting fish and hides and importing wines from the continent of <span class="loc">Europe</span>. French and Spanish fishing fleets used the town as a base.</p>
