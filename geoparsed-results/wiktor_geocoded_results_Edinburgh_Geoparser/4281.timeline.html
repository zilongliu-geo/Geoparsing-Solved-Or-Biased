  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bagdad</span>, <span class="loc">Tamaulipas</span>, <span class="loc">Mexico</span> was a town established in <span class="date">1848</span> on the south bank of the mouth of the RÃ­o <span class="loc">Grande</span>. Moreover, this town is also known as the Port of <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> or the Port of <span class="loc">Matamoros</span>, since it is inside the municipality of <span class="loc">Matamoros</span>, <span class="loc">Tamaulipas</span>. Officially declared non-existent in <span class="date">1880</span>, it is <span class="date">now</span> invisible, covered by the shifting sands of time. A major player in the American Civil War, <span class="date">today</span> few realize it even existed, nor its vital importance to the Confederacy in its struggle against the North. One of the first appearances of <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> was on a map entitled "<span class="org">Map of the Country Adjacent</span> to the Left Bank of the Rio Grande Below <span class="loc">Matamoros</span>, <span class="date">1847</span>." Cotton was the "white gold" that would sustain the Confederacy during the Civil War, and cotton was literally "King" in south <span class="loc">Texas</span>. <span class="per">Richard King</span>, owner of the famed King Ranch, along with several partners, was a major player in the cotton trade during this time period. The arid brush country was soon a bustle of activity as cotton carts from all parts of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, as well as neighboring states, labored on the rutted, dusty roads to transport the cotton first to <span class="loc">Brownsville</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, and then to <span class="loc">Matamoros</span>, <span class="loc">Tamaulipas</span>. From there it was transported by cart to <span class="loc">Bagdad</span>, where it was placed on ships bound for various ports around the world.</p><br><br>
