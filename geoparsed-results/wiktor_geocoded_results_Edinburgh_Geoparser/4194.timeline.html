  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dundee</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Tunica County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> is 12 miles (19 km) south-southwest of Tunica. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> has a post office with ZIP code 38626. The village was founded in <span class="date">1884</span> after the <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> and <span class="loc">Texas Railway</span> was built, and was originally called <span class="loc">Carnesville</span>, for <span class="per">Captain J.B. Carnes</span>, a principal landowner in the county. A post office was established in <span class="date">1887</span>, though a similarly-named <span class="loc">Carnesville</span> required a change of names. "Dundee" was selected from a list. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1920</span> by Gubernatorial (Governor's) Proclamation. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> served as a transportation hub, and a railroad depot was built around <span class="date">1895</span>. Blues musician <span class="per">W. C. Handy</span> once played on the depot's wooden platform as crowds danced. In <span class="date">2011</span>, the depot—the last in Tunica County—was moved to <span class="loc">Robinsonville</span>, where it was restored and made into a visitors center. The "Highway 61 North" <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Blues Trail marker is located in front of the depot. Residents are a part of the <span class="loc">Tunica County</span> School District. Zoned schools include <span class="org">Dundee Elementary School</span>, Tunica Middle School, and Rosa Fort High School.</p><br><br>
