The population as of the <span class="loc">Canada</span> <span class="date">2011</span> Census was 1,688. The following locations reside within the municipality's boundaries: <span class="loc">Dorea</span> (45°00′21″N 73°55′43″W) – a hamlet situated in the southern portion. <span class="loc">Franklin Centre</span> (45°01′42″N 73°55′29″W) – a hamlet located at the junction of Route 202 and Route 209.

"<span class="per">Chemin de Covey</span> Hill" (Covey Hill road) is considered to be one of the premier cycling roads in southern <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. This is due to the impressive climb between <span class="loc">Havelock</span> and <span class="loc">Franklin Centre</span>, the breath-taking views of the <span class="loc">St. Lawrence</span> and <span class="loc">Richelieu</span> river valleys, as well as a surprisingly good quality road surface.
