<p><span class="loc">Antioch</span> (formerly, <span class="loc">East Antioch</span>, Smith's Landing, and Marshs Landing) is a city in Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located in the <span class="loc">East Bay</span> region of the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> Bay Area along the San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, it is a suburb of <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="loc">Oakland</span>. The city's population was 102,372 at the 2010 census and estimated to be 108,930 in 2014. <span class="loc">Antioch</span> is one of the oldest towns in <span class="loc">California</span>. In 1848, John Marsh, owner of Rancho <span class="loc">Los Meganos</span>, one of the largest ranches in <span class="loc">California</span>, built a landing on the <span class="loc">San Joaquin River</span> in what is now <span class="loc">Antioch</span>. It became known as Marsh's Landing, and was the shipping point for the 17,000-acre rancho. It included a pier extending well out into the river, enabling vessels drawing 15 feet of water to tie up there at any season of the year. The landing also included a slaughterhouse, smokehouse for curing hams, rodeo grounds, and even a 1Â½-story dwelling, embellished with a liberal amount of fretwork, that was brought around the Horn to serve as a home for the mayordomo (manager) and his wife.</p>
