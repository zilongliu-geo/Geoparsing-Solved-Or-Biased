<p><span class="loc">Arcadia</span> is an unincorporated community located in <span class="loc">Sullivan County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, just outside Kingsport's eastern city limits. <span class="loc">Arcadia</span>, originally known as the Reedy Creek Settlement, was one of the earliest settlements in present-day <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. Daniel Boone's Wilderness Road ran through this community in 1775. <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> is listed in the National Register of Historical Places which includes the Thomas Fain Plantation. Thomas Fain named his plantation "Arcadia" to which the surrounding community became known. <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> is part of the Kingsport–Bristol (TN)–Bristol (VA) Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the <span class="loc">Tri-Cities region</span>. In 1770, the "Treaty of <span class="loc">Lochaber</span>" established new boundaries between the Native American lands and the settlers. Settlers then moved into what is now southwestern Virginia and Tennessee. Settlers followed the Great Wagon Road which followed the Great Indian Warpath from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and <span class="loc">Maryland</span> through the Great <span class="loc">Appalachian</span> Valley into Tennessee. The portion of this path that went through present-day <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> was later locally called Reedy Creek Road, Old Kentucky Road, and now Bloomingdale-Pike Road. This portion of the road was also part of Daniel Boone's Wilderness Road which allowed those following the Great Wagon Road to continue past present-day <span class="loc">Bristol</span>, through the Reedy Creek Settlement, through <span class="loc">Moccasin Gap</span>, and over to <span class="loc">Cumberland Gap</span> to settle in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>.</p>
