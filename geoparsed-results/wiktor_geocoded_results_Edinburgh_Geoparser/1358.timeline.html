  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Concord (/ˈkaŋ.kəɹd/ not /ˈkɒn.kɔɹd/) is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the town population was 17,668. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau considers Concord part of Greater Boston. The town center is located near where the confluence of the <span class="loc">Sudbury</span> and <span class="loc">Assabet</span> rivers forms the Concord River. The area which became the town of Concord was originally known as Musketaquid, an Algonquian word for "grassy plain". It was one of the scenes of the Battle of <span class="per">Lexington</span> and <span class="per">Concord</span>, the initial conflict in the American Revolutionary War. It developed into a remarkably rich literary center during the mid-nineteenth century. Featured were <span class="per">Ralph Waldo Emerson</span>, <span class="per">Nathaniel Hawthorne</span>, Bronson <span class="per">Alcott</span>, <span class="per">Louisa May Alcott</span> and <span class="per">Henry David Thoreau</span>, all of whose homes are preserved in modern-day Concord. The now-ubiquitous Concord grape was developed here. The area which became the town of Concord was originally known as "Musketaquid", situated at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Sudbury</span> and <span class="loc">Assabet</span> rivers. The name Musketaquid was an Algonquian word for "grassy plain", fitting the area's low-lying marshes and kettle holes. Native Americans had cultivated corn crops there; the rivers were rich with fish and the land was lush and arable. However, the area was largely depopulated by the smallpox plague that swept across <span class="loc">the Americas</span> after the arrival of Europeans.</p><br><br>
