  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salem</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 28,776 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Salem</span> is a marketing and distributing center north of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, with a major amusement attraction, <span class="loc">Canobie</span> <span class="per">Lake Park</span>, and a large shopping mall, the Mall at <span class="loc">Rockingham Park</span>. The area was first settled in <span class="date">1652</span>. As early as <span class="date">1736</span>, <span class="loc">Salem</span> was the "North Parish" of <span class="loc">Methuen</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, or "<span class="loc">Methuen District</span>." In <span class="date">1741</span>, when the boundary line between <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> was fixed, the "North Parish" became part of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, and was given the name "<span class="loc">Salem</span>," taken from nearby <span class="loc">Salem</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. It was incorporated in <span class="date">1750</span> by Colonial Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span>. In <span class="date">1902</span>, <span class="loc">Canobie</span> <span class="per">Lake Park</span> was established in <span class="loc">Salem</span> by the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Northeast Street Railway Company, to encourage leisure excursions on its trolleys. The plan was successful, and the enterprise quickly became one of the leading resorts of its type in <span class="loc">New England</span>. Crowds arrived from all over, including the nearby mill towns of <span class="loc">Haverhill</span>, <span class="loc">Lawrence</span>, <span class="loc">Lowell</span> and <span class="loc">Methuen</span> in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, and <span class="loc">Manchester</span> and <span class="loc">Nashua</span> in <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. Factory workers and others found respite strolling along tree-lined promenades, between flower-beds or beside the lake. Rides, arcades and a dance hall provided lively entertainments. The rise of the automobile, however, brought the decline of the trolley. But <span class="loc">Canobie</span> <span class="per">Lake Park</span>, one of the few former street railway amusement resorts still in existence, continues to be popular.</p><br><br>
