  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Clinton</span> is a community in the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Ontario</span>, located in the municipality of Central Huron. Established in <span class="date">1831</span>, <span class="per">Clinton first</span> began when <span class="per">Jonas Gibbings</span>, <span class="per">Peter</span> and <span class="per">Stephen</span> <span class="loc">Vanderburg</span> cleared out a small area to start. <span class="per">Clinton</span> started to grow in <span class="date">1844</span> when <span class="per">William Rattenbury</span> laid out the plans to began making a village. In <span class="date">1954</span>, <span class="per">Clinton</span>'s population was 2625 people. <span class="date">Today</span>, it has an estimated population of 3201. <span class="per">Clinton</span> is known as <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s home of radar and has a huge radar antenna in the downtown due to its association with RCAF <span class="per">Station Clinton</span> during World War II. <span class="per">Clinton</span> was known as The Corners or "<span class="loc">Rattenbury</span> Corner" in its earlier <span class="date">days</span>. It was named after Sir <span class="per">Henry Clinton</span>, who distinguished himself during the Peninsular War. The <span class="org">School</span> On Wheels, a school car that visited remote Northern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> communities to educate children who would otherwise not have access to school, is permanently on display in <span class="per">Clinton</span> as a museum about education. <span class="per">Clinton</span> was the home of the highly influential 19th-century ethnologist and anthropologist <span class="per">Horatio Hale</span>, who involved himself locally in real estate development and other business and educational endeavours. Several of the streets in the centre of the town were personally named by him. Hale is interred in the municipal cemetery north of the community.</p><br><br>
