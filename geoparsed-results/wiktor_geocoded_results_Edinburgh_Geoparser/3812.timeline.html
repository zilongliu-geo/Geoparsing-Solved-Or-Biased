  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> is an on-island suburb on the <span class="loc">Island of Montreal</span> in <span class="loc">Quebec</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Its population as of the <span class="loc">Canada</span> <span class="date">2011</span> Census was 19,505. It is located on the north shore of Lake Saint-Louis and is bordered on the west by Baie-D'Urfé, on the north by <span class="loc">Kirkland</span> and on the east by Pointe-Claire. It was incorporated in <span class="date">1910</span> and is named in honour of <span class="per">Benjamin Disraeli</span>, <span class="per">Lord Beaconsfield</span>, Prime Minister of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> in the 1860s and 1870s and close confidant of <span class="per">Queen Victoria</span>. It is part of the Greater <span class="loc">Montreal region</span> locally referred to as the <span class="loc">West Island</span>. As part of the <span class="date">2002</span>–<span class="date">2006</span> municipal reorganization of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>, <span class="loc">Beaconsfield</span> was merged into the <span class="loc">city of Montreal</span> on <span class="date">January 1, 2002</span>, joining with neighbouring Baie-D'Urfé to create the <span class="loc">borough of Beaconsfield–Baie-D</span>'Urfé. After a change of government and a <span class="date">2004</span> referendum, both of them voted to demerge and were reconstituted as independent cities on <span class="date">January 1, 2006</span>. However, they remain part of the urban agglomeration of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>. The population of <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> is mostly English-speaking. Most buildings in <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> are single-family homes, with some townhouses and Montreal-style apartment buildings. It may be characterized as a bedroom community. <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> is also home to a recreation centre that contains a pool, an ice rink and a gym.</p><br><br>
