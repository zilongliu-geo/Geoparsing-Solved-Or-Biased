  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Nome</span> (/ˈnoʊm/, Siqnazuaq in Iñupiaq) is a city in the <span class="loc">Nome</span> Census Area in the Unorganized Borough of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alaska</span>. The city is located on the southern <span class="loc">Seward Peninsula</span> coast on <span class="loc">Norton Sound</span> of the <span class="loc">Bering Sea</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, the city population was 3,598. The <span class="date">2014</span> population estimate was 3,788, suggesting a slight increase. <span class="loc">Nome</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">April 9, 1901</span>, and was once the most populous city in <span class="loc">Alaska</span>. <span class="loc">Nome</span> lies within the region of the <span class="org">Bering Straits Native Corporation</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Nome</span> claims to be home to the world's largest gold pan, although this claim has been disputed by the Canadian <span class="loc">city of Quesnel</span>, British <span class="org">Columbia</span>. In the <span class="date">winter of 1925</span>, a diphtheria epidemic raged among <span class="loc">Alaska Natives</span> in the <span class="loc">Nome</span> area. Fierce territory-wide blizzard conditions prevented delivery of a life-saving serum by airplane from Anchorage. A relay of dog sled teams was organized to deliver the serum. The origin of the city's name "<span class="loc">Nome</span>" is still under debate: there are three theories: That the name was given by <span class="loc">Nome</span>'s founder, Jafet Lindeberg: within trekking distance of his childhood home in Kvænangen, <span class="loc">Norway</span>, there is a Nome valley (Norwegian: <span class="loc">Nomedalen</span>).</p><br><br>
