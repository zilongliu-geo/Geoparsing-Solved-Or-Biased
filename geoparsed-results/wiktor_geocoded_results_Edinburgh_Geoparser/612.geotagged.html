<p><span class="loc">San Diego</span> /ˌsæn diːˈeɪɡoʊ/ (Spanish for "Saint Didacus") is a major city in <span class="loc">California</span>, on the coast of the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> in Southern <span class="loc">California</span>, approximately 120 miles (190 km) south of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and immediately adjacent to the border with <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. With an estimated population of 1,381,069 as of July 1, 2014, <span class="loc">San Diego</span> is the eighth-largest city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> and second-largest in <span class="loc">California</span>. <span class="loc">San Diego</span> is the birthplace of <span class="loc">California</span> and is known for its mild year-round climate, natural deep-water harbor, extensive beaches, long association with the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Navy, and recent emergence as a healthcare and biotechnology development center. Historically home to the Kumeyaay people, <span class="loc">San Diego</span> was the first site visited by Europeans on what is now the West Coast of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Upon landing in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego Bay</span> in 1542, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the entire area for <span class="loc">Spain</span>, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta <span class="loc">California</span> 200 years later. The <span class="loc">Presidio</span> and Mission of <span class="loc">San Diego</span>, founded in 1769, formed the first European settlement in what is now <span class="loc">California</span>. In 1821, <span class="loc">San Diego</span> became part of newly independent <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, and in 1850, became part of the <span class="loc">United States</span> following the Mexican–American War and the admission of <span class="loc">California</span> to the union.</p>
