The Parish is in the Local Authority of <span class="loc">Stafford</span> (<span class="loc">Non-Metropolitan District</span>). The ancient village and <span class="loc">parish of Weston</span> was a forest clearing on the outskirts and was part of the Chartley Estate which was sold off in <span class="date">1904</span>.

This small settlement was also located at the intersection of the <span class="loc">London</span> - <span class="loc">Lichfield</span> - <span class="loc">Chester</span> road and the <span class="loc">Shrewsbury</span> - <span class="loc">Stafford</span> - Derby road (the current A51 and A518 respectively). The road from <span class="loc">Stafford</span> originally forded the <span class="loc">Trent</span>. In the late 18th Century a flood washed away the bridge there. It was later replaced by a single arch stone bridge in the 19th century. Weston on <span class="loc">Trent</span> is mentioned in the Domesday Book of <span class="date">1086</span>. In the survey the village is recorded as being as the holding of one of <span class="per">King William</span>'s thegn's named Sperri, having previously being held by a Saxon named Wulfhelm. Assets of the village were listed as half a virgāta of land. Land for one plough, one villager or villein, 3 acres of meadows. There was one Household in the village and the amont of tax per household was calculated at one-eighth of one 'hide'.
