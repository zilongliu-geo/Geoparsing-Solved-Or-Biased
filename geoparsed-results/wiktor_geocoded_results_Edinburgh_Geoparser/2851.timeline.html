  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Charleston</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Cochise County</span> in the southeastern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. It was occupied from the late-1870s through the late-1880s, and was located in what was then known as the Arizona Territory. Located on the west bank of the <span class="loc">San Pedro River</span>, <span class="loc">Charleston</span>'s economy was based on milling silver ore mined from nearby Tombstone in the community of <span class="loc">Millville</span>, located directly across the river. <span class="loc">Charleston</span> is located at 31°38′9″N 110°10′21″W (31.635833, -110.1725), on the west bank of the <span class="loc">San Pedro River</span>, about 9 miles (14 km) southwest of Tombstone. <span class="loc">Millville</span> is located directly across the river, on the east bank. <span class="loc">Charleston</span> was originally settled as a residence for the mill workers in <span class="loc">Millville</span>, on the opposite bank of the <span class="loc">San Pedro River</span>, where two mills were built to process ore from the silver mines of nearby Tombstone. The mills were constructed in <span class="loc">Millville</span> due to a lack of water, needed for refinement, in the immediate vicinity of Tombstone. The mills, one operated by the Tombstone Mill and Mining Company and the other by the <span class="loc">Corbin</span> Mill and Mining Company, processed or "stamped" the silver ore into fine powder in preparation for smelting. The mills began operations in <span class="date">1879</span>, and at their peak from <span class="date">1881</span>–<span class="date">1882</span>, they processed almost $1.4 million in silver bullion in <span class="date">one year</span>.</p><br><br>
