<p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> (county code FR) is a county located in the eastern portion of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. As of the 2010 census, the county population was 25,992. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat and most populous city is <span class="loc">Ottawa</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Ottawa</span>, <span class="loc">KS</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Kansas City-Overland <span class="loc">Park-Kansas City</span>, MO-KS Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> was one of the 33 original Kansas Territory counties created by the first Territorial Legislature of 1855. The county was named after Benjamin Franklin, and is rich in Native American lore, which dates back centuries before <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became a territory. The area was included in a treaty ceding land to the Osage Nation in 1808, and ceded back to the federal government in 1825. After 1825 and prior to 1867, treaties with various Indian nations set off parts of what was later to become <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> for their use. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is divided into sixteen townships. The <span class="loc">city of Ottawa</span> is considered governmentally independent and is excluded from the census figures for the townships. In the following table, the population center is the largest city (or cities) included in that township's population total, if it is of a significant size.</p>
