  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dublin</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Harford County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Dublin</span> was founded in the early 19th century by <span class="per">George McCausland</span> and a friend who migrated from <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. The first record of the village of <span class="loc">Dublin</span> is found in <span class="org">the Act of Assembly Districts</span> of the 18th century, which divided the county into election districts and designated <span class="loc">Dublin</span> the vote place for the Fifth district. Martenet's map of 1878 shows <span class="per">McCausland</span> built a home on one side of what is <span class="date">now</span> Route 440 and a tavern or inn on the other side. The tavern on the southeast side was a long two story building that was very close to the road. The building had a porch on the first and second stories. In old records reference is made of the Mt. <span class="loc">Ararat</span> Lodge of Masons, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, which moved its meeting place in <span class="date">1809</span> from a tavern in <span class="org">Delta</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> to <span class="per">George McCausland</span>'s tavern in <span class="loc">Dublin</span>. The lodge remained there until <span class="date">1826</span>, then moved to the old Masonic Lodge on Bond Street in <span class="loc">Bel Air</span>. On the northeast corner of Routes 440 and 136 was a small log house, with a short circular stairway and a fireplace which was used as a school and referred to as "the academy". Along with several of the older homes, it burned in <span class="date">1971</span>.</p><br><br>
