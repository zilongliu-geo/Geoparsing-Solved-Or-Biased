  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, settled in <span class="date">1796</span>. The town was a coach stop on the Cincinnati-Zanesville Road, later known as the <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> Pike, with an inn, two taverns, a grist mill and a carding mill to process its agricultural products. It would remain a rather sleepy hamlet until <span class="date">the 1960s</span> when it became an affluent bedroom community for people working in <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>. It retains its historic downtown with many other 19th-century houses scattered throughout the community. It is currently accessed from exit 15 off Interstate 71 and exit 50 off Interstate 275, and it is the eastern terminus of the <span class="per">Ronald Reagan</span> <span class="loc">Cross County</span> Highway about five miles northeast of the <span class="loc">Cincinnati city</span> line. The population was 10,251 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is located at 39°14′50″N 84°20′51″W (39.247359, -84.347556). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.30 square miles (13.73 km2), of which 5.29 square miles (13.70 km2) is land and 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2) is water. <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is one of the oldest settlements in <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>, almost as old as Columbia-Tusculum. A log cabin was the first tavern of the community; this was a resting place for teamsters and travelers on the main road. In 1806-7 a number of people from <span class="loc">Montgomery</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> settled around this point for trade and farming, and named the village for their former home.</p><br><br>
