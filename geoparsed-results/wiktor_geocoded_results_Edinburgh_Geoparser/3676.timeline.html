  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jura</span> (/ˈdʒʊərə/ JOOR-ə; Scottish Gaelic: Diùra [ˈtʲuːɾə]) is an island in the <span class="loc">Inner Hebrides</span> of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, adjacent and to the north-east of <span class="loc">Islay</span>. Compared with its fertile and more populous neighbour, <span class="loc">Jura</span> is mountainous, bare and infertile, covered largely by vast areas of blanket bog, hence its small population. In a list of the islands of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> ranked by size, <span class="loc">Jura</span> comes eighth, whereas ranked by population it comes thirty-first. It is in the council area of <span class="loc">Argyll</span> and <span class="loc">Bute</span>. <span class="org">Evidence</span> of settlements on <span class="loc">Jura</span> dating from the Mesolithic period was first uncovered by the English archaeologist <span class="per">John Mercer</span> in <span class="date">the 1960s</span>. There is evidence of Neolithic settlement at <span class="loc">Poll a' Cheo</span> in the southwest of the island. The modern name "Jura" dates from the Norse-Gael era and is from the Old Norse Dyrøy meaning "beast [wild animal] island". In the sixth century, it is believed that <span class="loc">Jura</span> may have been the location of Hinba, the island to which the Irish founder of the <span class="per">Christian Church</span> in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> Saint Columba retreated for prayer and contemplation from the monastic community which he founded on <span class="loc">Iona</span>.</p><br><br>
