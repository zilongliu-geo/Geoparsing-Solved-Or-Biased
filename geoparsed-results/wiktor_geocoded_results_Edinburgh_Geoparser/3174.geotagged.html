<p><span class="loc">Fremont</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Fremont Township</span>, <span class="loc">Steuben County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,138 at the 2010 census. Settled in 1834 as <span class="loc">Willow Prairie</span>, it became the Village of <span class="loc">Brockville</span> when it was platted in 1837. In 1848, it was renamed to honor John C. Frémont, "the Great Pathfinder", in part because there was already a <span class="loc">Brockville</span> in <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. In 1914, the first hospital in <span class="loc">Steuben County</span> was opened in <span class="loc">Fremont</span> by Dr. Wade. <span class="loc">Fremont</span> is located at 41°43′52″N 84°55′57″W, four miles east of the interchange between Interstate 69 and the <span class="loc">Indiana</span> Toll Road (Interstate 80/90) on State Road 120. According to the 2010 census, <span class="loc">Fremont</span> has a total area of 2.22 square miles (5.75 km2), of which 2.21 square miles (5.72 km2) (or 99.55%) is land and 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2) (or 0.45%) is water. As an oddity, someone traveling due east from <span class="loc">Fremont</span> crosses into Michigan—not into <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. This is due to the early 19th century Ohio-Michigan boundary dispute over <span class="loc">Toledo</span> (q.v. Toledo War for details).</p>
