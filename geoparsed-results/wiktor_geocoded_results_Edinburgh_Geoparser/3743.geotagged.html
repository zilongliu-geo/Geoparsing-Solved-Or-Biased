<p><span class="loc">Ayr</span> (/ɛər/; Scottish Gaelic: Inbhir Àir, "Mouth of the <span class="loc">River Ayr</span>") is a large town and former Royal Burgh sitting along the west coast of <span class="loc">Ayrshire</span> in <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is the administrative centre of the <span class="loc">South Ayrshire</span> council area and historical county town of <span class="loc">Ayrshire</span>. <span class="loc">Ayr</span> is currently the most populated settlement in <span class="loc">Ayrshire</span> and the south of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is the 13th most populous locality in <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. The town was established as a royal burgh in 1205, serving as <span class="loc">Ayrshire</span>'s central marketplace and harbour throughout the Medieval Period and remaining a well-renowned port across the Early Modern Period. On the southern banks of the <span class="loc">River Ayr</span> sits the ramparts of a Citadel, constructed by Oliver Cromwell during the mid-17th Century. The town also houses the site of famous Scottish poet Robert Burns's birthplace in the suburb of <span class="loc">Alloway</span>, in the south of the town, which takes in Robert <span class="loc">Burns Cottage</span> and the Robert Burns experience. Across the Victorian era, coal and iron remained the central export of the town, with fishing and shipping also forming a significant sect of the local economy. <span class="loc">Ayr</span> later developed as a seaside holiday resort, aspects of which remain the case today with the continued presence of a Butlins holiday park to the south of the town. The Gaiety Theatre ran various shows across the late 20th century, attracting performers from across the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, and despite its decline throughout the 2000s, it remains in operation today.</p>
