<p><span class="loc">Ivangorod</span> (Russian: Иванго́род; Estonian: Jaanilinn; Votic: Jaanilidna), also known as Ivan-Gorod (Ива́н-Го́род), is a town in <span class="loc">Kingiseppsky District</span> of <span class="loc">Leningrad Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the right bank of the <span class="loc">Narva</span> River by the Estonia–Russia border, 159 kilometers (99 mi) west of St. Petersburg. Population: 9,854 (2010 Census); 11,206 (2002 Census); 11,833 (1989 Census). <span class="loc">Ivangorod</span> is a major border crossing point and a railway station by the Tallinn–St. Petersburg line. It is located just opposite to the Estonian town of <span class="loc">Narva</span>. The town is the site of the Ivangorod Fortress, a prominent fortification monument of the 15th and the 16th centuries. The fortress was established in 1492 during the reign of Ivan III of <span class="loc">Moscow</span> and was named after him. Between 1581–1590 and between 1612–1704, it was controlled by <span class="loc">Sweden</span>. <span class="loc">Ivangorod</span> was granted town privileges and administered as a Russian township under the Crown of <span class="loc">Sweden</span> (who conquered it in 1612 from boyar Teuvo Aminev) until 1649, when its burghers were ordered to remove to a <span class="loc">Narva</span> suburb. In 1617, the Treaty of <span class="loc">Stolbovo</span> was signed between <span class="loc">Russia</span> and <span class="loc">Sweden</span>, which placed the area under the Swedish sovereignty. <span class="loc">Russia</span> reconquered it during the Great Northern War in 1704. Despite other changes in territory and sovereignty, <span class="loc">Ivangorod</span> was considered an administrative part of the town of <span class="loc">Narva</span> from 1649 until 1945. In 1780, <span class="loc">Ivangorod</span>, together with <span class="loc">Narva</span>, was included into Narvsky Uyezd of St. Petersburg Governorate. In 1796, Narvsky Uyezd was abolished and merged into Yamburgsky Uyezd.</p>
