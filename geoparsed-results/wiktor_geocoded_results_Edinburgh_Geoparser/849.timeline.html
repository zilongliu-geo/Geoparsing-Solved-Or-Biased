  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ota</span> (alternatively spelled <span class="loc">Otta</span>') is a town in <span class="loc">Ogun State</span>, <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>, and has an estimated 163,783 residents living in or around it <span class="loc">Ota</span> is the capital of the Ado-Odo/<span class="org">Ota Local Government Area</span>. The traditional leader of <span class="loc">Ota</span> is the <span class="loc">Olota</span> of <span class="loc">Ota</span>, <span class="loc">Oba</span> <span class="per">Alani Oyede</span>. Historically, <span class="loc">Ota</span> is the capital of the Awori <span class="loc">Yoruba</span> ethnic group. As of <span class="date">1999</span>, <span class="loc">Ota</span> has the third largest concentration of industries in <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. It also possesses a large market and an important road junction, found just north of the tollgate on the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway. <span class="loc">Ota</span> is also well known as the home of former Nigerian president <span class="per">Olusegun Obasanjo</span>'s farm, the Canaanland compound of the megachurch Winners' Chapel, and the <span class="loc">Africa</span> Leadership Forum. Traditional Awori <span class="loc">Yoruba</span> folklore tells that Olofin's children, <span class="per">Osolo</span> and <span class="per">Eleidi</span> Atalabi founded <span class="loc">Ota</span> after migrating south from <span class="loc">Isheri</span>. As the town developed, it eventually came to be locally ruled by a crowned oba, called the <span class="loc">Olota</span>, whose ruling privilege came from the <span class="loc">Yoruba</span> traditional home of Ile-Ife. <span class="loc">Ota</span> soon became important in the production and sale of cocoa. In <span class="date">1842</span>, the expansion of the Egba nation brought <span class="loc">Ota</span> under the control of <span class="loc">Abeokuta</span>, however <span class="loc">Ota</span> held a semi-independent status within the Egba kingdom, and remained the capital of the Awori people.</p><br><br>
