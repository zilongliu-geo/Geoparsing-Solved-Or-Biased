  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Carlos</span> is an upper-middle-class neighborhood in the eastern area of <span class="loc">San Diego</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It borders the neighborhoods of Del Cerro, Tierrasanta, and Allied Gardens, the city of <span class="loc">La Mesa</span>, and Mission Trails Regional Park. The "jewel" of <span class="loc">San Carlos</span> is <span class="loc">Cowles Mountain</span>. <span class="loc">San Carlos</span> is geographically defined largely by its proximity to Mission Trails Regional Park and to the man-made reservoir <span class="loc">Lake Murray</span>. The area consists primarily of single-family homes. <span class="loc">San Carlos</span> is in the 7th City Council District and is represented by Councilmember <span class="per">Scott Sherman</span>. The neighborhood is served by the <span class="org">San Diego Unified School District</span>. It contains <span class="org">Daillard Elementary School</span>, Gage Elementary School, Green Elementary School, Benchley/<span class="org">Weinberger Elementary School</span>, <span class="org">Lewis Middle School</span>, Pershing Middle School, and <span class="org">Patrick Henry High School</span>, which serves all three neighboring communities of <span class="loc">San Carlos</span>, Allied Gardens, and Del Cerro. The neighborhood suffered a highly publicized crime in <span class="date">1979</span> when there was a shooting at <span class="org">Grover Cleveland Elementary School</span> (since closed). The principal and a custodian were killed, and eight students and a police officer were injured. A 16-year-old girl who lived across the street was convicted of the murders. The incident inspired the Boomtown Rats song "I Don't Like Mondays".</p><br><br>
