<p><span class="loc">Mayda</span> (variously known as <span class="loc">Maida</span>, <span class="loc">Mayd</span>, <span class="loc">Mayde</span>, Brazir, Mam, Asmaida, Asmayda, Bentusle, Bolunda and Vlaanderen) is a non-existent island in the North Atlantic that has been shown on several published maps at various points in history. It was most often represented as being crescent-shaped and its position has varied widely over time. Early maps drew the island west of Brittany and southwest of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, but it later moved towards <span class="loc">the Americas</span> (<span class="loc">Newfoundland</span>, <span class="loc">Bermuda</span>, <span class="loc">West Indies</span>). It was shown on a Rand McNally relief map as late as 1906. The island first appeared under the name of Brazir, on the Pizigani brothers' 1367 map. It was crescent shaped and sited southwest of the island of <span class="loc">Brasil</span>, on the same latitude of southern Brittany. It appeared as Asmaidas on a map of the <span class="loc">New World</span> accompanying Waldseemüller's 1513 edition of Ptolemy's Geography. Ortelius (in Theatrum Orbis Terrarum) placed a crescent-shaped island in the traditional location of <span class="loc">Mayda</span> with the name "Vlaenderen". While submerged land of the appropriate shape has been found in the area of early maps (at 46°23′N 37°20′W, 20 fathoms down), it is not necessarily that of <span class="loc">Mayda</span>.</p>
