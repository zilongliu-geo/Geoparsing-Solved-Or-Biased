<p><span class="loc">Manchester</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Washtenaw County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 2,091 at the 2010 census. The village is located within <span class="loc">Manchester</span> Township. In 1824 the United States Congress passed the General Survey Act, intended to create and maintain military roads through what was then the west of the country. One third of the funds allocated went to build a road between the strategic army posts of <span class="loc">Detroit</span> and Fort Dearborn, at the little town of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. Known as the Chicago Road, it followed the old <span class="loc">Sauk</span> Trail and opened the entire area for settlement. Also in 1824, the land around today's <span class="loc">Manchester</span> was surveyed by John Mack, who noted it as being "a good mill seat." John Gilbert, who had recently completed work on sections of the <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal, agreed with John Mack, and on May 10, 1826 he purchased 80 acres (32 ha) of land along the <span class="loc">Raisin River</span> at that location. Originally from upstate <span class="loc">New York</span>, John Gilbert resettled to <span class="loc">Ypsilanti</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, in 1831. In 1832, he decided to turn his attention to the extensive land tracts he held in the area. He commissioned the construction of a grist mill along the <span class="loc">Raisin River</span> upon the land he had purchased in 1826. The original plat of the village of <span class="loc">Manchester</span> was prepared by surveyor Hiram Burnham and dated 1833, but was not formally filed until March 25, 1835. The location was chosen to take advantage of water power from the river and named after <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>.</p>
