  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is a town in Isle of <span class="loc">Wight County</span>, in the <span class="loc">South Hampton Roads</span> subregion of the <span class="loc">Hampton Roads</span> region of Virginia in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,089 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is most famous for the curing and production of the <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> ham. The <span class="org">Virginia General Assembly</span> passed a statute defining "Smithfield ham" by law in <span class="date">1926</span>, with one of the requirements that it be processed within the town limits. Currently, <span class="org">Smithfield Foods</span>, a Fortune 500 Company that owns <span class="org">Smithfield Packing Company</span> and others, is the world’s largest pork processor and hog producer. The company, based in <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>, raises 12 million and processes 20 million hogs annually. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>, first colonized in <span class="date">1634</span>, is located on the <span class="loc">Pagan River</span>, not far from <span class="loc">Jamestown</span>. The Native Americans knew this area as Warascoyak, also spelled Warrosquoyacke, meaning “point of land.” Warrosquyoake Shire (with numerous variant spellings, including <span class="loc">Warrascoyack</span>, Warrascocke and "Warwick Squeak") was officially formed in <span class="date">1634</span> in the Virginia colony, but had already been known as "<span class="loc">Warascoyack County</span>" before this. It was renamed Isle of <span class="loc">Wight County</span> in <span class="date">1637</span>.</p><br><br>
