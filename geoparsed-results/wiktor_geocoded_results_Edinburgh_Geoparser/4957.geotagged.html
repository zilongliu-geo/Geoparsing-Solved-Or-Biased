<p><span class="loc">Annan</span> (Scottish Gaelic: Inbhir Anainn) is a town and former royal burgh in <span class="loc">Dumfries</span> and <span class="loc">Galloway</span>, south-west <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. Its public buildings include Annan Academy, of which the writer Thomas Carlyle was a pupil, and a Georgian building now known as "<span class="loc">Bridge House</span>". The Town Hall was built in Victorian style in 1878, using the local sandstone. <span class="loc">Annan</span> also features a Historic Resources Centre. In Port Street, some of the windows remain blocked up to avoid paying the window tax. Each year on the first Saturday in July, <span class="loc">Annan</span> celebrates the Royal Charter and the boundaries of the Royal Burgh are confirmed when a mounted cavalcade undertakes the Riding of the Marches. Entertainment includes a procession, sports, field displays and massed pipe bands. <span class="loc">Annan</span> stands on the River Annan—from which it is named—nearly 2 miles (3.2 km) from its mouth, accessible to vessels of 60 tons as far as <span class="loc">Annan</span> Bridge and 300 tons within a half-mile of the city. It is 15 miles (24 km) from <span class="loc">Dumfries</span> by rail, in the region of <span class="loc">Dumfries</span> and <span class="loc">Galloway</span> on the <span class="loc">Solway Firth</span> in the south of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. <span class="loc">Eastriggs</span> is about 3 miles to the east and <span class="loc">Gretna</span> is about 8 miles to the east.</p>
