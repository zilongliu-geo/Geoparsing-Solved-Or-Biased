  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bangor</span> is a borough located in <span class="loc">Northampton County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, 30 miles (48 km) north of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>, in the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley region of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>'s Slate Belt. It had a population of 5,273 according to the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The borough was settled about <span class="date">1760</span> and first incorporated in <span class="date">1875</span>. The founder and first <span class="per">Chief Burgess</span> of <span class="loc">Bangor</span> was <span class="per">Robert M. Jones</span>, an emigrant from <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span>. He was the prime mover in the establishment of the slate industry in <span class="loc">Northampton County</span>. Slate quarries pepper the area, but only a few are still functioning. A life-sized statue of him, dedicated on <span class="date">September 24, 1914</span>, remains in the town center. In the official program for the unveiling it states "... <span class="per">Mr. Jones</span> in his prime had many charming qualities, chief among which was his constant optimistic disposition." Indeed, if one visits <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span> it is clearly visible that the Welsh heritage made its way to <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, whose stone walls, rectangular gardens, and lovely flowers and greenery mirror those of its Welsh namesake. Around <span class="loc">Bangor</span> one can also see piles of slate residue and shale reminiscent of the area around <span class="loc">Bethesda</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span>.</p><br><br>
