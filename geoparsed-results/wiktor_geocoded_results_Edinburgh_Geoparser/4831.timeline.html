  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Norfolk</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with a population of 11,227 people at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Formerly known as <span class="loc">North Wrentham</span>, <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> broke away to become an independent town in <span class="date">1870</span>. <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> is a rural suburban town on the periphery of metropolitan <span class="loc">Boston</span>, located on an upper valley of the <span class="loc">Charles River</span>. There were a half dozen small farms in the town after <span class="date">1669</span>, the result of a determined effort to populate the colonial frontier. This was seen as a difficult task despite the good agricultural lands, fresh water fishing and fish runs because the settlement was so remote. It was abandoned during <span class="per">King Philip</span>'s War, and when <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> was reestablished, settlers relied on agriculture and cattle grazing with some considerable lumbering and planting of orchards. After <span class="date">1812</span>, three cotton manufacturing companies were established at <span class="loc">Stony Brook</span>, and later in the 19th century <span class="per">George Campbell</span>'s paper mill was opened at <span class="loc">Highland Lake</span> making heavy wrapping and building papers.The town saw a rapid increase in population after <span class="date">1925</span> when a hospital and a state prison were built in <span class="loc">Norfolk</span> on the <span class="loc">Walpole</span> line. Major residential development took place before <span class="date">1940</span> in the <span class="loc">Pondville</span> and Clark Streets section of town with scattered new housing along <span class="per">Seekonk</span> and <span class="per">Main</span> Streets, and suburban residential building has continued since.</p><br><br>
