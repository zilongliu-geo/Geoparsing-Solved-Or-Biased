<p>Site of proposed casino near <span class="loc">Chinatown</span> going to auction. Developers are planning to sell 22 acres near <span class="loc">Chinatown</span> – the site of a proposed Asian-themed casino – at a bankruptcy auction May 16. The site of the proposed Dragon <span class="loc">City Hotel</span> and Resort is bound by Valley View Boulevard, Spring Mountain Road, Wynn Road and Desert Inn Road. The land took seven years to assemble and is zoned for a 28-story, 2,200-room hotel with 500,000 square feet of gaming, restaurant, entertainment and meeting space, according to a press release issued by Chartwell Group, which is overseeing the auction. The sale, subject to approval by a bankruptcy court judge, is a "highly strategic opportunity for buyers to acquire a fully entitled casino site in an unparalleled location," Michael E. Berland, executive vice president and principal of Chartwell Group’s Accelerated Marketing Division, said in a statement. Bidding will start at $27.5 million. The Dragon City resort is one of multiple proposals for Asian-themed casinos in <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> that have not come to fruition. Even before the recession, financing for off-Strip casinos by industry newcomers was difficult at best. In an interview with In Business <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> in 2006, businessman Andrew Lai said his proposed resort had the potential to draw Asian tourists from the Strip and would be a place where Asians – a growing segment of casino customers – would feel at home.</p>
