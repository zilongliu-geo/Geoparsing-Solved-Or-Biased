<p><span class="loc">Henderson</span>, officially the <span class="loc">City of Henderson</span>, is a city in <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the second largest city in <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, after <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>, with an estimated population of 270,811 in 2013. The city is part of the <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> metropolitan area, which spans the entire <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> Valley. <span class="loc">Henderson</span> occupies the southeastern end of the valley, at an elevation of approximately 1,330 feet (410 m). In 2011, Forbes magazine ranked <span class="loc">Henderson</span> as <span class="loc">America</span>'s second safest city. It has also been named as "One of the Best Cities to Live in <span class="loc">America</span>" by Bloomberg Businessweek. In 2014, <span class="loc">Henderson</span> was again ranked as one of the Top 10 "<span class="loc">Safest Cities</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>" by the FBI Uniform Crime Report. The township of <span class="loc">Henderson</span> first emerged in the 1940s during World War II with the building of the Basic Magnesium Plant. <span class="loc">Henderson</span> quickly became a main supplier of magnesium in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, which was called the "miracle metal" of World War II. The plant supplied the US War Department with magnesium for incendiary munition casings and airplane engines, frames, and other parts. A quarter of all <span class="loc">US</span> wartime magnesium came from the Henderson Plant to strengthen aluminium, using 25% of <span class="loc">Hoover</span> Dam's power to separate the metal from its ore by electrolysis. Mayor Jim Gibson's grandfather, Fred D. Gibson, was one of the original engineers sent to <span class="loc">Great Britain</span> to learn the secret of creating the "miracle metal" which would eventually help the <span class="loc">United States</span> and its allies win the war.</p>
