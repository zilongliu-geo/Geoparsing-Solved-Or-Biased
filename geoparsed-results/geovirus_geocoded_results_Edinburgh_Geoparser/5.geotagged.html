<p>A patient was admitted to a hospital in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span> after showing Ebola-like symptoms, according to a statement yesterday by hospital spokeswoman Kerry-Ann Hamilton. Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in <span class="loc">Rockville</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span> admitted another patient with Ebola-like symptoms, but health officials there yesterday night later determined this person had malaria, not the Ebola virus. At the peak of Ebola countermeasures in <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>, almost 900 people there were monitored for the virus after contacting someone who was already sick.</p>
