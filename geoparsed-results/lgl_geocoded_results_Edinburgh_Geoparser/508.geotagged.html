<p>Alleged drug dealer's girlfriend will testify. Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. XENIA â€” The girlfriend of the alleged drug dealer who hanged himself in a <span class="loc">Georgia</span> jail last summer after being snared in a nationwide manhunt agreed Monday, March 30, to a plea deal that should spare her from prison. Chelsie D. Hornsburger, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of money laundering in <span class="loc">Greene County</span> Common Pleas Court. In exchange for her testimony against other members of a drug ring allegedly led by former Yellow Springs resident Umoja Iddi <span class="loc">Bakari</span>, prosecutors recommended she receive probation. The charges, both third degree felonies, carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. Hornsburger admitted to collecting drug debts on <span class="loc">Bakari</span>'s behalf, two of which were $1,000 transactions with members of the <span class="loc">Greene County</span> Drug Task Force, according to court records. "This is a good example of how someone who is naive can be sucked into a drug enterprise," said Suzanne Schmidt, first assistant prosecutor. Hornsburger also admitted to receiving drugs through the mail for <span class="loc">Bakari</span> and mailing drug payments to <span class="loc">Arizona</span> and <span class="loc">California</span>. Hornsburger met <span class="loc">Bakari</span> in 2007 and he told her he was a single dad. She later learned he was still married and operating a drug operation that brought marijuana and cocaine from <span class="loc">Columbus</span> to Yellow Springs for distribution, according to officials. Prosecutors also have indicted <span class="loc">Bakari</span>'s wife, Bekelech M. Asefa, 26, of <span class="loc">Canal Winchester</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span> near <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, who faces 20 felony counts including racketeering and money laundering. She entered a not guilty plea to the charges earlier this month and is free without bond. <span class="loc">Bakari</span> fled the Columbus area last May before police raided several homes he owned there and arrested Hornsburger. Officers caught up with <span class="loc">Bakari</span> near <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> in June, but he hung himself with a T-shirt in jail shortly after his arrest. Police are still searching for Robert McDonald Jr., a former <span class="loc">Greene County</span> resident, who allegedly helped <span class="loc">Bakari</span> sell drugs. <span class="loc">McDonald</span> is wanted on 11 felony charges and also has lived in <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> and <span class="loc">Florida</span>, police said.</p>
