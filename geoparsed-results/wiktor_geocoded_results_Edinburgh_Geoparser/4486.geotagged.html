<p><span class="loc">Kirovsk</span> (Russian: Ки́ровск), known as <span class="loc">Khibinogorsk</span> (Хибиного́рск) until 1934, is a town in <span class="loc">Murmansk Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located at the spurs of the <span class="loc">Khibiny</span> Mountains on the shores of the Lake Bolshoy Vudyavr, 175 kilometers (109 mi) south of <span class="loc">Murmansk</span>. Population: 28,625 (2010 Census). A settlement which eventually became <span class="loc">Kirovsk</span> was founded in 1929, soon after an expedition led by Alexander Fersman had discovered large deposits of apatite and nepheline in the <span class="loc">Khibiny</span> Massif in the 1920s. By the end of 1930, its population grew to ten thousand people, and a mining and chemical plant here was well under construction. Due to the rapid growth, the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee petitioned on January 18, 1931 to grant the settlement town status and to name it <span class="loc">Khibinogorsk</span>. The petition was approved by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee Resolution on October 30, 1931 and the town was subordinated directly to the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee. On December 15, 1934, the town was renamed <span class="loc">Kirovsk</span> after recently assassinated Sergey Kirov, who had been in charge of planning the development of the deposits.</p>
