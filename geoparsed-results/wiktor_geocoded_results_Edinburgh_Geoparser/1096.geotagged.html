<p><span class="loc">Taba</span> (Egyptian Arabic: طابا Ṭāba , IPA: [ˈtˤɑːbɑ]) is a small Egyptian town near the northern tip of the <span class="loc">Gulf of Aqaba</span>. <span class="loc">Taba</span> is the location of <span class="loc">Egypt</span>'s busiest border crossing with neighbouring <span class="loc">Israel</span>. Little more than a bus depot and a luxury hotel (complete with casino), <span class="loc">Taba</span> is a frequent vacation spot for Egyptians and tourists, especially those from <span class="loc">Israel</span> on their way to other destinations in <span class="loc">Egypt</span> or as a weekend getaway. It is the northernmost resort of <span class="loc">Egypt</span>'s Red Sea Riviera. <span class="loc">Taba</span> was located on the Egyptian side of the armistice line agreed to in 1949. During the Suez Crisis in 1956 it was briefly occupied but returned to <span class="loc">Egypt</span> when <span class="loc">Israel</span> withdrew in 1957. <span class="loc">Israel</span> reoccupied the <span class="loc">Sinai Peninsula</span> after the Six-Day War in 1967, and subsequently a 400-room hotel was built in <span class="loc">Taba</span>. Following the 1973 Yom-Kippur War, when <span class="loc">Egypt</span> and <span class="loc">Israel</span> were negotiating the exact position of the border in preparation for the 1979 peace treaty, <span class="loc">Israel</span> claimed that <span class="loc">Taba</span> had been on the Ottoman side of a border agreed between the Ottomans and British <span class="loc">Egypt</span> in 1906 and had, therefore, been in error in its two previous agreements. Although most of <span class="loc">Sinai</span> was returned to <span class="loc">Egypt</span> in 1982, <span class="loc">Taba</span> was the last portion to be returned. After a long dispute, the issue was submitted to an international commission composed of one Israeli, one Egyptian, and three outsiders. In 1988, the commission ruled in <span class="loc">Egypt</span>'s favour, and <span class="loc">Israel</span> returned <span class="loc">Taba</span> to <span class="loc">Egypt</span> in February 1989.</p>
