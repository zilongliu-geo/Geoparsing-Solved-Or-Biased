  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 4,836, making it the least populous county in <span class="loc">New York</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Lake Pleasant</span>. The county is named after <span class="per">Alexander Hamilton</span>, the only member of the <span class="loc">New York</span> State delegation who signed the United States Constitution in <span class="date">1787</span> and later the first United States Secretary of the Treasury. The county was created in <span class="date">1816</span> and later organized in <span class="date">1847</span>. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is one of only two counties that lie entirely within the <span class="loc">Adirondack</span> Park (Essex is the other). Because of its situation in the <span class="loc">Adirondack</span> Park, any development in the county is severely restricted by the <span class="loc">New York</span> State Constitution, which designates the park as "forever wild." There is no permanent traffic light in the county. On <span class="date">April 12, 1816</span>, <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> was created by partitioning 1,800 square miles (4,700 km2) from <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, but due to low population it remained unorganized and administered from <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, <span class="loc">N.Y.</span> until it was recognized as sufficiently organized for self-government on <span class="date">January 1, 1838</span>. The organization process was completed by <span class="date">Summer of 1847</span>.</p><br><br>
