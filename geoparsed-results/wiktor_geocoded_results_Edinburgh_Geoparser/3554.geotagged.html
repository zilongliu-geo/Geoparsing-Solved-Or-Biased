<p><span class="loc">La Playa</span> (Spanish for "the beach") is a bayfront neighborhood in the <span class="loc">Point Loma</span> community of <span class="loc">San Diego</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It is bordered by the <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego Bay</span> on the east, Naval Base <span class="loc">Point Loma</span> on the south, the Wooded Area neighborhood to the west and <span class="loc">Point Loma</span> Village/Roseville-Fleetridge to the north. It lies across a channel from <span class="loc">Shelter Island</span>. The bayside residential area now called <span class="loc">La Playa</span> lies somewhat north of the original <span class="loc">La Playa</span>, where commercial and military ships anchored during the early days of the city. The <span class="loc">La Playa</span> neighborhood includes some of the most expensive homes in <span class="loc">San Diego</span>. The neighborhood is mostly residential and contains two yacht clubs, San Diego Yacht Club and Southwestern Yacht Club. Some bayfront homes have private piers for small boats. The original area known as <span class="loc">La Playa</span> played an important role in the early history of <span class="loc">San Diego</span>. The first European to set foot in what is now California, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, came ashore in 1542 at <span class="loc">La Playa</span>, probably at a small rocky peninsula called Ballast Point. When a permanent European settlement was established a few miles inland in 1769, <span class="loc">La Playa</span> served as the town's "harbor", actually an anchorage where cargo was loaded and unloaded via small boats. Goods were then transported to the settlement by land over the historic <span class="loc">La Playa</span> Trail, the oldest European trail on the West Coast. The anchorage at <span class="loc">La Playa</span> continued to serve as <span class="loc">San Diego</span>â€™s main port until the establishment of New Town (current downtown) in the 1870s.</p>
