<p>Auburn is a city in <span class="loc">King County</span> and additionally <span class="loc">Pierce County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>; with the majority of spatial land area within <span class="loc">King County</span>. The population was 70,180 at the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. Auburn is a suburb in the <span class="loc">Seattle metropolitan</span> area. Auburn is currently ranked the fourteenth largest city in the state of <span class="loc">Washington</span>. Auburn is bordered by the cities of <span class="loc">Federal Way</span>, <span class="loc">Pacific</span>, and <span class="loc">Algona</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Sumner</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Kent</span> to the north, and unincorporated <span class="loc">King County</span> to the east. The Muckleshoot Indian Reservation is in or near the southern city limits. Auburn was originally incorporated as Slaughter, <span class="loc">Washington</span> after Lt. William Slaughter, who died in a skirmish fighting Native Americans which are now apart of the modern day Muckleshoot tribe in 1855. At the time, the main hotel in town was called the "Slaughter House." In 1893, a large group of settlers from Auburn, <span class="loc">New York</span>, moved to Slaughter, and renamed the town to "Auburn." Due to this history, when Auburn was building its second high school in the mid-1990s, there was a grass-roots effort to name the high school "Slaughter High School," but it was eventually decided that the name would be "Auburn Riverside High School," whose mascots are the Ravens.</p>
