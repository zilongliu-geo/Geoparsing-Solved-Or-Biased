  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Butler County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 14,867. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Allison. The county was organized in <span class="date">1854</span> and named for <span class="per">General William O. Butler</span>. <span class="loc">Butler County</span> was formed on <span class="date">January 15, 1851</span> from open land. It was named after Kentucky native <span class="per">William Orlando Butler</span>, a general and hero of the Mexicanâ€“American War, who ran as Vice President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> in <span class="date">1848</span>. Until <span class="date">1854</span>, the county was governed by other counties. Only at this time did it have enough inhabitants to establish its own local government. The first court proceedings were conducted in a small log cabin of a settler. In <span class="date">1858</span>, the first courthouse was completed in <span class="loc">Clarksville</span>. After it was sold shortly thereafter to the local school district, it was used as a schoolhouse from <span class="date">1863</span> until <span class="date">1903</span>. <span class="loc">Clarksville</span> was the first county seat, from <span class="date">1854</span> to <span class="date">1860</span>, after which <span class="org">Butler Center</span> became the seat. Because locals became disenchanted with <span class="org">Butler Center</span> (partially because of its inaccessibility during the <span class="date">winter</span>), Allison was made the county seat on <span class="date">January 10, 1881</span>.</p><br><br>
