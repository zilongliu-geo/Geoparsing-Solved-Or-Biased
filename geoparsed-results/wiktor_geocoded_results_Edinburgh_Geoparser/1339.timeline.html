  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pura</span> is a municipality in the <span class="loc">district of Lugano</span> in the canton of <span class="loc">Ticino</span> in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. <span class="loc">Pura</span> is first mentioned around 751-760, though this is found in <span class="date">a 17th Century</span> copy of the original. In the Middle Ages several institutions such as the monastery of <span class="loc">San Pietro</span> in <span class="loc">Ciel</span> d'<span class="loc">Oro</span> in <span class="loc">Pavia</span>, <span class="loc">Como Cathedral</span>, <span class="loc">Disentis Abbey</span> and the monastery of <span class="loc">Agno</span> possessed property or land in <span class="loc">Pura</span>. The village was part of the <span class="loc">Agno parish</span> until <span class="date">1603</span> when it became a separate parish. The parish church of <span class="loc">San Martino</span> was first mentioned in <span class="date">1352</span>. It was rebuilt in <span class="date">1580</span> and expanded between <span class="date">1642</span> and <span class="date">1658</span>. The village economy was based mainly on agriculture, livestock and the dairy industry. The dairy cooperative opened in <span class="date">1890</span>. Due to limited farming land many of the residents emigrated in the 19th Century. The majority of them went to <span class="loc">Italy</span> to work as brickmakers. In <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, a strong construction boom began. By <span class="date">2000</span>, approximately three quarters of the working population are commuters, especially to <span class="loc">Lugano</span>. <span class="loc">Pura</span> has an area, as of <span class="date">1997</span>, of 3.04 square kilometers (1.17 sq mi). Of this area, 0.67 km2 (0.26 sq mi) or 22.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 2.28 km2 (0.88 sq mi) or 75.0% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 0.53 km2 (0.20 sq mi) or 17.4% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.02 km2 (4.9 acres) or 0.7% is either rivers or lakes and 0.02 km2 (4.9 acres) or 0.7% is unproductive land.</p><br><br>
