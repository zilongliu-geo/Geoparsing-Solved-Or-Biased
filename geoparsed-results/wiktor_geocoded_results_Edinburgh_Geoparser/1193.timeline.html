  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Milan</span> (/ˈmaɪlən/ MY-lən) is a town in <span class="loc">Coos County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,337 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Berlin</span>, NH–VT <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. The city's name is pronounced differently from the English name for the Italian city of the same name. Neighboring <span class="loc">Berlin</span> also shares a similarly distinct pronunciation from its European namesake. Originally named Paulsburg in <span class="date">1771</span> after <span class="per">Paul Wentworth</span>, the town was incorporated on <span class="date">December 16, 1824</span>. In <span class="date">that year</span>, Governor <span class="per">Levi Woodbury</span> authorized a name change to <span class="per">Milan</span>, in honor of <span class="per">Milan Harris</span>. Prior to <span class="date">1820</span> there were but few inhabitants. In <span class="date">1819</span> the population was about fourteen; <span class="date">ten years</span> passed and the number had increased four-fold. Like the other towns around it, <span class="per">Milan</span>'s first industries were lumbering operations, and agriculture was for some time subordinate to this. The firms farms were developed on <span class="per">Milan</span> hill. The soil was warmer, more free from frost, and, for some <span class="date">years</span>, produced quite liberally in response to the labors of the pioneers. But they were not permanently as productive as they gave promise, and many of those settlers who remained south the most valuable lands along the river. Some of the names of the early pioneers of <span class="per">Milan</span> include Ellingwood, <span class="loc">Hodgdon</span>, <span class="loc">Fogg</span>, <span class="loc">Hinds</span>, <span class="loc">Roberts</span>, <span class="loc">Hagar</span>, <span class="loc">Sargent</span>, <span class="loc">Nay</span>, <span class="loc">Twitchell</span>, and <span class="loc">Newell</span>.</p><br><br>
