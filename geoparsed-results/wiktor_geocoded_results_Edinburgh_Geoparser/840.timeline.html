  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ostrov</span> (Russian: О́стров, lit. island) is a town and the administrative center of <span class="loc">Ostrovsky District</span> in <span class="loc">Pskov Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Velikaya</span> River, 55 kilometers (34 mi) south of <span class="loc">Pskov</span>, the administrative center of the oblast. Population: 21,668 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census); 25,078 (<span class="date">2002</span> Census); 29,060 (<span class="date">1989</span> Census); 27,000 (<span class="date">1974</span>). The name of the town, which means "island" in Russian, originates from the island on the <span class="loc">Velikaya</span>, on which the Ostrov fortress was originally built. It was founded as a fortress in the end of the 13th century and first mentioned in <span class="date">1342</span>. It had been an important military outpost throughout the 15th-16th <span class="date">centuries</span>. The only time it was conquered was in <span class="date">1501</span>, by the Livonian Order after the Battle of the <span class="loc">Siritsa</span> River. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in <span class="date">1708</span> by Peter the Great, it was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since <span class="date">1710</span> as Saint Petersburg Governorate). <span class="loc">Ostrov</span> is specifically mentioned as one of the towns making the governorate. In <span class="date">1727</span>, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off and in <span class="date">1772</span>, <span class="loc">Pskov</span> Governorate (which between <span class="date">1777</span> and <span class="date">1796</span> existed as <span class="loc">Pskov</span> Viceroyalty) was established. Catherine the Great incorporated it as a town in <span class="date">1777</span>.</p><br><br>
