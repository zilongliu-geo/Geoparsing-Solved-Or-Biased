<p>Dumpster dive doesn't help fleeing suspect. On Thursday, March 26, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Titus County Sheriff's Office (TCSO) Deputy David Robinson and his canine partner, Browning, were on patrol and attempted to stop a vehicle on Edwards Street in <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> for a traffic violation. The vehicle fled with Robinson's patrol unit in pursuit and <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> Police Department (MPPD) patrol units on the way to assist Robinson. After turning onto West 16th Street, the vehicle's driver, Thomas Wayne <span class="loc">Hellinghausen</span>, 22, of <span class="loc">Winfield</span>, soon exited the moving vehicle and fled on foot. Deputies and officers from both departments converged on the scene and searched the area for <span class="loc">Hellinghausen</span>. As the search continued, MPPD officers located <span class="loc">Hellinghausen</span> in a nearby trash dumpster. As the deputies and officers spoke with the suspect, it was determined that <span class="loc">Hellinghausen</span> had ingested an unknown amount of methamphetamine before he bailed out of his vehicle. <span class="loc">Hellinghausen</span> was then transported to Titus Regional Medical Center to be treated. <span class="loc">Hellinghausen</span> was booked into the <span class="loc">Titus County</span> Jail where he was charged with a state jail felony charge of evading detention with a vehicle; a second state jail felony charge of possession of a controlled substance, penalty group one, under one gram; and a third degree felony charge of tampering with physical evidence.</p>
