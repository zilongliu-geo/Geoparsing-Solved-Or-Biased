  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Weston</span> is a small suburb on the south-eastern side of <span class="loc">Southampton</span>, <span class="loc">UK</span>, predominantly built on the <span class="per">Weston</span> Grove Estate formerly owned by the <span class="per">Chamberlayne</span> family. It also includes the area that was previously the Barnfield Estate. <span class="per">Weston</span> includes part of <span class="loc">Mayfield</span> Park, which was previously the <span class="loc">Mayfield</span> Estate. <span class="per">Weston</span> is bounded by <span class="loc">Woolston</span>, <span class="loc">Sholing</span>, <span class="loc">Netley</span> and <span class="loc">Southampton Water</span>. <span class="per">Weston</span> was originally a small fishing community. The earliest references date to the end of the 10th century. <span class="per">John de Weston</span> is recorded as a Burgess of <span class="loc">Southampton</span> in <span class="date">1332</span>.
