<p><span class="loc">Gondar</span> or <span class="loc">Gonder</span> (Amharic: ጎንደር?, <span class="loc">Gonder</span> or Gondär; formerly ጐንደር, Gʷandar or Gʷender) is a city and separate woreda in <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. Located in the Semien <span class="loc">Gondar</span> Zone of the <span class="loc">Amhara Region</span>, <span class="loc">Gondar</span> is north of <span class="loc">Tana Lake</span> on the Lesser <span class="loc">Angereb</span> River and southwest of the <span class="loc">Simien Mountains</span>. It has a latitude and longitude of 12°36′N 37°28′E with an elevation of 2133 meters above sea level. It is surrounded by the <span class="loc">Gondar</span> Zuria woreda. <span class="loc">Gondar</span> previously served as the capital of both the Ethiopian Empire and the subsequent <span class="loc">Begemder Province</span>. The city holds the remains of several royal castles, including those in Fasil Ghebbi (the Royal Enclosure), for which <span class="loc">Gondar</span> has been called the "Camelot of <span class="loc">Africa</span>". Until the 16th century, the Solomonic Emperors of <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span> usually had no fixed capital town, instead living in tents in temporary royal camps as they moved around their realms while their family, bodyguard and retinue devoured surplus crops and cut down nearby trees for firewood. One exception to this rule was <span class="loc">Debre Berhan</span>, founded by Zara Yaqob in 1456; <span class="loc">Tegulet</span> in <span class="loc">Shewa</span> was also essentially the capital during the first century of Solomonic rule.</p>
