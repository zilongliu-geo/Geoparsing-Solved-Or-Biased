<p><span class="loc">Benton County</span> is located in the northwest part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, along the border with <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. As of 2010, the county's population was 8,854. It contains six incorporated towns as well as several small unincorporated settlements; it is also divided into 11 townships which provide local services. The county seat is Fowler. <span class="loc">Benton County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Lafayette</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Benton County</span> was formed February 18, 1840. It is named for Thomas H. Benton (D), <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senator from <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The original county seat selected in 1843 was <span class="loc">Oxford</span>, but after a long struggle between contending factions it was moved to Fowler in 1874. The current <span class="loc">Benton County</span> courthouse, located in Fowler, was designed by Gordon P. Randall of <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and built in 1874 by Levi L. Leach at a cost of $62,257. The new courthouse was an impressive building from an architectural standpoint, but also provided much-needed improvements in security, including large fire-proof vaults. Randall had designed the <span class="loc">Marshall County</span> courthouse a few years earlier. In 2008 the <span class="loc">Benton County</span> <span class="loc">Wind Farm</span> began operating with 87 1.5 MW wind turbines. Duke Energy purchases electricity from the wind farm and sells it to customers through its GoGreen program.</p>
