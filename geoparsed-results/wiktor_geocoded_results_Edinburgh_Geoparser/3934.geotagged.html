<p><span class="loc">Woodville</span> is a small town in the southern <span class="loc">North Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, 75 km north of <span class="loc">Masterton</span> and 25 km east of <span class="loc">Palmerston North</span>. In the 2006 census 1,398 people are usually resident in <span class="loc">Woodville</span>, a decrease of 81 people, or 5.5%, since the 2001 Census. It appears that <span class="loc">Woodville</span> was a traveller's rest spot in Maori history. It was also a place to rest for hunters as they walked from one side of the Manawatu Gorge to the other. The local iwi were <span class="loc">Rangitane</span>, and maintained strong and positive relations with other tribes for the most part. They arrived at Wharetiti from <span class="loc">Bare Island</span>, <span class="loc">Waimarama</span> and continued northwards to <span class="loc">Tongariro</span>. Local <span class="loc">Maori</span> would construct temporary housing when the <span class="loc">Titi</span> began to arrive and harvest the birds from their burrows, preserving them inside pouches made from bull kelp which they carried up from the coast. It is some years since muttonbirds were last seen on this part of the <span class="loc">Ruahine</span> Mountains. One interesting local landmark is Whariti, one of the main peaks in the <span class="loc">Ruahine Ranges</span> near <span class="loc">Woodville</span>. The name appears to be a corruption of the original name Wharetiti (Whare – house, titi – muttonbird (the Sooty Shearwater)). According to an interview on Radio <span class="loc">Woodville</span> in 2009, the peak of 920 m (2950 ft) gained its name when migrating muttonbird nested on top of the ridges of the <span class="loc">Ruahine</span> mountain range.</p>
