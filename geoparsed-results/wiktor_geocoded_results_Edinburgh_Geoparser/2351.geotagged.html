<p><span class="loc">Peru</span> (/pəˈruː/; Spanish: Perú [peˈɾu]; Quechua: Piruw [pɪɾʊw]; <span class="loc">Aymara</span>: Piruw [pɪɾʊw]), officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Peru</span> (Spanish:  República del Perú ), is a country in western <span class="loc">South America</span>. It is bordered in the north by <span class="loc">Ecuador</span> and <span class="loc">Colombia</span>, in the east by <span class="loc">Brazil</span>, in the southeast by <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>, in the south by <span class="loc">Chile</span>, and in the west by the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. <span class="loc">Peru</span> is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical <span class="loc">Amazon Basin</span> rainforest in the east with the Amazon river. Peruvian territory was home to ancient cultures spanning from the Norte Chico civilization in <span class="loc">Caral</span>, one of the oldest in the world, to the Inca Empire, the largest state in Pre-Columbian <span class="loc">America</span>. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a Viceroyalty with its capital in <span class="loc">Lima</span>, which included most of its South American colonies. Ideas of political autonomy later spread throughout Spanish <span class="loc">America</span> and <span class="loc">Peru</span> gained its independence, which was formally proclaimed in 1821. After the battle of <span class="loc">Ayacucho</span>, three years after proclamation, <span class="loc">Peru</span> ensured its independence. After achieving independence, the country remained in recession and kept a low military profile until an economic rise based on the extraction of raw and maritime materials struck the country, which ended shortly before the war of the Pacific. Subsequently, the country has undergone changes in government from oligarchic to democratic systems. <span class="loc">Peru</span> has gone through periods of political unrest and internal conflict as well as periods of stability and economic upswing.</p>
