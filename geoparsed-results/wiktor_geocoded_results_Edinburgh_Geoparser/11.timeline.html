  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Victoria</span> /vɪkˈtɔːriə/ is the capital <span class="loc">city of British Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, and is located on the southern tip of <span class="loc">Vancouver Island</span> off <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s Pacific coast. The city has a population of about 80,017, while the metropolitan area of <span class="per">Greater Victoria</span>, has a population of 344,615, making it the 15th most populous Canadian urban region. <span class="per">Victoria</span> is about 100 kilometres (60 miles) from BC's largest <span class="loc">city of Vancouver</span> on the mainland. The city is about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from <span class="per">Seattle</span> by airplane, ferry, or the <span class="per">Victoria</span> Clipper passenger-only ferry which operates daily, year round between <span class="per">Seattle</span> and <span class="per">Victoria</span> and 40 kilometres (25 miles) from <span class="loc">Port Angeles</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, by ferry Coho across the <span class="loc">Strait of Juan de Fuca</span>. Named after <span class="per">Queen Victoria</span> of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> and, at the time, British <span class="loc">North America</span>, <span class="per">Victoria</span> is one of the oldest cities in the Pacific Northwest, with British settlement beginning in <span class="date">1843</span>. The city has retained a large number of its historic buildings, in particular its two most famous landmarks, Legislative buildings (finished in <span class="date">1897</span> and home of the Legislative Assembly of British <span class="org">Columbia</span>) and the Empress hotel (opened in <span class="date">1908</span>). The city's <span class="loc">Chinatown</span> is the second oldest in <span class="loc">North America</span> after <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>'s. The region's <span class="org">Coast Salish First Nations</span> peoples established communities in the area long before non-native settlement, possibly several thousand <span class="date">years</span> earlier, which had large populations at the time of European exploration. <span class="per">Victoria</span>, like many <span class="loc">Vancouver Island</span> communities, continues to have a sizeable First Nations presence, composed of peoples from all over <span class="loc">Vancouver Island</span> and beyond.</p><br><br>
