<p>Lexington is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">US</span>. The population was 31,394 at the 2010 census, in nearly 11,100 households. Settled in 1641, it is celebrated as the site of the first shots of the American Revolutionary War, in the Battle of Lexington on April 19, 1775. It is part of the Greater Boston Area and is the sixth wealthiest small city in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Lexington was first settled circa 1642 as part of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. What is now Lexington was then incorporated as a parish, called <span class="loc">Cambridge Farms</span>, in 1691. This allowed them to have a separate church and minister, but were still under jurisdiction of the Town of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>. Lexington was incorporated as a separate town in 1713. It was then that it got the name Lexington. How it received its name is the subject of some controversy. Some people believe that it was named in honor of Lord Lexington, an English peer. Some, on the other hand, believe that it was named after Lexington (which was pronounced and is today spelled <span class="loc">Laxton</span>) in <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>.</p>
