<p><span class="loc">Tuli</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">province of Matabeleland South</span>, <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>. It is located about 90 km west of <span class="loc">Beitbridge</span> on the eastern bank of the <span class="loc">Shashe</span> River. The village grew around Fort Tuli which was the first settlement built by the Pioneer Column in July 1890 at the place known as <span class="loc">Selous</span> Camp and used by Frederick Selous as a base for his hunting expeditions. The village is mainly a police post and associated housing. The village can be accessed from <span class="loc">Gwanda</span> town via <span class="loc">Guyu</span> and <span class="loc">Hwali</span>, or from <span class="loc">Beitbridge</span> via <span class="loc">Nottingham</span> and <span class="loc">Shashi Irrigation Scheme</span>, although the latter road is in very poor condition <span class="loc">Tuli</span> was the first point at which the pioneer column, and many subsequent expeditions entered into Matabeleland and onward north to <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> (now <span class="loc">Harare</span>), the capital of <span class="loc">Rhodesia</span> as the country was then known. <span class="loc">Tuli</span> was the first location north of the Limpopo/<span class="loc">Shashe</span> rivers where a 'European' style building was erected - the BSA Police Station was a wooden modular style Victorian building, brought from the <span class="loc">UK</span> and erected to house members of the BSA Police who monitored the river crossing just south of the building's location. Until this time a large Fort (Fort Tuli) had existed on the southern bank of the <span class="loc">Shashe</span> where oxen and horses were rested prior to undertaking the river crossing. In the 1970s this building was re-located from its original site and erected at the site of the old, and now obliterated, Fort Tuli. It was used to house artifacts and items if historic interest which were found by persons in the area of the old Fort.</p>
