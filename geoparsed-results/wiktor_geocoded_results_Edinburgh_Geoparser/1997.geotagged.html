<p><span class="loc">Mir</span> (Belarusian: Мір; Russian: Мир; both meaning "world" and "peace"; but the name most likely originates from the name of the river the settlement is situated on) is an urban settlement in Kareličy (Карэлічы) raion, Hrodna Voblast, <span class="loc">Belarus</span> (53°27′N 26°28′E) on the banks of <span class="loc">Miranka</span> River, about 85 kilometers southwest of the national capital, <span class="loc">Minsk</span>. Prior to 1939 the town was in <span class="loc">Poland</span>. Mir village was founded sometime prior to 1345. It is home to a late medieval castle, which made the town the target of many attacks over the centuries. The town belonged to the Illinicz family (Korczak coat of arms) first and then to the Radziwiłł family. It was destroyed by the Swedish forces in 1655 (Deluge) and again by the Swedes during the Great Northern War in 1706. In 1792, the Lithuanian division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth army under Józef Judycki was routed by the invading Imperial Russian army corps under Boris Mellin (see Battle of <span class="loc">Mir</span>). During the Napoleonic invasion of <span class="loc">Russia</span> in 1812, Russian Imperial cavalry, artillery and cossack regiments ambushed and routed the Duchy of <span class="loc">Warsaw</span> 3 uhlan divisions (Battle of <span class="loc">Mir</span> (1812)). The retreating Russians, withdrawing east, abandoned the town and dynamited the castle. During the Middle Ages it was first located in the Principality of <span class="loc">Polotsk</span>, after the Battle on the river Nemiga in the Principality of <span class="loc">Minsk</span>, then was taken over by Kievan <span class="loc">Rus</span>' but after the Mongol Invasion the <span class="loc">Rus</span>' rule diminished and since 1242 <span class="loc">Mir</span> belonged to the expanding and dynamic Duchy of <span class="loc">Lithuania</span>.</p>
