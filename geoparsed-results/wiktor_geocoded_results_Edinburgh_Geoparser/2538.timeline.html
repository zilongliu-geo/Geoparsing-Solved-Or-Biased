  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lindi</span> is a coastal town located at the far end of the <span class="loc">Lindi Bay</span>, on the <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span> in southeastern <span class="loc">Tanzania</span>. The town is 450 kilometers south of <span class="loc">Dar es Salaam</span> and 105 kilometers north of <span class="loc">Mtwara</span>, the southernmost coastal town in <span class="loc">Tanzania</span>, and gives its name to the surrounding <span class="loc">Lindi Region</span>, one of the most sparsely populated areas of the country. The town population was 41,549 as of the <span class="date">2002</span> national census. <span class="loc">Lindi</span> is located at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Lukuledi River</span>. Its port facilities are still rudimentary, allowing one or two small cargo and passenger boats at a time, and cannot accommodate ocean-going ships. The region was once an important sisal-producing plantation area, especially in <span class="loc">Kikwetu</span>, surrounding the Lindi airstrip, 25 kilometers north of town. A recently completed building project has seen the town of <span class="loc">Lindi</span> linked to <span class="loc">Dar es Salaam</span> by a continuous tarmac road, making <span class="loc">Lindi</span> accessible throughout the rainy season. An older tarmac road connects Lindi town to <span class="loc">Mtwara</span>, passing through <span class="loc">Mikindani</span>, an important Arab business settlement for explorers sailing along the east coast from <span class="loc">Muscat</span>, <span class="loc">Oman</span>, <span class="loc">Malindi</span> or <span class="loc">Mombasa</span> to <span class="loc">Sofala</span>.</p><br><br>
