<p><span class="loc">Kew</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 6 km east from Melbourne's Central Business District. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Boroondara</span>. At the 2011 Census, <span class="loc">Kew</span> had a population of 23,876. Formerly a city in its own right, the <span class="loc">cities of Kew</span>, Hawthorn and Camberwell were amalgamated in 1994 to form the <span class="loc">City of Boroondara</span>. The suburb borders the <span class="loc">Yarra River</span> to the west and north, with Hawthorn to its south and <span class="loc">Balwyn</span> to its east. Prior to the establishment of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, the area was inhabited by the Wurundjeri peoples. In the 1840s European settlers named it the <span class="loc">Parish of Boroondara</span> â€“ meaning "a place of shade" in the Woiwurrung language. In 1838 Dight travelled down the <span class="loc">Yarra</span> from <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> and decided to locate a water-powered mill on a site adjacent to the falls; the impressive three-storey mill opened in 1840. John Hodgson established a squatters run at <span class="loc">Studley Park</span>, on the eastern bank of the <span class="loc">Yarra River</span>, in 1840. Studley House, also known as Burke Hall, built in 1857, was named after Hodgson's birthplace of <span class="loc">Studley</span>, <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span> and the house is now on the Register of the National Estate. The house was built in the Victorian Period Italianate Revival style. Modifications were made to the house in 1875 and 1919. The house was also owned by former bookmaker, ALP lobbyist, influential Irish-Catholic and millionaire, John Wren and was donated to Xavier College by the land developer T. M. Burke. It illustrates the importance of a residence in indicating success and status in nineteenth and early twentieth century <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> society. The nearby <span class="loc">Villa Alba</span>, built before 1863, is open to the public.</p>
