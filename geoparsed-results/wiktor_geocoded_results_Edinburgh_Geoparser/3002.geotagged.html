<p>Beaufort is a town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located on the Western Highway midway between <span class="loc">Ararat</span> and <span class="loc">Ballarat</span>, in the <span class="loc">Pyrenees</span> Shire local government area. It is 387 metres (1,270 ft) above sea level. At the 2011 census, Beaufort had a population of 1,004. The town takes its name either from Rear-Admiral Francis Beaufort or a Welsh village in <span class="loc">Monmouthshire</span>. The area was once occupied by the Wadawurrung Aborigines who called the area 'Peerick' or 'Yarram-yarram'. Thomas Mitchell passed through the district on his expedition of 1836. Early settlers in the area were the Kirkland Brothers and a Mr. Hamilton; the latter took up <span class="loc">Trawalla</span> Station in 1838. The station was taken over by Adolphus Goldsmith in 1841 and he developed the property into a rich grazing enterprise. <span class="loc">Lake Goldsmith</span> was named after him. Gold was discovered in 1852, with another gold rush from 1854 at nearby <span class="loc">Fiery Creek</span>. The <span class="loc">Fiery Creek</span> diggings supported four townships, Beaufort, Yam Holes Creek, <span class="loc">View Point</span> and <span class="loc">Southern Cross</span>, during the 1850s. The population on the fields reportedly reached approximately 100,000 people at its height in the late 1850s and produced 450,000 ounces of gold over a two-year period, 1855â€“1856.</p>
