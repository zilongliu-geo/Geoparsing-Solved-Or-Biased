  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bolu</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Turkey</span>, and administrative center of the <span class="loc">Bolu Province</span>. The population is 131,264 (<span class="date">2012</span> census). The mayor is Alaaddin Yılmaz (<span class="org">AK Party</span>) since local elections in <span class="date">2004</span>. <span class="loc">Bolu</span> is on the old highway from <span class="loc">Istanbul</span> to <span class="loc">Ankara</span>, which climbs over Mount Bolu, while the new motorway passes through Mount Bolu Tunnel below the town. <span class="loc">Bolu</span> was part of one of the Hittite kingdoms around <span class="date">2000 BC</span> and later <span class="date">500 BC</span> became one of the leading cities of the Kingdom of <span class="per">Bithynia</span> (<span class="date">279 BC</span> - <span class="date">79 BC</span>) . Bebryces,Mariandynes, Koukones, <span class="per">Thyns</span> and <span class="per">Paphlagons</span> are native people of the area in antique era.Strabo (XII, 4, 7) mentions a Hellenistic town, Bithynium (Greek: Βιθύνιον), celebrated for its pastures and cheese, which according to Pausanias (VIII, 9) was founded by Arcadians from <span class="loc">Mantinea</span>. In the Ancient Roman era, as is shown by its coins, the town was commonly called <span class="loc">Claudiopolis</span> after <span class="per">Emperor Claudius</span>. It was the birthplace of Antinous, the posthumously deified favourite of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who was very generous to the city, and his name was later added to that of <span class="per">Claudius</span> on the coins of the city. Emperor Theodosius II (408-50) made it the capital of a new province, formed out of <span class="per">Bithynia</span> and <span class="per">Paphlagonia</span>, and called by him Honorias in honour of his younger son <span class="per">Honorius</span>.</p><br><br>
