<p>Savannah (/səˈvænə/) is the oldest city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and is the county seat of <span class="loc">Chatham County</span>. Established in 1733 on the <span class="loc">Savannah River</span>, the <span class="loc">city of Savannah</span> became the British colonial capital of the <span class="loc">Province of Georgia</span> and later the first state capital of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. A strategic port city in the American Revolution and during the American Civil War, Savannah is today an industrial center and an important Atlantic seaport. It is <span class="loc">Georgia</span>'s fifth-largest city and third-largest metropolitan area. Each year Savannah attracts millions of visitors to its cobblestone streets, parks, and notable historic buildings: the birthplace of Juliette Gordon Low (founder of the Girl Scouts of the USA), the Georgia Historical Society (the oldest continually operating historical society in the South), the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences (one of the South's first public museums), the First African Baptist Church (one of the oldest African-American Baptist congregations in the <span class="loc">United States</span>), <span class="loc">Temple Mickve Israel</span> (the third oldest synagogue in <span class="loc">America</span>), and the Central of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Railway roundhouse complex (the oldest standing antebellum rail facility in <span class="loc">America</span>).</p>
