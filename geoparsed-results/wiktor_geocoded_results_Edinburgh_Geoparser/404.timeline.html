The population was 6,319 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Salem</span> was laid out and platted in <span class="date">1814</span>. It was named for <span class="loc">Salem</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, the hometown of one of the city founders. In <span class="date">June 1863</span>, the Confederate cavalry under <span class="per">John Hunt Morgan</span> had departed <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> on what would later become known as <span class="per">Morgan</span>'s Raid.

Upon entering <span class="loc">Salem</span> at approximately 9 a.m., <span class="per">Morgan</span> immediately took possession of the town and placed guards over the stores and streets. The cavalrymen burned the large, brick railroad depot, along with all the train cars on the track and the railroad bridges on each side of the town. <span class="per">Morgan</span> demanded taxes from the two flour mills that belonged to <span class="per">DePauw</span> and <span class="per">Knight</span>, and from the <span class="per">Allen Wollen</span> Mill. <span class="per">Morgan</span>'s men looted stores and took about $500 from the area before departing about 3 p.m.</p><br><br>
