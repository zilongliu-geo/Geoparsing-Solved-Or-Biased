  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mountain View</span> is a <span class="loc">Roanoke</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span> neighborhood located in central <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> north of the <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> River. It borders the neighborhoods of <span class="loc">Norwich</span> on the west, <span class="loc">West End</span> on the east, Hurt Park on the north and <span class="loc">Raleigh Court</span> and <span class="loc">Wasena</span> on the south. In <span class="date">March 2011</span>, This <span class="loc">Old House</span>, <span class="loc">America</span>’s most respected home improvement authority, selected <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> as <span class="loc">Virginia</span>’s “Best Old House Neighborhood <span class="date">2011</span>” in its annual list of “<span class="loc">North America</span>’s most timeless neighborhoods—places where lovingly crafted old houses have extraordinary pasts and unarguably promising futures.” <span class="loc">Mountain View</span> was one of 64 neighborhoods in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> and <span class="loc">Canada</span> recognized by This <span class="loc">Old House</span>, which distributed nomination forms to more than 14,000 historical societies, neighborhood groups, and preservation nonprofits to compile its “biggest-ever list of off-the-beaten-path places that are worth eyeing for a great old home.” The majority of the homes within the neighborhood were constructed in the late 19th century and early 20th century as mansions for railroad executives based in <span class="loc">Roanoke</span>. The residential design of the neighborhood is dominated by the two-story American Foursquare, and since the mid-20th century many have been subdivided into multi-family units.</p><br><br>
