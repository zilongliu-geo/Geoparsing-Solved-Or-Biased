The town is the capital of the <span class="loc">Jufra District</span>. <span class="loc">Hun</span> is about halfway between <span class="loc">Sabha</span> and the Mediterranean coast in the <span class="loc">Sahara Desert</span>. The modern <span class="loc">city of Hun</span> is <span class="date">150 years</span> old. The natural landscape around <span class="loc">Hun</span> mainly consists of black basalt mountains, with extensive sand dunes, and date palm trees - Phoenix dactylifera groves indicating oases. The <span class="loc">cities of Waddan and Sokna</span> are the nearest settlements. There is a ruined ksar and several mosques in the <span class="loc">city of Waddan</span>.
