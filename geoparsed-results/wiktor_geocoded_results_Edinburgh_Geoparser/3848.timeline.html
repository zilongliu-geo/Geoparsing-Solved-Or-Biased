  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Colton is a village and civil parish in <span class="loc">Lichfield District</span>, <span class="loc">Staffordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is situated just outside the town of <span class="loc">Rugeley</span>. Colton is the home to Border Collie Trust GB, a registered charity rescuing and rehoming Border Collies and Collie crosses throughout the <span class="loc">UK</span>. There is also a village hall and a small church. There is a bypass that has just been built near <span class="loc">Rugeley</span> the town nearest Colton. There is also a park for young children. Colton lies just off the B5013, which runs from <span class="loc">Rugeley</span>, local pronunciation 'Rudge-Lee' or 'Rewj-uh-lee', to <span class="loc">Uttoxeter</span> ('Utch-eater'). The village is entered by way of a hump-back bridge over the <span class="loc">Moreton</span> Brook, which has a ford alongside for large vehicles. It is said that in WWII, a <span class="loc">US</span> army lorry took the bridge at speed and overturned, killing two soldiers. St. Mary's Church stands on the right, with St. Mary's School on the left. There used to be a pool on the left a short distance beyond the school, on which people would skate, or slide, during the frequent very cold winters of <span class="date">the 1960s</span>. A hundred yards further on is the Forge, where the Williscroft family would with a steel hoop re-tyre your cart wheel, make you a toboggan for use in the snow on The <span class="loc">Martlin Hill</span>, or dig your grave, make your coffin and conduct your funeral.</p><br><br>
