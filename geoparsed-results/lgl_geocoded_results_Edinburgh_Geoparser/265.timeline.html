  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Readington Superintendent decides not to take salary increase. – Jorden Schiff, superintendent for the grade <span class="loc">K-8 district</span>, has agreed to have his salary frozen during <span class="date">the last year</span> of his contract, saying he believes it is the right decision as many others face salary freezes during this poor economy. The township Board of Education voted to approve a new five-year contract for <span class="loc">Schiff</span> at its <span class="date">Feb. 24</span> meeting, which provides a 3.75 percent increase each year. But <span class="loc">Schiff</span> surprised everyone by declining to accept any salary increase <span class="date">this year</span>, <span class="date">the last year</span> of his contract, which ends <span class="date">June 2010</span>. “He had already told us he would accept half the contractual increase but we were taken completely by surprise when he announced he would give up any increase at all,” said Deb Labbadia, the board president. “I felt like it is the right thing to do,” said <span class="loc">Schiff</span> on <span class="date">March 6</span>. “These are difficult economic times. A lot of people are losing jobs; others are dealing with salary freezes and furloughs.”</p><br><br>
