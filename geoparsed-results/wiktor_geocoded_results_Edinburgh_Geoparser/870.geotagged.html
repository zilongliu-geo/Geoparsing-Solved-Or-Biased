<p><span class="loc">Dublin</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Cheshire County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,597 at the 2010 census. It is home to Dublin School and Yankee magazine is based there. In 1749, the Masonian proprietors granted the town as Monadnock No. 3 (or North Monadnock) to Matthew Thornton and 39 others. But the French and Indian War thwarted permanent settlement until the 1760s, when Henry Strongman moved from <span class="loc">Peterborough</span>. Other early settlers arrived from <span class="loc">Sherborn</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. In 1771, Governor John Wentworth incorporated the town, naming it after Strongman's birthplace: <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. Like all towns in this area, the terrain features hills and valleys. Farmers found the soil hard and rocky, but with effort it yielded maize, oats, barley and potatoes, with some wheat and rye. Orchards were common. The first census, taken in 1790, reported 901 residents. By 1859, there were 1,088. Then in 1870, the small mill town of <span class="loc">Harrisville</span> voted to separate from <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, leaving the latter with only 455 residents during the 1880 census.</p>
