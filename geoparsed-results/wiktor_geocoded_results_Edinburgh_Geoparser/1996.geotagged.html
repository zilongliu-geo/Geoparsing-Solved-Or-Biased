<p><span class="loc">Lodi</span> (also called <span class="loc">Fullerton</span>, <span class="loc">Gilderoy</span> or Waterman) is an unincorporated community in Liberty Township, <span class="loc">Parke County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Set on State Hwy 234, the most prominent feature is Waterman Baptist Church, which occupies a red brick building in the north-east corner of town. Just south of the town is one of the first round barns, the W. H. York <span class="loc">Round Barn</span>, which was built in 1895. Less than a year later though the town would change its name to <span class="loc">Lodi</span> on January 26, 1837. It may have been named for the <span class="loc">city of Lodi</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span> near <span class="loc">Milan</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>, where Napoleon won a great victory over the Austrians in 1796. The Post Office was officially call <span class="loc">Lodiville</span>. Once again the town's name changed in 1857 to Waterman in honor of Dr. Waterman who had opened a pork packing plant and store in town. In 1874 an R.M. Waterman owned large coal fields north of town. The <span class="loc">Wabash</span> and <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal passed around <span class="loc">Lodi</span> on the west side and wrapped around the south side before crossing <span class="loc">Coal Creek</span> and continuing its journey south. A feeder dam was built on coal creek. The last canal boat to pass <span class="loc">Lodi</span> was in 1875 heading north to <span class="loc">Lafayette</span>.</p>
