<p>Not to be confused with Barclay-Kingston, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> or <span class="loc">Kingston Estates</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. Kingston is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) along the border of <span class="loc">South Brunswick Township</span> in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span> and Franklin Township in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, in <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the CDP's population was 1,493, of which 1,222 were in <span class="loc">South Brunswick Township</span> and 271 in Franklin Township. The <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> State Planning Commission created the Kingston Village Advisory Committee to address issues related to this distinct area. Both <span class="loc">South Brunswick</span> and Franklin appoint members to the committee, which holds an annual meeting to discuss issues pertinent to the Kingston area. Kingston is located in five historic districts and is part of the <span class="loc">Millstone River</span> Valley Scenic Byway. The <span class="loc">Delaware and Raritan Canal</span> and Rockingham State Historic Site are a short distance away. Jediah Higgins purchased 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) from the Native Americans in the early 18th century and the town of Kingston was established. Kingston's location on the <span class="loc">Lenape Assunpink</span> Trail where it crossed the <span class="loc">Millstone River</span> and later becoming part of the King's Highway was the prime factor in its early prominence.</p>
