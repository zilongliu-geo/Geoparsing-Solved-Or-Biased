  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Par (Cornish: An <span class="loc">Porth</span>, meaning creek or harbour) is a village and fishing port with a harbour on the south coast of <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. The village is situated in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Tywardreath and Par</span>, although West Par and the docks lie in the <span class="loc">parish of St Blaise</span>. Par is approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km) east of <span class="loc">St Austell</span>. Par has a population of around 1,600 (in <span class="date">2012</span>). It became developed in <span class="date">the second quarter</span> of the nineteenth century when the harbour was developed, in order to serve copper mines and other mineral sites in and surrounding the <span class="loc">Luxulyan</span> Valley; china clay later became the dominant traffic as copper working declined, and the harbour and the china clay dries remain as distinctive features of the industrial heritage; however the mineral activity is much reduced. Par Harbour and the beach at <span class="loc">Par Sands</span> are south of the village, and the latter includes a large static caravan holiday park; another small beach is at <span class="loc">Spit Point</span> west of the harbour. Between these two beaches the <span class="loc">South West Coast Path</span> takes an inland diversion through the village.</p><br><br>
