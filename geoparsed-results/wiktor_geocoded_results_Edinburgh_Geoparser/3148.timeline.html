  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kholmogory</span> (Russian: Холмого́ры) is a historic rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of <span class="loc">Kholmogorsky District</span> of Arkhangelsk Oblast, <span class="loc">Russia</span>. It lies on the left bank of the Northern <span class="loc">Dvina River</span>, along the Kholmogory Highway, 75 kilometers (47 mi) southeast of Arkhangelsk and 90 kilometers (56 mi) north of the Antonievo-Siysky Monastery. The name is derived from the Finnish Kalmomäki for "corpse hill" ("cemetery"). Population: 4,150 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census); 4,592 (<span class="date">2002</span> Census); 5,205 (<span class="date">1989</span> Census). The Kholmogory area was at first in historical times inhabited by the Finno-Ugrians "Savolotshij Thsuuds", (sa-volokis, i.e. "the Chud [who live] beyond the portage"), known also as Yems in old Novgorod chronicles, and Karelians. The first Slavonic population to enter to Kalmamäki were Pomors from <span class="loc">Vologda</span> area after <span class="date">1220</span>. As early as the 14th century, the village (the name of which was then spelled <span class="loc">Kolmogory</span>) was an important trading post of the Novgorod Republic in the <span class="loc">Far</span> North of <span class="loc">Russia</span>. Its commercial importance further increased in <span class="date">1554</span> when the <span class="org">English Muscovy Company</span> made it a center of its operations in furs. The Polish-Lithuanian vagabonds (see Lisowczycy) besieged the wooden fort during <span class="org">the Time of Troubles</span> (<span class="date">1613</span>), but had to retreat in failure. In the course of the 17th and 18th <span class="date">centuries</span>, the settlement was also a place of exile, notably for ex-regent <span class="per">Anna Leopoldovna</span> and her children.</p><br><br>
