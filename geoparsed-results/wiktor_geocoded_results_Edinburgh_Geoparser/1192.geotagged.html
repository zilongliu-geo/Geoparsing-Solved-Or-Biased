<p>Milan /ˈmaɪlən/ is a town in <span class="loc">Dutchess County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 2,370. The town is in the northern part of the county. The area that comprises <span class="loc">Milan</span> today was the western part of the Little Nine Partners Patent of 1706. <span class="loc">Milan</span> was largely a farming and mill town and remains a very rural town today. The first settler in the area was Johannes Rowe. The son of a Palatine immigrant, Rowe bought 911 acres (3.69 km2) from Robert Livingston and built a stone house in 1766 on what is now <span class="loc">Rowe Road</span> near the <span class="loc">Milan Town Hall</span>. The remains of the house were photographed in 1940 for the Historic American Buildings Survey. The <span class="loc">New York</span> State Legislature voted on March 6, 1818, to create the town of <span class="loc">Milan</span> from the western part of the town of North East, to be effective "from and after the last day in March" 1818. The session laws stated that the first town meeting would be held the first Tuesday of April and at the home of Stephen Thorn, who was elected town supervisor along with John F. Bartlett, town clerk.</p>
