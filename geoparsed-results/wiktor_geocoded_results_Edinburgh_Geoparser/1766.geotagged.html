<p><span class="loc">Geneva</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ontario</span> and <span class="loc">Seneca</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. It is located at the northern end of <span class="loc">Seneca Lake</span>; all land portions of the city are within <span class="loc">Ontario County</span>; the water portions are in <span class="loc">Seneca County</span>. The population was 13,261 at the 2010 census. Some claim it is named after the city and canton of <span class="loc">Geneva</span> in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. Others believe the name came from the word "<span class="loc">Seneca</span>". The main settlement of the <span class="loc">Seneca</span> was spelled Zoneshio by early white settlers, and was described as being 2 miles north of <span class="loc">Seneca Lake</span>. The city lies within the Town of <span class="loc">Geneva</span>. The city identifies as the "Lake Trout Capital of the World." The area was long occupied by the <span class="loc">Seneca</span> tribe, who established a major village of Kanadaseaga here by 1687. The British helped fortify the village against the French of <span class="loc">Canada</span> during the Seven Years' War (locally known as the French and Indian War); later they added defensive fortifications against the Americans during the Revolutionary War. During the latter warfare, the punitive Sullivan Expedition of 1779 mounted by rebel forces destroyed many of the dwellings, as well as the winter stores of the people, and they abandoned the ruins. Following the war and cession of the land by the <span class="loc">Seneca</span>, European-Americans settled here about 1793. They developed a town encouraged by the Pulteney Association, which owned the land and was selling plots.</p>
