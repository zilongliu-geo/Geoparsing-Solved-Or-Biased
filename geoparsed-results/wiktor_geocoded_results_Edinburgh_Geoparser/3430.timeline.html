  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Austin</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Tunica County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. Once a thriving shipping port on the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River, <span class="per">Austin</span> served as county seat from <span class="date">1847</span> to <span class="date">1888</span>. Earlier county seats were <span class="per">Commerce</span> and <span class="per">Peyton</span>. <span class="per">Austin</span> was founded in <span class="date">1847</span> and named for <span class="per">Austin Miller</span>, who donation land on which the town and a courthouse were built. <span class="per">Austin</span> was burned in <span class="date">1863</span> by Union soldiers of the <span class="org">Mississippi Marine Brigade</span> under the command of <span class="per">Alfred W. Ellet</span>. Two houses were spared. The town rebuilt and was incorporated in <span class="date">1871</span>, though it is no longer incorporated. In <span class="date">1884</span>, the area was flooded when a nearby levee broke. When waters receded, a large sandbar had been left between the town and the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River, and steamboats could no longer land. The completion of the <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> and <span class="loc">Texas Railway</span> 3 mi (4.8 km) east of <span class="per">Austin</span> in the late 1880s further contributed to its isolation. In <span class="date">1888</span>, the county seat was moved to Tunica, a more accessible location. The construction of the <span class="loc">Hardin Cutoff</span> in <span class="date">1942</span>, which created <span class="loc">Tunica Lake</span>, moved the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River an additional 7 mi (11 km) west of <span class="per">Austin</span>.</p><br><br>
