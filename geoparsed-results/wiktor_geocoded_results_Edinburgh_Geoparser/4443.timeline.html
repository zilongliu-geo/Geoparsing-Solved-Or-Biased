  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cornwall</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Lebanon County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>, <span class="loc">PA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 3,486 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> was founded by <span class="per">Peter Grubb</span> in <span class="date">1737</span>. <span class="per">Peter</span>, a <span class="loc">Chester County</span> stonemason, came to <span class="loc">Lancaster County</span> around <span class="date">1734</span> in search of building materials. First building his house and then a store, he discovered very high quality magnetite iron ore nearby and decided to mine for it, acquiring 300 acres (1.2 km2) by <span class="date">1737</span> and over 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) by <span class="date">1739</span> when mining was initiated. He called it the <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> <span class="loc">Iron Mines</span> after his father's birthplace in <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> <span class="loc">Iron Mines</span>, also known as <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> Banks, turned out to be the largest <span class="loc">United States</span>' iron deposit east of <span class="loc">Lake Superior</span>, and were once the largest open-pit iron mine in the world. They were mined continuously until <span class="date">1973</span>, totaling 234 uninterrupted <span class="date">years</span> of production. Finding the necessary components nearby for making iron (water, limestone and timber for charcoal), <span class="per">Grubb</span> built the <span class="loc">Cornwall Iron Furnace</span> and began production in <span class="date">1742</span>. The operation also included the Hopewell Forges on nearby Hammer Creek. <span class="per">Peter Grubb</span> did not stay long to run the operation, but leased it out in <span class="date">1745</span> for <span class="date">20 years</span> and returned to <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>, <span class="loc">Delaware</span>. In <span class="date">1765</span> <span class="per">Peter</span>'s sons <span class="per">Curtis</span> and <span class="per">Peter</span> Jr. took over the operation, and in <span class="date">1798</span> it passed to <span class="per">Robert Coleman</span> and his family. <span class="loc">Cornwall Furnace</span> was in production from <span class="date">1742</span> until <span class="date">1883</span>, and appears <span class="date">today</span> much as it was when production ended. In <span class="date">1932</span> the <span class="per">Coleman</span> family deeded the property to the Commonwealth of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and it is <span class="date">now</span> a designated National Historic Landmark open to the public.</p><br><br>
