  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Brooklyn is a town to the north of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> 51 kilometres from the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district, in the local government area of <span class="loc">Hornsby Shire</span>. Despite sharing the name, this small <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> town has no relation to the <span class="loc">borough of Brooklyn</span> in New <span class="loc">York City</span>. Brooklyn is sometimes considered the northernmost suburb of the <span class="org">Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area</span>, as it is located on the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> side of the <span class="loc">Hawkesbury River</span>, and <span class="loc">Mooney</span> <span class="loc">Mooney</span> Bridge. It is part of <span class="loc">The County</span> of <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, in which <span class="loc">Sydney city</span> is located, but Brooklyn is rarely considered part of the city. Brooklyn occupies a narrow strip of tidal waterfront land aligned east â€“ west along the southern bank of the <span class="loc">Hawkesbury River</span>. Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park borders the suburb to the south and the F3 Sydney-Newcastle Freeway crosses the river just to the west. <span class="loc">Long Island</span> runs parallel with the suburb on the opposite side of Sandbrook Inlet and is joined to Brooklyn by the railway causeway. <span class="loc">Dangar Island</span> is sited to the north east. The general area was known as Peat's Ferry crossing for <span class="date">a long time</span> until <span class="date">January 1884</span> when a plan of survey for the subdivision of land owned by <span class="per">Peter</span> and <span class="per">William</span> <span class="loc">Fagan</span> was registered with the suburb name of Brooklyn. A hotel of the same name followed <span class="date">later in the year</span>. The town owes its existence and location to the main northern railway line with the railway arriving in Brooklyn in <span class="date">1887</span> when the single track section north from <span class="loc">Hornsby</span> was completed.</p><br><br>
