<p><span class="loc">Berlin</span> (/ˈbɜːrlɪn/ BUR-lin) is a town in <span class="loc">Hartford County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 19,866 at the 2010 census. It was incorporated in 1785. The geographic center of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> is located in the town. <span class="loc">Berlin</span> is residential and industrial, and is served by the Amtrak station of the same name. <span class="loc">Berlin</span> also has two hamlets: <span class="loc">Kensington</span> and <span class="loc">East Berlin</span>. The greatest boom to Berlin industry resulted from the decision of the Patterson brothers to start their business on <span class="loc">West Street</span> (now called <span class="loc">Lower Lane</span>). For twenty years until 1760, they kept their work in the family selling their wares from a basket. When demand increased they took apprentices into the shop and engaged peddlers to travel throughout the colonies selling the shiny, useful articles (the seal of the Town of <span class="loc">Berlin</span> shows such a "Yankee peddler" in eighteenth-century dress with a basket under his arm, a pack on his back full of tinware). As others learned the trade, they soon set up shop and hired apprentices. There were so many that the noise of the whitesmiths and their hammering could be heard in every part of town.</p>
