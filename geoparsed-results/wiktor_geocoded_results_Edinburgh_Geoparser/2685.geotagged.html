<p>The Township of <span class="loc">Norwich</span> is a municipality located in <span class="loc">Oxford County</span> in Southwestern <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The preferred pronunciation of the town name is /ˈnɔːrwɪtʃ/ NOR-wich, which differs from the pronunciation /ˈnɔːrɪdʒ/ NOR-ij used for the <span class="loc">city of Norwich</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The origin of <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, is more likely <span class="loc">Norwich</span> in Upper New York State, the area from which the pioneering families emigrated in the early 19th century, where the community was known as Norwichville. <span class="loc">Oxford County</span> Road 59 (formerly Highway 59) is the major north–south highway through much of the township, including the community of <span class="loc">Norwich</span> proper. The local economy is largely agricultural, based on corn, soybean, and wheat production with dairy farming in the north part of the township and tobacco, vegetable, and ginseng farming to the south. Slowly, ginseng and traditional cash crops are replacing the former cash crop - tobacco, as demand shrinks.
