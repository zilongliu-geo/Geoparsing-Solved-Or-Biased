<p>Lìjiāng (simplified Chinese: 丽江; traditional Chinese: 麗江) is a prefecture-level city in the northwest of <span class="loc">Yunnan province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>. It has an area of 21,219 square kilometres (8,193 sq mi) and had a population of 1,244,769 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Lijiang</span> is famous for its UNESCO Heritage Site, the <span class="loc">Old Town</span> of <span class="loc">Lijiang</span>. <span class="loc">Lijiang City</span> replaced the former administrative region of <span class="loc">Lijiang</span> Naxi Autonomous Prefecture. It was under the rule of the Mu family (木氏) local commanders (土司) during the <span class="loc">Ming</span> Dynasty and Qing Dynasty. The <span class="loc">Baisha</span> <span class="loc">Old Town</span> was the political, commercial and cultural center for the local Naxi people and other ethnic groups for 400 years from the year 658 AD to 1107 AD. The Dabaoji Palace of the <span class="loc">Baisha</span> Fresco, very close to the <span class="loc">Baisha</span> Naxi Hand-made Embroidery Institute, was built in the year 658 AD in the Tang Dynasty (618 AD to 960 AD).
