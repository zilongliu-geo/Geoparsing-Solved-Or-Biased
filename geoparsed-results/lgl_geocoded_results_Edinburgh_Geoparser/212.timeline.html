The breakaway region’s law enforcement agencies said that a remote control explosive device went off and suggested that the Georgian special services could have been behind “the terrorist act.” <span class="per">Tbilisi</span> has denied the allegation and the Georgian television stations reported that the blast was a result of infighting between the Abkhaz gangs.
