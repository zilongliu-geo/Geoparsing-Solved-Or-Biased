  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Clinton</span> is a village in British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, located approximately 40 km northwest of <span class="loc">Cache Creek</span> and 30 km south of 70 Mile House. It is considered by some to straddle the southern edge of the <span class="loc">Cariboo</span> country of British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, although others consider Ashcroft-Cache Creek, <span class="loc">Lillooet</span>, <span class="loc">Savona</span>, <span class="loc">Kamloops</span> and even <span class="per">Lytton</span> and <span class="per">Spences</span> Bridge to be in the <span class="loc">Cariboo</span>. <span class="per">Clinton</span>, however, does sit immediately below the southern edge of the <span class="loc">Cariboo</span> Plateau. <span class="per">Clinton</span> has a number of attractions including horse-back riding, big game viewing, hiking, fishing and other outdoor activities. Every <span class="per">May, Clinton</span> is home to the Annual Ball which features a rodeo and dance. This is one of British <span class="org">Columbia</span>'s oldest continual events having first been held in <span class="date">1867</span> and was a highlight of the social calendar in the British <span class="org">Columbia</span> Interior for <span class="date">many decades</span>. The <span class="org">Clinton Museum</span>, built in <span class="date">1892</span>, has a number of historical artifacts on display that date back to the gold rush and founding of the area. Originally known as 47 Mile House or 47 Mile, <span class="per">Clinton</span> was named in <span class="date">1863</span> upon completion of the <span class="loc">Cariboo</span> Wagon Road in the area for <span class="per">Henry Fiennes</span> Pelham <span class="per">Clinton</span>, the 5th <span class="per">Duke of Newcastle</span>, who was Colonial Secretary from 1854-1854 and 1859-1864.</p><br><br>
