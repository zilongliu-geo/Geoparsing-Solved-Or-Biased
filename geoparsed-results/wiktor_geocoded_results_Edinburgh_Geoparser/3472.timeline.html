  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dauphin is a borough in <span class="loc">Dauphin County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 791 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Dauphin's ZIP code is 17018. It is part of the <span class="loc">Harrisburg–Carlisle Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Dauphin is located on the western edge of <span class="loc">Dauphin County</span> at 40°22′00″N 76°55′52″W, on the east bank of the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span>. The land at the river's edge is alluvial floodplain, but Dauphin sits at the head of a narrow valley between two mountains, at the mouth of <span class="loc">Stony Creek</span>. The valley between the two mountains is called Stony Valley, which contains the villages of <span class="loc">Singersville</span> and <span class="loc">Ellendale Forge</span>. This section along the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span> is a gateway from the southeastern plains into the Appalachian Mountains and the north-central part of the state. Dauphin is surrounded by Middle Paxton Township, which comprises mountains and valleys south of the confluence of the <span class="loc">Susquehanna</span> and <span class="loc">Juniata</span> rivers. From south to north, the mountains in the township are <span class="loc">Blue Mountain</span>, <span class="loc">Second Mountain</span>, <span class="loc">Third</span> or <span class="loc">Stony Mountain</span>, and <span class="loc">Peters Mountain</span>. The eastern ends of these valleys are generally undeveloped state game lands and protected watershed.</p><br><br>
