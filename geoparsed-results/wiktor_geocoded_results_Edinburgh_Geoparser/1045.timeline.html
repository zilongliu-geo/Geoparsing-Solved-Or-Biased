  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Marion</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Plymouth County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,907 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. For geographic and demographic information on the village of <span class="org">Marion Center</span>, please see the article <span class="per">Marion</span> <span class="loc">Center</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. <span class="per">Marion</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1679</span> as "<span class="loc">Sippican</span>", a <span class="loc">district of Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The name, which also lends itself to the river which passes through the north of town and the harbor at the heart of town, was the Wampanoag name for the local tribe. The town was mostly known for its many local sea captains and sailors whose homes were in town, although there were also some small shipbuilding operations on the harbor as well. By the late 1840s, however, tensions between the village of <span class="loc">Mattapoisett</span> and the town led to a battle which sought to redraw the town lines and effectively take over <span class="loc">Sippican</span> Village. This caused the villagers to form a committee, which went to <span class="loc">Boston</span> to petition for incorporation as its own town. Thus, with the help of a powerful local ally, the town was incorporated on <span class="date">May 14, 1852</span>, and renamed <span class="per">Marion</span> in honor of Revolutionary War hero <span class="per">Francis Marion</span>. <span class="loc">Mattapoisett</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1857</span>.</p><br><br>
