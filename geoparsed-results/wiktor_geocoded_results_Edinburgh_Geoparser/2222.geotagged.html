<p>Monroe is a town in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 121 at the 2010 census. By area, population and population density, it is the smallest town in the county; and is the second-smallest town by population in the Commonwealth, with only Gosnold having fewer residents. Monroe is part of the <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. Monroe was first settled in 1800 and was officially incorporated in 1822. The town was named for President James Monroe, who was in office at the time of incorporation. The town was mostly rural, with dairy farming taking up much of the town's economic activity. During the mid-19th century, the town did get some business from the building of the Hoosac Tunnel, just south of town in <span class="loc">Florida</span>. In 1885, however, a railroad line was built between neighboring <span class="loc">Readsboro</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, and <span class="loc">Holyoke</span> to haul wood pulp to a paper factory. This, in turn, enticed the Ramage family to establish the James Ramage Paper Company in 1887. The company was the main industry well into the 20th century, before closing in 1984.</p>
