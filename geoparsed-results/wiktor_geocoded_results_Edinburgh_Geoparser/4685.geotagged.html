<p><span class="loc">Alberton</span> is a metropolitan suburb in Adelaide, <span class="loc">South Australia</span>, about 20 minutes drive from the city. Part of the City of Port Adelaide Enfield, it is bordered by the suburbs of Rosewater, <span class="loc">Queenstown</span>, <span class="loc">Cheltenham</span> and <span class="loc">Port Adelaide</span>. <span class="loc">Alberton</span>, like <span class="loc">Port Adelaide</span>, is rich in historical significance. On 7 March 1839, the South Australian Company was granted private subdivision of preliminary section 423. Section 423 was sold as 'The Town of Albert' and subsequently became '<span class="loc">Albert Town</span>' after Prince Albert, Prince Consort of Queen Victoria. Eventually, 'Alberton' became commonly used and around the turn of the century was officially adopted as the suburb's name. With demand for workers at the Port and homes for these workers needed, late in 1840 there were already 61 houses and 235 residents in <span class="loc">Alberton</span>. The layout of '<span class="loc">Albert Town</span>' originally had provisions for four public squares, two of which still exist. <span class="loc">St Georges</span>' Square became the site for the Anglican Church while St Andrew's Square was later subdivided and became the site of the Trinity Uniting Church. St Patrick's Square and Company Square are today still used as public recreation areas (Couper-Smartt, 2003).</p>
