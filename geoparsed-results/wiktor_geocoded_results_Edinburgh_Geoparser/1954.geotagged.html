<p><span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a town in Oak Grove Township, <span class="loc">Benton County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. The population was 1,162 at the 2010 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Lafayette</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was <span class="loc">Benton County</span>'s first town. Commissioners appointed by the Indiana General Assembly selected the location in May 1843 to be the site of the county seat on land donated by Henry W. Ellsworth and David Atkinson. It was first called Milroy in honor of Samuel Milroy, one of the commissioners, but a town in <span class="loc">Rush County</span> already bore that name. In October 1843 the commissioners changed it to <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, after <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> (the home of <span class="loc">Ellsworth</span> and <span class="loc">Watkins</span>), but they discovered this name was also already being used in <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, so in December Judge David J. McConnell awarded the town its present name. Lots went up for sale at this time, with buyers allowed to pay for the lots in three installments over 18 months. The first building erected in <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was a two-story, wooden frame courthouse, designed and built by Francis Boynton, and the second was a hotel, built by Henry L. Ellsworth and operated by James L. Hatton. The first home was that of Aaron Wood, who also ran a small store that supplied groceries, beer and whiskey.</p>
