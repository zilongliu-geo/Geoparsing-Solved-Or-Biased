  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Mugger allegedly pistol-whips teen, flees with $15. <span class="per">Megan Gildow</span> brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, Ohio â€” Police received a report that two teenage boys, a 17-year-old and an18-year-old, were robbed at gunpoint about 10 p.m. on <span class="date">Saturday, March 28</span>. According to the police report, the teens said they were walking near the intersection of Fair Street and <span class="loc">South Lowry Avenue</span> when a man approached them. After initially asking them for change, the man reportedly said, "Give me everything you got!" then struck the 17-year-old across the face. The teen who said he was struck told police he realized the man had hit him with a gun, so he ran. The man with the gun reportedly then demanded the 18-year-old place his wallet on the ground. When he did so, the robber picked up the wallet, which contained $15, and fled northbound on <span class="loc">South Lowry Avenue</span>, according to the police report. The report noted that the teen who said he was struck had visible swelling on the left side of his face.</p><br><br>
