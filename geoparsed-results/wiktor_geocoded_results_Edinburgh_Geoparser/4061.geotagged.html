<p><span class="loc">Monte Hermoso</span> is a town located on the Atlantic coast of <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, some 100 km (62 mi) east of the <span class="loc">city of Bah√≠a Blanca</span>, in the south of the Province of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>. It is the administrative seat of the partido of <span class="loc">Monte Hermoso</span>. Founded at the beginning of the twentieth century, <span class="loc">Monte Hermoso</span> is a family seaside resort with more than 32 km (20 mi) of beach overlooking the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> and with the unique characteristic in <span class="loc">Argentina</span> of having both sunrises and sunsets over the sea. The summer climate of <span class="loc">Monte Hermoso</span> is more temperate than that of other major seaside resorts due to the sea breeze effect, while the water itself is warmer, making for a pleasant beach experience. <span class="loc">Monte Hermoso</span> owes its existence to the 1879 purchase of 4,000 seaside hectares (10,000 acres) by Esteban Dufaur. His son, Sulpicio, created the <span class="loc">El Recreo</span> estancia in 1910, and in 1918, began welcoming guests with the inaugural of the Hotel de Madera; the hotel was built by Dafaur with lumber salvaged from a shipwreck on the shore. The settlement was established as such in 1975, and given autonomy on April 1, 1979.</p>
