<p><span class="loc">Odessa</span> or <span class="loc">Odesa</span> (Ukrainian: Оде́са, [oˈdɛsɐ]; Russian: Оде́сса; IPA: [ɐˈdʲesə]) is a city in <span class="loc">Ukraine</span> and a major seaport and transportation hub located on the northwestern shore of the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span>. <span class="loc">Odessa</span> is also an administrative center of the <span class="loc">Odessa Oblast</span> and a multiethnic major cultural center. <span class="loc">Odessa</span> is the third biggest city in <span class="loc">Ukraine</span> and known in <span class="loc">Ukraine</span> as <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> Pearl or Southern <span class="loc">Palmyra</span>. The predecessor of <span class="loc">Odessa</span>, a small Tatar settlement, was founded by Hacı I Giray, the Khan of <span class="loc">Crimea</span>, in 1440 and originally named after him as "Hacıbey". After a period of Lithuanian control, it passed into the domain of the Ottoman Sultan in 1529 and remained in Ottoman hands until the Ottoman Empire's defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1792. In 1794, the <span class="loc">city of Odessa</span> was founded by a decree of the Empress Catherine the Great. From 1819 to 1858, <span class="loc">Odessa</span> was a free port. During the Soviet period it was the most important port of trade in the Soviet Union and a Soviet naval base. On 1 January 2000, the Quarantine Pier at Odessa Commercial Sea Port was declared a free port and free economic zone for a period of 25 years.</p>
