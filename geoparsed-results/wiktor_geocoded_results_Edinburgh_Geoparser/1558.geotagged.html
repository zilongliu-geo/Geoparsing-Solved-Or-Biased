<p>Gilbert is a town in <span class="loc">Searcy County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 28 at the 2010 census, ranking it as one of the smallest municipalities in the state and nation. Over the years, Gilbert has gained a reputation (along with Calico Rock) as one of the coldest locations in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The Gilbert General Store, built in 1901, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the name Mays Store. The community was founded in 1902 when a railroad construction camp for the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and <span class="loc">North Arkansas Railroad</span> was built and named in honor of Charles W. Gilbert, secretary-treasurer of Allegheny Supply Company, which was building the railroad. In 1906, William Mays moved his store and post office from Duff, located a few miles away. Gilbert was a hub for commerce. Cotton, logs, ore and grain came by rail. Gilbert was eventually the home to a repair shop for the railroad, which ceased operation in 1946. While the tracks were removed and sold as scrap, there are still signs of the railroad where the old concrete supports crossed the <span class="loc">Buffalo River</span>. The former rail bed is now a hiking route along the river.</p>
