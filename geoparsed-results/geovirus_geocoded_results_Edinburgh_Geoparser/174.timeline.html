  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> government has been forced to act because of a letter sent to Prime Minister <span class="per">Helen Clark</span> which claimed that the disease <span class="per">Foot</span> and <span class="per">Mouth</span> is being intentionally spread on <span class="loc">Waiheke Island</span>. The letter, which is assumed to be a hoax, could have a major impact on <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>'s meat industry. Agriculture Minister <span class="per">Jim Sutton</span> went so far as to say that the suspension of meat exports by some countries was a real possibility. The incubation period of foot and mouth disease is such that if animals have been infected, signs should be evident within <span class="date">ten days</span>. In the meantime, Ministry of <span class="per">Agriculture</span> and <span class="per">Forestry</span> experts and veterinarians, many with experience gained in the recent <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> outbreak, are conducting intensive monitoring of the island's susceptible animals. All sheep and cattle are being individually inspected every 48 hours. Meanwhile, restrictions on the movement of livestock are in place, so that in the very unlikely event that there has been a release of the disease, the effects will be contained. Police efforts are underway to track the origin of the letter that initiated the scare.</p><br><br>
