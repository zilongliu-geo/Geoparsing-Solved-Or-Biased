<p><span class="loc">Barak</span> is a Kyrgyz village (40°40′N 72°46′E) which is an exclave situated within <span class="loc">Uzbekistan</span>. Administratively it is part of <span class="loc">Kara-Suu District</span> in <span class="loc">Kyrgyzstan</span>'s <span class="loc">Osh Region</span>. The exclave of <span class="loc">Barak</span> is encircled by <span class="loc">Andijan Region</span>, <span class="loc">Uzbekistan</span>. It is a relatively small town of approximately 600 people located in the <span class="loc">Fergana</span> Valley. Alternative estimates list the village consisting of 153 families (approximately 1,000 residents). It is located about 4 km north-west of the road from <span class="loc">Osh</span> (<span class="loc">Kyrgyzstan</span>) to Khodjaabad (<span class="loc">Uzbekistan</span>) near the Kyrgyz–Uzbek border in the direction toward <span class="loc">Andijan</span> (40°47′N 72°20′E). This places it approximately 1.5 km from the Uzbek/Kyrgyz border, near Ak-Tash village. <span class="loc">Kyrgyzstan</span>'s 1991 pre-independence border is the de jure international border, but much of it is hotly disputed with its neighbors. In August 1999, the area around <span class="loc">Barak</span> was occupied by <span class="loc">Uzbekistan</span>, cutting it off from <span class="loc">Kyrgyz</span> territory. Uzbek forces dug up and blockaded the road to Ak-Tash while also allegedly seizing large areas of Kyrgyz land that had been loaned in the Soviet era but never returned. They entrenched themselves within much of Kyrgyz border territory and refused to leave. <span class="loc">Barak</span> became a de facto enclave only 1.5 km from the shifted main border. Four Uzbek enclaves and <span class="loc">Barak</span> are major sticking points in border delimitation talks, and disputes center on the areas of <span class="loc">Barak</span>, <span class="loc">Sokh</span>, <span class="loc">Gava</span> and Gavasay (stream).
