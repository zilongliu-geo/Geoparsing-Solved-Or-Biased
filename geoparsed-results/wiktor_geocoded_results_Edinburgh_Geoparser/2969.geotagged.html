Before this, it was only a barrio of the municipality of <span class="loc">Mandaue</span>. <span class="loc">Consolacion</span> became a separate town in 1871. However, in 1902 and 1903, unable to maintain its status as an independent municipality, it reverted to <span class="loc">Mandaue</span>. In 1920, <span class="loc">Consolacion</span> was again made an independent municipality after a petition was accepted by the governor. So grateful were the townspeople to the Spanish governor that they named their new town after his daughter – Consolacion – and they also chose <span class="loc">San Narciso</span> as their patron saint, the namesake of the governor's wife, Narcisa.</p>
