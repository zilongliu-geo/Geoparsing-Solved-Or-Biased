It is an older suburban subdivision, including mostly low-density, single detached dwellings. As of <span class="date">2011</span>, the area is home to 3,271 residents.

According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of <span class="date">2013</span> was $304,939. The <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> neighbourhood was within the city limits at the time of <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span>'s incorporation in <span class="date">1906</span>. The subdivision west of <span class="loc">Lorne Avenue</span> was marketed by three <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span> real estate men: W.H. <span class="per">Coy, A.</span> <span class="loc">MacDougall</span> and F.E. Guppy. All three eventually had streets named after them; Coy Avenue is still in existence.

After <span class="date">a few decades</span> of very little construction, infill housing projects jumped starting after <span class="date">1996</span>.</p><br><br>
