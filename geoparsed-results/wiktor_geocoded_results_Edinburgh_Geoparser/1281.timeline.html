  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Long Beach is a city in <span class="loc">Nassau County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Just south of <span class="loc">Long Island</span>, it is located on Long Beach <span class="loc">Barrier Island</span>, which is the westernmost of the outer barrier islands off <span class="loc">Long Island</span>'s <span class="loc">South Shore</span>. As of the <span class="loc">United States</span> <span class="date">2010</span> Census, the city population was 33,275. It was incorporated in <span class="date">1922</span>, and is nicknamed The City By the Sea (as seen in Latin on its official seal). The <span class="loc">city of Long Beach</span> is surrounded by Reynolds Channel to the north, east and west, and the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> to the south. As of <span class="date">2012</span>, <span class="per">Jack Schnirman</span> is the city manager, a position appointed by the City Council. It has been democratic for <span class="date">many years</span>. Long Beach's first inhabitants were the Algonquian-speaking Rockaway Indians, who sold the area to English colonists in <span class="date">1643</span>. While the barrier island was used by baymen and farmers for fishing and harvesting salt hay, no one lived there year-round for <span class="date">more than two centuries</span>. In <span class="date">1849</span> Congress established a lifesaving station. <span class="date">A dozen years before</span>, 62 people died when the barque <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, carrying Irish immigrants to <span class="loc">New York</span>, ran ashore on <span class="date">New Year's Day</span>.</p><br><br>
