  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kalyan</span> is a part of the Thane District of Maharashtra state in Western India.It is also known for being the <span class="loc">Mumbai region</span>'s exit station to <span class="loc">North India</span> and <span class="loc">South India</span>. <span class="loc">Kalyan</span> is within the administrative division (tahsil) at a taluka level of the Thane District. <span class="loc">Kalyan</span> and its neighbouring township of <span class="loc">Dombivli</span> jointly form the <span class="org">Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation</span>, abbreviated as KDMC. It is considered a part of the <span class="loc">Mumbai Metropolitan</span> Region, along with Vitthalwadi, <span class="loc">Bhiwandi</span>, Thane, <span class="loc">Ulhasnagar</span> and the municipal councils of <span class="loc">Ambernath</span> and <span class="loc">Badlapur</span>. The word 'Kalyan' spelled in (Marathi: कल्याण) is a Marathi word which means 'Welfare' in English. In pre-independent <span class="loc">India</span>, the administration spelled <span class="loc">Kalyan</span> as Kallian, <span class="loc">Callian</span> and sometimes as callianee. The city has been attacked by various foreign armies including the <span class="loc">Mughal</span>, the Portuguese and the British. The Marathas were held in high regard by the locals for being the only line of defence against invasions. <span class="per">Walter Hamilton</span>, a foreign visitor passing through <span class="loc">India</span> described Callianee as follows in his <span class="date">1820</span> book A Geographical, Statistical, and Historical Description of <span class="loc">Hindostan</span>, and the Adjacent Counties, Volume 2 on page 150:</p><br><br>
