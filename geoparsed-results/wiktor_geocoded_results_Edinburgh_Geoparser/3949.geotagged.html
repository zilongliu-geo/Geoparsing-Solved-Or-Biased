<p><span class="loc">Franca</span> is a municipality in the Brazilian state of São Paulo. The population is 342,112 (2015 est.) in an area of 606 km². Its elevation is 1040 m. It was established in 1805 as a parish within the municipality of Moji Mirim, and became an independent municipality in 1824. The history of the region of <span class="loc">Franca</span> begins at the time of the <span class="loc">Bandeirantes</span> explorers. The bandeira or entrada of Anhangüera (the son) in 1722 established the “way of Goiás,” a trail from São Paulo to the gold mines in Goiás. Along this and other trails settlements were made, becoming the so-called "landings" or way-stations for the gold seekers. <span class="loc">Franca</span> was known at the time of the <span class="loc">Bandeirantes</span> as the “catfish landing.” At the end of the 18th century, settlers had dispersed into the region in several of these landings. In 1779, around 1000 people lived in the area around <span class="loc">Franca</span> . To better organize the settlement, a Decree Company was created and the Portuguese Captain Manoel de Almeida was put in charge. At the beginning of the 19th century, the sons of Manoel de Almeida (Antonio Antunes de <span class="loc">Almeida</span> and <span class="loc">Vicente Ferreira</span> de Almeida) donated lands for the construction of a chapel, which in turn was blessed by the priest Joaquin Martins <span class="loc">Rodrigues</span>. With the decline of mining activity in <span class="loc">Minas Gerais</span> and Goiás, more settlers migrated to the "Belo Sertão do <span class="loc">Rio Pardo</span>" (beautiful valley of the <span class="loc">Pardo</span> River), under the sponsorship of the governador of São Paulo, Antônio José de Franca e <span class="loc">Horta</span>, after whom the municipality are named.</p>
