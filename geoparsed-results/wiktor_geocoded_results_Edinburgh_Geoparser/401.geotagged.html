<p><span class="loc">Colorado</span> (/kɒləˈrædoʊ/, or /kɒləˈrɑːdoʊ/) (Spanish for "ruddy") is a state in the <span class="loc">United States</span> encompassing most of the Southern <span class="loc">Rocky Mountains</span> as well as the northeastern portion of the <span class="loc">Colorado Plateau</span> and the western edge of the <span class="loc">Great Plains</span>. <span class="loc">Colorado</span> is part of the Western <span class="loc">United States</span>, the Southwestern <span class="loc">United States</span>, and the Mountain States. <span class="loc">Colorado</span> is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 <span class="loc">United States</span>. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau estimates that the population of <span class="loc">Colorado</span> was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. The state was named for the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span>, which Spanish travelers named the Río <span class="loc">Colorado</span> for the ruddy (Spanish: colorado) silt the river carried from the mountains. The Territory of <span class="loc">Colorado</span> was organized on February 28, 1861, and on August 1, 1876, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting <span class="loc">Colorado</span> to the Union as the 38th state. <span class="loc">Colorado</span> is nicknamed the "Centennial State" because it became a state 28 days after the centennial of the United States Declaration of Independence.</p>
