It is along the Nairobi-Nyeri highway, 100 kilometres north of <span class="loc">Nairobi</span>, the capital of <span class="loc">Kenya</span>. Its name comes from <span class="loc">Kenya</span>'s second longest river, Sagana river which is also called Thagana. NAPOLEONS RAFTING CAMP SAGANA Sagana Country Lodge Highcrest Preparatory School Savage Wilderness Camp - Whitewater Rafting Sagana Fisheries Tanneries YMCA Suncity Resort Bethany House Sagana has 2 distinct rainy <span class="date">seasons</span> and dry weather throughout the year. Average <span class="date">30 year</span> annual rainfall is 1,166 mm. The warmest period is <span class="date">February</span> through <span class="date">April</span> with a distinct cool season between <span class="date">June</span> and <span class="date">August</span>, when rainfall is at a minimum. Even though there is little rain, the skies tend to be overcast much of the day during this period. A rainy period known as the “short rains” occurs between <span class="date">October</span> and <span class="date">December</span>. The “long rains” fall from <span class="date">March</span> through <span class="date">May</span> with a single-month peak of 500 mm or more in <span class="date">April</span>. <span class="loc">Sagana</span> is situated at the edge of a large plain at the southern foot of Mt. <span class="loc">Kenya</span>. Soils were formed on volcanic rocks from Mt. <span class="loc">Kenya</span> — latest Pliocene to Pleistocene basalts, phonolites, and pyroclastics. In areas with free drainage conditions on moderate to steep slopes, lateritic and red to reddishbrown soils are present. some areas with black cotton soils indicate that the soils have formed under restricted drainage conditions, which are the result of low rainfall and the presence of level to moderate slopes.</p><br><br>
