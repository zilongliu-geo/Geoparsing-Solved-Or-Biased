  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Harvey</span> is a south suburb of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, located in <span class="loc">Cook County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 25,282 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city suffers from high levels of poverty (33.2%) and unemployment (22.0%). It also suffers from high levels of crime. <span class="per">Harvey</span> is bordered by <span class="loc">Dixmoor</span> and <span class="loc">Riverdale</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Dolton</span>, <span class="loc">Phoenix</span>, and <span class="loc">South Holland</span> to the east, <span class="loc">East Hazel Crest</span> to the south, and <span class="loc">Hazel Crest</span>, <span class="loc">Markham</span> and <span class="loc">Posen</span> to the west. <span class="per">Harvey</span> was founded in <span class="date">1891</span> by Christian leader <span class="per">Turlington</span> <span class="per">W. Harvey</span>, a close associate of <span class="per">Dwight Moody</span>, the founder of the <span class="org">Moody Bible Institute</span> in <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. <span class="per">Harvey</span> was originally intended as a model town for Christian values and was one of the Temperance Towns; it was closely modeled after the company town of <span class="loc">Pullman</span>, which eventually was annexed into the <span class="loc">city of Chicago</span>. The city saw its greatest growth during <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, but by <span class="date">the 1990s</span> it was losing population and its economy was in decline. In the 2000s and 2010s, Mayor <span class="per">Eric Kellogg</span> attempted to boost <span class="per">Harvey</span>'s economy with little success. <span class="per">Kellogg</span> offered developers millions of dollars in incentives to revive the long vacant Dixie Square Mall. In another plan to redevelop the Chicago Park Hotel, a developer was given $10 million from the city but then abandoned the project, leaving behind a gutted building.</p><br><br>
