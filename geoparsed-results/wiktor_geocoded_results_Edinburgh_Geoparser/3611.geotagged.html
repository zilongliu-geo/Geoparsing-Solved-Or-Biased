<p><span class="loc">Huntington</span> is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of <span class="loc">City of York</span> in <span class="loc">North Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Huntington</span> &amp; <span class="loc">New Earswick</span> ward and lies on the <span class="loc">River Foss</span>, to the north of <span class="loc">York</span> and the south of <span class="loc">Strensall</span>. Before 1996 it was part of the <span class="loc">Ryedale district</span> of <span class="loc">North Yorkshire</span>. According to the 2001 census <span class="loc">Huntington</span> had a population of 9,277, increasing to 12,108 at the 2011 census. <span class="loc">Huntington</span> is made up of mainly low-lying land, with the highest point in the village being only 64 feet above sea level. It covers some 4,800 acres (19 km2) and measures some 4 miles (6 km) from north to south and 3 miles (5 km) east to west. There has been a parish church (<span class="loc">All Saints</span>') in this village since 1086. <span class="loc">Huntington</span> originally included three villages within the parish boundaries: <span class="loc">Towthorpe</span>, <span class="loc">Earswick</span> and <span class="loc">Huntington</span>. <span class="loc">Huntington</span> itself also comprised the small township of <span class="loc">West Huntington</span>, including <span class="loc">West Huntington Hall</span>. The village is somewhat unusual in that the main settlement and church are separated by a river, the <span class="loc">Foss</span>. During the Middle Ages, the part of <span class="loc">Huntington</span> to the east of the <span class="loc">Foss</span> was part of the Forest of Galtres, a hunting royal forest that covered large areas of land to the north-east of <span class="loc">York</span> and is still referred to in many local place names. The Act of Dis-Afforestation of 1629 put an end to this.</p>
