<p>Linden is a municipality in the Bern-Mittelland administrative district in the canton of <span class="loc">Bern</span> in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. Ausserbirrmoos was the largest in land area of the three communities that formed Linden. It was first mentioned in 1298 as Birmos. Throughout the Middle Ages it was part of the Herrschaft of <span class="loc">Diessbach</span>. Originally it formed a single community with Innerbirrmoos, but in 1633 the two communities separated to form independent municipalities. It absorbed the land and population of the communities of Schöntal (BE) and Barschwand when they dissolved in 1887. In 1941, before the merger, it had a population of 466. <span class="loc">Otterbach</span> is first mentioned in 1236 as Ottirbach. Like Innerbirrmoos, around 1399 it became part of the <span class="loc">Bernese district</span> of Röthenbach and in 1529 the Landvogtei of <span class="loc">Signau</span>. It was the smallest and poorest of the three municipalities that joined to form Linden. In 1941 it had a population of 310. The hamlet of Linden was first mentioned in 1354. While it was geographically in the center of the three municipalities, it was never an independent municipality itself. All three municipalities, Ausserbirrmoos, Innerbirrmoos, and <span class="loc">Otterbach</span>, were part of the <span class="loc">parish of Oberdiessbach</span> until 1860, when they broke away to form the <span class="loc">parish of Kurzenberg</span>. After the creation of the independent municipality of Linden in 1945, it became the <span class="loc">parish of Linden</span>. The parish church was built in the hamlet of Linden in 1848. Since it was in the center of the communities, the local school was also built there. Beginning in the 1970s, a training base for the Swiss Army opened in the community. Today the municipality is still rural and agricultural in character, though about two-thirds of the working population commute to jobs outside the municipality.</p>
