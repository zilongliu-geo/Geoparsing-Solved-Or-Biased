<p><span class="loc">Dubrava</span> is the largest part of <span class="loc">Zagreb</span>, <span class="loc">Croatia</span>. It is located in the northeastern part of the city and divided by the Dubrava Avenue into two administrative areas: <span class="loc">Gornja Dubrava</span> (Upper Dubrava) <span class="loc">Donja Dubrava</span> (Lower Dubrava) The name comes from a Slavic toponym for oak forests. The species of oak that grows in this area is Quercus robur L. In its earliest days <span class="loc">Dubrava</span> was no more than a village, consisting of a couple of houses and gardens. It slowly grew, mostly because of intensive settling of people from all over <span class="loc">Croatia</span> to the <span class="loc">city of Zagreb</span> and surrounding areas. By the 1930s <span class="loc">Dubrava</span> had over hundred inhabitants and was connected with <span class="loc">Zagreb</span> via road. When World War II began, <span class="loc">Dubrava</span> already had electrical power and 250 inhabitants. During the war it was a partisan base due to its relative distance from mayor cities, and yet close to <span class="loc">Zagreb</span> and an ideal place from which partisans could operate within <span class="loc">Zagreb</span> itself. As the war raged partisans intensified their activities and started with diversions, although most of them were useless. Because of many victims of partisan bombing of public and military targets, army was sent to <span class="loc">Dubrava</span> and after investigations and skirmishes with partisans, the Army of the Independent State of Croatia hanged 13 partisans on December 1944. Later, these were termed "national heroes" and a monuments were built in their honor in the Park of December Victims and on the corner of the Konjščinska Street.</p>
