  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Duncan is a town in <span class="loc">Greenlee County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population of the town is 696. Duncan is at the juncture of the <span class="loc">Gila River</span> and the Arizona-New <span class="loc">Mexico</span> state border. Duncan lies on both sides of the <span class="loc">Gila</span>, although the primary portion of the town and the entire downtown area lie on the south side of the river. Duncan was founded in the mid 19th century, and the land was added to the <span class="loc">United States</span> as a part of the Mexican Cession. The town of Duncan has been destroyed twice by flood and once by fire. The town and area are primarily populated by ranchers and miners (especially from the Freeport-McMoran copper mines in SE <span class="loc">Arizona</span> and SW <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>). Surrounding smaller towns such as <span class="per">Franklin</span> and <span class="per">York</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span> and <span class="loc">Virden</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> use Duncan public works and public schools. Duncan and the surrounding area along the <span class="loc">Gila River</span> is world-renowned for Native American artifacts such as arrow heads, pottery, burial sites, cave paintings and other remnants of the Anasazi and other pre-historic cultures, as well as artifacts from garrison camps of the Expedition of Francisco VÃ¡squez de <span class="loc">Coronado</span>.</p><br><br>
