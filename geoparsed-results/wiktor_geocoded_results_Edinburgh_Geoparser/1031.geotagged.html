<p><span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Grafton County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,374 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> includes the village of <span class="loc">North Woodstock</span>, the commercial center. Its extensive land area is largely forested, and includes the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. Parts of the White Mountain National Forest are in the east and west. The Appalachian Trail crosses the town's northwest corner. Russell Pond Campground is in the east. West of <span class="loc">North Woodstock</span> is the <span class="loc">Lost River</span> Reservation. First granted in 1763, Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth named the town Peeling after an English town. Many of the first colonists were originally from <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. In 1771, his nephew, Governor John Wentworth, gave it the name <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, after <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. The town was renamed <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> in 1840 for <span class="loc">Blenheim Palace</span> in <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Logging became a principal early industry, with sawmills established using water power from the <span class="loc">Pemigewasset River</span>. The entrance of the railroad in the 19th century opened the wilderness to development, carrying away wood products to market. It also brought tourists, many attracted by paintings of the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span> by <span class="loc">White Mountain</span> artists. Several inns and hotels were built to accommodate the wealthy, who sought relief from the summer heat, humidity and pollution of coal-age <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">Hartford</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>. They often relaxed by taking carriage rides through the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span>, or by hiking along the <span class="loc">Lost River</span> in <span class="loc">Lost River</span> Reservation. But with the advent of automobiles, patrons were no longer restricted by the limits of rail service. Consequently, many grand hotels established near depots declined and closed. <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>, however, remains a popular tourist destination.</p>
