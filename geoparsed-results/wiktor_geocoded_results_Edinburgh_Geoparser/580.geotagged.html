<p>Milton is a village in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Adderbury</span> about 2.5 miles (4 km) south of <span class="loc">Banbury</span> in <span class="loc">Oxfordshire</span>, placed on the Milton road in between the villages of <span class="loc">Adderbury</span> and <span class="loc">Bloxham</span>: The Church of England parish church of <span class="loc">Saint John</span> the Evangelist was built in 1856 by the Gothic Revival architect William Butterfield. Milton has one public house, the Black Boy Inn, that was a gastropub, owned by chef Marco Pierre White, who now no longer owns it. The public house has an outdoor garden and children's climbing equipment. The former <span class="loc">Banbury</span> and <span class="loc">Cheltenham Direct Railway</span>, part of the Great Western Railway, was completed in 1881. The GWR opened a small railway station, Milton Halt, in 1908 on the northern edge of the village near <span class="loc">Manor Farm</span>. British Railways closed the halt in 1951 and closed the railway to freight traffic in 1964. The track was removed in 1965. The village is built near an affluent of the <span class="loc">River Cherwell</span>, and has many nature spots and footpaths surrounding it and leading from it. From 2008 until 2010, the village had a small, amateur tabloid newspaper, The Milton Mercury, published monthly.</p>
