<p>Dayton is a town in <span class="loc">Marengo County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 52 at the 2010 census, down from 60 in 2000. Dayton began to be settled in the early 19th century, with a town survey done and a "public well" established in 1832. The post office was established in 1837. It was incorporated on January 13, 1844. A devastating tornado hit the town in 1852. By 1860 the town had male and female academies, a hotel, cotton gin, oil mill, blacksmith shop, tavern, cabinet shop, drug store, and several general merchandise stores. The town also had several large homes, though most are now gone. One of the survivors, the William Poole House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The decrease in agricultural activity over the last century has reduced the population to a fraction of what it once was. Dayton is located at 32°20′59″N 87°38′28″W (32.349733, -87.641247). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2), all land.</p>
