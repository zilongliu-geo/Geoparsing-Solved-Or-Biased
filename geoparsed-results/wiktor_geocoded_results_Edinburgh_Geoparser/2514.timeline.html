  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ede</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Osun</span> State, southwestern <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. It lies along the <span class="loc">Osun</span> River at a point on the railroad from <span class="loc">Lagos</span>, 112 miles (180 km) southwest, and at the intersection of roads from <span class="loc">Oshogbo</span>, <span class="loc">Ogbomosho</span>, and <span class="loc">Ife</span>. <span class="loc">Ede</span> is one of the older towns of the Yoruba people. It is traditionally said to have been founded about <span class="date">1500</span> by Timi Agbale, a hunter and warlord sent by Alaafin (King) <span class="loc">Kori</span> of <span class="loc">Old Oyo</span> (<span class="loc">Katunga</span>), capital of the Oyo empire, to establish a settlement to protect the Oyo caravan route to <span class="loc">Benin</span> (127 miles [204 km] to the southeast). Nearby towns include <span class="loc">Awo</span>, <span class="loc">Iragberi</span> and <span class="loc">Oshogbo</span>. The present <span class="loc">Ede</span> was established by Timi Kubolaje Agbonran around <span class="date">1817</span> along with his siblings Oyefi, Ajenju, <span class="per">Arohanran</span> and <span class="per">Oduniyi</span>, all being the descendants of <span class="loc">Lalemo</span>. The former <span class="loc">Ede</span> is known as Ede-Ile. <span class="loc">Ede</span> is a predominantly Muslim town with about 90% of the population. This can be traced back to 19th century during the reign of Timi Abibu Lagunju as the king of <span class="loc">Ede</span>, who is most likely the first Muslim <span class="loc">Oba</span> in Yorubaland given the fact that he was already on the throne for <span class="date">a few years</span> when in <span class="date">November 1857</span>, the <span class="loc">Baptist</span> missionary <span class="per">W.H. Clarke</span> visited <span class="loc">Ede</span>. <span class="per">Clarke</span> record thus: "This young follower of the Prophet (Prophet Muhammad), <span class="date">a short time</span> since became the ruler of this town in the place of his father (<span class="per">Oduniyi</span>), the deceased, and brings with him into office, the influence of his new religion (Islam)."</p><br><br>
