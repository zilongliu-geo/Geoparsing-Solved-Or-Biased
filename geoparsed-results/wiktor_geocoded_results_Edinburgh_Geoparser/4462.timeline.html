  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jiexiu</span> (Chinese: 介休; pinyin: Jièxiū) is a county-level city of south-central <span class="loc">Shanxi province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. It is under the administration of <span class="loc">Jinzhong City</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Jiexiu</span> was established by <span class="loc">Chong</span>'er, <span class="per">Duke Wen</span> of <span class="loc">Jin</span>, during the Spring and <span class="date">Autumn</span> period to commemorate his retainer <span class="per">Jie Zitui</span>, who had loyally followed him during his <span class="date">years</span> of exile. Supposedly, he once even cut meat from his own thigh to provide <span class="loc">Chong</span>'er with soup. Once <span class="loc">Chong</span>'er was enthroned as duke, however, <span class="per">Jie</span> considered his services no longer required and resigned. Although <span class="per">Duke Wen</span> was generous in rewarding those who had helped him in his time of need, he long passed over <span class="per">Jie</span>, who had moved into the forest with his mother. <span class="per">Duke Wen</span> went to the forest in <span class="date">636 BC</span> but could not find them. He then ordered his men to set fire to the forest in order to force <span class="per">Jie</span> out. When <span class="per">Jie</span> and his mother were killed instead, the duke was overcome with remorse and ordered <span class="date">three days</span> without fire to honor <span class="per">Jie</span>'s memory. The city erected over the former forest is called <span class="loc">Jiexiu</span>, meaning "<span class="per">Jie</span>'s rest".</p><br><br>
