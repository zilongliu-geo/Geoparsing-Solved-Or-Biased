  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Brandon is a village in <span class="loc">Northumberland</span>, in <span class="loc">England</span>. It is about 9 miles (14 km) north-west of <span class="loc">Alnwick</span> and 8 miles (13 km) south of <span class="loc">Wooler</span> in the <span class="loc">Breamish</span> Valley, just off the A697 north of <span class="loc">Powburn</span>. The village, or hamlet, is actually all one farm, farmed by the <span class="org">Shell</span> family since at least the late 19th century. On the north side of the main road is a line of tied cottages and the old blacksmith's shop, still in good condition though lacking a blacksmith. On the south side is the traditional square of farm buildings and the Grade B listed farm house which <span class="date">now</span> also provides 'bed and breakfast' accommodation. Hidden in the corner of a small paddock next to the road is the mill race, apparently just a line of very large flagstones but covering a deep and well preserved stone channel, which shows that the traditional square farm buildings once contained a mill. Some more modern buildings have been added on, mostly to the west end of the farm, however the older buildings are still in good original condition.</p><br><br>
