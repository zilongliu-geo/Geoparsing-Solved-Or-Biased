  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dover</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Dutchess County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,699 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town was named after <span class="loc">Dover</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>, the home town of an early settler. The town of <span class="loc">Dover</span> is located on the eastern boundary of the county, north of <span class="loc">Pawling</span>, south of <span class="loc">Amenia</span>, and west of the state of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. In <span class="date">1637</span>, the Pequot people had been driven from their former homes in <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> and settled in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Dover</span>. They were led by <span class="per">Gideon Mauwee</span> for part of their time in this location. The town was formed in <span class="date">1807</span> from part of the town of <span class="loc">Pawling</span>. The first town meeting took place in the home of <span class="per">John Preston</span>, an early settler. That home, built circa <span class="date">1730</span>, is <span class="date">now</span> an inn and restaurant known as Old Drovers Inn. The Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center (<span class="date">1924</span>â€“<span class="date">1994</span>) was a major source of employment for <span class="loc">Dover</span> and the surrounding areas. When the center was closed in <span class="date">1994</span>, many businesses in the area were hit hard. Many of the brick and marble buildings on the grounds still stand. The property and buildings were purchased in <span class="date">2003</span> by the <span class="org">Benjamin Development Corporation</span>, and the eastern portion was sold to <span class="org">Olivet Management</span> in <span class="date">2013</span>.</p><br><br>
