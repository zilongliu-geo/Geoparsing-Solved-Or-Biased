  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Medina</span> /mᵻˈdaɪnə/ mə-DY-na is a city in <span class="loc">Medina County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. In <span class="date">2009</span>, CNNMoney named <span class="per">Medina</span> the 40th most desirable American city to live in. The population was 26,678 at the <span class="date">2010</span> Census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Medina County</span>. <span class="per">Medina</span> is located at 41°8′9″N 81°51′51″W (41.135899, -81.864069). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 12 square miles (31.08 km2), of which 11.8 square miles (30.56 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) is water. <span class="per">Medina</span> was founded in <span class="date">1818</span> as part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. It was originally named <span class="per">Mecca</span>, but an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> already had that name, so the name was changed. Both <span class="per">Mecca</span> and <span class="per">Medina</span> are cities in <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span> and particularly significant to <span class="loc">Islam</span>. Most early residents were farmers. In the 1830s, growth of the community was aided by the completion of the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Erie Canal</span>, which helped transport agricultural products to markets. In <span class="date">1835</span>, <span class="per">Medina</span> was incorporated as a village and as the county seat of <span class="loc">Medina County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. By <span class="date">1855</span>, the town's quarries were producing over $200,000 worth of stone per year. In <span class="date">1857</span>, many of the canal workers started a strike for higher wages; the striking workers were fired, and the four workers who started it were jailed in <span class="loc">Albion</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>.</p><br><br>
