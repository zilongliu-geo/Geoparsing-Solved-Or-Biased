  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Lila is a fifth income class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Bohol</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. Twenty kilometres (12 mi) from <span class="loc">Tagbilaran</span>, it is bounded to the east by <span class="loc">Dimiao</span>, to the west by <span class="loc">Loay</span> and to the north by <span class="loc">Loboc</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 11,985. Lila comprises 18 barangays, of which 10 are coastal and 8 inland: In <span class="date">1869</span>, during the Spanish Regime, a place called “Tinubdan” was discovered by the Spaniards. Passing a pool fed by a spring, their attention was caught by the water lilies whose flowers were of lilac, a unique shade of the color violet. And thus the place was referred to as Lilac which later evolved into Lila. The coastal town of Lila once belonged to the Municipality of <span class="loc">Dimiao</span>. It was composed of the barrios of the municipalities of <span class="loc">Loay</span> and <span class="loc">Dimiao</span>. In <span class="date">1899</span>, during the Spanish–American War, the municipal building, the church and neighboring houses were razed to the ground and burned. Thus, no records can be shown stating when Lila was annexed to the town of <span class="loc">Dimiao</span>. However, the Agustinian mission in <span class="loc">Bohol</span> has written that Lila was a separate municipality in <span class="date">1879</span>, with a population of 4,023.</p><br><br>
