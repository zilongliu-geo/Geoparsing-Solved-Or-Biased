  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pula</span> or <span class="loc">Pola</span> (Croatian pronunciation: [pǔːla] Pola Italian and Istro-Romanian; Latin: Colonia Pietas Iulia Pola Pollentia Herculanea; <span class="per">Slovene</span> and <span class="per">Chakavian</span>: <span class="loc">Pulj</span>, German: <span class="loc">Polei</span>, Ancient Greek: Πόλαι, Polae) is the largest city in <span class="loc">Istria County</span>, <span class="loc">Croatia</span>, situated at the southern tip of the Istria peninsula, with a population of 57,460 (<span class="date">2011</span>). Like the rest of the region, it is known for its mild climate, smooth sea, and unspoiled nature. The city has a long tradition of winemaking, fishing, shipbuilding, and tourism. It has also been Istria's administrative centre since ancient Roman times. <span class="org">Evidence</span> of the presence of Homo erectus <span class="date">1 million years ago</span> has been found in the cave of Šandalja near Pula/Pola. Pottery from the Neolithic period (6000–2000 BC), indicating human settlement, has been found around <span class="loc">Pula</span> - <span class="loc">Pola</span>. In the Bronze Age (<span class="date">1800</span>–<span class="date">1000</span> BC), a new type of settlement appeared in <span class="loc">Istria</span>, called 'gradine', or Hill-top fortifications. Many late Bronze Age bone objects, such as tools for smoothing and drilling, sewing needles, as well as spiral bronze pendants, have been found in the area around Pula/Pola. The type of materials found in Bronze Age sites in <span class="loc">Istria</span> connects these with sites along the <span class="loc">Danube</span>. The inhabitants of <span class="loc">Istria</span> in the Bronze Age are known as Proto Illyrians.</p><br><br>
