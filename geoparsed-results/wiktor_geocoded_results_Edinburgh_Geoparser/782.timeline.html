  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Riverside</span> is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Wichita</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. A mostly residential area located between the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> and Little <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Rivers, it is home to several of the city's museums and large parks. <span class="loc">Riverside</span> was founded in <span class="date">March 1886</span> when the <span class="loc">Riverside</span> Land Company, led by developer <span class="per">James Oakley</span> <span class="per">Davidson</span>, had the area surveyed and platted. The company intended for the new neighborhood to be <span class="loc">Wichita</span>'s most stylish residential area and supported the construction of bridges and a trolley line to connect it to downtown. The local real estate market collapsed <span class="date">the next year</span>, however, and development stalled for <span class="date">a decade</span>. By <span class="date">1889</span>, several of the company's investors, including <span class="per">Davidson</span> and <span class="per">Burton</span> <span class="per">Campbell</span>, had built large, luxurious homes for themselves. <span class="per">Campbell</span>'s mansion, modeled after a Scottish castle, became known as <span class="per">Campbell Castle</span> or <span class="per">Crumb Castle</span> locally and was eventually designated a historical landmark. In <span class="date">1897</span>, the <span class="loc">Wichita city</span> government purchased land in the neighborhood and began developing parks. It also built two more bridges, increasing access to the area and attracting more home buyers. <span class="loc">Riverside</span> became a popular recreational area for local residents, and development continued over the ensuing <span class="date">decades</span>. The <span class="loc">Riverside</span> Boathouse opened on the <span class="loc">Little Arkansas River</span> in the late 1890s followed by a zoo in Central <span class="loc">Riverside</span> Park in <span class="date">1921</span> and a public swimming pool in South <span class="loc">Riverside</span> Park in <span class="date">1923</span>. The <span class="org">Wichita Art Museum</span> opened in <span class="date">1935</span>. In <span class="date">1938</span>, the Works Progress Administration replaced the pool with a second pool called Municipal Beach.</p><br><br>
