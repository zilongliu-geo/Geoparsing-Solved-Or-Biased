  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Wellington</span> is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Collingsworth County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,189 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Sometime in <span class="date">1889</span> or <span class="date">1890</span>, as smaller ranches and farmlands were being purchased, <span class="per">Ernest Theodore O'Neil</span>, his brother-in-law <span class="per">John Simon McConnell</span>, and <span class="per">John W. Swearingen</span>, together had purchased the land upon which the town currently sits, for $5.00 per acre. Subsequently, <span class="per">O'Neil</span>, who originally owned a fourth of the section of the township, purchased the interests of <span class="loc">McConnell</span> and <span class="loc">Swearingen</span>, and retained sole ownership of the land. The <span class="date">1890</span> census showed 357 inhabitants across the county, with 89 ranches and farms and 335 acres (1.36 km2) of land in cultivation. In <span class="date">August 1890</span>, a petition was circulated to organize the county, choose a county seat, and elect county officers. Two potential townships were proposed: <span class="per">Wellington</span> and <span class="per">Pearl</span>. The proposed town of <span class="per">Wellington</span> was located on the land owned by <span class="per">Ernest T. O'Neil</span> who was promoting this location, and had been given its proposed name by his wife, <span class="per">Matilda Anna Elisabeth</span> "Lizzie" <span class="per">O'Neil</span>, who greatly admired the <span class="per">Duke of Wellington</span>, hero of the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. The alternate and proposed town of <span class="per">Pearl</span> was located several miles north of <span class="per">Wellington</span>.</p><br><br>
