  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Fire near Orlando might shut I-4. <span class="date">Mar. 21</span> -- The smoke is back -- and with it the need for drivers to check conditions before they hit the road. A rapidly growing brush fire made commuting an ordeal for drivers on Interstate 4 on <span class="date">Friday night</span> and threatens to close the highway <span class="date">today</span> between <span class="per">DeLand</span> and <span class="per">Daytona</span> Beach if winds flare up as expected. '' It's [the weather] so unpredictable, we never know when we're going to have to shut it down,'' said <span class="per">Sgt. Kim Miller</span>, a Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman. Fifteen brush fires were burning in <span class="loc">Volusia County</span> on <span class="date">Friday</span>, and another was under control in <span class="loc">Osceola</span>. The largest, spanning 800 acres near State Road 44, was first reported <span class="date">March 6</span> and was caused by people, according to the <span class="org">U.S. Forestry Service Web</span> site. It doubled in size from <span class="date">Thursday morning</span> to <span class="date">Friday night</span>, said Shelley Szafraniec, a <span class="loc">Volusia County</span> spokeswoman. It is in a wooded, swampy area near <span class="per">DeLand</span> difficult for firefighters to reach, she said. The blaze was within an eighth of a mile of I-4, but officials said they didn't plan to close the road unless it burned closer. Motorists were advised to slow down and use their lights if visibility dims. '' People need to use caution in this area,'' <span class="per">Szafraniec</span> said. The flames, fanned by high winds, jumped a line that firefighters plowed. They weren't visible from the road. But smoke could be seen -- and smelled -- as far away as north <span class="loc">Seminole County</span>. Eight Florida Highway Patrol troopers were monitoring conditions. If flames burn across the highway, the road would be closed between I-95 and S.R. 472, <span class="per">Miller</span> said. Dry weather is expected to continue until the rainy season starts in mid-May, said <span class="per">Bob Wimmer</span>, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. Winds, which are expected to kick up to 20mph this afternoon, won't help. '' Conditions have been dry, and we're getting into the driest part of our year,'' he said. A <span class="loc">La Nina</span> weather pattern is partly to blame, said <span class="per">Tony Cristaldi</span>, another weather-service meteorologist. The phenomenon, which shifts <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> temperatures and North American wind patterns, usually turns the rain spigot off for <span class="loc">Florida</span> during the <span class="date">winter</span> and spring. The system is weakening, but ''the atmosphere doesn't instantaneously react,'' <span class="per">Cristaldi</span> said. ``We're expected to stay dry right through the spring.'' The <span class="loc">Florida Division</span> of Forestry is working to control the flames with help from <span class="loc">Volusia County</span> firefighters, said Timber Weller of the forestry division. '' Being this dry, and the humidity being low, makes it very difficult to stop a fire,'' he said. ``The conditions are really stacked against them [firefighters] right <span class="date">now</span>.'' Meanwhile, a 300-acre-plus brush fire was contained by <span class="date">Friday night</span> in east <span class="loc">Osceola County</span>. The fire is near Crabgrass, <span class="loc">Owens</span> and <span class="loc">Harris</span> roads east of rural <span class="loc">Holopaw</span>, county spokeswoman <span class="per">Niki Whisler</span> said. One or two dozen homes are nearby but are not in immediate danger, she said. '' One problem we have is the wind keeps shifting,'' <span class="per">Whisler</span> said. The fire started <span class="date">Thursday</span>, died down and flared again <span class="date">Friday</span>.</p><br><br>
