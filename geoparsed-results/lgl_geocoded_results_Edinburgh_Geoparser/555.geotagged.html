<p>LST-325 to travel to <span class="loc">Jeffersonville</span> in August. <span class="loc">JEFFERSONVILLE</span>, Ind. (AP) &#x97; A World War II troop landing ship typically docked in <span class="loc">Evansville</span> will travel to <span class="loc">Jeffersonville</span> in August. The LST-325 will spend more than a week at the city's riverfront from Aug. 21-30. The visit coincides with the <span class="loc">American Legion</span>'s national convention in nearby <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">Ky</span>. The LST-325 attracted thousands of visitors to <span class="loc">Jeffersonville</span> during a four-day visit in 2003. Mayor Tom Galligan says he expects this year's crowd to fill downtown. The ship was built in 1942 to hold 300 soldiers and 20 Sherman tanks. It landed on the beaches of <span class="loc">Normandy</span> during the D-Day invasion of <span class="loc">Europe</span> and made other trips ferrying troops and equipment to soldiers pushing to break the German stronghold on western <span class="loc">Europe</span>.</p>
