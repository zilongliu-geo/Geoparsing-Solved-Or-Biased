  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Prospect is a town in <span class="loc">Waldo County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 709 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The most prominent landmark in Prospect is <span class="loc">Fort Knox</span>, a large 19th-century fort. It is <span class="date">now</span> a major tourist attraction, as is the Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory. Originally part of <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>, it was settled in <span class="date">1759</span> when Fort Pownall was completed at <span class="loc">Fort Point</span> on <span class="loc">Cape Jellison</span>. Prospect was set off and incorporated in <span class="date">1794</span>. Land was then set off from Prospect in <span class="date">1845</span> to form part of <span class="loc">Searsport</span>. <span class="loc">Stockton</span> (later <span class="loc">Stockton</span> Springs) was set off and incorporated in <span class="date">1857</span>. Shipbuilding was an early industry. By <span class="date">1859</span>, the town had one gristmill, three sawmills and a shingle mill. Construction on <span class="loc">Fort Knox</span> began in <span class="date">1844</span>, using granite from <span class="loc">Mount Waldo</span> in <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>. It was built to defend the <span class="loc">Penobscot River</span> and the lumber port of <span class="loc">Bangor</span> during the <span class="org">Aroostook War</span>. Although never fully completed, work on the huge defense stopped in <span class="date">1869</span>.
