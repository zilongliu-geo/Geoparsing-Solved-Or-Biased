  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>No one injured in Newberry home invasion. A shot fired into the floor during a home invasion robbery in <span class="loc">Newberry</span> on <span class="date">Friday night</span> may have been accidental, according to <span class="loc">Alachua County</span> Sheriff’s Office deputies. The incident began at 11:05 p.m. in a home in the 25400 block of SW 2nd <span class="loc">Ave</span>. The homeowner said he was inside his home a minute or so when four men forced their way into the home. Deputies said a woman who was a friend of the homeowner was also in the house at the time. The man and the woman told deputies that four masked men, including one carrying a gun, forced them to lie on the kitchen floor. The man said that when the intruders demanded money, he told them he did not have a safe or cash in his home. Instead, the masked men took cash and credit cards from the man’s pockets along with his cell phone. “Apparently he was not lying still enough and the suspect with the gun fired a round that went through the kitchen floor,” said sheriff’s spokesman <span class="per">Art Forgey</span>. After the gun went off, the intruders talked among themselves, saying that a shooting was not a part of the plan and asking the shooter why he had fired the weapon. “That makes us believe it may have been accidental,” <span class="per">Forgey</span> said. “And they picked up the man and the woman from the kitchen floor to make sure they were not hurt before they made them get back down onto the floor.” Before the men left the home, they also grabbed jewelry and a laptop computer from the bedroom of the homeowners’ daughter, who was not at home at the time of the incident. Witnesses told deputies they saw a white, police-type sedan in the area shortly before the home invasion. The victims told deputies that the four men were similar in appearance &#x96; all were black men, about 5-9 to 5-10 with thin builds and <span class="date">about 20 years</span> old. All four were wearing ski masks and were dressed in dark clothing, including baggy jeans and jackets. Anyone with information about the home invasion is asked to contact the Sheriff’s Office at 955-1818.</p><br><br>
