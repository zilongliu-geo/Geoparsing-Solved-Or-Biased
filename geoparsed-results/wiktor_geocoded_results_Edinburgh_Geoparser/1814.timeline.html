  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jaba</span> is a Local Government Area in <span class="loc">Kaduna State</span>, <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. Its headquarters are in the town of <span class="loc">Kwoi</span> (Har Kwain) in Hyam, the language of almost all the entire inhabitants of the local area. The people know themselves as the Ham and speak Hyam but are called 'Jaba' by the <span class="loc">Hausa</span>. The origin of the word 'Jaba' is suggested by Koelle (1854:19) to have emerged during the contact of the people of Ham with the <span class="loc">Hausa</span> just about 1800s. Koelle's book records four (4) Ham youth captured during a war with the <span class="loc">Hausa</span> in <span class="date">1846</span>/7 and sold into slavery as revealed in an interview in <span class="date">1853</span>. According to the youth, the people are Ham or <span class="per">Fu Ham</span> but labelled 'Jaaba' by the <span class="loc">Hausa</span>. This suggests the label, <span class="loc">Jaba</span>, was not accepted by the Ham at least before the <span class="date">year 1846</span>â€“7 when the youth who gave information about the area were captured. The use of <span class="loc">Jaba</span> to refer to the Ham therefore may not have been <span class="date">more than 168 years</span> <span class="date">now</span>. Further, the meaning of the word 'Jaba' is not clear but it is suggestive of a derogatory description of the people of Ham as the house mouse/rat with the long mouth, poisonous and dangerous (<span class="per">Hayab, J. P.</span> no date).</p><br><br>
