  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Meteor or piece of spacecraft caused fireball, boom, expert says. A fireball and big boom that people witnessed <span class="date">Sunday night</span> could have been caused by a meteor or even a falling part from a Russian spacecraft, experts say. "I know it's one of the two," said <span class="per">Geoff Chester</span>, an astronomer and public relations officer with the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Naval Observatory in <span class="loc">Washington</span>. "I just can't tell you definitively which one it actually was." People in parts of Virginia, <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> reported a light similar to fireworks about 9:40 p.m., followed by an explosive sound. <span class="per">Chester</span> suggested that a falling Russian booster rocket caused the hubbub. The booster -- a steel cylinder about 25 feet long and 8 feet wide -- was part of the Soyuz spacecraft that launched <span class="date">Thursday</span> on a mission to the International Space Station. The booster was expected to fall toward Earth on a path, headed east, that would have taken it across the <span class="loc">Chesapeake</span> Bay region <span class="date">Sunday night</span>, <span class="per">Chester</span> said. The booster would have burned in the friction of the Earth's atmosphere and, as it slowed below the speed of sound, it would have released energy that caused a sonic boom, <span class="per">Chester</span> said. "My feeling is this is what people actually saw," <span class="per">Chester</span> said. <span class="per">Stefan Bocchino</span>, a spokesman for the Joint Space Operations Center at <span class="loc">Vandenberg Air Force Base</span> in <span class="loc">California</span>, said experts there do not think the light was caused by a manmade object. The Joint Space Operations Center tracks manmade objects that enter the atmosphere. The National Weather Service has ruled out any weather-related cause. Other experts said the light and boom sound like the work of a meteor. Meteors are bits of space rock or gravel that burn and create light when they hit the atmosphere. "Some very bright ones are known to explode," creating a sound, said <span class="per">Phillip Ianna</span>, a professor emeritus of astronomy at the <span class="org">University</span> of Virginia. Meteors typically burn up in the atmosphere. Much less often, a small piece of the rock will hit Earth. <span class="per">Steve Chesley</span>, an astronomer with <span class="loc">NASA</span>, said the <span class="date">Sunday</span> phenomenon could be the work of a meteor the size of a television set or small car. "These kinds of things hit the [atmosphere] once <span class="date">a month</span>," <span class="per">Chesley</span> said. They usually fall over water or less-populated areas and attract less attention. <span class="loc">NASA</span> doesn't track such small objects, <span class="per">Chesley</span> said, and focuses instead on big ones -- space rocks half the length of a football field or more -- that are headed toward Earth. "It's the big ones we're worried about, and we need to find them <span class="date">decades</span> in advance," <span class="per">Chesley</span> said. The object on <span class="date">Sunday</span> had to be unusually bright to be seen in urban areas, where artificial lights drown out most celestial objects, said <span class="per">David Hagan</span>, a staff scientist with the <span class="loc">Science Museum of Virginia</span>. "It had to be quite a phenomenon to be observed from <span class="loc">Shockoe</span> Bottom," <span class="per">Hagan</span> said. <span class="per">Brian Munford</span>, 43, of <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, was driving in <span class="loc">Short Pump</span> when he saw the light. "It was like a Roman candle headed the wrong way, coming down. . . . It was pretty cool-looking." <span class="per">Chester</span>, of the Naval Observatory, said objects burning in the sky can appear deceptively close when they actually are many miles away.</p><br><br>
