  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Monte Hermoso</span> is a town located on the Atlantic coast of <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, some 100 km (62 mi) east of the <span class="loc">city of Bah√≠a Blanca</span>, in the south of the Province of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>. It is the administrative seat of the partido of <span class="loc">Monte Hermoso</span>. Founded at the beginning of the twentieth century, <span class="loc">Monte Hermoso</span> is a family seaside resort with more than 32 km (20 mi) of beach overlooking the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> and with the unique characteristic in <span class="loc">Argentina</span> of having both sunrises and sunsets over the sea. The <span class="date">summer</span> climate of <span class="loc">Monte Hermoso</span> is more temperate than that of other major seaside resorts due to the sea breeze effect, while the water itself is warmer, making for a pleasant beach experience. <span class="loc">Monte Hermoso</span> owes its existence to the <span class="date">1879</span> purchase of 4,000 seaside hectares (10,000 acres) by <span class="per">Esteban Dufaur</span>. His son, <span class="per">Sulpicio</span>, created the <span class="loc">El Recreo</span> estancia in <span class="date">1910</span>, and in <span class="date">1918</span>, began welcoming guests with the inaugural of the <span class="per">Hotel de Madera</span>; the hotel was built by Dafaur with lumber salvaged from a shipwreck on the shore. The settlement was established as such in <span class="date">1975</span>, and given autonomy on <span class="date">April 1, 1979</span>.</p><br><br>
