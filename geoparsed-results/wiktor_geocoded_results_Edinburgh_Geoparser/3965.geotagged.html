The population was 227 at the 2010 census. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.36 square miles (0.93 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Lismore</span> is situated on the western slope of the Buffalo Ridge, a drainage divide separating the <span class="loc">Mississippi River</span> and <span class="loc">Missouri River</span> systems. Main highways include: <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> State Highway 91 <span class="loc">Nobles County</span> Road 16 <span class="loc">Nobles County</span> Road 19 The town of <span class="loc">Lismore</span> was named after Lismore Township which, in turn, was named after a village in <span class="loc">County Waterford</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, noted for its beautiful castle. The name for Lismore Township was suggested by Father C. J. Knauf of Adrian. <span class="loc">Lismore</span> owes its existence to the building of the Burlington Railroad through northeast <span class="loc">Nobles County</span>. The railroad established the towns of Reading and Wilmont in 1899. When the railroad reached present-day <span class="loc">Lismore</span> at 3:00 pm on Saturday, June 9, 1900, construction of the town immediately commenced. The first business on site was the St. Croix Lumber company which sold its wares from a tent pitched next to a large pile of lumber hauled in from Wilmont. The first building in town was built by James Beacom and was used as a saloon. The second building in town was the O. B. Bratager store building. James Montgomery started a small grain elevator, and James Ramage opened a lumber yard and hardware store under the management of Arch Priest. The Bank of Lismore opened its doors on September 1, 1900, and was incorporated as the <span class="loc">State Bank</span> of <span class="loc">Lismore</span> three months later. A livery stable, a butcher shop, a restaurant, and a blacksmith shop were also opened in that first year. A school house, churches, several businesses, and many residences were constructed in 1901.</p>
