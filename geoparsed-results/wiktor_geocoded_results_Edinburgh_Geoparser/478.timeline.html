  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dover</span> (/ˈdoʊvər/; French: <span class="loc">Douvres</span>) is a town and major ferry port in the home <span class="loc">county of Kent</span>, in <span class="loc">South East England</span>. It faces <span class="loc">France</span> across the strait of <span class="loc">Dover</span>, the narrowest part of the English Channel, and lies south-east of <span class="loc">Canterbury</span>; east of <span class="loc">Kent</span>'s county town <span class="loc">Maidstone</span>; and north-east along the coastline from <span class="loc">Dungeness</span> and <span class="loc">Hastings</span>. The town is the administrative centre of the <span class="loc">Dover District</span> and home of the Dover Calais ferry through the Port of <span class="loc">Dover</span>. The surrounding chalk cliffs have become known as the <span class="loc">White Cliffs</span> of <span class="loc">Dover</span>. Its strategic position has been evident throughout its history: archaeological finds have revealed that the area has always been a focus for peoples entering and leaving <span class="loc">Britain</span>. The name of the town derives from the name of the river that flows through it, the River Dour. The town has been inhabited since the Stone Age according to archaeological finds, and <span class="loc">Dover</span> is one of only a few places in <span class="loc">Britain</span> – <span class="loc">London</span>, <span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>, and <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> being other examples – to have a corresponding name in the French language, <span class="loc">Douvres</span>.</p><br><br>
