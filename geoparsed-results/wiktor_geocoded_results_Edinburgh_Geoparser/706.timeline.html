  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Weston</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Umatilla County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was originally a post office called Mitchell's Station, established in <span class="date">February 1867</span>. In <span class="date">September 1869</span>, <span class="per">T.T. Lieuallen</span> renamed the post office after his hometown, <span class="loc">Weston</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The population was 667 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the Pendleton–Hermiston <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Weston</span> was incorporated by the <span class="org">Oregon Legislative Assembly</span> on <span class="date">October 19, 1878</span>. <span class="loc">Weston</span> is best known for its connection with novelist <span class="per">Nard Jones</span> (<span class="date">1904</span>–<span class="date">1972</span>), who lived in the city with his parents between <span class="date">1919</span> and <span class="date">1927</span>, and whose first novel <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Detour was set in an <span class="loc">Oregon</span> town of 600 inhabitants called "Creston". When his novel, written according to the tenets of the New Realism literary movement (established <span class="date">years</span> before by <span class="per">Sherwood Anderson</span>, <span class="per">Sinclair Lewis</span> and others) was published in <span class="date">1930</span>, many of the residents were convinced that his characters were based on local inhabitants, and considered the work a slander against the town. While the legend that <span class="per">Jones</span> was sued and ran out of town for his book is not true, members of the town made an effort to locally suppress access to the book: copies of the novel were stolen from the local library; after the novel became the subject for a high school student's book report, his English teacher removed the book from both the reading list and the high school library. According to <span class="per">George Venn</span>, local literary historian, even in <span class="date">the 1980s</span>, "trying to figure out or trying to remember who the 'real people' in the novel is still a local pastime."</p><br><br>
