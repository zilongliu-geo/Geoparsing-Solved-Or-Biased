  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Standing by <span class="loc">Sudan</span>. As unfavorable ideas go, this one is a corker, as far as <span class="loc">Egypt</span> is concerned. The choices that confront <span class="loc">Sudan</span> preoccupy <span class="loc">Egypt</span>. One danger, for both <span class="loc">Egypt</span> and <span class="loc">Sudan</span>, lies in failing to think clearly about short term and long term. In the short term, peace in <span class="loc">Darfur</span> is a priority for both <span class="loc">Egypt</span> and <span class="loc">Sudan</span>. In the long term, <span class="loc">Sudan</span>'s territorial integrity and national sovereignty are at stake. "<span class="loc">Egypt</span> seeks peace and we don't have a hidden agenda," President <span class="per">Hosni Mubarak</span> declared. <span class="loc">Egypt</span> proposed a United Nations conference to discuss the ICC indictment of <span class="loc">Bashir</span>, even though the Sudanese government declined Cairo's bid on the pretext that it might lead to the internationalisation of the issue. Southern <span class="loc">Sudan</span> is rich in economic resources, which attracts Western and Asian, especially Chinese, interests out to make a quick kill. With this in mind, <span class="loc">Egypt</span> understands the gravity of the threat that faces <span class="loc">Sudan</span>. Peacekeepers have a deplorable record in Sub-Saharan <span class="loc">Africa</span>. Their failure to protect civilians from ill-disciplined government troops and pro-government militias is proverbial. In <span class="loc">Sudan</span> the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in <span class="loc">Darfur</span> (UNAMID) has so far kept a relatively low profile. Some 1,500 Egyptian troops are currently stationed in <span class="loc">Darfur</span>, even though certain <span class="loc">Darfur</span> armed opposition groups objected to the Egyptian participation in UNAMID, most notably the <span class="per">Justice</span> and <span class="per">Equality</span> Movement and the <span class="org">Sudan Liberation Army</span>. <span class="loc">Egypt</span> was one of the first countries to send its UNAMID contingency to <span class="loc">Darfur</span>. In the turbulent aftermath of the ICC indictment of Sudanese <span class="per">President Al-Bashir</span> <span class="date">the future</span> of the hitherto buoyant Sudanese economy may be in jeopardy. "This is the last thing <span class="loc">Egypt</span> wants. <span class="loc">Egypt</span> would like to see a prosperous, politically stable and peaceful <span class="loc">Sudan</span>," El-Feki explained. "<span class="loc">Egypt</span> is poised for participating positively in <span class="loc">Sudan</span>'s economic uplift." "As far as <span class="loc">Egypt</span> is concerned, the indictment of <span class="per">President Al-Bashir</span> by the ICC would have a detrimental impact on the Sudanese economy. That is neither in the interest of <span class="loc">Sudan</span> nor <span class="loc">Egypt</span>," El-Feki added. The cost to <span class="loc">Sudan</span> of withholding aid might be high at a time of global penny- pinching. But the consequences of inaction will be far higher. It is against this backdrop that <span class="loc">Egypt</span> is prepared to help <span class="loc">Sudan</span> in any fashion the Sudanese people require. <span class="loc">Sudan</span> is bracing itself for a big bang and a perfect storm. The country stands at the crossroads. This is a testing time for the current and future administrations of <span class="loc">Sudan</span>, and Egyptian officials are acutely conscious of the Sudanese conundrum and are at pains to explain that they would back whatever decisions the Sudanese people adopt. If push comes to shove, managing a potentially tricky Sudanese transition will not be easy. Moreover, it would be a protracted affair and may prove awkward for both <span class="loc">Egypt</span> and <span class="loc">Sudan</span>. For all these reasons, <span class="loc">Egypt</span> assumes its responsibilities to drive forward this necessary new <span class="loc">Sudan</span>. Tacit agreement to do nothing would be dangerous for both neighbours. There are other reasons for caution. The need for dialogue between all the rival Sudanese factions is pivotal. "It is for this reason that <span class="loc">Egypt</span> attempts to maintain close contacts with all the various political groups, both government and opposition," El-Feki stressed. "At the same time we should work on initiatives to drive forward a more productive, more democratic <span class="loc">Sudan</span>," he concluded. <span class="loc">Egypt</span> may not have much leverage over <span class="loc">Sudan</span>, but a rift in bilateral relations between <span class="loc">Egypt</span> and its neighbour to its immediate south will be detrimental to both countries. The balkanisation of <span class="loc">Sudan</span> will come at a time when <span class="loc">Egypt</span> can least afford it. "But this is a question for the Sudanese people to determine." "We are only concerned about <span class="loc">Sudan</span>'s interests and the welfare of its people," <span class="per">Mubarak</span> stated categorically. He dispatched Foreign Minister <span class="per">Ahmed Abul</span>- Gheit and General Intelligence <span class="per">Chief Omar Suleiman</span> to the Sudanese capital <span class="loc">Khartoum</span> to discuss the latest crisis concerning the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for <span class="per">President Omar Al-Bashir</span>. Egyptian officials concur that the primary purpose of <span class="loc">Egypt</span>'s solidarity with <span class="loc">Sudan</span> is to advance the interests of the "two fraternal neighbouring states," as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the People's Assembly <span class="per">Mustafa El-Feki</span> told . "<span class="loc">Sudan</span> constitutes the strategic depth of <span class="loc">Egypt</span> and is key to its water security and potentially for its food security too. <span class="loc">Sudan</span>'s agricultural potential is tremendous and yet untapped. <span class="loc">Egypt</span> is prepared to step up its agricultural investment in <span class="loc">Sudan</span>. And, we are prepared to work with representatives of all the various Sudanese groups and regions. If the southern Sudanese people decide to secede, we are ready to accept and respect their choice. If they decide to stay within a federal <span class="loc">Sudan</span>, we will back them. Among numerous joint ventures, we have established a branch of the <span class="org">University</span> of Alexandria in the southern Sudanese capital of <span class="loc">Darfur</span>."</p><br><br>
