  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Mitchell is a city in <span class="loc">Marion Township</span>, <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,350 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the birthplace of astronaut <span class="per">Gus Grissom</span>, who flew on <span class="loc">Liberty Bell</span> 7, Gemini 3, and died in a launch pad fire at <span class="org">Kennedy Space Center</span> in <span class="date">1967</span>. Mitchell was built as a railroad town in the mid-19th century. At this location in <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>, the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Indianapolis</span> and <span class="loc">Louisville Railroad</span>, better known by the shorter name of "the <span class="loc">Monon</span>", was built as a north-south line from <span class="loc">New Albany</span> to <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, passing through the area which became Mitchell in <span class="date">1853</span>. In <span class="date">1857</span>, the east-west <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Mississippi Railway</span> (later part of the <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Railroad</span>) was completed, as part of a link between <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span> and <span class="per">St. Louis</span>. At the intersection of the two rail lines, a new town was planned. As the O&amp;M railroad was surveyed, the owners of the land arranged for one of the surveyors, <span class="loc">Ormsby</span> <span class="loc">McKnight</span> <span class="loc">Mitchel</span> (<span class="date">1810</span>–<span class="date">1862</span>), a <span class="loc">West Point</span> graduate and professor at the <span class="org">University of Cincinnati</span>, to plat their new town in exchange for naming it for him. (The second "L" in Mitchell was added later). A native of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="per">Ormsby Mitchel</span> grew up in <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, and was also an attorney and notable astronomer. He later became a Major General in the <span class="org">Union Army</span> during the American Civil War (<span class="date">1861</span>–<span class="date">1865</span>), and is best known for ordering the raid that became famous as the Great Locomotive Chase. He was known as "Old Stars". <span class="per">General Mitchel</span> died of yellow fever while serving in <span class="loc">Beaufort</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. [1]</p><br><br>
