  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is the seventh largest city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. Located 15 miles (24 km) west of downtown <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span> in <span class="loc">Hennepin County</span>, the city is the third largest suburb of Minneapolisâ€“Saint Paul, which is the fifteenth largest metropolitan area in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, with about 3.46 million residents. The population was 70,576 at the <span class="date">2010</span> Census. Once named for <span class="loc">Medicine Lake</span>, the city's name was chosen by <span class="loc">Hennepin County</span> Commissioners during the county's inception. Plymouth's history can be traced back to the pre-Columbian period around <span class="date">1400</span> to <span class="date">1500</span> AD. The original inhabitants were the Dakota. Their encampment was at the north end of <span class="loc">Medicine Lake</span>. The name <span class="loc">Medicine Lake</span> is derived from the Dakota word Mdewakanton, meaning "<span class="org">Lake of the Spirit</span>." The Dakota named the lake after a warrior overturned his canoe and his body was never recovered. <span class="per">Antoine LeCounte</span>, a guide and explorer, was the first settler to this area. He arrived in <span class="date">1848</span>, but did not settle until <span class="date">1852</span>. He carried mail from the <span class="loc">Red River</span> country to points south, trading goods to Native Americans for horses on the way. <span class="per">LeCounte</span> built the first cabin at what is <span class="date">now</span> East <span class="loc">Medicine Lake</span> Boulevard at 29th Avenue North.</p><br><br>
