<p><span class="loc">Salta</span> is a hamlet in the parish of <span class="loc">Holme St Cuthbert</span> in northwestern <span class="loc">Cumbria</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. It is located 1.1 miles (1.8 km) southwest of the village of <span class="loc">Mawbray</span>, and 25.1 miles (40.4 km) southwest of the <span class="loc">city of Carlisle</span>. It has a population of about 35 people. <span class="loc">Salta</span> can only be accessed from the lane from <span class="loc">Mawbray</span>, which goes on to join the B5300 coast road, although two public bridleways provide access over the fields from <span class="loc">Hailforth</span> and <span class="loc">Mawbray</span>. The hamlet consists of mainly bungalows, and a farm is still in operation in the vicinity. A caravan park, Manor House Park, is situated across the Moss to the southeast, to the southwest of the hamlet of <span class="loc">Edderside</span>. The settlement's name is derived from "sÄ“alt-tir", meaning "salt land" in Old English, as during Anglo-Saxon times, salt making was a major industry on the <span class="loc">Solway Plain</span>. Fortified during the Roman period, in the 1550s, <span class="loc">Salta</span> participated in a system called "seawake", a night watch to guard the coast against incursions across the <span class="loc">Solway</span> by the Scots. <span class="loc">Salta Moss</span> was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1954 and forms part of the <span class="loc">Solway</span> Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is home to a diversity of wildlife, including Adders, <span class="loc">Britain</span>'s only native venomous snake, and several varieties of heather, as well as the purple moor grass Molinia caerulea.</p>
