<p>Vita (/vɑːjtə/ Ukrainian: Вайта; translit. <span class="loc">Vaita</span>) is a small community in Southeastern <span class="loc">Manitoba</span> settled by Ukrainian immigrants in the late 1890s. It is roughly 50 km by road from <span class="loc">Steinbach</span>, <span class="loc">Manitoba</span> (via PTH 12 and Provincial Road 302) in the Rural Municipality of Stuartburn. The village's name means "life" in the Ukrainian language, and is pronounced as in vitamin; "bella vita" [beautiful life] in Italian is pronounced "veeda". Vita has a multi-cultural population with residents from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, the largest being Ukrainian and Mennonite. Vita is served by "Shevchenko School" (part of the Border Land School Division), built in 1970. It educates Kindergarten through Grade 12. From 1965 until 1991 the Ukrainian language (in the Canadian Ukrainian dialect) was taught as an option at the elementary and secondary levels – parallel to the French language. Businesses and services in Vita include, but are not limited to: a restaurant, fuel station, hospital, credit union with drive-thru ATM, post office, two grocery stores, an arena-curling rink, a liquor store, and a hotel-motel.</p>
