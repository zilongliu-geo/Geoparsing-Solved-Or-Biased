<p><span class="loc">Alexandria</span> is a city in and the parish seat of <span class="loc">Rapides Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies on the south bank of the <span class="loc">Red River</span> in almost the exact geographic center of the state. It is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Alexandria</span> metropolitan area (population 153,922) which encompasses all of Rapides and Grant parishes. Its neighboring city is <span class="loc">Pineville</span>. In 2010, the population was 47,723, an increase of 3 percent from the 2000 census. Located along the <span class="loc">Red River</span>, the <span class="loc">city of Alexandria</span> was originally home to a community which supported activities of the adjacent Spanish outpost of Post du Rapides. The area developed as an assemblage of traders and merchants in the agricultural lands bordering the mostly unsettled areas to the north and providing a link from the south to the <span class="loc">El Camino Real</span> and then larger settlement of Natchitoches, the oldest permanent settlement in the <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> Purchase. Alexander Fulton, a businessman from <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, near <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, received a land grant from <span class="loc">Spain</span> in 1785, and the first organized settlement was made at some point in the 1790s. In 1805, Fulton and business partner Thomas Harris Maddox laid out the town plan and named the town in Fulton's honor. The earliest deed that survives, for an <span class="loc">Alexandria</span> resident is from June 24, 1805 when a William Cochren who identifies himself as a "of the Town of <span class="loc">Alexandria</span>" sold a tract of land across the <span class="loc">Red River</span> to a William Murrey.[<span class="loc">Louisiana</span> State Land Office, Historical Records, Sales Documents, South Western District, Sales Letters, 39].</p>
