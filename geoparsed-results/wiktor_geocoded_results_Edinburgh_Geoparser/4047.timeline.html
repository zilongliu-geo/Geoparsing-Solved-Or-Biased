  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it had a population of 32,957. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat and largest city is <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is included in the St. Louis, <span class="loc">MO-IL Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is located in the southern portion of <span class="loc">Illinois</span> known locally as "<span class="loc">Little Egypt</span>". Indigenous peoples lived along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River and related waterways for <span class="date">thousands of years</span> before European contact. French Jesuit priests in the Illinois Country encountered the <span class="loc">Kaskaskia</span> and <span class="loc">Cahokia</span>, bands of the Illiniwek confederacy. The first European settlement in this area was St. Philippe, founded in <span class="date">1723</span> by Philippe Fran√ßois Renault, a French courtier, on his concession about three miles north of Fort de <span class="loc">Chartres</span> along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. This early agricultural community quickly produced a surplus, and grains were sold to the lower Louisiana colony for <span class="date">years</span>. They were integral to that community's survival, as its climate did not allow cultivation of such staple grains. After the American Revolution, <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was formed in <span class="date">1816</span> out of <span class="loc">Randolph</span> and St. <span class="loc">Clair counties</span>, as the 8th county created from the then Illinois Territory.</p><br><br>
