  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Rincon</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Effingham County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,836 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 4376 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Savannah Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="per">Rincon</span>, in the southeast area of <span class="loc">Effingham County</span>, was incorporated as a city as recently as <span class="date">1927</span>. While the earliest settlers came to the area in <span class="date">1751</span>, its existence as a full-fledged community with families and businesses dates back to the late 19th century. The origin and development of <span class="per">Rincon</span> really got its start with the coming of the railroad. Around the time of the turn of the 20th century a rail line was built from the <span class="loc">Carolinas</span> across the state line at the <span class="loc">Savannah River</span> and southward to <span class="per">Savannah</span>. The name of the city is believed to have had its origin from the Spanish or Mexican name "Rincón", after a small but prosperous town in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. (Rincón means "corner.") Once the railroad and depot were built, a telegraph operator or agent is known to have been on duty as early as about <span class="date">1895</span>. This opened up the area to communication. With the coming of the railroad and service to <span class="per">Rincon</span> and the combined availability of the "dirt" road (<span class="date">now</span> State Highway 21) between <span class="per">Savannah</span> and <span class="per">Rincon</span> and beyond, and other country roads between farms and the town and outlying other towns, <span class="per">Rincon</span> became a small hive of activity. The surrounding farmers, sawmill operators and the like, who "wagoned" their products, cotton and lumber, to <span class="per">Savannah</span>, <span class="date">now</span> could "wagon" to the <span class="per">Rincon</span> railhead for shipment. They also could receive shipments and travel as rail passengers.</p><br><br>
