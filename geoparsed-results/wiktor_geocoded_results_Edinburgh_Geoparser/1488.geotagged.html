<p><span class="loc">Claremont</span> is a western suburb of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, Western <span class="loc">Australia</span> on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Swan River</span>. Prior to European settlement, the Noongar people used the area as a source of water, for fishing and for catching waterfowl. In 1830, John Butler, a settler, set up an inn at <span class="loc">Freshwater Bay</span> (in modern-day Peppermint Grove) to attract travellers on the road from <span class="loc">Perth</span> to <span class="loc">Fremantle</span>. A wetland became known as Butler's Swamp (later <span class="loc">Lake Claremont</span>). After the arrival of convicts in the colony in 1850, work began on constructing the <span class="loc">Fremantle</span> Road. The government allocated land on the foreshore and at Butler's Swamp to 19 pensioner guards and their families, and a permanent convict depot operated at <span class="loc">Freshwater Bay</span> (until 1875). A state school (1862) and church were built, and a community grew around what is now Victoria Avenue. A settler named James Morrison, named his property at Swan Location 702, Claremont Estate, after his wife, Clara (ne√© de Burgh). During the 1870s, a number of prominent families, including the Triggs, Sandovers and Stirlings, acquired land in the district, around the later site of Christ Church Grammar School; some of their homes were later bought and used by the school.</p>
