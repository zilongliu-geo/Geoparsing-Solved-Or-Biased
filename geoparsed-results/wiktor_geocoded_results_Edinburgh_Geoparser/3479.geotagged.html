<p><span class="loc">Hudson</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hillsborough County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located along the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> state line. The population was 24,467 at the 2010 census, with an estimated population of 24,645 in 2013. It is the ninth-largest municipality (town or city) in the state, by population. The primary settlement in town, where 7,336 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Hudson</span> census-designated place (CDP) and is located at the junctions of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> routes 102, 111 and 3A, directly across the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span> from the <span class="loc">city of Nashua</span>. <span class="loc">Hudson</span> began as part of the <span class="loc">Dunstable</span> Land Grant that encompassed the current <span class="loc">city of Nashua</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, and the towns of <span class="loc">Dunstable</span> and <span class="loc">Pepperell</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, as well as parts of other nearby towns on both sides of the border. In 1732, all of <span class="loc">Dunstable</span> east of the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span> became the town of <span class="loc">Nottingham</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Nine years later, the northern boundary of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> was finally officially established, and the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> portion of <span class="loc">Nottingham</span> became <span class="loc">Nottingham</span> West, to avoid confusion with <span class="loc">Nottingham</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> to the northeast.</p>
