  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bor</span> is a town and <span class="loc">district of Niğde</span> Province in the Central <span class="loc">Anatolia region</span> of <span class="loc">Turkey</span>, 14 km (8.7 mi) north of the <span class="loc">city of Niğde</span>, on a high plain (altitude 1,100 m (3,600 ft)). The district's population is 59,919 of which 38,320 live in the town of <span class="loc">Bor</span>. The area is situated just north of the <span class="loc">Taurus Mountains</span>, not far from the <span class="loc">Cilician Gates</span> (Gülek Boğazı), the mountain pass leading to <span class="loc">Cilicia</span> and <span class="loc">Syria</span>, and has long been a place of commercial and military importance. The Hittites and Assyrians gave the area the name Tuwanuwa. In the times of <span class="org">Cyrus</span> the <span class="per">Younger</span> and <span class="per">Alexander</span> the Great it was named Dana and then by the <span class="loc">Romans</span>, <span class="loc">Tyana</span>, (Θυάνα in Ancient greek). The remains of these civilizations can be found in the village of <span class="loc">Kemerhisar</span>. <span class="loc">Bor</span> is a more modern settlement nearby. The plain has been settled since the time of the Hittites, and subsequently controlled by Assyrians, Phrygians, Persians and Ancient Macedonians. The Romans (and from <span class="date">395 AD</span> onwards <span class="loc">Byzantium</span>) built the ancient <span class="loc">city of Tyana</span> the most southern-most centre of <span class="loc">Cappadocia</span>. During the Byzantine period the town was the <span class="loc">eastern Mediterranean region</span>’s most important Christian centre, as indicated also by its former Turkish name of Kilisehisar (‘<span class="org">City of the Churches</span>’).</p><br><br>
