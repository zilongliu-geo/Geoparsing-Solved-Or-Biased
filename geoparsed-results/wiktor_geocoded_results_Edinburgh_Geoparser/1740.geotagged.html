<p>Lafayette (/ˌlæfiˈjɛt/; French: [lafajɛt]) is a city located along the <span class="loc">Vermilion River</span> in southwestern <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Lafayette</span> is the fourth-largest in the state, with a population of 120,623 at the 2010 census. The combined statistical area of <span class="loc">Lafayette–Opelousas-Morgan City</span> was 611,774 according to 2012 estimates. Lafayette is the parish seat of <span class="loc">Lafayette Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>. Its nickname is The <span class="loc">Hub City</span>. The American city was founded as <span class="loc">Vermilionville</span> in 1821 by Jean Mouton, a French-speaking man of Acadian descent. In 1884, it was renamed for General Lafayette, who fought with and significantly aided the American Army during the American Revolutionary War. The city's economy was primarily based on agriculture until the 1940s, when the petroleum and natural gas industries became dominant. Lafayette is considered the center of Acadiana, the area of Cajun and Creole culture in <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> and the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It developed following the relocation of Acadians after their expulsion by the British from eastern <span class="loc">Canada</span> in the late 18th century following <span class="loc">France</span>'s defeat in the Seven Years' War. There is also a strong <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> Creole influence in the area.</p>
