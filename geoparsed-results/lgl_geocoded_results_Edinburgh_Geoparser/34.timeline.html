  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Arlington</span> woman was 'the juice' for her family. <span class="per">Kimberly Renee Underwood</span>’s father nicknamed her "the juice" because she was the spark of the family. At 4, she ran down the aisle of an <span class="loc">Ohio</span> church saying: "I love Jesus! I love Jesus! Baptize me!" Church leaders didn’t believe in baptizing a child so young, but she was adamant, so they relented, relatives said <span class="date">last week</span>. She was the one to encourage the family to have <span class="date">a weekend</span> barbecue, to get her parents to take a trip to <span class="loc">Cancun</span>, to find the best deals on a cute handbag. "She was kind of like the one who kept things moving," said her mother, <span class="per">Mamie Underwood</span>. <span class="per">Ms. Underwood</span>, 34, of <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, died <span class="date">Tuesday</span> of an unknown cause. The <span class="loc">Tarrant County</span> medical examiner’s office is investigating the cause of death. <span class="per">Ms. Underwood</span> was an answer to her parents’ prayers for a child, her mother said. She was the second of three. "She was a prayer warrior," her mother said. "She was a fervent believer in God and his power and in praying and the power of prayer. She believed when there was a problem to pray." <span class="per">Ms. Underwood</span>, born <span class="date">Dec. 20, 1974</span>, spent <span class="date">the first 10 years</span> of her life in <span class="loc">Wintersville</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, before the family moved to <span class="loc">Arlington</span>. Her father is an engineer, and her mother is an employee of the federal General Services Administration. <span class="per">Ms. Underwood</span> was an honor student and graduated from <span class="per">O.D. Wyatt</span> High School in <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span> in <span class="date">1993</span>. She attended law school at <span class="org">Texas Southern University</span> in Houston. Her younger sister, <span class="per">Kalena Horhn</span> of <span class="loc">Grand Prairie</span>, said she remembers riding on a Big Wheel with her big sister in front. "She was full of wisdom, of hopes and of dreams," she said. <span class="per">Ms. Underwood</span>’s mother said she often went out of her way to help others. When a friend lost her job, <span class="per">Ms. Underwood</span> invited her to stay with her, rent free. "Her heart was not as big as <span class="loc">Texas</span>," her mother said. "It was bigger than <span class="loc">Texas</span>." Other survivors include a 15-month old son, <span class="per">Kingston James</span>, and her father, <span class="per">Gary Underwood</span>. Her funeral was <span class="date">Saturday</span>.</p><br><br>
