<p><span class="loc">Canoa</span> is a town in the Canton of <span class="loc">San Vicente</span> in the <span class="loc">Manabí Province</span> of <span class="loc">Ecuador</span>. <span class="loc">Canoa</span> is located north of Bahía de Caraquez, <span class="loc">Province of Manabí</span> – <span class="loc">Ecuador</span>. Local stories and tales say that the natives of <span class="loc">Canoa</span> hid deep in the hills when they saw invaders approaching, leaving the beautiful beach deserted. 100 years later, Jesuit priests arrived and along with Canoans, they celebrated the birth of yet another Spanish community. In its beginnings, <span class="loc">Canoa</span> was called Pantaguas o Pintagua. <span class="loc">Juan de Velasco</span>, a priest, was the first to include <span class="loc">Canoa</span> in a map of the old Reino de Quito (Kingdom of Quito). At the turn of the 20th century, the beach was officially recognized and became part of the Cantón Sucre (Bahía de Caraquez). <span class="loc">Canoa</span> was registered as part of the Cantón <span class="loc">San Vicente</span> at the end of the 20th century. There are two ways to cross the bay of <span class="loc">Bahia de Caraquez</span> to <span class="loc">Canoa</span>. You can take a ferry to cross the bay, or you can go across the bridge. Once you've crossed you can take a bus to the town or you can hire a bicycle carriage to take you there.</p>
