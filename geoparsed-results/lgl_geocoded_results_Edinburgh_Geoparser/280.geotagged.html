<p>Bond resigns from Groton Town Council. ” I resign with a heavy heart, as it has been an honor to serve the citizens of the Town of <span class="loc">Groton</span> for the past six years, and I have been truly humbled by the faith, trust and support I have received from our community,” Bond wrote in a resignation letter. Tradition has called for asking those who ran in the last election but lost if they are still interested in serving, officials said. Two Republicans lost, Bruce Flax and John Scott. However, Scott, a former councilor, is now a Democrat. Republican Town Committee Chairwoman Deb Peruzzotti could not be reached for comment.</p>
