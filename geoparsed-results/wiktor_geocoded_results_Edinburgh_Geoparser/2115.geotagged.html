<p><span class="loc">Waterford</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Erie County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,449 at the 2000 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Erie Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> is an independent municipality located entirely within (and completely surrounded by) <span class="loc">Waterford</span> Township and is located near the geographic center of the township. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> is located at 41°56′37″N 79°59′2″W (41.943648, -79.984012). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.1 km2), of which, 1.2 square miles (3.1 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) of it (1.63%) is water. Lake <span class="loc">Le Boeuf</span> lies immediately adjacent to the borough. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> is said to contain the only statue of <span class="loc">George Washington</span> wearing a British uniform, but in reality, he had been sent by the Governor of Virginia and is wearing the uniform of an officer in the Virginia Militia. In December 1753, at age 21, <span class="loc">Washington</span> was asked by Governor Dinwiddie to carry a British ultimatum to the French Canadians on the Ohio frontier. <span class="loc">Washington</span> delivered the message to the French Canadians at <span class="loc">Fort Le Boeuf</span> in present-day <span class="loc">Waterford</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. The message, which went unheeded because he delivered it to the wrong person, called for the French Canadians to abandon their development of the Ohio country to the south. The two colonial powers were heading toward worldwide conflict, the Seven Years' War, or the French and Indian War.</p>
