<p><span class="loc">Milford</span> is a borough located in <span class="loc">western Hunterdon County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 1,233, reflecting an increase of 38 (+3.2%) from the 1,195 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn declined by 78 (-6.1%) from the 1,273 counted in the 1990 Census. <span class="loc">Milford</span> was incorporated as a borough by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on April 15, 1911, from portions of Holland Township, based on the results of a referendum held on May 8, 1911. The borough's incorporation was confirmed on March 13, 1925. The borough is located on the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River in the western portion of <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>, known as the <span class="loc">Hunterdon</span> Plateau. The Borough dates to the mid-18th century when a grist mill was established here. After the mill was destroyed by fire in 1769, the settlement became known as <span class="loc">Burnt Mills</span>. The area was renamed as "Lowreytown" after Thomas Lowrey purchased land in the area in 1796. The community became commonly known as "Millford" or "Millsford" by the beginning of the 19th century, but by 1844 the name had lost a letter or two. It was incorporated in 1911 but the official incorporation was not registered until 1925.</p>
