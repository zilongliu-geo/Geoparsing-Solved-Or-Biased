  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Grant County</span> is a county located on the northern border of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 4,527. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Medford</span>. Originally designated as part of the Cherokee Outlet, it was named County L in Oklahoma Territory at the time of its opening to non-Indian settlement. A county election renamed it for <span class="loc">U.S.</span> President <span class="per">Ulysses S. Grant</span>. <span class="loc">Grant County</span> was part of the Cherokee Nation's Cherokee Outlet until it was opened to non-Indian settlers in response to public demand on <span class="date">September 16, 1893</span>. Settlers named the county after President <span class="per">Ulysses S. Grant</span> in a general election held <span class="date">November 6, 1894</span>. Congress originally designated this area as County L in Oklahoma Territory, with the county seat at <span class="loc">Pond Creek</span>. <span class="loc">Medford</span> became the county seat through an election held on <span class="date">May 27, 1908</span>. The <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Nebraska Railway (later the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> and Pacific Railway) built a railroad from northern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> through <span class="loc">Grant County</span> in <span class="date">1889</span> and <span class="date">1890</span>. In <span class="date">1897</span> the Gulf Railroad (later the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway, AT&amp;SF) linked <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">Wakita</span>, <span class="loc">Medford</span>, and <span class="loc">Deer Creek</span>. At the start of the 20th Century the <span class="loc">Blackwell</span>, <span class="loc">Enid</span> and Southwestern Railroad (later the St. <span class="per">Louis</span> and <span class="per">San</span> Francisco Railway) passed through Lamont. Still later, the <span class="loc">Denver</span>, <span class="loc">Enid</span> and Gulf Railroad (later the AT&amp;SF) reached Nash (Nashville).</p><br><br>
