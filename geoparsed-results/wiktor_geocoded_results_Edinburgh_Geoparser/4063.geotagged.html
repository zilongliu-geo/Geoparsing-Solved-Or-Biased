<p>Redmond is a city in <span class="loc">Deschutes County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Incorporated on July 6, 1910, the city is on the eastern side of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>'s Cascade Range, in the <span class="loc">High Desert</span> in Central <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. From Redmond there is access to recreational opportunities, including mountain biking, fishing, hiking, camping, rock climbing, white-water rafting, skiing, and golf. Redmond is a full-service municipality and one of the fastest-growing industrial and residential communities in <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. Redmond had a population of 26,215 in 2010, and the population continues to grow at a rate of about 8 percent each year. The city encompasses 15.5 square miles (40 km2) and is on a plateau, at an elevation of 3,077 feet (938 m). Redmond is 15 miles (24 km) north of <span class="loc">Bend—the county</span> seat of <span class="loc">Deschutes</span> County—144 miles (232 km) from <span class="loc">Portland</span>, 129 miles (208 km) from Salem—the capital of Oregon—and 126 miles (203 km) from Eugene. Redmond was named after Frank T. Redmond, who settled in the area in 1905. It was platted in 1906 by a company which would become part of Central <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Irrigation District building a canal. Electrification and the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trunk Railway reached Redmond in 1911. The rail link opened markets for farmers and merchants. By 1930, the town had grown to 1,000 and by 1940 had nearly doubled. In the 1940s, Redmond was a U.S. Army Air base and commercial air service was established at Roberts Field after World War II. In the 1950s, 60s, 70s, and most of the 80s, the population remained relatively static, growing slowly around a small commercial/retail center and manufacturing industry. However, during the 1990s, the population began to grow along with most of <span class="loc">Deschutes County</span>. Between 2000 and 2006, Redmond's population grew 74.3%, making it among <span class="loc">Oregon</span>'s fastest-growing cities each year. This growth continued through 2006, increasing the population to 23,500. Its growth is fueled by employment and a lower cost of living.</p>
