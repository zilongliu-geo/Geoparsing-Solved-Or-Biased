  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salamah</span> (Arabic: سلمة‎) was a Palestinian Arab village, located five kilometers east of <span class="loc">Jaffa</span>, that was depopulated in the lead up the <span class="date">1948</span> Arab-Israeli War. The town was named for <span class="loc">Salamah</span> <span class="loc">Abu Hashim</span>, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. His tomb, two village schools, and ten houses from among the over 800 houses that had made up the village, are all that remain of the structures of the former village <span class="date">today</span>. 'Salameh street', <span class="date">now</span> on the border of <span class="loc">Tel Aviv</span> and <span class="loc">Jaffa</span> is named after the historic village. In <span class="date">1596</span>, under Ottoman rule, <span class="loc">Salamah</span> was a village in the nahiya of <span class="loc">Ramla</span> (liwa of <span class="loc">Gaza</span>), with a population of 94. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat and barley, as well as on other types of property, such as goats and beehives. In the late nineteenth century, the village was described as being built of adobe brick, with a few gardens and wells. On <span class="date">4 December 1947</span> a band of 120–150 gunmen from <span class="loc">Salame</span> attacked the nearby kibbutz <span class="loc">Efal</span>. The settlers, together with Palmah reinforcements, beat them off. On <span class="date">8 December 1947</span> Arabs attacked the <span class="loc">Tel Aviv</span> neighbourhood Hatiqwa. Some of the Jewish residents were killed. Most of the attackers were Salame residents.</p><br><br>
