<p><span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> (German pronunciation: [ˈhaɪdəlbɛʁk]) is a city situated on the river <span class="loc">Neckar</span> in south-west <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The fifth-largest town in the State of Baden-Württemberg after <span class="loc">Stuttgart</span>, <span class="loc">Karlsruhe</span>, <span class="loc">Mannheim</span> and <span class="loc">Freiburg im Breisgau</span>, <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> is part of the densely populated <span class="loc">Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan</span> Region. In 2011, over 149,000 people lived in the city. A former residence of the Electorate of the Palatinate, <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> is the location of Heidelberg University, well known far beyond <span class="loc">Germany</span>'s borders. <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> is a popular tourist destination due to its romantic and picturesque cityscape, including <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> Castle and the baroque style <span class="loc">Old Town</span>. <span class="loc">Heidelberg</span> is in the <span class="loc">Rhine</span> Rift Valley, on the left bank of the lower part of the <span class="loc">Neckar</span> in a steep valley in the <span class="loc">Odenwald</span>. It is bordered by the Königsstuhl (568 m) and the <span class="loc">Gaisberg</span> (375 m) mountains. The <span class="loc">Neckar</span> here flows in an east-west direction. On the right bank of the river, the Heiligenberg mountain rises to a height of 445 meters. The <span class="loc">Neckar</span> flows into the <span class="loc">Rhine</span> approximately 22 kilometres north-west in <span class="loc">Mannheim</span>. Villages incorporated during the 20th century stretch from the <span class="loc">Neckar</span> Valley along the Bergstraße, a road running through the <span class="loc">Odenwald</span> hills.</p>
