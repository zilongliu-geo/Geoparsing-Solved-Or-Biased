<p><span class="loc">Moura</span> is a small town and locality in the Shire of Banana in Central Queensland, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It services the surrounding coal mining and rural activities. It is situated approximately 65 kilometres (40 mi) west of <span class="loc">Biloela</span> on the Dawson Highway, 186 kilometres (116 mi) west of the port <span class="loc">city of Gladstone</span>, and 171 kilometres (106 mi) south west of <span class="loc">Rockhampton</span>. At the 2011census, <span class="loc">Moura</span> had a population of 1,899 people. In 1854 Charles Marshall named his leased pastoral selection <span class="loc">Moura</span>. There are two theories regarding the origin of the name. One is that it is named after <span class="loc">Moura</span> in <span class="loc">Portugal</span> where he served in the British Army during the Peninsular Wars. The other is that it is an Aboriginal word meaning native camp dog. The <span class="loc">Moura</span> property was developed into a homestead in 1880 by Edward Homer. The town was first established in 1936 as a farming centre near the existing <span class="loc">Moura</span> Station. The Moura Post Office opened in late 1939. Moura Provisional School was opened on 10 September 1940. It became Moura State School on 1 January 1948. In 1965 a secondary department was attached to the school. By 1975, there were sufficient secondary students to warrant a formal high school and so Moura State High School was opened on 25 January 1976 with 263 pupils.</p>
