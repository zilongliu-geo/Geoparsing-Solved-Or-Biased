  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Saint-Louis, or <span class="loc">Ndar</span> as it is called in Wolof, is the capital of <span class="loc">Senegal</span>'s <span class="loc">Saint-Louis Region</span>. Located in the northwest of <span class="loc">Senegal</span>, near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Senegal</span> River, and 320 km north of <span class="loc">Senegal</span>'s capital city <span class="loc">Dakar</span>, it has a population officially estimated at 176,000 in <span class="date">2005</span>. Saint-Louis was the capital of the French colony of <span class="loc">Senegal</span> from <span class="date">1673</span> until <span class="date">1902</span> and French <span class="loc">West Africa</span> from <span class="date">1895</span> until <span class="date">1902</span>, when the capital was moved to <span class="loc">Dakar</span>. From <span class="date">1920</span> to <span class="date">1957</span> it also served as the capital of the neighboring colony of <span class="loc">Mauritania</span>. The heart of the old colonial city is located on a narrow island (just over 2 km long and about 400 m wide) in the <span class="loc">Senegal</span> River, 25 km from its mouth. At this point the river is separated from the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> to the west by a narrow sand spit, the <span class="loc">Langue de Barbarie</span> (300 m wide), which has also been urbanized (the seaside neighborhoods of <span class="loc">Ndar Tout</span> and <span class="loc">Guet</span> <span class="loc">Ndar</span>). Yet a third part of the city, <span class="loc">Sor</span>, lies on the eastern mainland and is nearly surrounded by tidal marshes. Saint-Louis is situated on the Mauritanian border, though the border crossing is at <span class="loc">Rosso</span>, 100 km upstream.</p><br><br>
