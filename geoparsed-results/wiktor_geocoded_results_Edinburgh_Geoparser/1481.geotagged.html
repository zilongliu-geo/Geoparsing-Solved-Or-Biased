<p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is an agricultural center and town in northwestern <span class="loc">Alfalfa County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 152 at the 2010 census. Originally the town of <span class="loc">Burlington</span> was named "Drumm", for prominent cattle rancher Major Andrew Drumm. Major Drumm had operated the 150,000 acre U Ranch in the area from 1874 until 1888 on land leased from the Cherokees and was a founder of the Cherokee Strip Live Stock Association. Drumm was also the founder of the Andrew <span class="loc">Drumm Institute</span> of Independence Missouri. A post office was established there as such on June 6, 1906. After plans to rename the town "Wheaton" in July of 1907 fell through, the town's name was officially changed to <span class="loc">Burlington</span> on August 21, 1907, which it remains to this day. A member-owned ag. coop called Burlington Grain Company was formed in 1916. It is now known as Burlington Cooperative Association. The elevator at <span class="loc">Burlington</span> has a capacity of 1,774,000 bushels. A second facility in nearby <span class="loc">Amorita</span> has storage space of 342,000 bushels. <span class="loc">Alfalfa County</span>’s first consolidated school was organized in <span class="loc">Burlington</span> in April of 1908. The following year, the first school building was completed. By 1913, it had 150 students and four teachers. A two story brick building was constructed in 1923. In 1948 a new gymnasium was added. In 1963 a new school was built and many additions have been added since that time – the most recent being a band room and agriculture shop addition in 2014. In the 1960's, <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">Driftwood</span>, <span class="loc">Byron</span>, and <span class="loc">Amorita</span> schools consolidated into a single school.  There were approximately 150 (pre-K-12th) students in 2014.</p>
