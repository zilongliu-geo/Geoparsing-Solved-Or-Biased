<p><span class="loc">Makary</span> is a town in Logone-et-Chari, Far North Region, <span class="loc">Cameroon</span>, <span class="loc">West Africa</span>. The town is located on the right (east) bank of a distributary of the <span class="loc">Chari River</span> in the delta just before it enters <span class="loc">Lake Chad</span>. The people are known as <span class="loc">Kotoko</span>, and the local language is Mpade, <span class="loc">Fulani</span> (Fulfulde) is the trade language. The primary economic activity was and is fishing. <span class="loc">Makary</span> was part of the indigenous Sao civilisation that occupied the land south of <span class="loc">Lake Chad</span> from about the Sixth Century A.D. going into decline by at least the Fourteenth Century. With the decline of the Sao confederation, <span class="loc">Makary</span> was an independent kingdom, one of the Kotoko kingdom city-states. In the early Fifteenth Century, <span class="loc">Makary</span> went from being an ally of King Idris Alooma to being a part of the Bornu Empire, and soon converted to <span class="loc">Islam</span>. However, by the late Eighteenth Century, although nominally still part of <span class="loc">Bornu</span>, the city states had reasserted themselves, and by 1800 <span class="loc">Makary</span> had formed a federation of seven fortified towns under the prince (MÃ©) of <span class="loc">Makary</span>.</p>
