<p><span class="loc">Cook County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 5,176, making it the fifth-least populous county in <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Grand Marais</span>. The <span class="loc">Grand Portage Indian Reservation</span> is entirely within the county. The first inhabitants of what is now <span class="loc">Cook County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> were the Ojibwe people. The first non-Native Americans to ever set foot in what is now <span class="loc">Cook County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> were French fur traders. Few of them remained permanently as year-round residents of the area and by the 1830s the French population of what is now <span class="loc">Cook County</span> numbered less than fifty. In the 1830s migrants from <span class="loc">New England</span> began moving to what is now <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. These were “Yankee” settlers, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled <span class="loc">New England</span> during the colonial era. While most of them came to <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> directly from <span class="loc">New England</span>, there were many who came from upstate <span class="loc">New York</span>. These were people whose parents had moved from <span class="loc">New England</span> to upstate <span class="loc">New York</span> in the immediate aftermath of the American Revolution. Due to the prevalence of New Englanders and <span class="loc">New England</span> transplants from upstate <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> was very culturally contiguous with early <span class="loc">New England</span> culture for much of its early history.</p>
