  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Mr Justice Saunders</span> <span class="date">today</span> imprisoned a man for <span class="date">eight years</span> at the Old Bailey in <span class="loc">London</span> after an FBI sting in which he tried to buy ricin on the Dark Web. <span class="per">Mohammed Ali</span>, 31, from <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>, was convicted at trial of attempting to possess a chemical weapon. He told the jury he was "curious" about the Dark Web, which is a largely hidden and difficult to police section of the Internet. <span class="per">Ali</span> said he didn't realise he had done anything illegal. <span class="per">Ali</span> was prosecuted under the Chemical Weapons Act <span class="date">1996</span> after sending an undercover agent a message reading "Hi, would you be able to make me some ricin and send it to the <span class="loc">UK</span>?" He bought 500mg, which has the potential to kill about 1,400, but was sent a dummy package. Counter-terror police in the <span class="loc">UK</span> liaised with the FBI. The powder, which <span class="per">Ali</span> paid for in BitCoin, was actually harmless. Hidden inside a toy car, the package was treated with markers and his face glowed under ultraviolet light, indicating he had handled it. The judge said <span class="date">today</span> there was "real risk" involved. <span class="per">Ali</span> told his trial he had discovered drugs and guns for sale. Computer analysis showed he had looked up ricin and other poisons; he said he went for ricin simply because it had appeared in Breaking Bad. He also searched for small animals after being advised to test it on a rodent; a to-do list on his computer included "paid ricin guy" and "get pet to murder".</p><br><br>
