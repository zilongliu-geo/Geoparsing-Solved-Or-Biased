<p>Victoria is a city in <span class="loc">Ellis County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 1,214. A group of English and Scottish colonists led by a <span class="loc">Scotsman</span> named George Grant founded Victoria in 1873 on land he had purchased from the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Pacific Railway. They named the settlement after Queen Victoria. Grant intended for Victoria to be a ranching community and was purportedly responsible for bringing the first Aberdeen Angus cattle to the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Most of the colonists, however, were remittance men more interested in sports and dancing than in raising livestock. Their families soon learned of this and reduced the remittances, driving most of the colonists to leave by 1880. Some returned to <span class="loc">Britain</span>; others left for <span class="loc">South America</span>. In 1876, Volga Germans from villages near <span class="loc">Saratov</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span> established the settlement of Herzog one half mile north of Victoria. Herzog's Roman Catholic settlers built a series of churches which culminated in the construction of St. Fidelis Catholic Church, known as "The Cathedral of the Plains," in 1911. <span class="loc">Herzog</span> grew rapidly and later absorbed Victoria, eventually adopting the older settlement's name. <span class="loc">Herzog</span> was officially renamed Victoria in 1913.</p>
