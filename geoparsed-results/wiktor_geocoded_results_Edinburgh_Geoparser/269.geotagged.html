<p><span class="loc">San Martin</span> (/ˈsən mɑːrˈtiːn/) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa <span class="loc">Clara County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It takes its name from <span class="loc">St. Martin</span> of Tours, the patron saint of early pioneer Martin Murphy, who built the first Catholic church in the area. The community has been considering incorporating into either a city or town since 2004, but no official action had been taken by the end of 2010. The population was 7,027 at the 2010 census. Like neighboring Morgan Hill and <span class="loc">Gilroy</span>, <span class="loc">San Martin</span> is a large producer of garlic, table mushrooms, and wine. It is also home to the volunteer-run Wings of History aviation museum, located next to <span class="loc">South County</span> Airport. <span class="loc">San Martin</span> is located at 37°05′16″N 121°36′00″W (37.087746, -121.600020). It is approximately 48 km (30 mi) <span class="loc">south of San Jose</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, 11 km (6.8 mi) <span class="loc">north of Gilroy</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, and 24 km (15 mi) inland from the Pacific Coast. Lying in a roughly 6 km-wide (4-mi-wide) southern extension of the <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> Valley, it is bounded by the <span class="loc">Santa Cruz Mountains</span> to the west and the Diablo Range to the east.</p>
