  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Mission, the core of which was formerly a separate municipality known as <span class="loc">Mission City</span>, is a district municipality in the Lower Mainland region of the <span class="loc">province of British Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is situated on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Fraser River</span> where it backs onto mountains and lakes overlooking the Central <span class="loc">Fraser</span> Valley eighty kilometres east-southeast of <span class="loc">Vancouver</span>. Mission is the 23rd largest municipality in British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, with a population of 36,426 (<span class="date">2011</span>). Unlike the other <span class="loc">Fraser</span> Valley municipalities, Mission is mostly forested upland with only small floodplains lining the shore of the <span class="loc">Fraser River</span>. Some benches of farmland rise in succession northwards above the core developed area of the city. Mission was once the heart of the berry industry in the <span class="loc">Fraser</span> Valley, with "<span class="org">Home of the Big Red Strawberry</span>" as Mission's slogan in <span class="date">the 1930s</span> and into <span class="date">the 1940s</span>. The more southerly portion of the municipality is bounded on the west by the lower reaches of the Stave River, which consists mostly of the lakewaters of two hydroelectric reservoirs, <span class="loc">Stave Lake</span> and <span class="loc">Hayward Lake</span>. Although the vast majority of the population of Mission lives well to the east of the Stave, over 50% of the northern land area of the municipality is west and north of that river; its extreme northwest corner is on the far side of upper <span class="loc">Alouette</span> Lake. A small portion of the lower Stave still runs free in its last two miles before its confluence with the <span class="loc">Fraser</span> at <span class="loc">Ruskin</span>; its last three-quarters of a mile forms the border with the larger municipality of Maple Ridge to the west.</p><br><br>
