  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Farmington</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the town population was 7,760. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> is home to the <span class="org">University of Maine at Farmington</span>, the <span class="org">Nordica Memorial Auditorium</span>, the Homestead, and the annual Farmington Fair. The area was once territory of the Canibas tribe of Abenaki Indians. They had two camps located near <span class="loc">Farmington Falls</span>, with fields cleared for cultivation of maize and potatoes. Their fort's stockade enclosed about an acre at the center of what is <span class="date">today</span> <span class="loc">Farmington Falls</span> village. A group from <span class="loc">Topsham</span> arrived in <span class="date">1776</span> to explore the area and lay out a town, called Plantation No. 1 or Sandy River Plantation, but permanent settlement was delayed by the Revolutionary War. In <span class="date">1781</span>, the first settlers arrived, the same year a sawmill was established. On <span class="date">February 1, 1794</span>, Sandy River Plantation was incorporated as <span class="loc">Farmington</span>, named for its unusually fertile soil. Beginning with a cluster of log houses at <span class="loc">Farmington Falls</span>, the town grew quickly and prospered. Agriculture was an important early occupation, with hay a principal product. Orchards yielded apples and other fruit. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> became one of the largest wool producing towns in <span class="loc">New England</span>, with many herds of sheep grazing the hills and intervales.</p><br><br>
