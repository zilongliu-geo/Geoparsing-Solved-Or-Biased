  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Esperanza is a first class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Agusan del Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 51,897 people. It renowned as the "<span class="org">Tilapia Capital</span> of the Province" and has an official moniker of "<span class="org">The Home of Cultural Diversity</span>". Esperanza is politically subdivided into 47 barangays. In <span class="date">July 1917</span>, a flood and storm swept through <span class="loc">Agusan del Sur</span> in Barangay Cubo of Esperanza. After the storm, a Manobo woman named Bilay Ocampo was on the banks of the muddy <span class="loc">Wawa River</span> where she eventually found a figure where it washed up from the river. The 21-karat gold figure dating to around 850 to 950 C.E. weighs 4 lbs and depicts a woman sitting in the lotus position in Buddhism, is ornamented with jewelry on her body, and wears a headdress. This figure turned out to be a representation of the <span class="per">Bodhisattva Tara</span>. <span class="date">Now</span> known as the "<span class="per">Golden Tara</span>", after its discovery, it was handed to the former Deputy Governor Bias Baclagon then it was passed to the <span class="org">Agusan Coconut Company</span>, because of a debt. It was then being sold and was purchased for 4,000 pesos by the wife of American Governor-General <span class="per">Leonard Wood</span>, Faye Cooper-Cole, who was the curator of <span class="loc">Chicago</span> <span class="org">Field Museum</span>â€™s Southeast Asian department. They then donated the <span class="per">Golden Tara</span> to the <span class="org">Field Museum</span> in <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span> where it is currently held in the <span class="loc">Grainger</span> Hall of Gems. <span class="per">Dr. H. Otley Beyer</span>, known as the father of Philippine <span class="per">Archaeology</span> and <span class="per">Anthropology</span>, tried to encourage the government to buy the artifact however all attempts failed due to lack of funds.</p><br><br>
