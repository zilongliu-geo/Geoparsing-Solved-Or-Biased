<p><span class="loc">Arlington</span> is a former town in <span class="loc">western Phelps County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along a county road that was once <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66. The town found its prosperity in the mid-19th century. Located near <span class="loc">Rolla</span> on the <span class="loc">Ozark</span> Plateau, the only remaining business at <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was a caravan park that closed permanently in 2008. <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was originally called Little Piney. It was manned at times by troops form the 5th <span class="loc">Missouri</span> State Militia Cavalry. Originally settled by Thomas Harrison and James Harrison and later established as a township by General Fremont circa-1867, the town was renamed for the former Robert E. Lee plantation (later a cemetery) at <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was once a popular resort served by the Pacific Railroad. Located on the last section of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66 in <span class="loc">Missouri</span> to be paved in 1931, the tiny community served fishermen on the <span class="loc">Gasconade</span> and Little Piney Rivers. Stony Dell Resort capitalised on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66 and the nearby Fort Leonard Wood military base to grow in the 1930s and early 1940s from a small group of tourist cabins to a popular oasis which included a stream-fed swimming pool, a restaurant, service station and bus stop, offering tennis, dancing, boating and fishing.</p>
