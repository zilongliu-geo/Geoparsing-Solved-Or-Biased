<p>Officials in <span class="loc">Mexico</span> are asking citizens to take actions in order to minimize the spread of the swine flu outbreak. Citizens are urged to stay away from large crowds, avoid kissing people and stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from one another. Additionally, all schools and universities in <span class="loc">Mexico City</span> have been closed indefinitely. In addition, at least twenty people in the <span class="loc">United States</span> have been infected with the disease, causing the government to issue a "national public health emergency." On Monday, Mexican officials reported that at least 100 deaths in their country were "likely linked" to the swine flu. Dr. Jose A. Cordova Villalobos, the health secretary of <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, said that at least 20 of the deaths have been confirmed as swine flu related deaths while the World Health Organization (WHO) says that 71 people have died from complications caused by the disease. Meanwhile, over 1,300 people in <span class="loc">Mexico</span> have been hospitalized because of flu-like symptoms since April 13. In <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, 26 students and teachers might have been infected by the flu during their trip to <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. Dr. Julia Peters, the clinical director of Auckland Regional Public Health Service, said that at least 22 have shown flu-like symptoms. All of the students and teachers are being quarantined pending test results.</p>
