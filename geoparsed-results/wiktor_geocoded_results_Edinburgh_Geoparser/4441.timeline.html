  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cornwall</span> is a city in <span class="loc">eastern Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, and the seat of the United Counties of <span class="loc">Stormont</span>, <span class="loc">Dundas</span> and Glengarry. <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> is Ontario's easternmost city, located on the <span class="loc">Saint Lawrence River</span>, in the <span class="loc">Quebec</span> Cityâ€“Windsor Corridor along Ontario Highway 401, and is the urban centre for surrounding communities, including <span class="loc">Long Sault</span> and <span class="loc">Ingleside</span> to the west, Mohawk Territory of Akwesasne to the south, St. Andrew's and <span class="loc">Avonmore</span> to the north, and <span class="per">Glen Walter</span>, <span class="loc">Martintown</span>, <span class="loc">Williamstown</span>, and <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> to the east. <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> lies on the 45th parallel, approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of <span class="loc">Ottawa</span>, the national capital, 120 kilometres (75 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>, <span class="loc">Quebec</span>'s largest city, and 440 kilometres (270 mi) northeast of <span class="loc">Toronto</span>, the provincial capital and <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s largest city.
