<p>Baldwin is a town in <span class="loc">Duval County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. When the majority of communities in <span class="loc">Duval County</span> consolidated with the <span class="loc">city of Jacksonville</span> in 1968, Baldwin, along with <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span> Beach, Atlantic Beach, and <span class="loc">Neptune Beach</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, remained quasi-independent. Like the other towns, it maintains its own municipal government, but its residents vote in the <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span> mayoral election and vote for the <span class="loc">Jacksonville City</span> Council; unlike the others, Baldwin no longer supports its own police force. The population was 1,425 at the 2010 census. The town was first settled under the name of Thigpen in 1846. Mr. Thigpen had opened a tavern to benefit the stagecoach line at the crossroads of what is today Baldwin. He supplied horses for the stage and shelter and food for the passengers. The first railroad was built in Thigpen in 1857 with a second crossing it in 1859. The name was changed to <span class="loc">Baldwin</span> in honor of Dr. Abel Seymour Baldwin, the president of the <span class="loc">Florida</span>, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad, a railroad that ran from <span class="loc">Lake City</span> to <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span>. Further development in Baldwin led to the establishment of a telegraphic line running from <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span> to <span class="loc">Baldwin</span>.</p>
