  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Anta</span> is a small village in <span class="loc">Anta District</span>, <span class="loc">Carhuaz Province</span>, <span class="loc">Ancash Region</span>, <span class="loc">Peru</span>. It is the district's capital, and lies 9.1 km to the north of the village of <span class="loc">Quillo</span>. <span class="loc">Anta</span> in <span class="loc">Carhuaz</span> should not be confused with the bigger village of <span class="loc">Anta</span>, <span class="loc">Cusco Region</span>, nor with lots of other small villages with the same name in the regions of <span class="loc">Ancash</span>, <span class="loc">Arequipa</span>, <span class="loc">Ayacucho</span>, <span class="loc">Huancavelica</span> and <span class="loc">Puno</span>. The airport was actually created by the <span class="org">U.S Air Force</span> in <span class="date">June, 1070</span>. After the <span class="date">May 31, 1970</span> earthquake, the 39th Tactical Airlift Squadron on rotational duty at Howard AFB, Canal Zone sent C-130's to <span class="loc">Lima</span> to support the relief efforts. Upon arriving at <span class="loc">Lima</span> <span class="per">Colonel Beckett</span> (the squadron commander), Ssgt <span class="per">Richard Eubanks</span> and <span class="per">Sgt Leonard Holmes</span> (both Combat Controllers), <span class="per">Mrs. Consuelo</span> de <span class="loc">Velasco</span> (<span class="loc">Peru</span>'s first lady) and <span class="loc">US</span> Ambasssador Taylor Belcher flew over the disaster area to survey the damage and determine the best method to reach the area. The decision was made that the dirt road going through <span class="loc">Anta</span> would be the best bet for possible landings so Ssgt <span class="per">Eubanks</span> and <span class="per">Sgt</span> <span class="per">Holmes</span> deployed to <span class="loc">Anta</span> and began work to convert that dirt road into a runway that would eventually become the <span class="loc">Anta</span> Airport.</p><br><br>
