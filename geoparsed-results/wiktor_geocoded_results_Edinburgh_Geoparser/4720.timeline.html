  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Ashley is a village and former civil parish in the <span class="loc">Borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme</span> of <span class="loc">Staffordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. According to the <span class="date">2001</span> census it had a population of 508. The village is close to the border of <span class="loc">Shropshire</span>, adjacent to Loggerheads, and is 4 miles (6 km) North East of <span class="loc">Market Drayton</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census the population had been incorporated in Loggerheads. The name means "land once cultivated and left fallow(Ley) in the near ash trees" <span class="loc">Ashley Dale</span> and <span class="loc">Jugbank</span>. Mainly sandstone cottages <span class="date">now</span> mixed in with modern housing. From medieval times men have indiscriminately hacked clearings in the forests, then linked them with tracks and lanes following no specific pattern. The church of <span class="loc">St John</span> the <span class="loc">Baptist</span> possesses a 17th-century tower with the remainder built in 1860-62 by <span class="per">J. Ashdown</span> of <span class="loc">London</span> in a style representative of the 13th-14th century. The church is notable for its collection of funerary art from <span class="date">several centuries</span>. The spectacular tomb of <span class="per">Sir Gilbert Gerard</span> (d. <span class="date">1592</span>) and his wife <span class="per">Anne Radcliffe</span> (d. <span class="date">1608</span>) was later supplemented by free-standing, kneeling figures of their son, <span class="per">Thomas Gerard, 1st Baron Gerard</span> and his son, <span class="per">Gibert</span> 2nd <span class="per">Baron Gerard</span>. This composite family group dominates the <span class="loc">Gerard</span> Chapel, on the north side of the church. This is balanced on the south side by the <span class="loc">Kinnersley</span> Chapel, containing the memorials of the Kinnersleys of <span class="loc">Clough Hall</span>. Most impressive is the sculpture of <span class="per">Thomas Kinnersley</span> I, by <span class="per">Francis Leggatt</span> <span class="loc">Chantrey</span>. His son and successor is commemorated by a large and elaborate structure, the work of <span class="per">Matthew Noble</span>. Near to the church is a mound as yet unexcavated but thought to be a burial ground from the time of the Black Death.</p><br><br>
