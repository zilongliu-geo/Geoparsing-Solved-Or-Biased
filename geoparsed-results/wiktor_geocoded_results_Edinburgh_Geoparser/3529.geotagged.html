<p><span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> is a town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span> at the southern end of the <span class="loc">Grampians</span> National Park, in the Shire of Southern <span class="loc">Grampians</span>. It is approx 283 km west of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> on the Glenelg Highway. The town's population is holding steady but ageing. At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> had a population of 461. The Chapwurrung people lived in this region to the south and east of the <span class="loc">Grampians</span> for over 4,000 years prior to the arrival of the Europeans. The first pastoralists took up properties here in the late 1830s, and there was a decade of sometimes violent clashes with the Chapwurring. A small European township developed which was initially known as <span class="loc">Mount Sturgeon</span>, the hill behind the town. A Post Office of that name opened on 1 July 1852 (Dunkeld from 1 January 1854); but, as the early settlers were predominantly Scottish, it was renamed <span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> after a Scottish town which was the principal locality of the Caledonian picts in Roman times. At a strategic point south of the <span class="loc">Grampians</span> for road traffic and surrounded by fine wool producing country, <span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> thrived in the mid-19th century. The Robertson's Woolpack Inn was the first building to be erected in 1845, followed by five other hotels - the Shamrock and the Western, the Royal Mail, the Collins Railway Hotel and the Family Inn. Road traffic declined with the opening of the railway (1877 to <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> and <span class="loc">Ararat</span>, with another short lived line going south to <span class="loc">Penshurst</span>). Louis Buvelot, Eugene von Guerard and Nicholas Chevalier all made paintings of the district, where <span class="loc">Mount Abrupt</span> and <span class="loc">Mount Sturgeon</span> provide an appealing backdrop.</p>
