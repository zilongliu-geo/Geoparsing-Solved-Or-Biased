  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Indonesian Health</span> officials are concerned that a 9-year-old girl who died of the H5N1 Avian Flu virus, contracted the illness as a result of human to human transmission and officials say a team of experts are on the way to the area to determine if a cluster exists. "The tests were positive. She died of bird flu. A team left this morning to check if there is a cluster or not," said Bird Flu Information Center scientist, Nurdin. Ai Siti Amanah who lived in <span class="loc">Garut</span>, located in <span class="loc">West Java</span> died on <span class="date">August 15</span> before health officials were able to determine that she had the deadly virus and only <span class="date">one day</span> after arriving for treatment at the hospital. It is believed that the girl had contact with a 17-year-old male named Umar <span class="per">Aup</span> from the same town who is infected with the virus, but health officials say he is recovering at a local hospital. He was diagnosed with the illness on <span class="date">August 12</span>. Another boy named Misbah, 20, cousin of <span class="per">Aup</span> died <span class="date">earlier in August</span> and was not tested for the disease but officials say he was exhibiting signs of the illness. <span class="loc">Supari</span>, <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>'s health minister, stated that tests will be done on the two subjects to determine the origin and the "exact type of the virus." <span class="date">Three months ago</span>, seven family members died when they contracted the virus through human to human transmission. So far, 46 people have died from the virus in <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>.</p><br><br>
