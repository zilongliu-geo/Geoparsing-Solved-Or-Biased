<p><span class="loc">Pamplona</span> (Spanish: [pamˈplona]; French: Pampelune; English: Pampeluna) or Iruña (Basque: [iɾuɲa], alternative spelling: Iruñea, IPA: [iɾuɲea]) is the historical capital <span class="loc">city of Navarre</span>, in <span class="loc">Spain</span>, and of the former Kingdom of <span class="loc">Navarre</span>. The city is famous worldwide for the running of the bulls during the San Fermín festival, which is held annually from July 6 to 14. This festival was brought to literary renown with the 1926 publication of Ernest Hemingway's novel The Sun Also Rises. After the 2015 municipal elections, there are 27 seats in Pamplona's municipal council: ten of Navarrese People's Union (Unión del Pueblo Navarro), five of EH Bildu, five of Geroa Bai, three of the Socialist Party of <span class="loc">Navarre</span>, three of Aranzadi (supported by Podemos), and one of Izquierda-Ezkerra. <span class="loc">Pamplona</span> is located in the middle of <span class="loc">Navarre</span> in a rounded valley, known as the Basin of <span class="loc">Pamplona</span>, that links the mountainous North with the Ebro valley. It is 92 km (57 mi) from the <span class="loc">city of San Sebastián</span>, 117 km (73 mi) from <span class="loc">Bilbao</span>, 735 km (457 mi) from <span class="loc">Paris</span> and 407 km (253 mi) from <span class="loc">Madrid</span>. The climate and landscape of the basin is a transition between those two main Navarrese geographical regions. Its central position at crossroads has served as a commercial link between those very different natural parts of <span class="loc">Navarre</span>.</p>
