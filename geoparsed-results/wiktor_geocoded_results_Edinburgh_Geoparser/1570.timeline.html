  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Taylor</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Williamson County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,575 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census; it was 15,191 in the <span class="date">2010</span> census estimate. In <span class="date">1876</span> the <span class="loc">Texas</span> Land Company auctioned lots in anticipation of the arrival of the International-Great Northern Railroad when <span class="per">Taylor</span> was founded <span class="date">that year</span>. The city was named after <span class="per">Edward Moses Taylor</span>, a railroad official, under the name <span class="loc">Taylorsville</span> which officially became <span class="per">Taylor</span> in <span class="date">1892</span>. Immigrants from <span class="loc">Moravia</span> and <span class="loc">Bohemia</span> (<span class="date">now</span> the <span class="loc">Czech Republic</span>) and other Slavic states, as well as from <span class="loc">Germany</span> and <span class="loc">Austria</span>, helped establish the town. It soon became a busy shipping point for cattle, grain, and cotton. By <span class="date">1878</span> the town had 1,000 residents and thirty-two businesses, twenty-nine of which were destroyed by fire in <span class="date">1879</span>. Recovery was rapid, however, and more substantial buildings were constructed. In <span class="date">1882</span> the <span class="per">Taylor</span>, <span class="per">Bastrop</span> and <span class="per">Houston</span> Railway reached the community, and machine shops and a roundhouse serviced both rail lines. In <span class="date">1882</span> the town was incorporated with a mayor-council form of city government, and in <span class="date">1883</span> a public school system replaced a number of private schools.</p><br><br>
