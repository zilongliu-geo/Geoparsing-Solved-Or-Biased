<p><span class="loc">Zaragoza</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [saɾaˈɣosa]) is a municipality in the Chimaltenango department of <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>. The early name of the valley where <span class="loc">Zaragoza</span> is located was Chicaj, which evolved into Chicoj or Chixoc, which in kakchiquel means "Francisco Oj", who was the kakchikel chief who owner the land in 1711. It was also known as the "Peach Valley". In 1761 several Spanish families wanted to move to that place and commissioned several members to get government approval; once the permission was granted, the villa was called "Valle de Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Heredia" (English:"Our Lady of the Pond of <span class="loc">Heredia</span> Valley)". One of the earliest references to the town during the Spanish Colony can be found in Compendio de la Historia de la <span class="loc">Ciudad de Guatemala</span> (English:Brief account of <span class="loc">Guatemala City</span> history) who in 1818 wrote Domingo Juarros. He pointed out that the Spanish villa belong to Patzicía's "curato" in the mayor municipality of <span class="loc">Chimaltenango</span>. After the independence of Central <span class="loc">America</span> in 1821, the Constitution of the State of <span class="loc">Guatemala</span> from 11 October 1825, specified the town in the territory, and the villa appeared in Circuit #8 (Sacatepéquez), within <span class="loc">Chimaltenango</span> and then, by the Constitutional Assembly of 1839, the town was assigned to Chimaltenango Department. Finally, by an executive action of 27 January 1892, the town was elevated to municipality, and its name was changed to "<span class="loc">Zaragoza</span>" because most of the Spanish people who lived there was from <span class="loc">Zaragoza</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>.</p>
