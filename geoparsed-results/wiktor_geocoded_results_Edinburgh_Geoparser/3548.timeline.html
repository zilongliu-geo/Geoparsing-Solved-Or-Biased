  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alameda (/ælᵻˈmiːdə/ or /ælᵻˈmeɪdə/; Spanish: [ala'meða]) is a city in <span class="loc">Alameda County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located on <span class="loc">Alameda Island</span> and <span class="loc">Bay Farm Island</span>, and is adjacent to and south of <span class="loc">Oakland</span> and in eastern <span class="loc">San Francisco Bay</span> across from <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>, on the <span class="loc">San Francisco Bay</span> Area. <span class="loc">Bay Farm Island</span>, a portion of which is also known as "Harbor Bay Isle", is not actually an island, and is part of the mainland adjacent to the <span class="org">Oakland International Airport</span>. The city's estimated <span class="date">2014</span> population was 75,988. Alameda is a charter city, rather than a general law city, allowing the city to provide for any form of government. Alameda became a charter city and adopted a council–manager government in <span class="date">1916</span>, which it retains to the present. The island Alameda occupies what was originally a peninsula connected to <span class="loc">Oakland</span>. Much of it was low-lying and marshy, but on higher ground the peninsula and adjacent parts of what is <span class="date">now</span> downtown <span class="loc">Oakland</span> were home to one of the largest coastal oak forests in the world. The area was therefore called <span class="loc">Encinal</span>, Spanish for "forest of evergreen oak". Alameda is Spanish for "grove of poplar trees" or "tree-lined avenue", and was chosen in <span class="date">1853</span> by popular vote.</p><br><br>
