  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Harrow is a town in the <span class="loc">Wimmera region</span> of western Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The town is located in <span class="org">the Shire of West</span> Wimmera local government area, 391 kilometres north west of the state capital <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, overlooking the <span class="loc">Glenelg River</span> valley. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, Harrow and the surrounding area had a population of 315. The first European explorer of the area was <span class="per">Thomas Mitchell</span> and a monument marks the spot where he crossed the <span class="loc">Glenelg River</span>. A town originally known as Upper Glenelg was established in the 1840s and is claimed to be the oldest inland town in Victoria. The Post Office opened on <span class="date">1 March 1849</span> as Upper Glenelg (Harrow from <span class="date">1854</span>). At its peak, the town included a range of shops and services including two hotels.

To enhance the cricket connection, the <span class="org">Centre</span> <span class="date">now</span> houses <span class="loc">Australia</span>'s largest Sir <span class="per">Donald Bradman</span> exhibition.</p><br><br>
