<p>Hanover is a town in the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Ontario</span> with a population of about 7,500 residents. It is located in southern <span class="loc">Grey County</span>, west of <span class="loc">Durham</span> and east of <span class="loc">Walkerton</span> on Grey/Bruce Road 4. Hanover is between <span class="loc">Grey County</span> and <span class="loc">Bruce County</span> and therefore is ideally located to provide a center of commerce and services for the 12,500 residents of the adjacent villages of The Municipality of West Grey. Hanover has its own City Hall, Police Department and award winning Hanover and District Hospital. It was over 160 years ago, in the year 1849, that our first pioneer, Abraham Buck, stood on the banks of the <span class="loc">Saugeen River</span> and looked about him to behold the thick forest – good hardwood timber - the realm of the deer, the bear and the wolf. The sky was filled with wild pigeons and the streams teamed with fish. It was at this moment that he expressed the famous words written above. Mr. Buck decided to stay and others were quick to follow. Christian Hassenjager, the first of many German settlers, who was to suggest the name of Hanover; Abram Z. Gottwals, a missionary with the Evangelical Church; Duncan Campbell, who became postmaster; Edward Goodeve, who had one of the first stores; entrepreneurs such as Henry Proctor Adams who built the dam and the first mill and drew up plans for a new proposed village – a man of vision who could foresee the growth of the future; Dr. Landerkin, our first doctor, who let his horse decide which turns to take and ended up in Hanover… and finally, Daniel Knechtel, an eager, hard-working man who arrived in 1864 with a bag of tools on his back and began making furniture in a small barn behind his house. His vision and determination, also, was to guide Hanover for more than a century. Our community grew and prospered because of the struggles of these first pioneers.</p>
