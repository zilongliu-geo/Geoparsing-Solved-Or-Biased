<p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 51,599. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Malone</span>. The county is named in honor of American Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Malone</span>, <span class="loc">NY</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. Much of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is within the <span class="loc">Adirondack</span> Park. Its Canadian borders are the <span class="loc">provinces of Quebec and Ontario</span>. <span class="loc">When counties</span> were established in <span class="loc">New York</span> in 1683, the present <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> was part of <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of <span class="loc">New York</span> State as well as all of the present State of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> and, in theory, extending westward to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of <span class="loc">Gloucester County</span>, both containing territory now in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. On March 12, 1772, what was left of <span class="loc">Albany County</span> was split into three parts, one remaining under the name <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. One of the other pieces, <span class="loc">Charlotte County</span>, contained the eastern portion.</p>
