  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Thornton</span> is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Sefton</span>, in <span class="loc">Merseyside</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Situated to the north east of <span class="loc">Crosby</span>, it is a residential area of semi-detached and detached housing which dates mainly from <span class="date">the 1930s</span>. Many of the houses, particularly those around Edge Lane and <span class="loc">Water Street</span>, feature notably long gardens. The A565 Liverpool-Southport road serves the area. At the <span class="date">2001</span> Census the population of the village and civil parish was recorded as 2,262, falling to 2,139 at the Census <span class="date">2011</span>. Historically part of <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>. During the compilation of the Domesday Book in <span class="date">1086</span>, the settlement of Torent√∫n is recorded, along with the settlement of <span class="loc">Homer Green</span>, which far outdates any claim that <span class="loc">Ince Blundell</span> is the oldest village in <span class="loc">Sefton</span>. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> was combined with <span class="loc">Crosby Village</span> and <span class="loc">Blundellsands</span> to form the <span class="loc">Great Crosby</span> urban district. The district subsequently became part the municipal <span class="loc">borough of Crosby</span> in <span class="date">1937</span>. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> was still served by <span class="loc">West Lancashire</span> Council until the formation of the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Sefton</span> on <span class="date">1 April 1974</span>. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> still however retains Parish Council status and therefore has a historical boundary.</p><br><br>
