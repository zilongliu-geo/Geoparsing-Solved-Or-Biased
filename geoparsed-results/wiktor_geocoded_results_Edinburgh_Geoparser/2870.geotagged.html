<p>Burbank is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span> in <span class="loc">Southern California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, 12 miles (19 km) northwest of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. The population at the 2010 census was 103,340. Billed as the "Media Capital of the World" and only a few miles northeast of <span class="loc">Hollywood</span>, numerous media and entertainment companies are headquartered or have significant production facilities in Burbank, including The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros. Entertainment, ABC Studios, ABC Family, Marvel Studios, Nickelodeon, NBC, and Insomniac Games. The city is also home to Bob Hope Airport. Burbank also holds a special place in aerospace history since Lockheed's Skunk Works in Burbank produced some of the most secret and technologically advanced airplanes, including the U-2 spy planes that uncovered the Soviet Union missile components in <span class="loc">Cuba</span>. Burbank consists of two distinct areas: a downtown, in the foothills of the <span class="loc">Verdugo Mountains</span>, and flatlands, at the east end of the <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> Valley. At one time, it was referred to as "Beautiful Downtown Burbank" on Laugh-In and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. The city was named after David Burbank, a New Hampshire-born dentist and entrepreneur.</p>
