<p>Compton is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">River Pang</span> valley in the <span class="loc">Berkshire Downs</span> about 6 miles (9.7 km) south of <span class="loc">Didcot</span> which is buffered from neighbouring settlements by cultivated fields to all sides. The village is in a gently-sloped dry valley and the fledgling Pang seasonally enters from the north west and discharges in the south east and may be joined at the centre of the village by the <span class="loc">Roden</span> from the North, when winter bournes rise to fill their channels. Elevations vary from 95 to 155m AOD. In 1882 the <span class="loc">Didcot</span>, <span class="loc">Newbury</span> and <span class="loc">Southampton Railway</span> was completed through the parish and Compton railway station was opened. British Railways withdrew passenger services from the line and closed Compton station in 1962. BR had closed Compton goods yard by 1966. Through freight traffic was withdrawn in 1967 and the line was closed and dismantled. From 18 February 2013, Compton is served by Newbury and District bus services 6 and 6A from Newbury. The academically successful The Downs School local authority secondary school is in Compton. In the 21st century its Science building was built, named The <span class="loc">Hubble</span> after American astro-physicist Edwin Hubble. The Primary School, Compton Church of England Primary School is located on School Road. The School emblem is a stag.</p>
