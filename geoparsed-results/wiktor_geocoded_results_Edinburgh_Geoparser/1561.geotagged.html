<p>Henderson is a home rule-class city along the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> in <span class="loc">Henderson County</span> in western <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 28,757 at the 2010 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Evansville Metropolitan</span> Area, locally known as the "Kentuckiana" or the "Tri-State Area". Notable residents have included the ornithologist, naturalist, and painter John James Audubon and blues legend W.C. Handy. For more than 100 years the city has been home to the Southern <span class="loc">Cherokee Nation</span>. The city was named after Col. Richard Henderson, an eighteenth-century pioneer and land speculator, by his associates Gen. Samuel Hopkins and Thomas Allin. The county, of which Henderson is the seat, also shares this namesake. Henderson has its roots in a small, block-wide strip of land high above the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>, the site of the present <span class="loc">Audubon</span> <span class="loc">Mill Park</span> directly south of the city's riverfront boat dock. A village on this site was called <span class="loc">Red Banks</span> by the local <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> on account of its reddish clay soil. By the early 1790s, <span class="loc">Red Banks</span> had a tavern and several European-American families along with the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>. On Nov. 16, 1792, resident Robert Simpson wrote to Col. Alexander D. Orr in <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, requesting help to appoint a magistrate for <span class="loc">Red Banks</span> to deal with some of its 30 families he felt were of dubious (criminal) character. During this period, the <span class="loc">Red Banks</span> settlement had gained notoriety as a frontier haven for westward moving, outlaws and their families. One such family was that of Squire Samuel Mason. By that time, excluding the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>, the free male inhabitants of <span class="loc">Red Bank</span> totaled 62.</p>
