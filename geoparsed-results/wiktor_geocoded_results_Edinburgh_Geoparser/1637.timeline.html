  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Miguel County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Once two separate municipalities (one a city and the other a town) both named <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>, west <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> ("<span class="loc">Old Town</span>") and east <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> ("New Town"), separated by the <span class="loc">Gallinas River</span>, retain distinct characters and separate, rival school districts.
