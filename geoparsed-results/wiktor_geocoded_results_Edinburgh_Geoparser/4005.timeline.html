  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kalbar</span> is a small town and locality in the Scenic Rim, <span class="loc">South East Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located near the Cunningham Highway and directly north of <span class="loc">Mount French</span> in the <span class="loc">Fassifern</span> Valley. The town is part of the Scenic Rim Region local government area. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Kalbar</span> had a population of 723. Settlement began at the location in <span class="date">1876</span> and by <span class="date">1890</span> a small town had developed. The town was once known as <span class="loc">Fassifern</span> Scrub and then <span class="loc">Engelsburg</span> after the first settler of the town. The town has a very rich German history, reflected <span class="date">today</span> in the many Anglo-German road and street names as well as the many local German settler descendant surnames. The name changed to <span class="loc">Kalbar</span> because of anti-German sentiment in <span class="date">1916</span>. The <span class="loc">Mount Edwards</span> railway line reached the town in the same year. <span class="org">Engelsburg Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">7 July 1897</span> (a receiving office had been open from <span class="date">1878</span>. known as <span class="loc">Engels</span> for <span class="date">five years</span>) and was renamed <span class="loc">Kalbar</span> in <span class="date">1916</span>. During the <span class="date">1899</span> referendum to decide if <span class="loc">Australia</span> should become a federation, <span class="loc">Kalbar</span> registered the highest No vote of any town in <span class="loc">Queensland</span>. In <span class="date">1920</span>, the <span class="org">Kalbar School of Arts</span> hall and half the businesses in town were destroyed by fire.</p><br><br>
