<p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. As of 2010, the population was 38,124. The county seat is <span class="loc">Crawfordsville</span>. The county is divided into 11 townships which provide local services. The earliest known inhabitants of the area that would become <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> were the Mound Builders, Native Americans who built large earthen mounds, two of which were constructed in southeastern Franklin Township. (Note: Research in the late 1900s has shown these mounds were natural mounds not man made. Subsequent Native American tribes occupied the area until as late as 1832. The first white settler in the area that would become <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> was William Offield, earlier of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, who arrived in 1821 with his wife Jennie (n√©e <span class="loc">Laughlin</span>) and one child and settled near the confluence of <span class="loc">Offield</span> Creek and <span class="loc">Sugar Creek</span>, about five miles (8 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Crawfordsville</span>. The first land in the county to be purchased from the government was a tract in Scott Township sold to John Loop on July 23, 1822; many more tracts were entered in subsequent months, most in Union Township. The area's settlers mostly came from <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, with others arriving from <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span> and the <span class="loc">Carolinas</span>.</p>
