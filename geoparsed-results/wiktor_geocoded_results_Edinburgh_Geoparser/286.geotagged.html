<p><span class="loc">Toledo</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Lewis County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 725 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Toledo</span> was officially incorporated on October 10, 1892. <span class="loc">Toledo</span> was named by Celeste Rochon after a pioneer side wheel paddle steamer operated by Captain Oren Kellogg of the Kellogg Transportation Company. The boat traveled the <span class="loc">Cowlitz River</span>. A picture of the riverboat is hanging downtown next to the drugstore. The first school in <span class="loc">Toledo</span> was called the OK School. It was a one-room school house. Most of the kids that lived out of the town limits had to ride a boat across the river to and from school until the bridge was built. The current Middle School was originally the High School until the new High School was built in the late 70s-early 80s. While the middle school was being remodeled in 1995 the children were relocated for the year to St. Mary's Church and School. The Cowlitz Indian Tribe made a special Totem Pole for Toledo High School. The town has always used the "Indian" as the School's mascot (of course after receiving permission from the tribe). Recently, a painting was donated to the High School of "Old Ike" who was the last full blooded Cowlitz Indian. His portrait still hangs within the halls of the High School.</p>
