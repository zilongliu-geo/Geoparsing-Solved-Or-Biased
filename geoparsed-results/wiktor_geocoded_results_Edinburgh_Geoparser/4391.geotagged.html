<p><span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> is a large suburban town in <span class="loc">Charleston County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the fourth-largest municipality in <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, and for several years it was one of the state's fastest-growing areas, doubling in population between 1990 and 2000. The population was 67,843 at the 2010 census, and the estimated population in 2014 was 77,796. It is the third-largest municipality in the <span class="loc">Charleston</span> – <span class="loc">North Charleston</span> – <span class="loc">Summerville metropolitan</span> area, behind <span class="loc">Charleston</span> and <span class="loc">North Charleston</span>. At the foot of the Arthur Ravenel Bridge is <span class="loc">Patriots Point</span>, a naval and maritime museum, home to the World War II aircraft carrier USS <span class="loc">Yorktown</span>, which is now a museum ship. The <span class="loc">Ravenel</span> Bridge, an eight-lane highway that was completed in 2005, spans the <span class="loc">Cooper River</span> and links <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> with the <span class="loc">city of Charleston</span>. The site of <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> was originally occupied by the Sewee people, an Algonquian language-speaking tribe. The first white settlers arrived from <span class="loc">England</span> on July 6, 1680, under the leadership of Captain Florentia O'Sullivan. Captain O'Sullivan had been granted 2,340 acres (950 ha), which included not only the island that bears his name, but also the land that was to become <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>. On the earliest map of the time this area was called "<span class="loc">North Point</span>".</p>
