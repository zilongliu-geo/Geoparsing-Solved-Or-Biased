  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Oakland</span> officer shot by parolee is taken off life support. <span class="loc">SAN FRANCISCO</span> â€” A fourth <span class="loc">Oakland</span> police officer who was shot by a 26-year-old man wanted on a parole violation has been taken off of life support, a hospital spokeswoman said <span class="date">Tuesday</span>. Officer <span class="per">John Hege</span> was taken off life support <span class="date">Monday night</span>, said <span class="per">Andrea Breaux</span> of <span class="org">Alameda County Medical Center</span>. The 41-year-old <span class="org">Concord</span> resident's family had kept him alive so his organs could be donated, in keeping with his wishes. <span class="per">Breaux</span> said the process of harvesting <span class="per">Hege</span>'s organs started just after <span class="date">8 p.m. Monday</span> and was completed by 2 a.m. today. According to police, <span class="per">Hege</span> and a partner, <span class="per">Sgt. Mark Dunakin</span>, were gunned down when they pulled over the parolee on <span class="date">Saturday</span>. A massive manhunt ensued and two more officers died when the city's SWAT team stormed an apartment where the suspected gunman, Lovelle Mixon, was hiding. <span class="loc">Mixon</span> was fatally shot. The two officers who were killed at the apartment were <span class="per">Sgt. Ervin</span> Romans, 43, and <span class="per">Sgt. Daniel Sakai</span>, 35. "This is the biggest tragedy ever to hit our department," <span class="loc">Oakland</span> police <span class="per">Sgt. Mark Schmid</span> said <span class="date">Monday</span>. "We're just numb and walking around like zombies. We feel each other's pain but we don't know how to explain it." Flowers piled up outside <span class="loc">Oakland</span> police headquarters and books brimmed with condolences. A vigil was planned for <span class="date">Tuesday evening</span> at the corner near where the two motorcycle officers pulled over <span class="loc">Mixon</span>. DNA found at the scene of the rape was a probable match to Lovelle Mixon, <span class="loc">Oakland</span> police spokesman <span class="per">Jeff Thomason</span> said <span class="date">Monday night</span>. Investigators got that information <span class="date">Friday</span>, the day before the routine traffic stop ended in gunfire. California prison records show that authorities had issued a warrant for Mixon's arrest after he failed to make a mandatory meeting with his parole officer on <span class="date">Feb. 19</span>. The family said he had previously served <span class="date">six years</span> in state prison for assault with a firearm during an armed robbery in <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>. More recently, he had served <span class="date">several months</span> in prison <span class="date">last year</span>. State Attorney General <span class="per">Jerry Brown</span> said he will examine how <span class="loc">Mixon</span>, 26, was monitored following his release from prison in <span class="date">November</span>. <span class="loc">Mixon</span> also was a suspect in a murder but was never charged, according to state prison officials. "Mixon was certainly a character that needed more supervision," said Brown, the former mayor of <span class="loc">Oakland</span>. "In <span class="loc">Oakland</span>, the highway patrol has an office there, sheriff and police. And all those agencies should have a list of the more dangerous, threatening parolees so they can keep a watch on them." Problems involving parolees from California's overcrowded prison system have long beset state officials who must monitor them, local officials who try to keep streets safe and federal authorities who enforce firearms and other laws. <span class="loc">Mixon</span> was one of 164 <span class="loc">Oakland</span> parolees in mid-March who had outstanding arrest warrants for parole violations, state prison records show. The city of 400,000 had more than 1,900 total parolees at the time, including nearly 300 who had been returned to custody or whose parole was about to be revoked. During traffic stops, police often check vehicle records to find whether the driver has outstanding warrants. But police have not disclosed how <span class="date">Saturday</span>'s shooting unfolded. Mixon's family members said he was upset that he was unable to find work, felt his parole officer was not helping him and feared he would be arrested for a parole violation. State prison officials said Mixon's parole officer was responsible for 70 parolees. A caseload of that size is nearly unmanageable, and also not unusual, said <span class="per">Lance Corcoran</span>, spokesman for California's prison guard union, which includes parole officers. "There is no control," <span class="per">Corcoran</span> said. "It's simply supervision, and supervision at distance." Associated Press writers <span class="per">Josh Dubow</span>, <span class="per">Lisa Leff</span> and <span class="per">Juliana Barbassa</span> in <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="per">Terry Collins</span> in <span class="loc">Oakland</span> contributed to this report.

A man wanted for violating his parole killed three police officers and gravely wounded <span class="per">Hege</span> in two shootings <span class="date">Saturday, March 21, 2009</span>. <span class="per">Hege</span> was taken off life support <span class="date">Tuesday</span>.
