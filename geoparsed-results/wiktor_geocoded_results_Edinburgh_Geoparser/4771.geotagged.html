<p><span class="loc">Jixi</span> (Chinese: 鸡西; pinyin: Jīxī) is a city in <span class="loc">southeastern Heilongjiang Province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. At the 2010 census, 1,862,165 people resided within its administrative area of 22,488.47 square kilometres (8,682.85 sq mi) and 757,647 in its built-up (or metro) area made up of 3 out of 6 urban districts (including <span class="loc">Jiguan</span>, <span class="loc">Hengshan</span> and <span class="loc">Chengzihe</span>). <span class="loc">Jixi</span> is on the <span class="loc">Muling</span> River about 30 km (19 mi) from the border with <span class="loc">Russia</span>'s Primorsky Krai and 120 km (75 mi) from <span class="loc">Khanka</span> Lake. The mayor of <span class="loc">Jixi</span> is Zhu Deyi (朱德义) since July 2009. The area is one of the important coal mining bases in <span class="loc">China</span>. A crater on asteroid 253 <span class="loc">Mathilde</span> was named after the city. <span class="loc">Jixi</span> was ruled by the Jurchen and Goguryeo people. By the Shang dynasty, dwellers here had begun to communicate with people in the <span class="loc">Central Plain</span>. It was in the Han dynasty that primitive agriculture in this region had made great progress. During the Tang dynasty, <span class="loc">Jixi</span> was under the control of the Balhae. As the Manchus conquered the territories occupied by the Ming dynasty in 1644, the basin of the <span class="loc">Amur River</span> was blocked in order to protect the Manchu people's place of origin. In this period, the population of the <span class="loc">Jixi region</span> experienced a sharp decrease. In 1662, the Kangxi Emperor ordered the general of <span class="loc">Ninguta</span> to dominate the territory. Since a large number of people engaged in reclaiming wasteland and collecting ginseng, <span class="loc">Jixi</span> and the whole <span class="loc">Ussuri River</span> basin gradually became the base for medicinal materials.</p>
