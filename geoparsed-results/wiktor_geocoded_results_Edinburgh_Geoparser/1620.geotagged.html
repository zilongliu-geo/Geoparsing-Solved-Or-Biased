<p><span class="loc">Newport</span> is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 7 km south-west of Melbourne's CBD. Its local government area is the City of <span class="loc">Hobsons Bay</span>. At the 2011 Census, <span class="loc">Newport</span> had a population of 11,987. <span class="loc">Newport</span> is approximately 10 minutes by car from Melbourne via the West Gate Freeway or a 20-minute train journey from Flinders Street Station. The Yalukit-willam people of the Boon-wurrung Country are the traditional owners of land known as <span class="loc">Newport</span>, with a well researched connection to the area beyond 30,000 years. First contact came with European sealers (1803â€“1834) and followed a pattern of violence typical across <span class="loc">Australia</span> at the time. In 1835 the arrival of John Batman saw a treaty established and a period of relative peace. However, despite this the plight of the Australian Aborigines was dire, as they were increasingly denied ownership and access to their lands. European settlement began in <span class="loc">Newport</span> at what was then called <span class="loc">Williamstown</span> Junction around 1862, with a Telegraph Office and Post Office by 1869. It was renamed <span class="loc">Newport</span> in 1881. The Newport Railway Workshops played a key role in the development of the suburb, formerly the main workshops of the Victorian Railways. The workshops are just south of the <span class="loc">Newport</span> railway station. The Newport Power Station is another feature of the suburb, the chimney of which remains one of the tallest towers in Melbourne at 183 metres. The original coal-fired generators were replaced in 1981 with a single 500MW gas-fired generator and operates during peak-load periods.</p>
