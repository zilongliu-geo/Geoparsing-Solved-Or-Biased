  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Ẓafār or <span class="loc">Dhafar</span> (Ar ظفار) Ðafār (museum: UTM: 435700E, 1571160 N zone 38P, 14°12'N, 44°24'E, deviating slightly from <span class="org">Google</span> Earth) is an ancient Himyarite site situated in <span class="loc">Yemen</span>, some 130 km south-south-east of <span class="date">today</span>'s capital, <span class="loc">Sana</span>'a. Given mention in several ancient texts, there is little doubt about the pronunciation of the name. Despite the opinion of local patriots in <span class="loc">Oman</span>, this site is far older than its namesake there. It lies in the Yemenite highlands at some 2800 m. The closest large town is <span class="loc">Yarim</span>, which is 10 km directly to the north-north-west. <span class="loc">Zafar</span> was the capital of the Himyarites (110 BCE - 525 CE), which at its peak ruled most of the <span class="loc">Arabia</span>. The <span class="loc">Himyar</span> are not a tribe, but rather a tribal confederacy. For <span class="date">250 years</span> the confederacy and its allies combined territory extended past <span class="loc">Riyadh</span> to the north and the <span class="loc">Euphrates</span> to the north-east. <span class="loc">Zafar</span> was the Himyarite capital in Southern <span class="loc">Arabia</span> prior to the Aksumite conquest. Archaeologically speaking, the settlements beginnings aren't well known. The main sources are Old <span class="loc">South Arabian</span> musnad inscriptions dated as early as the 1st century BCE. It is mentioned by <span class="loc">Pliny</span> in his Natural History, in the anonymous Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (both 1st century CE), as well as in the Geographia of Claudius Ptolemaeus (original 2nd century CE). At some point, presumably the medieval times the coordinates of the Ptolemy map were incorrectly copied or emended so that subsequent maps place the site Sephar metropolis in <span class="loc">Oman</span>, not in the <span class="loc">Yemen</span>. The <span class="loc">Zafar</span> in <span class="loc">Yemen</span> is <span class="date">more than 1000 years</span> older than that place-name in <span class="loc">Oman</span>, assuming from the evidence in known texts (Smith <span class="date">2001</span>: 380). Written sources regarding <span class="loc">Zafar</span> are numerous, but heterogeneous in informational value. The most important source is epigraphic Old <span class="loc">South Arabian</span>. Christian texts shed light on the war between the <span class="loc">Himyar</span> and the Aksumites (523 - 525). The <span class="loc">Vita</span> of Gregentios is a pious forgery created by Byzantine monks, which mentions a bishop who allegedly had his see in <span class="loc">Zafar</span>. It contains linguistic usage possibly of the 12th century CE.</p><br><br>
