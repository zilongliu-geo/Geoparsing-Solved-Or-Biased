<p>Cleveland is a village in <span class="loc">Oswego County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 750 at the 2010 census. The Village of Cleveland is at the eastern boundary of the Town of <span class="loc">Constantia</span> on Route 49. The Village of Cleveland was incorporated in 1857. Much of the 19th century industry was based on glass manufacturing. Some say the town is named after <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> and other claim it is named after James Cleveland, an early settler. In 2007, over one hundred village residents signed a petition to dissolve the village. The petition was rejected on technical grounds, but the village board formed a committee to study the implications of dissolution and alternatives, including increased efficiency via intermunicipal cooperation. The <span class="loc">St. James</span>' Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Cleveland is located at 43°14′11″N 75°52′58″W (43.236502, -75.882705). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.1 km2), of which, 1.1 square miles (2.8 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) of it (8.13%) is water.</p>
