  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Auburn is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Weld County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Auburn is five miles southeast of Downtown <span class="loc">Greeley</span>. In <span class="date">the 1960s</span> Auburn was a farming community with no general stores and no post offices. Many of the families were first, second, and third generation immigrants with German-Russian, Mexican, and Swedish heritage. Families attended Baptist, Catholic, and Congregational churches in <span class="loc">Greeley</span>, <span class="loc">Gilcrest</span>, and <span class="loc">Platteville</span>. On <span class="date">December 14, 1961</span>, Union Pacific's "<span class="loc">City of Denver</span>" passenger train collided with a school bus, killing twenty children who were on board. Sixteen children and the driver survived. The crash was the deadliest traffic accident in <span class="loc">Colorado</span> history. Auburn is within <span class="loc">Weld County</span> School District Six. As of 2008 residents are zoned to <span class="org">Bella Romero Elementary School</span> in an unincorporated area, Heath Middle School in <span class="loc">Greeley</span>, and <span class="loc">Greeley West High</span> School in <span class="loc">Greeley</span>. For <span class="date">many years</span> Auburn had a school district and a school. A legislative study posted by the mid-1950s recommended reorganizing <span class="loc">Colorado</span>'s school districts and declared school district reorganization as the state's main priority. Between <span class="date">1956</span> and <span class="date">1961</span> nearly 700 school districts closed, leaving 275 open. As a consequence, many small schools in <span class="loc">Colorado</span> began to close as a result of the district closures. The Auburn School District and the three-room school in Auburn closed, causing children to attend schools in <span class="loc">Greeley</span> beginning in <span class="date">1961</span>. During <span class="date">that year</span> children were assigned to <span class="org">Delta Elementary School</span>, <span class="org">Meeker Junior High School</span>, and <span class="org">Greeley High School</span>. <span class="org">Delta Elementary School</span> no longer exists.</p><br><br>
