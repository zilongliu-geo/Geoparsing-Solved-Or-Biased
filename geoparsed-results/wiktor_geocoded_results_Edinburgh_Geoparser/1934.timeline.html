  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Riverton</span> is a borough located in <span class="loc">Burlington County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough had a total population of 2,779, reflecting an increase of 20 (+0.7%) from the 2,759 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn declined by 16 (-0.6%) from the 2,775 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. <span class="loc">Riverton</span> was incorporated as a borough by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on <span class="date">December 18, 1893</span>, from portions of Cinnaminson Township, based on the results of a referendum held <span class="date">six days earlier</span>. Portions of the borough were taken to form Palmyra Township on <span class="date">April 19, 1894</span>. The borough's name is derived from The <span class="org">Riverton Improvement Company</span>, which was established after a group of ten purchased a 120-acre (49 ha) that would be the site of a planned community with homes erected for many of the founders along the riverfront. It is a dry town, where alcohol cannot be sold. The borough's dry status was an early character of the borough, with a clause inserted starting in <span class="date">1952</span> by the <span class="org">Riverton Improvement Company</span> into deeds for all properties in the community that prohibited the sale or manufacture of alcoholic beverages.</p><br><br>
