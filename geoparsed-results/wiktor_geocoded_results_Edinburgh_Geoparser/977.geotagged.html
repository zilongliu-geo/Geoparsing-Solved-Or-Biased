<p>Salina is a town in <span class="loc">Onondaga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 33,710 at the 2010 census. The name of the town is derived from the Latin word for "salt". Salina is a northwest suburb of the <span class="loc">city of Syracuse</span>. The region was in the domain of the Onondaga tribe and later was within the Central New York Military Tract, although it was reserved for members of the Onondagas. Salina received its name in 1797, when the Surveyor General of <span class="loc">New York</span> State received authority to set aside a portion of the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation for use in salt manufacture. The reservation had been created by a treaty with the Native Americans. The land extended one mile around <span class="loc">Onondaga Lake</span>. In 1798, the Village of Salina was chartered. It was located in what is now the Washington Square neighborhood or "First Ward" of the current <span class="loc">City of Syracuse</span> and contained sixteen blocks. Each block was divided into four house lots, selling according to law, for no less than forty dollars. The area now known as the Town of Salina was still part of the Townships of <span class="loc">Manlius</span> and <span class="loc">Marcellus</span>. In March 1809, the Town of Salina was organized. It included the areas now known as the Town of <span class="loc">Geddes</span> (formed 1848), part of <span class="loc">Manlius</span> and the <span class="loc">City of Syracuse</span>.</p>
