<p><span class="loc">San Luis</span> is a second class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Aurora</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. The town has almost the same area as <span class="loc">Metro Manila</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 25,276 people. Between 1818 and 1902, the <span class="loc">Province of Aurora</span>, then a district of “ <span class="loc">El Principe</span>”, <span class="loc">Nueva Ecija</span> consisted only of <span class="loc">Baler</span> and <span class="loc">Casiguran</span>. The four (4) other existing municipalities were just mission villages like the <span class="loc">San Jose</span> de Casecnan (now <span class="loc">Maria Aurora</span>), <span class="loc">Dipaculao</span>, <span class="loc">Dilasag</span> and Ditale. While what is now the municipality of <span class="loc">San Luis</span> was a barrio of <span class="loc">Baler</span> adjacent to the old barrios of Real, <span class="loc">Bacong</span>, <span class="loc">Ditumabo</span> and <span class="loc">Zarah</span>. It was named after the patron Saint “ <span class="loc">San Luis Rey</span> de Francia”. In the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> Revolution of 1898, the five barrios became the hot beds of insurgency. The situation was aggravated when the insurrectos attacked the cazadores living in those areas. Since then, these places became famous and significant spots in the northern part of the then <span class="loc">Tayabas province</span>. On 9 December 1941, the locality suffered heavy casualties when the Japanese Imperial forces bombarded it. This caused the people to flee their homes and settle in nearby mountains of Dibalo and Dicaloyungan. From there, they organized and formed a guerilla group called “205th Squadron” which later became instrumental in liberating the province against the Japanese invading forces by the local Filipino soldiers and the recognized guerrillas in 1945.</p>
