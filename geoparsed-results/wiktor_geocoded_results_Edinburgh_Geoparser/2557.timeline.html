  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> (<span class="per">Tamil</span>: வட மாகாணம் Vaṭakku Mākāṇam; <span class="per">Sinhalese</span>: උතුරු පළාත Uturu Paḷāta) is one of the nine provinces of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>, the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until <span class="date">1987</span> when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> established provincial councils. Between <span class="date">1988</span> and <span class="date">2006</span> the province was temporarily merged with the <span class="loc">Eastern Province</span> to form the <span class="loc">North Eastern Province</span>. The capital of the province is <span class="loc">Jaffna</span>. The majority of the <span class="org">Sri Lankan Civil War</span> was played out and had its roots in this province. Parts of present-day <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> were part of the pre-colonial Jaffna kingdom. Other parts were ruled by Vanniar Chieftains who paid tribute to the Jaffna kingdom. The province then came under Portuguese, Dutch and British control. In <span class="date">1815</span> the British gained control of the entire island of <span class="loc">Ceylon</span>. They divided the island into three ethnic based administrative structures: Low Country <span class="per">Sinhalese</span>, Kandyan <span class="per">Sinhalese</span> and <span class="per">Tamil</span>. The <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> was part of the <span class="per">Tamil</span> administration. In <span class="date">1833</span>, in accordance with the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, the ethnic based administrative structures were unified into a single administration divided into five geographic provinces. The <span class="loc">districts of Jaffna</span>, <span class="loc">Mannar</span>, Nuvarakalaviya (present day <span class="loc">Anuradhapura District</span>) and <span class="loc">Vanni</span> formed the new <span class="loc">Northern Province</span>. Nuvarakalaviya was transferred to the newly created <span class="loc">North Central Province</span> in <span class="date">1873</span>.</p><br><br>
