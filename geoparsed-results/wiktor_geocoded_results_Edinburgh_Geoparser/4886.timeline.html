This town is located 5 km west of <span class="loc">Ramtek</span> and 45 km northeast of <span class="loc">Nagpur city</span>. <span class="loc">Mansar</span> is located at 21.4°N 79.25°E﻿ / 21.4; 79.25. It has an average elevation of 471 metres (1545 feet). In <span class="date">1972</span>, an image of a deity, later identified as Shiva Vamana was found from a hillock in <span class="loc">Mansar</span>, locally known as Hidimba Tekri. Important excavations were carried out at the ancient sites of <span class="loc">Mansar</span> since 1997-98, under the aegis of the Bodhisatva Nagarjun Smarak Samstha Va Anusandhan Kendra, <span class="loc">Nagpur</span> and under the directions of <span class="loc">Jagat</span> <span class="loc">Pati</span> <span class="loc">Joshi</span> and <span class="per">A. K. Sharma</span>. So far 5 sites have been excavated in <span class="loc">Mansar</span>, which are designated as MNS 1, MNS 2, MNS 3, MNS 4 and MNS 5. These excavations have resulted in the discovery of various shrines (MNS 3, 4, 5) and a palace complex (MNS 2), identified as Pravarapura, the capital of the Vakataka king <span class="per">Pravarasena II</span> (1st half of 5th century). Adjacent to this palace, on Hidimba Tekri (MNS 3), an extensive temple complex has been unearthed, identified as Pravareśvara. A 3 m tall lime model of a male human figure in crouching position was found underneath one of the terraces of MNS 3. Significant 5th-century sculptures of Hindu deities, artefacts and some coins have been discovered in the excavations.</p><br><br>
