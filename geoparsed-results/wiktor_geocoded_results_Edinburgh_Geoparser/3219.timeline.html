  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wilton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Fairfield County</span> in southwestern <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the town population was 18,062. Officially recognized as a parish in <span class="date">1726</span>, <span class="loc">Wilton</span> is <span class="date">today</span>, like many other <span class="loc">Fairfield County</span> towns, an expensive residential community with open lands (a testament to its colonial farming roots), historic architecture and extensive town services. Residents commonly commute to New <span class="loc">York City</span>, <span class="loc">Stamford</span>, and <span class="loc">Norwalk</span>, although there are a number of office buildings in town. <span class="loc">Wilton</span> was rated one of <span class="org">CNN</span>'s top 25 towns to live, boasting an average household income of over $300,000 per family. <span class="loc">Wilton</span> is home to many successful start-up companies, national strategy and professional services and consulting firms, and global corporations such as Deloitte &amp; Touche, Sun Products, <span class="loc">Breitling</span> <span class="loc">USA</span>, <span class="org">Cannondale Bicycle Corporation</span>, Melissa &amp; Doug, and the Blue Buffalo Company (#1 natural pet food manufacturer, also founded here). Many Fortune 1000 companies are headquartered within a 30-minute train or car commute. AIG Financial Products was headquartered in the town. Its trading in credit derivatives essentially bankrupted its parent company, AIG, and helped create the global financial crisis of <span class="date">2008</span>â€“<span class="date">2009</span>.</p><br><br>
