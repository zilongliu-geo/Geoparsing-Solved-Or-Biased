  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Berg is a municipality in <span class="loc">Troms county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of <span class="loc">Skaland</span>. Other villages include Finnsæter, Mefjordvær, and Senjahopen. The municipality was the first place in the world to utilize a hydroelectrical power station in the mining community of <span class="loc">Hamn</span>. When the mining industry ceased, the "electrical adventure" did as well. The buildings are still located at <span class="loc">Hamn</span>, <span class="date">now</span> functioning as a special hotel/lodge. The first female pastor in the Lutheran Church of <span class="loc">Norway</span>, Ingrid Bjerkås, worked in this parish, starting in <span class="date">1961</span>. Berg was established as a municipality on <span class="date">1 January 1838</span> (see formannskapsdistrikt). The southern part of Berg (population: 1,229) was separated from Berg to form the new municipality of <span class="loc">Torsken</span> on <span class="date">1 January 1902</span>. This left Berg with 1,002 residents. The municipal borders have not changed since. The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Berg farm (Old Norse: Berg). The name is identical with the word berg which means "mountain". The Church of <span class="loc">Norway</span> has one parish (sokn) within the municipality of Berg. It is part of the Senja deanery in the <span class="loc">Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland</span>.</p><br><br>
