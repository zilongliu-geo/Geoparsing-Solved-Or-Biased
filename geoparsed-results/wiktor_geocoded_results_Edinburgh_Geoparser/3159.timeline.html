  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Baga</span> is a town in the northeastern Nigerian state of <span class="loc">Borno</span>, close to <span class="loc">Lake Chad</span>, and lying northeast of the town of <span class="loc">Kukawa</span>. It is located within the <span class="org">Kukawa Local Government Area</span>. The town is approximately 196km from <span class="loc">Maiduguri</span>, the capital of <span class="loc">Borno State</span>. The "Doron Baga" fish market, as of <span class="date">2000</span>, was located about six kilometres from the town. <span class="loc">Baga</span> used to lie on the border of <span class="loc">Lake Chad</span> and was a fishing center itself in <span class="date">the 1960s and 1970s</span>, but the diminishing size of the lake has caused fishermen to move, and others have turned to subsistence farming. In <span class="date">April 2013</span>, over 185 people were killed and over 2000 homes in <span class="loc">Baga</span> were destroyed as a result of fighting between the Nigerian military and the Boko Haram Islamist group. In <span class="date">January 2015</span>, Boko Haram again attacked the town, seizing it and the military base used by a multinational force set up to fight them. The town was burned and the people massacred — perhaps 2000 deaths — the largest such massacre in Boko Haram's history. Some residents escaped to nearby <span class="loc">Chad</span>.</p><br><br>
