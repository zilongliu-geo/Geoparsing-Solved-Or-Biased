<p>For other places with the same name, see <span class="loc">Oakland</span>. <span class="loc">Oakland</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Kennebec County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Maine</span>. The population was 6,240 at the 2010 census. Gateway to the <span class="loc">Belgrade Lakes</span> region, <span class="loc">Oakland</span> is 4 miles (6 km) west of <span class="loc">Waterville</span> and approximately 18 miles (29 km) north of <span class="loc">Augusta</span>, the state capital. It was first settled about 1780 by colonists of English descent from <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. At that time, the region was known as Taconnet after Indian Chief Taconnet, an Abenaki sachem. It was incorporated by the Massachusetts General Court in 1771 as part of <span class="loc">Winslow</span>. In 1802, the area west of the <span class="loc">Kennebec River</span> was incorporated as <span class="loc">Waterville</span>. But manufacturers in the western section, who had created a separate center of industry and trade and were dissatisfied with its taxation, petitioned to have the district set off as a town. The Maine State Legislature complied, and on February 26, 1873 incorporated it as <span class="loc">West Waterville</span>. In 1883, it was renamed <span class="loc">Oakland</span>, presumably after all the oak trees in the town, though some favored the name <span class="loc">Weldon</span>.</p>
