  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Milton is a town in the South Coast region of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, within the <span class="loc">City of Shoalhaven</span>. It was founded in <span class="date">1860</span>, named after the property of post master <span class="per">George Knight</span> and became an important regional centre during the 19th Century. <span class="date">Today</span>, Milton remains one of the two main commercial centres of the <span class="loc">Milton-Ulladulla district</span>, with a population at the <span class="date">2011</span> census of 1,449. It is a popular stopping place for travellers on the Princes Highway which runs through the centre of town. In <span class="date">recent years</span>, Milton has undergone a resurgence largely influenced by the local tourism industry and an influx of residents to the district seeking a seachange. Several new housing estates are being developed on the fringes of the village and new boutique stores, cafes and bed and breakfast type businesses have located in the town. The coastal area of the <span class="loc">Milton-Ulladulla district</span> was observed by Captain <span class="per">James Cook</span> in <span class="date">1770</span> when sailing along the east coast of <span class="loc">Australia</span>, before landing at <span class="loc">Botany Bay</span>. Cook noted the nearby <span class="loc">Pigeon House Mountain</span>, a prominent landmark. The Reverend <span class="per">Thomas Kendall</span> was the first European settler to the area, issued a land grant in <span class="date">1827</span>. He named the estate "<span class="per">Kendall Dale</span>" and commenced pastoral activities as well as cutting red cedar found in abundance near <span class="loc">Narrawallee</span> Creek. Poet <span class="per">Henry Kendall</span>, the grandson of <span class="per">Thomas Kendall</span> was born at the property near Milton in <span class="date">1839</span>. Further land grants in the 1830s led to a town site being surveyed in <span class="date">1837</span> at <span class="loc">Boat Harbour</span> (present day <span class="loc">Ulladulla</span>). The district prospered through the 1840s on the back of the timber industry.</p><br><br>
