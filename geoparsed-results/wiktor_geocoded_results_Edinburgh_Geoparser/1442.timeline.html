  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Huron</span> and <span class="loc">Richland</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The population was 1,857 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The <span class="loc">Richland County</span> portion of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Mansfield Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, while the <span class="loc">Huron County</span> portion is part of the <span class="org">Norwalk Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> was laid out in <span class="date">1825</span>. It was incorporated as a village in <span class="date">1834</span>. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> was formerly the headquarters of the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> Locomotive Works, a builder of industrial railroad locomotives. The factory closed in <span class="date">1999</span>. The company designed and built an automobile named <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> in the early part of the century, but it was not mass-produced, but there were trucks and tractors produced by Commercial Motor Truck Company under the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> name in the same period. Later, <span class="org">Chrysler</span> Motors developed the <span class="org">Plymouth Automobile Division</span>, but thought the Ohio company had infringed on their name. A court battle ensued over the ownership of the name <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, which <span class="org">Chrysler</span> lost when it was determined the original <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> car preceded <span class="org">Chrysler</span>'s by <span class="date">several years</span>. During the Great Depression, the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> Locomotive Plant designed and built the famous <span class="loc">Silver King</span> (originally the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>) tractor, a somewhat maligned favorite of local farmers and known for its fast road gear. The tractors were produced until <span class="date">the 1950s</span> when it was sold to Mountain State Engineering in <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> and then discontinued. The village hosts the annual <span class="loc">Silver King</span> Festival during <span class="date">the first week of August</span> when restored Silver Kings tractors from around the world are displayed.</p><br><br>
