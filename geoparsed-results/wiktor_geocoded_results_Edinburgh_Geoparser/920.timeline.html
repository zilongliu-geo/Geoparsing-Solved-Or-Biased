  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Albany</span> /ˈælbəni/ is a port city in the <span class="loc">Great Southern</span> region of Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 418 km SE of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, the state capital. <span class="loc">Albany</span> is the oldest permanently settled town in Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, predating <span class="loc">Perth</span> and <span class="loc">Fremantle</span> by over <span class="date">two years</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> Census, <span class="loc">Albany</span>'s population was 30,656, making it the state's sixth-largest population centre. The city centre is at the northern edge of <span class="loc">Princess Royal Harbour</span>, which is a part of <span class="loc">King George Sound</span>. The central business district is bounded by <span class="loc">Mount Clarence</span> to the east and <span class="loc">Mount Melville</span> to the west. The city is in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Albany</span>. <span class="loc">Albany</span> was founded on <span class="date">26 December 1826</span> as a military outpost of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> as part of a plan to forestall French ambitions in the region. To that end, on <span class="date">21 January 1827</span> the commander of the outpost, Major <span class="per">Edmund Lockyer</span>, formally took possession of the western third of the continent for the British <span class="org">Crown</span>. The area was initially named <span class="per">Frederick</span> Town in honour of <span class="per">Prince Frederick</span>, <span class="loc">Duke of York</span> and <span class="loc">Albany</span>. In <span class="date">1831</span>, the settlement was transferred to the control of the <span class="org">Swan</span> <span class="loc">River Colony</span> and renamed <span class="loc">Albany</span> by Lieutenant-Governor <span class="per">James Stirling</span>.</p><br><br>
