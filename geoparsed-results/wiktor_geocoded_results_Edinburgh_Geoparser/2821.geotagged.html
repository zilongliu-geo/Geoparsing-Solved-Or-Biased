<p><span class="loc">Polk County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 75,403. The county seat is Dallas. The county is named for James Knox Polk, the 11th president of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Polk County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Salem</span>, <span class="loc">OR</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Portland-Vancouver-Salem, OR-WA Combined Statistical Area. It is located in the <span class="loc">Willamette</span> Valley. The Oregon Provisional Legislature created <span class="loc">Polk County</span> from <span class="loc">Yamhill District</span> on December 22, 1845, granting to it the entire southwestern portion of present day <span class="loc">Oregon</span> to the California border. County boundaries were periodically changed to reflect the creation of Benton and Lincoln counties. Many other counties were subsequently carved out of these as settlement spread towards the south, leaving <span class="loc">Polk County</span> many counties away from its former border with <span class="loc">California</span>. The first county seat was a settlement on the north side of <span class="loc">Rickreall Creek</span> named <span class="loc">Cynthian</span> (also known as Cynthia Ann). In 1852 city officials renamed <span class="loc">Cynthian</span> to Dallas after Vice President George M. Dallas, vice president (1845-1849) to James Polk. During the 1880s and 1890s, there were a series of unsuccessful efforts to move the county seat to nearby Independence.</p>
