<p>Lions Club member wins chance to kiss pig. <span class="loc">CHARLESTON</span>, W.Va. - Jim McMillon of the Charleston Gold Dome Lions Club won first prize in a fundraiser that entitled him to kiss a pig. McMillon raised a total of $2,447 to support research and education programs of the American Diabetes Association and Charleston Gold Dome Lions Club sight programs. <span class="loc">Jethro</span>, the piglet, was supplied by 17-year-old Ripley High School junior Andrew Bourgeois. He is chapter treasurer of the Future Farmers of <span class="loc">America</span>. Last year, his brother Caleb provided the pig. He kissed a piglet named <span class="loc">Jethro</span> on Friday afternoon at the LaBelle Theater in <span class="loc">South Charleston</span>. The "Kiss A Pig" event honors the pig for its life-saving role in the treatment of diabetes as the first source of insulin in 1921.
