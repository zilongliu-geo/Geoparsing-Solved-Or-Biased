  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Paradise is a town on the <span class="loc">Avalon Peninsula</span> in the province of <span class="loc">Newfoundland and Labrador</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The town is a part of the St. <span class="org">John's Metropolitan Area</span> and borders the City of <span class="loc">St. John</span>'s, the City of <span class="loc">Mount Pearl</span>, the Town of <span class="loc">Portugal</span> Cove-St. Philip's, and the town of Conception Bay South. According to the <span class="date">2011</span> Canadian census the population of Paradise is 17,695, after recording a 41% increase in population over <span class="date">five years</span>. While parts of Paradise have been inhabited since the late nineteenth-century, its growth only took off in <span class="date">the 1960s and 1970s</span> as a "bedroom community" of nearby <span class="loc">St. John</span>'s. It has grown at a rapid pace since. In <span class="date">the early 1990s</span>, <span class="org">the Town of Paradise</span> was amalgamated with the Town of <span class="loc">St. Thomas</span>. Other developed areas which had previously been administered by the St. <span class="org">John's Metropolitan Board</span>, an agency of the Government of <span class="loc">Newfoundland and Labrador</span>, were also amalgamated with Paradise. These areas are Three Island Pond, <span class="loc">Topsail</span> Pond, <span class="per">Elizabeth Park</span>, and Evergreen Village. Recently, Paradise has been identified by Statistics <span class="loc">Canada</span> as the fastest-growing municipality in Atlantic <span class="loc">Canada</span>.</p><br><br>
