<p>Reading is a city in <span class="loc">Lyon County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 231. For millennia, the land that is currently <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, the <span class="loc">United States</span> secured most of modern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, Congress organized the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory and in 1861, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th state. In 1863, by Act of Congress and similarly by an act of the State of <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Railway was granted 3,000,000 acres of <span class="loc">Kansas</span> land on the condition that it would build a continuous line to the western border of <span class="loc">Kansas</span> by March 1, 1873. On Oct. 30, 1868, construction began at <span class="loc">Topeka</span>. By Sept. 14, 1870, the first <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> train reached Emporia, fifteen miles past the present site of Reading.  James Fagan, agent for the railroad lands, and T. J. Peter and M. S. Sargent, who represented the railroad interest, organized a town company, with James Fagan as president. The land was owned by McMann &amp; Co., of Reading, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. The town was platted on sixty acres of Section 3, Township 18, Range 13, and called it Reading, after Reading, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. In summer 1870, the town site was surveyed.</p>
