<p><span class="loc">Korba</span> (Tunisian Arabic: قربة‎  qorbā), ancient Curubis, is a town in <span class="loc">Tunisia</span> on the eastern shore of the <span class="loc">Cap Bon</span>. It was the place of exile of the Carthaginian bishop Cyprian in the year leading up to his martyrdom. Modern Korba is in the Nabeul Governorate and had a population of 34,807 in 2004. Ancient geographers and itineraries mention the town Curubis on the African coast between <span class="loc">Clupea</span> (modern <span class="loc">Kelibia</span>) and <span class="loc">Neapolis</span> (modern <span class="loc">Nabeul</span>). The earliest historical record is an inscription from the time of the Roman civil war, which records that the Pompeian generals P. Attius Varus and Gaius Considius Longus fortified the town in 46 BC. In the years after the civil war the town was made a Roman colony, colonia Iulia Curubis (Pliny the Elder refers to it as libera, "free"), perhaps as part of Julius Caesar's attempt to rid his army of older soldiers and at the same time hold <span class="loc">Africa</span> against Pompeian forces. In the year AD 257, the Carthaginian bishop Cyprian was exiled there; his biographer Pontius, who accompanied him into exile, praises the place (12): "provisum esse divinitus … apricum et conpetentem locum, hospitium pro voluntate secretum et quidquid apponi eis ante promissum est, qui regnum et iustitiam dei quaerunt." ("by God's favour a sunny and appropriate place was provided, a refuge secluded as he wished, and whatever was previously promised to be set before those who seek the kingdom and justice of God").</p>
