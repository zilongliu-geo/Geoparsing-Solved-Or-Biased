<p>Hamilton (Māori: Kirikiriroa) is the seat and most populous city of the <span class="loc">Waikato region</span>, in the <span class="loc">North Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. The city encompasses a land area of about 110 km2 (42 sq mi) on the banks of the <span class="loc">Waikato River</span>, and is home to 156,800 people, making it <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>'s fourth most-populous city. <span class="loc">Hamilton City</span> is part of the wider <span class="loc">Hamilton Urban</span> Area, which also encompasses the nearby towns of <span class="loc">Ngaruawahia</span>, <span class="loc">Te Awamutu</span> and <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>. Initially an agricultural service centre, Hamilton now has a growing and diverse economy and is the third fastest growing urban area in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> (behind <span class="loc">Pukekohe</span> and <span class="loc">Auckland</span>). Education and research and development play an important part in Hamilton's economy, as the city is home to approximately 40,000 tertiary students and 1,000 PhD-qualified scientists. The area now covered by the city was originally the site of a handful of Māori villages (kāinga), including Pukete, Miropiko and Kirikiriroa ("long stretch of gravel'), from which the city takes its Māori name. Local Māori were the target of raids by Ngāpuhi during the Musket Wars, and several pā sites from this period can still be found beside the Waikato River.In December 2011 several rua or food storage pits were found near the <span class="loc">Waikato River</span> bank, close to the Waikato museum. Magistrate Gorst, estimated that Kirikiriroa had a population of about 78 before the Waikato Kingitanga wars of 1863–64. The government estimated the Waikato area had a Maori population of 3,400 at the same time. By the time British settlers arrived after 1863, most of these villages had been abandoned as the inhabitants were away fighting with the Kingitanga rebels further west in the battlefields of the upper Waipa river. Missionaries arrived in the area in the 1830s. At the end of the <span class="loc">Waikato Campaign</span> in the <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> wars the four regiments of the Waikato Militia were settled as a peace-keeping force across the region. The 1st Regiment was at <span class="loc">Tauranga</span>, the 2nd at <span class="loc">Pirongia</span>, the 3rd at <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> and the 4th at Kirikiriroa. The settlement was founded on 24 August 1864 and named by Colonel William Moule after Captain John Fane Charles Hamilton, the popular Scottish commander of HMS <span class="loc">Esk</span>, who was killed in the battle of Gate Pā, <span class="loc">Tauranga</span>. Many of the soldier/settlers who intended to farm after the 1863 war, walked off their land in 1868 disgusted at the poor quality of the land. Much of the land was swampy or under water. In 1868 Hamilton's population, which was about 1,000 in 1864, dropped to 300 as farmers left.</p>
