  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a nongovernmental county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 71,372, which makes it the least-populous county on the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> mainland, and the third-least populous county in the state. Its largest community and traditional county seat is <span class="loc">Greenfield</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> comprises the Greenfield Town, <span class="org">MA Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which is included in the Springfield-Greenfield Town, <span class="org">MA Combined Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> was created on <span class="date">24 June 1811</span> from the northern third of <span class="loc">Hampshire County</span>. It was named for <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> was abolished by state government in <span class="date">1997</span>, at the county's request. Like several other <span class="loc">Massachusetts counties</span>, <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> exists <span class="date">today</span> only as a geographic region and has no county government. The <span class="org">Franklin County Commission</span> voted itself out of existence, and all former state-mandated county functions were assumed by state agencies in <span class="date">1997</span>. The sheriff and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region. Counties in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New England</span> generally are historically weak governmental structures. The primary subdivision of the Commonwealth is the municipal township. Communities are permitted to form regional compacts for sharing services. The municipalities of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> have formed the <span class="org">Franklin Regional Council of Governments</span>. The regional council provides various services on a regional basis, and a majority of the county's towns are members of the <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> Solid Waste Management District, which provides municipal waste disposal and recycling services to its members. Public transportation throughout the county and in the North Quabbin area of northwestern <span class="loc">Worcester County</span> is provided by the <span class="org">Franklin Regional Transit Authority</span>.</p><br><br>
