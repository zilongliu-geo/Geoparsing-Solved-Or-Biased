<p><span class="loc">Princeton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Collin County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 6,807. In the late 1870s T. B. Wilson and his brother George began farming near the site of future <span class="loc">Princeton</span>. In 1881 the <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Texas Railroad Company extended its line from <span class="loc">Greenville</span> to <span class="loc">McKinney</span>, passing through land owned by the brothers. The name "Wilson's Switch" was commonly used to designate the area. When residents applied for a post office branch, however, they learned that the name Wilson was already being used. The community then submitted the name "<span class="loc">Princeton</span>" in honor of Prince Dowlin, a landowner and promoter of the town. This name was accepted, and a post office was established in 1888. In 1940, a camp of 76 cabins was built west of <span class="loc">Princeton</span> to house up to 400 migrant workers, who came to work during the onion and cotton seasons. In February 1945, the site became a prisoner-of-war camp for Germans prisoners captured during the Second World War. The local farmers paid the POWs to work on their farms. This operation continued for eight months. Under a special bill, the German prisoners were contracted to work on the City Park located across from city hall. The park was built as a living memorial and shrine to those who served and died during World War II. The Community Park/WWII P.O.W. Camp is located at 500 West College Street.</p>
