  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salla</span> (Kuolajärvi until <span class="date">1936</span>) is a municipality of <span class="loc">Finland</span>, located in <span class="loc">Lapland</span>. The municipality has a population of 3,758 (<span class="date">30 June 2015</span>) and covers an area of 5,872.21 square kilometres (2,267.27 sq mi) of which 142.73 km2 (55.11 sq mi) is water.

The nearby settlement of Sallatunturi is home to the Salla Ski Resort. <span class="loc">Salla</span> is in the Eastern <span class="loc">Lapland</span> and as a border area was affected by the Second World War. Red Army troops invaded <span class="loc">Finland</span> at <span class="loc">Salla</span> during the <span class="date">Winter</span> War but were stopped by the Finnish Army (see Battle of <span class="loc">Salla</span>). Parts of the municipality were ceded to the Soviet Union after the war. The ceded part is sometimes called "Old Salla" or Vanha Salla. During the Continuation War the old town of <span class="loc">Salla</span> was on the Soviet side of the border. The German <span class="org">XXXVI Corps</span> attacked the Soviet positions in an operation code-named Polarfuchs. With the help of the Finnish 6th Division it managed to occupy all of the ceded territories. At the end of the war the German troops were pushed out of <span class="loc">Lapland</span> by Finnish troops in the <span class="org">Lapland War</span>.</p><br><br>
