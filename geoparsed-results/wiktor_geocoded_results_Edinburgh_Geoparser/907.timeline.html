  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>See <span class="loc">Hampton</span> Township, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> for the municipality in <span class="loc">Sussex County</span> <span class="loc">Hampton</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 1,401, reflecting a decline of 145 (-9.4%) from the 1,546 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 31 (+2.0%) from the 1,515 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. What is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Hampton</span> was originally incorporated by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature as Junction Borough on <span class="date">February 20, 1895</span>, from portions of both <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> <span class="per">Township</span> and <span class="per">Bethlehem</span> Township, based on the results of a referendum held on <span class="date">the previous day</span>. By a resolution of the borough council, the name was changed to <span class="loc">Hampton</span> as of <span class="date">February 11, 1909</span>. In <span class="date">1931</span>, additional territory was annexed from both <span class="loc">Glen Gardner</span> borough and <span class="per">Bethlehem</span> Township. Located on the banks of the <span class="loc">Musconetcong River</span>, <span class="loc">Hampton</span> has changed little since it was first settled in <span class="date">1800</span>. In <span class="date">1880</span>, the town consisted of a store, hotel, cabinet manufacturer, blacksmith, wheelwright shop, grist mill, school house and about 25 dwellings. <span class="loc">Hampton</span> was once known as "Junction" because the Central Railroad of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> and the <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, <span class="per">Lackawanna</span> and <span class="per">Western</span> Railroad crossed through here.</p><br><br>
