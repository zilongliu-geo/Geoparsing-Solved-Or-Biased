  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hampton</span> is a village in Rock <span class="loc">Island County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,863 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The village was originally in territory claimed by the <span class="loc">Sauk</span> and Fox Indians, and several Woodland era Native mounds are located in the village limits, and in the adjacent <span class="loc">Illiniwek Forest Preserve</span>. The village in <span class="date">1834</span> was platted as "<span class="loc">Milan</span>" (not the village 13 miles south-southwest in Illinois—see <span class="loc">Milan</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> for more). The "paper town" did not sell initially because of the swampy riverfront, and being adjacent to the north end of the Rock <span class="loc">Island Rapids</span>. However, settlers drained the swamps by the end of the 19th century, and the village was founded by <span class="date">1900</span> as Hampton— the original name of <span class="loc">Milan</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. Black's Store, which is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>, was the first mercantile store to open in Northwest <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="loc">Hampton</span> is located at 41°33′27″N 90°24′29″W (41.557583, -90.407993). According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="loc">Hampton</span> has a total area of 1.65 square miles (4.27 km2), all land.</p><br><br>
