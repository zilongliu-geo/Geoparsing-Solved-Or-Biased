<p>Eureka is a city located in St. <span class="loc">Louis County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> between the <span class="loc">cities of St. Louis and Pacific</span> along Interstate 44. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 10,189. Since 1971, Eureka has been known as the home of the amusement park Six Flags St. Louis (formerly Six Flags Over Mid-America). Local news coverage for the town and some of its neighbors is provided by the <span class="loc">Tri County</span> Journal, the Eureka Pacific Current NewsMagazine, and the Washington Missourian. The city is 2 miles (3 km) west of the former Times Beach, the site of dioxin contamination in the 1980s; the area was depopulated, cleaned up, and reopened as Route 66 State Park. The village of Eureka was platted in 1858 along the route of the Pacific Railroad. By 1890, the village consisted of about 100 homes. According to the Eureka <span class="loc">Chamber of Commerce</span>, railroad workers while clearing way for the track and the next railroad camp saw Eureka, level land with little to clear, and declared, "Eureka!" Greek meaning "I have found it." Thus, Eureka was founded. In 1898, Eureka became home to the St. Louis Children's Industrial Farm, established to give children from St. Louis tenement neighborhoods a chance to experience life in a rural setting. It later became <span class="loc">Camp Wyman</span> (now part of Wyman Center) and is one of the oldest camps in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Eureka was incorporated as a fourth-class city on April 7, 1954.</p>
