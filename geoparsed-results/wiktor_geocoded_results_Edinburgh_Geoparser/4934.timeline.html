  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Carter County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 47,557. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Ardmore</span>. The county was named for <span class="per">Captain Ben W. Carter</span>, a <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> who lived among the <span class="loc">Chickasaw</span>. <span class="loc">Carter County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Ardmore</span>, <span class="loc">OK</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. It is also a part of the <span class="loc">Texoma region</span>. Prior to statehood, the present <span class="loc">Carter County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, was part of <span class="loc">Pickens County</span> in the <span class="loc">Chickasaw Nation</span> of Indian Territory. After the Civil War, the government of the <span class="loc">United States</span> forced the <span class="loc">Chickasaw</span> government to allow railroads built across its territory. The Gulf, <span class="per">Colorado</span> and <span class="per">Santa</span> Fe Railway (controlled by the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and <span class="per">Santa</span> Fe Railway, AT&amp;SF) built a line north from <span class="loc">Texas</span> to <span class="loc">Purcell</span>. In <span class="date">1901</span>-<span class="date">1903</span> the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> and <span class="loc">Choctaw Railway</span> (acquired by the St. <span class="per">Louis</span> and <span class="per">San</span> Francisco Railway in <span class="date">1907</span>) built a line from <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> to <span class="loc">Ardmore</span>. Oil production spurred further railroad development. In 1913-14, the <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and Pacific Railway constructed a line from <span class="loc">Ardmore</span> west to <span class="loc">Ringling</span>. In <span class="date">1916</span>, the <span class="loc">Ringling</span> and Oil Fields Railway laid tracks north from <span class="loc">Ringling Junction</span> to <span class="loc">Healdton</span>. These last two rail lines were abandoned in <span class="date">1976</span>.</p><br><br>
