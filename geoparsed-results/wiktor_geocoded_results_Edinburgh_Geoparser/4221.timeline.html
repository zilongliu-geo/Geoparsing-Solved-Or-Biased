  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Winton</span> is a town in Central <span class="loc">West Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 177 kilometres (110 mi) northwest of <span class="loc">Longreach</span>. The main industries of the area are sheep and cattle raising. The town was named in <span class="date">1876</span> by postmaster <span class="per">Robert Allen</span>, after his place of birth, <span class="loc">Winton</span>, <span class="loc">Dorset</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Winton</span> had a population of 954. In <span class="date">2015</span> the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> <span class="org">Morning Herald</span> reported that recent seismic studies indicated that <span class="date">300 million years ago</span> an asteroid or comet struck the area releasing energy equivalent to 650 Hiroshima A-bombs. <span class="per">Richard Blewett</span>, a senior official with Geoscience <span class="loc">Australia</span>, described how it was a long circular arc in the course of the <span class="loc">Diamantina River</span> near <span class="loc">Winton</span> that triggered the curiosity that prompted seismic studies. The strike left geomagnetic anomalies over an area 130 kilometres (81 mi) in diameter. The area surrounding the town has yielded a number of dinosaur fossils, including 'Elliot', a sauropod. In <span class="date">2009</span>, three dinosaur genera, Australovenator, <span class="per">Wintonotitan</span> and <span class="per">Diamantinasaurus</span>, were discovered near the town. Australovenator wintonensis, the type specimen of that genus, is named after the town. The town also lent its name to the <span class="loc">Winton</span> Formation.</p><br><br>
