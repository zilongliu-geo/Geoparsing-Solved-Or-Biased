  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Charlotte</span> (/ʃɑːrˈlɒt/ shar-LOT) is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 9,074. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Eaton County</span>. <span class="per">Charlotte</span> is in the central portion of the county, on the boundary between <span class="loc">Eaton Township</span> and <span class="loc">Carmel Township</span>, though politically independent of both. Interstate 69 serves the city, and connects it to the state capital of <span class="loc">Lansing</span>. It is located 21.5 miles (34.6 kilometers) from downtown <span class="loc">Lansing</span>. In <span class="date">1832</span> <span class="per">George Barnes</span> purchased the land that would become <span class="per">Charlotte</span> from the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Government. <span class="per">Barnes</span> in turn sold the land to <span class="loc">Edmond</span> <span class="per">B. Bostwick</span>, a land speculator from New <span class="loc">York City</span> <span class="date">three years later</span> in <span class="date">1835</span>. <span class="per">Bostwick</span> then sold portions of the land to <span class="per">H.I. Lawrence</span>, <span class="per">Townsend Harris</span>, and <span class="per">Francis Cochran</span>. These four created the village which they named after Edmond <span class="per">Bostwick</span>'s wife <span class="per">Charlotte</span>. <span class="per">Jonathan Searles</span> became the first postmaster on <span class="date">March 17, 1838</span>. <span class="per">Charlotte</span> was incorporated as a village on <span class="date">October 10, 1863</span>, and as a city on <span class="date">March 29, 1871</span>. At various times <span class="per">Charlotte</span> had the unofficial names of <span class="loc">Eaton Centre</span>, and <span class="loc">Carmel</span>. It was designated as the county seat when <span class="loc">Eaton County</span> was organized in <span class="date">1837</span>; however, due to a lack of population and buildings, county functions were conducted at <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> until <span class="date">1840</span>.</p><br><br>
