  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Horn is a municipality in the <span class="loc">district of Arbon</span> in the canton of Thurgau in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. Horn is an exclave of Thurgau, enclaved in the canton of St. Gallen. Horn is first mentioned in <span class="date">1155</span> as <span class="loc">Horna</span>. The <span class="loc">Kehlhof</span> in Horn was built in the 9th century, probably for the <span class="loc">Diocese of Constance</span>. In <span class="date">1463</span>, the <span class="per">Bishop of Constance</span> acquired the entire bailiwick of Horn. Until <span class="date">1798</span> the city was under the court at <span class="loc">Arbon</span>, where the Bishop held the high and low courts. The geographic and administrative municipalities were established in <span class="date">1816</span>, and in <span class="date">1870</span> merged into a combined municipality. Horn was in the <span class="loc">parish of Arbon</span>. In <span class="date">1877</span> a shared chapel was established. Then, in <span class="date">1911</span> the Catholic parish was established, followed by a <span class="loc">Reformed parish</span> in <span class="date">1920</span>. In the 19th century the local economy was dominated by fishing, weaving and handicrafts. In <span class="date">1824</span> a steamship company began providing regular service, which allowed the economy to grow. <span class="per">Bad Horn</span> in Horn was advertised as a spa and health resort. Towards the end of the 19th century cattle, dairy farming and fruit growing became common in the municipality. After the opening of the SBB line Romanshorn-Rorschach in <span class="date">1869</span>, the bleaching company, <span class="org">Radun AG</span> (<span class="date">1888</span>), and the oil and fat factory <span class="loc">Sais</span> (<span class="date">1916</span>â€“17), were established in Horn. By <span class="date">1920</span>, industrial companies displaced much of the agricultural sector. After <span class="org">Radun AG</span> closed the mill in <span class="date">1989</span> and the oil factory shut down in <span class="date">2000</span>, only <span class="org">Unisto AG</span> (later specializing in security seals, name badges and brand profiling) as well as Sabo Specialities, successor of <span class="loc">Sais</span>, continued to provide manufacturing jobs.</p><br><br>
