  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rosario</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [roˈsaɾjo]) is the largest city in the province of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>, in central <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. It is located 300 km (186 mi) northwest of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, on the western shore of the Paraná River. <span class="loc">Rosario</span> is the third most populous city in the country, and is also the most populous city in <span class="loc">Argentina</span> that is not a province capital. With a growing and important metropolitan area, Greater Rosario has an estimated population of 1,276,000 as of <span class="date">2012</span>. One of its main attractions includes the neoclassical architecture that has been retained over the <span class="date">centuries</span> in hundreds of residences, houses, and public buildings. <span class="loc">Rosario</span> is the head city of the <span class="org">Rosario Department</span> and is located at the heart of the major industrial corridor in <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. The city is a major railroad terminal and the shipping center for north-eastern <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. Ships reach the city via the Paraná River, which allows the existence of a 10-metre-deep (34 ft) port. The Port of <span class="loc">Rosario</span> is subject to silting and must be dredged periodically. Exports include wheat, flour, hay, linseed and other vegetable oils, corn, sugar, lumber, meat, hides, and wool. Manufactured goods include flour, sugar, meat products, and other foodstuffs. The Rosario-Victoria Bridge, opened in <span class="date">2004</span>, spans the Paraná River, connecting <span class="loc">Rosario</span> with the <span class="loc">city of Victoria</span>, across the Paraná Delta. Because it plays a critical role in agricultural commerce, the city finds itself at the center of a continuing debate over taxes levied on big-ticket agricultural goods such as soy.</p><br><br>
