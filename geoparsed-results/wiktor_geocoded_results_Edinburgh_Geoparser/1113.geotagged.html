<p><span class="loc">Chester</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,768 at the 2010 census. It was home to the now defunct Chester College (formerly White Pines College). From Statistics and Gazetteer of New-Hampshire, 1875: "Chester is considered one of the old towns of the state. In 1719, about eighty persons, chiefly from <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> and <span class="loc">Hampton</span>, formed an association, for the purpose of securing a tract of land in the "Chesnut Country" (so called) and stationed three men upon this tract, to hold possession until they should procure a lawful title. After considerable difficulty they obtained a grant of land, ten miles [16 km] square. Immediately the settlement was commenced by several persons from Rye and Hampton, among whom were Samuel Ingalls, Jonathan Goodhue, Jacob Sargent, Ebenezer Dearborn, Robert Smith, E. Colby and S. Robie, who contributed largely to the permanent success of the enterprise. On the 8th of May, 1722 the township which had hitherto been called <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>, was incorporated under its present name, and comprising an area of over 120 square miles [310 km2]."</p>
