  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Puente</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 39,816 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city lies approximately 20 miles east of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. The original inhabitants of the area <span class="date">now</span> occupied by the city of <span class="loc">La Puente</span> were the Tongva. They lived in a village called Awingna, which linguists translate as "abiding place." The Awingna chief <span class="per">Matheo</span> (who also held sway over several other nearby villages) was baptized at Mission <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> in <span class="date">1774</span>. In <span class="date">1769</span>, the Spanish Portol√† expedition became the first Europeans to see inland portions of Alta <span class="loc">California</span>. On <span class="date">July 30</span>, the party camped on the east side of the <span class="loc">San Gabriel River</span>, in <span class="date">today</span>'s unincorporated area of <span class="loc">Bassett</span>. Father <span class="per">Juan Crespi</span> wrote in his diary that, <span class="date">the next day</span>, they had to build a bridge (Spanish "puente") to cross the miry <span class="loc">San Gabriel River</span>. With the establishment of Mission <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span>, the area encompassing Awingna and what is <span class="date">now</span> the city of <span class="loc">La Puente</span> became part of <span class="loc">Rancho La Puente</span>, established as a mission outpost and ranch. The rancho was visited by the <span class="per">Jedediah Smith</span> party in <span class="date">November 1826</span>, the first Americans to travel overland to <span class="loc">California</span>.</p><br><br>
