  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Portland selectmen hire veteran lawyer. PORTLAND — The Board of Selectmen has hired a veteran attorney to represent the town’s interest in the ongoing debate over installation of a bulk propane storage facility. Two brothers are trying to win planning commission approval to install the facility on property they own off Gospel Lane. The proposal has generated considerable opposition from a number of near-neighbors of the proposed site and from other residents in town. <span class="date">Last week</span>, the selectmen agreed to allocate $4,500 to retain a professional engineer, who will assist the town’s fire marshal and fire chief in reviewing details of the proposal.</p><br><br>
