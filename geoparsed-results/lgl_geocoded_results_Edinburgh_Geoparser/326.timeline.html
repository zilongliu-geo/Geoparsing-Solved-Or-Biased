  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Culver pushing new rules on dependant adult abuse. Less than <span class="date">a month</span> after creating a task force to address dependent adult abuse, Gov. <span class="per">Chet Culver</span> is urging the legislature to begin making changes to strengthen and improve Iowa law. The governor received a series of initial legislative recommendations from the task force. Culver spoke about this issue <span class="date">today</span> at a meeting of the Dependent Care Task Force, where he was joined by Government Oversight Committee co-chairs Sen. <span class="per">Rich Olive</span>, D-<span class="loc">Story City</span> and Rep. Vicki <span class="per">Lensing, D</span>-<span class="loc">Iowa City</span>. “Over <span class="date">the past 30 years</span>, bureaucracy at every level of government failed these men,” said Culver. “We have a chance to rectify past mistakes by making the changes to our laws necessary to protect our most vulnerable Iowans and punish those who abuse them.” The task force was formed following allegations about the treatment and living conditions of men at Henry’s Turkey Service, a <span class="loc">Texas</span>-based company operating a bunkhouse in <span class="loc">Atalissa</span>.</p><br><br>
