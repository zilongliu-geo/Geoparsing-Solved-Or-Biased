  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Ham is a suburban district in south-west <span class="loc">London</span> which has meadows adjoining the <span class="loc">River Thames</span> where the Thames Path National Trail also runs. Most of Ham is in the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Richmond upon Thames</span> and, chiefly, within the <span class="loc">ward of Ham</span>, <span class="loc">Petersham</span> and <span class="loc">Richmond</span> Riverside; the rest is in the Royal Borough of <span class="loc">Kingston upon Thames</span>. The district has modest convenience shops and amenities, including a petrol station and several pubs, but its commerce is subsidiary to the nearby regional-level economic centre of <span class="loc">Kingston upon Thames</span>. Ham is centred 9.25 miles (14.89 km) south-west of the centre of <span class="loc">London</span>. Together with <span class="loc">Petersham</span>, Ham lies east of the bend in the river almost surrounding it on three sides, 1 mile (1.6 km) south of <span class="loc">Richmond</span> and 2 miles (3.2 km) north of <span class="loc">Kingston upon Thames</span>. Its elevation mostly ranges between 6m and 12m OD but reaches 20m in the foothill side-streets leading to <span class="loc">Richmond Park</span>. It has the Thames Path National Trail and is connected to <span class="loc">Teddington</span> by a large Lock Footbridge at <span class="loc">Teddington Lock</span>, and during the <span class="date">summer</span> <span class="date">months</span> Hammerton's Ferry a pedestrian ferry links it to Marble <span class="loc">Hill House</span>, <span class="loc">Twickenham</span>.</p><br><br>
