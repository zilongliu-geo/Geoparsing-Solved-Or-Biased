<p><span class="loc">San Fernando</span> is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Romblon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. The town of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> was established in 1636 as Visita de Cauit in what is today Barangay Azagra. It is one of two visitas in <span class="loc">Sibuyan Island</span>, the other being <span class="loc">Cajidiocan</span>. In 1744, Cajiodiocan was turned into a pueblo (town) which included Visita de Cauit. The first villages or barrios of Visita de Cauit were <span class="loc">Pag-alad</span>, <span class="loc">Cangumba</span>, <span class="loc">Mabolo</span> or <span class="loc">San Roque</span>, <span class="loc">Canjalon</span>, Espa√±a or Canago, <span class="loc">Agtiwa</span>, <span class="loc">Cangumon</span> and <span class="loc">Otod</span>. After <span class="loc">Romblon</span> was made a separate district in 1853, and the local government reorganization of 1855, 17 new pueblos were created including Visita de Cauit. On 3 February 1868, Pueblo de Cauit was renamed Pueblo de Azagra. One of Azagra's villages, Visita de <span class="loc">Pag-alad</span> was renamed Visita de <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> in 1882, in honor of Ferdinand Magellan. When civilian government was introduced to the province by the Americans on 16 March 1901, Azagra was one of 11 new municipalities created. However, by the end of the year, the seat of the municipality was transferred from <span class="loc">Azagra</span> to <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> village, thereby, changing the town's name.</p>
