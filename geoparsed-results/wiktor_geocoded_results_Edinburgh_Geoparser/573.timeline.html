  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Milton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Chittenden County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 10,352 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. According to local legend, the town was named for the English poet <span class="per">John Milton</span>, but the name most likely originated from <span class="per">William FitzWilliam</span>, 4th <span class="per">Earl FitzWilliam</span>, who held the title <span class="per">Viscount Milton</span>.

The town is home to the warehouse for Gardener's Supply and a manufacturing facility for Husky Injection Molding Systems. Auto racing oval Catamount Stadium was located in <span class="per">Milton</span> and many drivers, including <span class="per">Kevin Lepage</span>, raced here during their racing careers. <span class="per">Milton</span> was a filming location for some of the scenes in the <span class="org">Farrelly brothers</span> movie Me, Myself &amp; Irene starring <span class="per">Jim Carrey</span> and <span class="per">Ren√©e Zellweger</span>. <span class="per">Milton</span> was chartered by Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span> of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> on <span class="date">June 8, 1763</span>.

There were approximately 300 settlers living in <span class="per">Milton</span> by <span class="date">1795</span>.

In <span class="date">1878</span>, it was destroyed by a fire. Early settlers in <span class="per">Milton</span> made most of their income from lumber and potash until <span class="date">1840</span> when dairy became popular and butter and cheese were sold. Eventually, milk was also shipped to <span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">New York</span>.</p><br><br>
