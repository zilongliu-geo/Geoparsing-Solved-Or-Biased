<p><span class="loc">El Dorado</span> (/ˌɛldəˈreɪdoʊ/ EL-də-RAY-doh) is a city situated along the <span class="loc">Walnut River</span> in the central part of <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, located in south-central <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, in the Central <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 13,021. It is the county seat and most populous city of <span class="loc">Butler County</span>. <span class="loc">El Dorado</span> was laid out and platted in 1868. The name is of Spanish origin meaning "golden land". <span class="loc">El Dorado</span> was incorporated in 1870. In 1877, the <span class="loc">Florence</span>, <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company built a branch line from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>; in 1881 it was extended to <span class="loc">Douglass</span>, and later to <span class="loc">Arkansas City</span>. The line was leased and operated by the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway. The line from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">El Dorado</span> was abandoned in 1942. The original branch line connected <span class="loc">Florence</span>, <span class="loc">Burns</span>, <span class="loc">De Graff</span>, <span class="loc">El Dorado</span>, <span class="loc">Augusta</span>, <span class="loc">Douglass</span>, <span class="loc">Rock</span>, <span class="loc">Akron</span>, <span class="loc">Winfield</span>, and <span class="loc">Arkansas City</span>. In 1915, the <span class="loc">El Dorado</span> <span class="loc">Oil</span> Field was the first oil field that was found using science/geologic mapping, and part of the Mid-Continent oil province. By 1918, the <span class="loc">El Dorado</span> <span class="loc">Oil</span> Field was the largest single field producer in the <span class="loc">USA</span>, and was responsible for 12.8% of national oil production and 9% of the world production. It was deemed by some as "the oil field that won World War I".</p>
