  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Davis</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Garvin</span> and <span class="loc">Murray</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. The population was 2,683 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Davis</span> is named after <span class="per">Samuel H. Davis</span>, who moved to <span class="loc">Washita</span> in what was then Indian Territory in <span class="date">1887</span>. <span class="per">Davis</span> owned a dry goods store, which was four miles south of the current town of <span class="per">Davis</span>. <span class="per">Davis</span> submitted a petition for a <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> depot to be built near his store, and the petition was accepted. In <span class="date">1890</span>, he also successfully petitioned for a post office to be built. The post office was supposed to be named after <span class="per">Nelson Chigley</span> a Chickasaw Indian who owned the land on which the town was to be built. <span class="per">Chigley</span> was already an Indian Territory name, so it was named after <span class="per">Davis</span>. The town was established on <span class="date">November 16, 1898</span>. It is located twenty-three miles north of <span class="loc">Ardmore</span> and twenty-three miles south of <span class="loc">Pauls Valley</span>. By <span class="date">1900</span>, <span class="per">Davis</span> had fifty-seven businesses, two banks, ten doctors, three dentists, and three lawyers. Cotton farming was a common occupation in <span class="per">Davis</span>, which was in one of the best cotton producing sections in <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>.</p><br><br>
