  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Ever-popular '<span class="per">Mr Ice Cream</span>' dies aged 72. <span class="per">CAMBRIDGE</span>'S <span class="per">Mr Ice Cream</span>, <span class="per">Antonio Savino</span>, has died. <span class="per">Mr Savino</span>, who was 72, was a familiar, cheerful face on the city's streets for <span class="date">40 years</span>, selling ice cream from his van on <span class="loc">Chesterton</span> Road, along the Backs, and at <span class="org">Cherry</span> <span class="loc">Hinton Hall</span>. As he drove around, his van would chime the tune O Sole Mio, and his beaming smile will be remembered by thousands of people. He was born in the small village of <span class="loc">Flumeri</span> in southern <span class="loc">Italy</span> in <span class="date">1936</span>, and married the love of his life, Antonietta, in <span class="date">1958</span>. She had been living in <span class="loc">England</span> for <span class="date">four years</span>, and the couple were both employed as domestics for a wealthy family at <span class="loc">Kentford</span>, near Newmarket. Later they moved to <span class="per">Cambridge</span> and <span class="per">Mr</span> <span class="per">Savino</span> got a job at the <span class="org">Fitzwilliam Museum</span>, also working as a kitchen porter. Being a tailor by trade, he took in work making and repairing suits for the <span class="per">Cambridge</span> Italian community. In <span class="date">1967</span>, having saved enough money, he bought his first ice cream van and became one of the first vendors in <span class="per">Cambridge</span>. In the early <span class="date">days</span> his round would cover much of north <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, including <span class="loc">Arbury</span> and <span class="loc">Chesterton</span>, then during <span class="date">the 1980s</span> he was given a permit by the city council to have a fixed pitch at Garret Hostel Lane, along the Backs. A family spokeswoman said: "Locals and tourists will have lovely memories of his infectious warmth and charming personality. "He always seemed to have enough time to make his customers feel special, and a remarkable ability for remembering names as well as faces. "We would like to thank everyone who has sent kind messages and letters since his death in <span class="org">Addenbrooke's Hospital</span> <span class="date">a few days ago</span>." His funeral will take place on <span class="date">Wednesday</span> at 10am at the Church of Our Lady and The English Martyrs in Hills Road.</p><br><br>
