  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Long Beach is a city in <span class="loc">Pacific County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,392 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Long Beach began when <span class="per">Henry Harrison</span> Tinker bought a land claim from Charles E. Reed in <span class="date">1880</span>. He platted the town and called it "Tinkerville." Long Beach was officially incorporated on <span class="date">January 18, 1922</span>. From <span class="date">1889</span> to <span class="date">1930</span>, a narrow gauge railroad called the <span class="org">Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company</span> ran up the whole peninsula. The Long Beach depot was built between First and Second Streets on the east side of the track, which ran north along "B" Street. A major destination in Long Beach was Tinker's Hotel, later renamed the Long Beach Hotel, and built very close to the station. This was the second hotel built at the site by <span class="per">Henry Harrison</span> Tinker, the founder of Long Beach. Tinker's first hotel burned down in <span class="date">1894</span>. He built another one just a few feet to the east and south of the rail depot. The image in the gallery shows a crowd waiting for the train sometime between <span class="date">1901</span> and <span class="date">1907</span>. Just across the tracks (which doubled in this area) from Tinker's Hotel in Long Beach was the Portland Hotel. The Portland Hotel, owned by the Hanniman family featured an enormous round (and unique) turret-like structure. The Portland Hotel burned down on <span class="date">December 6, 1914</span>, and was not replaced. The Driftwood Hotel was another common Long Beach destination.</p><br><br>
