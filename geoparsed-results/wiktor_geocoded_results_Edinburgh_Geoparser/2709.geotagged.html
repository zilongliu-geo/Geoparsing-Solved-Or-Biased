<p><span class="loc">Tampa</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 112. In 1802, <span class="loc">Spain</span> returned most of the land to <span class="loc">France</span>. In 1803, most of the land for modern day <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was acquired by the <span class="loc">United States</span> from <span class="loc">France</span> as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. From the 1820s to the 1870s, one of the most significant land routes in the <span class="loc">United States</span> was the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail. It was located along the edge of what would become <span class="loc">Tampa</span>. Two <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail markers were located on the trail near <span class="loc">Tampa</span>. The trail was active across <span class="loc">Marion County</span> from 1821 to 1866. In 1854, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in 1861 <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In 1855, <span class="loc">Marion County</span> was established within the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory, which included the land for modern day <span class="loc">Tampa</span>. In 1887, the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Nebraska Railway built a main line from <span class="loc">Herington</span> through <span class="loc">Tampa</span> to <span class="loc">Pratt</span>. In 1888, this line was extended to Liberal. Later, it was extended to Tucumcari, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and <span class="loc">El Paso</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. It foreclosed in 1891 and taken over by <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and finally merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the "<span class="loc">Rock Island</span>".</p>
