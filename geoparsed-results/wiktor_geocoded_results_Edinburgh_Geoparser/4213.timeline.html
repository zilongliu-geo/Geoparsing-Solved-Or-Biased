  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Livermore</span> (local /ˈlivərmɔːr/) is a home rule-class city located at the confluence of the Green and Rough rivers in <span class="loc">McLean County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The population was 1,482 at the time of the <span class="date">year 2000</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census. It is included in the <span class="loc">Owensboro</span> metropolitan area. <span class="per">Livermore</span> is located at 37°29′28″N 87°8′7″W (37.490987, -87.135340). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2), all land. <span class="per">William Brown</span> founed the city in <span class="date">1837</span> as Brown's Landing, but the post office established <span class="date">the next year</span> took the name <span class="per">Livermore</span>. The origin is disputed: some historians trace it to an otherwise-unknown shopkeeper named <span class="per">James Livermore</span>, others to civil engineer <span class="per">Alonzo Livermore</span> who helped construct a dam across the <span class="loc">Green River</span> at <span class="loc">Rumsey</span>. The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly in <span class="date">1850</span>. <span class="per">Livermore</span> achieved national and international notoriety in the second decade of the 20th Century for a bizarre lynching. On <span class="date">April 20, 1911</span>, a black man named <span class="per">Will Porter</span> (or Potter) shot and wounded <span class="per">Frank Mitchell</span>, a white man, after a barroom argument. <span class="per">Sheriff V.P.</span> Stabler then arrested <span class="per">Porter</span>. After this, accounts vary. <span class="org">The New York Times</span> account holds that a local mob of fifty overwhelmed the sheriff, who had hid <span class="per">Porter</span> in the opera house basement to protect him. They then bound <span class="per">Porter</span>'s hands and feet, took him to the center stage, and shot him there. Another version reported by several Kentucky papers omitted the sheriff's concern and had <span class="per">Porter</span> taken from the jail to the opera house, where admission was charged to witness the hanging. Those in the gallery were permitted a single shot at <span class="per">Porter</span>; those in the orchestra seats were allowed to empty their guns.</p><br><br>
