<p>Campbell is a small town situated on the edge of the <span class="loc">Ghaap Plateau</span> in the Northern Cape province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It is located 48 km east of <span class="loc">Griquatown</span>. It was originally known as <span class="loc">Knovel</span> Valley and then <span class="loc">Groote Fontein</span>, but was renamed in honour of the Reverend John Campbell who visited the <span class="loc">Cape Colony</span> in 1813. The history of modern settlement of Campbell dates back to 1805 when a group of Griqua, including Captain Andries Waterboer, travelled with missionary Jan Matthys Kok from <span class="loc">Klaarwater</span> (now <span class="loc">Griquatown</span>) to the territory of the Tswana near the modern town of <span class="loc">Kuruman</span>. Encountering strong springs in a valley at the edge of the <span class="loc">Ghaap Plateau</span>, they gave the place the name of <span class="loc">Knovel</span> Valley, noting its potential for future crop cultivation. It was only in 1811 that the Reverend Lambert Jansz, accompanying the traveller William Burchell, revisited the place, taking possession of the springs, by now known as <span class="loc">Groote Fontein</span> (Great Fountain), in the name of the London Missionary Society. Before long the name of the place would be changed again: when the Reverend John Campbell, on a tour of inspection in 1813, reached the nascent village and asked its name, he was told it was Campbell.</p>
