  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Richland</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Navarro County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 291 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="loc">Richland</span> is located at 31°55′34″N 96°25′35″W (31.926052, -96.426350). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.1 square miles (2.8 km2), all land. <span class="loc">Richland</span>, at the junction of Interstate 45 and State Highway 14, on <span class="loc">Pisgah</span> Ridge twelve miles south of <span class="loc">Corsicana</span> in south central <span class="loc">Navarro County</span>, was first settled in the late 1840s. <span class="per">Asa Chambers</span> had established a store on the trail from <span class="loc">Corsicana</span> to <span class="org">Franklin</span> by <span class="date">1848</span>, when a post office, named Richland Crossing after nearby <span class="loc">Richland Creek</span>, opened in his store. The store, which moved and changed ownership several times, continued to form the nucleus of the community until the early 1870s. When the <span class="loc">Houston</span> and <span class="org">Texas Central Railway</span> was built through the area in <span class="date">1871</span>, the station on the <span class="loc">Pisgah</span> Ridge near the store was designated <span class="loc">Richland</span>, and a new community began to develop around the depot. A post office named <span class="loc">Richland</span> began operating in <span class="date">1878</span>, and by the mid-1890s the town had two steam gristmills and cotton gins, three general stores, a grocer, two blacksmiths, two saloons, a hardware store, a bank, and an estimated population of 150. The first school had begun operating around the time of the Civil War, and by <span class="date">1906</span> the town had a two-teacher school with an enrollment of seventy-five. <span class="loc">Richland</span> continued to prosper during <span class="date">the 1920s</span>, reaching a peak population of 750 in <span class="date">1929</span>. During <span class="date">the 1930s</span> its population began to decline, in part because of the Great Depression. By <span class="date">1950</span> the town had twelve businesses and a population of 369. The decline continued during <span class="date">the 1960s and 1970s</span>, and by <span class="date">1990</span> <span class="loc">Richland</span> had 244 residents and one business. The population reached 291 in <span class="date">2000</span>.</p><br><br>
