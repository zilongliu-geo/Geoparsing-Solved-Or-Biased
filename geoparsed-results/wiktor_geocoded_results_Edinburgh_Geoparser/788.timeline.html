  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bago</span>, officially <span class="loc">City of Bago</span>, is a second class city in the province of <span class="loc">Negros Occidental</span> in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, some 21 kilometres (13 mi) south of the provincial capital <span class="loc">Bacolod</span>. With a total of 163,045 people based on the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="loc">Bago City</span> comprises the 6.63% of the population of the entire <span class="loc">Province of Negros Occidental</span>. It sets a land area of 389 square kilometres, which is 5% of the entire <span class="loc">Negros Occidental</span> and 10% of the total land area of component cities. It is also tagged as the “<span class="org">Home of Historical</span> and Natural Treasures”, owing to its contribution in the colourful history of the province of <span class="loc">Negros Occidental</span> and country, and its beautiful scenery and abundance in flora and fauna making it a good eco-tourism destination as well as the “Boxing Capital of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>” title, owing to the great names it produced in boxing. The community was named after a large tree called “Bágo” under which a native prince <span class="per">Mapagic</span> died according to the writings of a Spanish historian, <span class="per">Diego de Povedano</span>. Another version, however, noted that the name came from the shrub, bago-bago that grew abundantly in the riverbanks. Around the 17th and 18th <span class="date">Centuries</span>, settlers from <span class="loc">Molo</span>, <span class="loc">Iloilo</span> formed a little village at the mouth of <span class="loc">Bago River</span>, presently a rich source of sand and gravel. The village grew into a large settlement prompting its elders to pass a petition for its conversion into a town or pueblo, which was granted in <span class="date">1800</span>.</p><br><br>
