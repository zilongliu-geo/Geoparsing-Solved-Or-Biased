  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> is the capital of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Sangamon County</span>. The city has a population of 116,250, as of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, making it the sixth most populated city in the state. It is the largest city in central <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. As of <span class="date">2013</span>, the city's population was estimated to have increased to 117,006, with just over 211,700 residents living in the <span class="loc">Springfield Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which includes <span class="loc">Sangamon County</span> and the adjacent <span class="loc">Menard County</span>. Present-day Springfield was first settled by European Americans in the late 1810s, around the time <span class="loc">Illinois</span> became a state. The most famous past resident is <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span>, who lived in <span class="loc">Springfield</span> from <span class="date">1837</span> until <span class="date">1861</span>, when he went to the White House as President. Major tourist attractions include a multitude of historic sites connected with <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span> including his presidential museum, his home from <span class="date">1837</span> to <span class="date">1861</span>, his tomb at Oak Ridge Cemetery, and the historical town of <span class="loc">New Salem</span>, within a short drive from the city. The city lies on a mostly flat plain that encompasses much of the surrounding countryside. Hilly terrain lies near the <span class="loc">Sangamon River</span>. Lake Springfield, a large artificial lake owned by the City Water, Light &amp; Power company (CWLP), supplies the city with recreation and drinking water. Weather is fairly typical for middle latitude locations, with hot summers and cold winters. Spring and <span class="date">summer</span> weather is like that of most midwestern cities; severe thunderstorms are common. Tornadoes hit the <span class="loc">Springfield</span> area in <span class="date">1957</span> and <span class="date">2006</span>.</p><br><br>
