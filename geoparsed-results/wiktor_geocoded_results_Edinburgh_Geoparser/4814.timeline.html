  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Goudi</span> (Greek: Γουδί until <span class="date">2006</span>; Γουδή since <span class="date">2006</span>) is a residential neighbourhood of <span class="loc">Athens</span>, <span class="loc">Greece</span>, on the eastern part of town and on the foothills of Mount Hymettus. Its name descends from the 19th century Goudi family, who owned a large estate in the area. It was home to a large army camp of the same name (where the Trial of the Six defendants were executed in <span class="date">1922</span>), three university hospitals (Laiko and two children's hospitals) and the main campuses for <span class="org">the Faculty of Medicine</span> and <span class="org">the Faculty of Dentistry</span>, of the <span class="org">Athens University School of Health Sciences</span>. The area's main square is <span class="loc">St. Thomas</span>' Square, with the church of <span class="loc">St. Thomas</span> in its middle. The Goudi army camp was decommissioned and turned into parkland and sports facilities, hosting the badminton and modern pentathlon venues for the <span class="date">2004</span> Olympic Games. During <span class="date">2012</span>, 'Goudi' became a catchcry during some political extremist rallies in <span class="loc">Greece</span>, with protesters chanting it to express their hostility to mainstream politicians who they perceived as traitors to the country during the <span class="org">Euro Crisis</span>, alleging that they deserved a similar fate as the Trial of the Six defendants.</p><br><br>
