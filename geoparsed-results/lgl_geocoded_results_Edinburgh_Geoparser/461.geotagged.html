<p>Woman is robbed behind <span class="loc">Berea</span> apartment complex. <span class="loc">Berea</span> police are searching for a suspect in a March 21 robbery, but have only a limited description to go on. Berea Police Department spokesman Capt. Ken Clark said the victim in the robbery outside an apartment complex in the 800 block of Candlewood Drive could provide only a partial description. “We don’t have much to go on,” Clark said. The woman described the man who shoved her to the ground and stole her purse as a tall, large male wearing a dark or gray hooded sweatshirt, Clark said. The man fled the scene as a passenger in a green car. Clark said the woman was outside smoking behind the complex when the suspect pushed her to the ground, causing cuts to her knees and hands. “That’s why we made it a robbery first (degree), because the statute says if someone’s injured,” Clark said. Walmart robberyA <span class="loc">Berea</span> man was charged with second-degree robbery and resisting arrest after fighting with Walmart employees and <span class="loc">Berea</span> police attempting to detain him for allegedly shoplifting from the store. Grant W. Graham, 27, of the 1000 block of Brooklyn Boulevard, was stopped by Walmart employees around 7 p.m. Sunday for allegedly attempting to take merchandise from the store. Clark said Graham was involved in an altercation with loss prevention specialists before fleeing, and then fought with officers who attempted to arrest him. Anyone with information about these crimes is asked to call the Berea Police Department at 986-8456. Brian Smith may be reached at bsmith@richmondregister.com or at 624-6694.</p>
