  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Jefferson</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Coos County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,107 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is home to parts of the White Mountain National Forest in the south and northeast and to two theme parks: Santa's Village and <span class="per">Fort Jefferson</span> Fun Park. There are also several private campgrounds, motels and inns. <span class="per">Jefferson</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Berlin</span>, NHâ€“VT <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. Colonial Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span> first made land grants in this area in <span class="date">1765</span>, but the location was so deep in unexplored territory that few settlers took up their claims. So soon after the French and <span class="org">Indian War</span>, in which certain Native American tribes in <span class="loc">New England</span> were allied with the French, English colonists did not want to be exposed on the frontier. <span class="per">Colonel Joseph Whipple</span> took a grant and cut trails through the forests to build a "manor" house. He named the town "<span class="per">Dartmouth</span>" after <span class="per">William Legge</span>, 2nd <span class="per">Earl of Dartmouth</span>, the patron of <span class="org">Dartmouth College</span>. <span class="org">Brother</span> to <span class="per">William Whipple</span>, a signer of <span class="org">the Declaration of Independence</span>, <span class="per">Colonel Whipple</span> renamed the town "<span class="per">Jefferson</span>" <span class="date">four years</span> prior to <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span>'s election as president. The state legislature granted the town a new charter as "<span class="per">Jefferson</span>" in <span class="date">1796</span>.</p><br><br>
