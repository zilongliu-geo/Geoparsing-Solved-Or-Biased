  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Francisco</span> is a third income class municipality on <span class="loc">Camotes Islands</span> in the <span class="loc">province of Cebu</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 47,357. In the <span class="date">2013</span> election, it had 26,624 registered voters. <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> consists primarily of <span class="loc">Pacijan Island</span> (also known as <span class="loc">Pajican</span> Island), as well as the tiny Tulang islet just north of Pacijan. Both islands are part of the <span class="loc">Camotes Islands</span> group in the <span class="loc">Camotes Sea</span> (that also includes <span class="loc">Poro Island</span> and <span class="loc">Ponson Island</span>). They are located east of the main island of <span class="loc">Cebu</span>, south and west of <span class="loc">Leyte</span> and north of <span class="loc">Bohol</span>. <span class="loc">Pacijan Island</span> is about 14.75 kilometres (9.17 mi) long and 8.5 kilometres (5.3 mi) wide. A 1,400-metre (1,500 yd) causeway crosses the mangrove swamp to connect Pacijan and <span class="loc">Poro Island</span>. It was constructed during the Spanish era, to bridge the islands for easier trading and attending services in Poro church. <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> comprises 15 barangays: Just before <span class="org">Typhoon</span> <span class="loc">Yolanda</span> struck in <span class="date">November 2013</span>, the mayor of <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> ordered the evacuation of all the residents (approximately 1,000) to the main island. This was credited with saving their lives as all houses on the island (about 500) were completely destroyed.</p><br><br>
