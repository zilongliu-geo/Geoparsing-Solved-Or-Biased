<p>Dr. Peter Piot, head of U.N. AIDS agency, told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a regional AIDS conference Sunday about the potential for an explosion in HIV and AIDS cases in the country of <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span>. He said the country is "the one that I would see that could have an African-type of epidemic" and that the danger of HIV and AIDS there "is really getting out of hand." He also said other Asia-Pacific nations like <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>, <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> and <span class="loc">Myanmar</span> are also worrisome as the number of infections there continue to rise.</p>
