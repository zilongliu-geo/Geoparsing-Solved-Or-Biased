<p>Grafton is a town in <span class="loc">Grafton County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,340 at the 2010 census. Originally granted in 1761, and re-granted in 1769, Grafton, like the county it resides in, takes its name from Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, a relative of colonial governor Benning Wentworth. Grafton was incorporated in 1778. Historically, Grafton's economic base consisted of subsistence farming, small-scale industry, and mining. Several mica mines and granite quarries once dotted the town's landscape, most notably Ruggles Mine. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 42.6 square miles (110.3 km2), of which 41.7 square miles (108.0 km2) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.3 km2) is water, comprising 2.19% of the town. The highest point in Grafton is the summit of <span class="loc">Melvin Mountain</span>, at 2,177 feet (664 m) above sea level. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> Pond is in the western part of town. Grafton lies mostly within the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span> watershed, though the western edge of town is in the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> watershed.</p>
