<p><span class="loc">Honghu</span> (Chinese: 洪湖; pinyin: Hónghú) is a county-level city in the municipal region of <span class="loc">Jingzhou</span>, in the south of <span class="loc">Hubei</span> province, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. The city lies on the northwest (left) bank of the <span class="loc">Yangtze River</span>, across from <span class="loc">Hunan Province</span> and <span class="loc">Xianning</span>, <span class="loc">Hubei</span>. It is named after the adjacent Hong Lake, which since ancient times has periodically flooded. The traditional Chinese holiday Duanwu Jie (端午节, Dragon Boat Festival), celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, features boat races which are run on Hong Lake. By means of its famous lake, <span class="loc">Honghu City</span> produces forty kinds of fish and an abundance of plants, such as lotus, reed and a type of black algae. As of 2000, <span class="loc">Honghu City</span> had a population of 335,618 or more people. <span class="loc">Honghu</span> is celebrated as an important supporter of the Communist side during last century's Chinese Civil War. Westerners know it for <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> communist Rewi Alley's relief work and Gung-ho (共合, <span class="loc">Gonghe</span>) co-operative movement. <span class="loc">Honghu</span> and other regions around its lake were part of an important communist stronghold called the Hunan-Western <span class="loc">Hubei</span> Revolutionary Base Area (湘鄂西革命根据地, Xiang-Exi Geming Genjudi, also called the Hunan-Western <span class="loc">Hubei</span> Soviet, 湘鄂西苏维埃, Xiang-Exi Suweiai). The Hunan-Western <span class="loc">Hubei</span> Soviet was actually a collection of several isolated bases linked together by underground and guerrilla activities. The <span class="loc">Honghu</span> Base, the largest, was itself the object of four Encirclement Campaigns, the last of which was strategised as one stage of the broadly successful Encirclement Campaign against Hunan-Western <span class="loc">Hubei</span> Soviet.</p>
