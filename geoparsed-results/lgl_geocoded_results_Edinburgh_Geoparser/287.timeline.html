  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Annual trivia bee raises $3,750 for literacy council. <span class="org">Florida State University</span> is not one of the original Southeastern Confernce members. The <span class="loc">Atlas Mountains</span> make up a mountain range that runs through western <span class="loc">Africa</span> in <span class="loc">Morocco</span>, <span class="loc">Tunisia</span> and Lybia. Placing fines, taxes and bail money in the middle of the board, and giving it to the first person to land on Free Parking is not an official Monopoly rule. <span class="per">Mary Travers</span> of the ’60s folk group, <span class="per">Peter, Paul</span> and <span class="per">Mary</span> was born and raised in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The <span class="org">University of the Kentucky</span> broke the color barrier in SEC football. Those were just a few of the bits of knowledge the 18 teams participating in the 11th annual <span class="org">Laurel County Adult Education</span> and Literacy Trivia Bee were asked in their quest to take home the really big trophy. When the smoke cleared, the <span class="org">HSBC</span> <span class="per">Juggernauts, Dale</span> Crandall, <span class="per">John Matthews</span> and <span class="per">Jason Jones</span>, took home first place. As they celebrated their victory with some of their fellow <span class="org">HSBC</span> employees, they admitted it was not all smooth sailing. “We had our lowest score with the SEC questions and we were fortunate with the Monopoly questions to make some good guesses,” <span class="per">Jones</span> said. The team vowed they will return in <span class="date">2010</span> to defend their title. <span class="per">Kathryn Hardeman</span>, executive director of <span class="org">Laurel County Adult Education</span> and Literacy, said the event raised $3,750 for the organization. “That money is used to pay for scholarships,” <span class="per">Hardeman</span> said. “Most of the grant money we receive is marked for specific projects. It’s nice to have some money you can use however you need it.” The team from <span class="per">St. Joseph</span> <span class="loc">London</span> finished second, followed by the team from First Christian Chruch in third. “We had really good participation,” <span class="per">Hardeman</span> said. “We are open to suggestions as we plan for next year.” The <span class="org">HSBC</span> <span class="per">Juggernauts, Dale</span> Crandall, <span class="per">John Matthew</span> and <span class="per">Jason Jones</span> are presented the trophy for winning the <span class="date">2009</span> trivia bee by <span class="per">Katherine Hardeman</span> and <span class="per">Tommy Weatherly</span> of <span class="org">Laurel County Adult Education</span> and Literacy.</p><br><br>
