The name was bestowed by Daniel Bradley Hulbert after his hometown, Madison, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. The townsite was laid out and named "Madison" in 1877 when the railroad, the <span class="loc">Vaca</span> Valley and Clear Lake Railroad, reached that spot, as the terminus, after expanding north from Winters.
