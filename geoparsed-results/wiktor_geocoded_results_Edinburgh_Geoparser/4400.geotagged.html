<p><span class="loc">Diu</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Diu district</span> in the union territory of <span class="loc">Daman</span> and <span class="loc">Diu</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Diu</span> lies at the eastern end of <span class="loc">Diu Island</span>, and is known for its fortress and old Portuguese Cathedral. It is also a fishing town. It is the tenth least populated <span class="loc">district of India</span>. <span class="loc">Diu</span> has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi's flagship Smart Cities Mission. The town and district were historically part of the <span class="loc">Saurashtra region</span> of <span class="loc">Gujarat</span> and an important port on trade routes of Arabian sea of <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span>. Due to its strategic importance, there was a Battle of <span class="loc">Diu</span> in 1509 between <span class="loc">Portugal</span> and a combined force of <span class="loc">Turkey</span>, <span class="loc">Egypt</span>, <span class="loc">Venice</span>, the Republic of <span class="loc">Ragusa</span> (now known as <span class="loc">Dubrovnik</span>) and the Sultan of <span class="loc">Gujarat</span>, Mahmud Begada. In 1513, the Portuguese tried to establish an outpost there, but negotiations were unsuccessful. There were failed attempts by <span class="loc">Diogo Lopes</span> de <span class="loc">Sequeira</span> in 1521, Nuno da Cunha in 1523. In 1531 the conquest attempted by D. Nuno da Cunha was also not successful.</p>
