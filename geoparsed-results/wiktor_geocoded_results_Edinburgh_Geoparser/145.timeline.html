  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> /ˈbjuːnə ˈvɪstə/ is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Willamette River</span>, and is the western landing for the <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> Ferry. It is approximately 6 miles south-southeast of Independence. <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> was named in about <span class="date">1850</span> by Reason B. Hall, who settled on a Donation Land Claim there in <span class="date">1847</span>. Some of Hall's relatives had participated in the Battle of <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> during the Mexican–American War. About the same time he named the community, Hall also started Halls Ferry across the <span class="loc">Willamette</span>. The ferry later became known as the <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> Ferry, which is still in operation <span class="date">today</span>. Later one of Hall's sons, B.F. Hall, operated another Halls Ferry north of Independence. <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> was once the home of a pottery factory that shipped its wares all over <span class="loc">Oregon</span> via the <span class="loc">Willamette River</span>. One of the earliest settlements in <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, it once had a much greater population because of the pottery industry, as well as being an important hops-growing area. <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> had saloons, a hotel, a school, a church, an I.O.O.F. hall and a store. The town later went into decline, especially because the railroad bypassed <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> and instead was routed through Independence. <span class="date">Today</span>, most of the principal buildings are gone and the community is considered a ghost town by authors of ghost town guidebooks, although local residents tend to disagree. <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> formerly had a post office by the same name. The post office ran from <span class="date">1866</span> to <span class="date">1935</span>.</p><br><br>
