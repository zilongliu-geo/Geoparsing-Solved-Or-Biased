<p>Concord is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, the Concord Village Historic District. The <span class="loc">United States</span> Geographic Names Information System classifies Concord as a populated place. It is located in western <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, east of <span class="loc">Farragut</span> and west of <span class="loc">Knoxville</span>. Mail destined for Concord is now addressed to <span class="loc">Knoxville</span> or <span class="loc">Farragut</span>. The Village of Concord began to develop in 1854. Before that time, the area was sparsely settled. Large farms were centered on the <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> River, and relied on a nearby settlement, Campbellâ€™s Station (modern <span class="loc">Farragut</span>), for trade and other urban needs. In 1853, construction of the <span class="loc">East Tennessee</span> and <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Railroad along the north bank of the <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> River caused a population and development shift to the area that became Concord. Concord was founded and platted in 1854 on land owned by James M. Rodgers. Mr. Rodgers laid out 55 lots, and gave the new town the name Concord. It is believed the name was inspired by the nearby Concord Cumberland Presbyterian Church, of which Rodgers was a member ("Concord" being a common name for churches at the time). He began to sell lots in 1855, but later moved to <span class="loc">California</span>. Shortly before he moved, he several large tracts of land, some which are still intact in some sections of the village.</p>
