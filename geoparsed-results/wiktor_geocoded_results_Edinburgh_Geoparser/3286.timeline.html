  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sulu</span> (Tausūg: سوگ, Sūg; <span class="loc">Chavacano</span>: Provincia de Sūlū; Filipino: Lalawigan ng <span class="loc">Sulu</span>) is an autonomous archipelago province in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, located in the Autonomous Region in Muslim <span class="loc">Mindanao</span> (ARMM). Its capital is <span class="loc">Jolo</span> and the primary/main island of the same name occupies the middle part of the group of islands in the <span class="loc">Sulu Archipelago</span>, between <span class="per">Basilan</span> and <span class="per">Tawi-Tawi</span>. The peaceful advent of <span class="loc">Islam</span> around <span class="date">1138</span> through merchants and traders had a distinct influence on Southeast <span class="loc">Asia</span>. The coming of Arabs, Persians and other Muslims paved the way for the arrival of religious missionaries, traders, scholars and travelers to <span class="loc">Sulu</span> and <span class="loc">Mindanao</span> in the 12th century. A landmark born of the social process was the founding of the Sultanate of <span class="loc">Sulu</span>. <span class="date">Year 1380</span> CE, Karim-ul Makhdum came to <span class="loc">Sulu</span> and introduced <span class="loc">Islam</span> to the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. <span class="date">Year 1450</span> CE, a Johore-born Arab adventurer, <span class="per">Sayyid Abubakar</span> Abirin came to <span class="loc">Sulu</span> and lived with Rajah Baguinda Ali, eventually marrying his daughter Dayang-dayang Paramisuli and eventually inheriting Rajah Baguinda's polity (which was a principality before) and turning it into a sultanate. <span class="per">Sayyid Abubakar</span> eventually inherited the rule of Rajah Baguinda, established the Sultanate of <span class="loc">Sulu</span> and became its first Sultan. To consolidate his rule, <span class="per">Sayyid Abubakar</span> united the local political units under the umbrella of the Sultanate. He brought <span class="loc">Sulu</span>, <span class="loc">Zamboanga Peninsula</span>, <span class="loc">Palawan</span> and <span class="loc">Basilan</span> under its aegis.</p><br><br>
