  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Riverton</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">King County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,407 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Riverton</span> was formerly part of the Riverton-Boulevard Park CDP, which was split up for the <span class="date">2010</span> census into <span class="per">Riverton</span> and <span class="per">Boulevard</span> Park. <span class="per">Riverton</span> also refers to a neighboring former community in part of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Tukwila</span> in the Duwamish River Valley. It was on the left bank of the Duwamish, not far from the location on the right bank of the present-day <span class="org">Tukwila Community Center</span>. <span class="per">Riverton</span> lent its name to an early 20th-century bridge, variously known as the <span class="per">Riverton</span> Draw Bridge, the <span class="per">Riverton</span> Drawspan, and <span class="loc">King County</span> Bridge 622-A.

A remnant of the central pier can still be seen in the river as of <span class="date">2009</span>, visible either from the riverbank or from the 119th St. S. pedestrian bridge or the <span class="loc">Allentown</span> Bridge. <span class="per">Riverton</span> is located at 47°29′41″N 122°18′40″W (47.494614, -122.311248).
