  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Victoria</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ellis County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 1,214. A group of English and Scottish colonists led by a <span class="loc">Scotsman</span> named <span class="per">George Grant</span> founded <span class="per">Victoria</span> in <span class="date">1873</span> on land he had purchased from the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Pacific Railway. They named the settlement after <span class="per">Queen Victoria</span>. <span class="per">Grant</span> intended for <span class="per">Victoria</span> to be a ranching community and was purportedly responsible for bringing the first Aberdeen Angus cattle to the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Most of the colonists, however, were remittance men more interested in sports and dancing than in raising livestock. Their families soon learned of this and reduced the remittances, driving most of the colonists to leave by <span class="date">1880</span>. Some returned to <span class="loc">Britain</span>; others left for <span class="loc">South America</span>. In <span class="date">1876</span>, Volga Germans from villages near <span class="loc">Saratov</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span> established the settlement of Herzog one half mile north of <span class="per">Victoria</span>. <span class="org">Herzog's Roman Catholic</span> settlers built a series of churches which culminated in the construction of St. <span class="org">Fidelis Catholic Church</span>, known as "<span class="org">The Cathedral of the Plains</span>," in <span class="date">1911</span>. <span class="loc">Herzog</span> grew rapidly and later absorbed <span class="per">Victoria</span>, eventually adopting the older settlement's name. <span class="loc">Herzog</span> was officially renamed <span class="per">Victoria</span> in <span class="date">1913</span>.</p><br><br>
