  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Canoa</span> is a town in the <span class="org">Canton</span> of <span class="loc">San Vicente</span> in the <span class="loc">Manabí Province</span> of <span class="loc">Ecuador</span>. <span class="loc">Canoa</span> is located north of Bahía de Caraquez, <span class="loc">Province of Manabí</span> – <span class="loc">Ecuador</span>. Local stories and tales say that the natives of <span class="loc">Canoa</span> hid deep in the hills when they saw invaders approaching, leaving the beautiful beach deserted. <span class="date">100 years later</span>, Jesuit priests arrived and along with Canoans, they celebrated the birth of yet another Spanish community. In its beginnings, <span class="loc">Canoa</span> was called Pantaguas o Pintagua. <span class="loc">Juan de Velasco</span>, a priest, was the first to include <span class="loc">Canoa</span> in a map of the old <span class="per">Reino de Quito</span> (Kingdom of <span class="per">Quito</span>). At the turn of the 20th century, the beach was officially recognized and became part of the Cantón Sucre (Bahía de Caraquez). <span class="loc">Canoa</span> was registered as part of the Cantón <span class="loc">San Vicente</span> at the end of the 20th century. There are two ways to cross the bay of <span class="loc">Bahia de Caraquez</span> to <span class="loc">Canoa</span>. You can take a ferry to cross the bay, or you can go across the bridge. Once you've crossed you can take a bus to the town or you can hire a bicycle carriage to take you there.</p><br><br>
