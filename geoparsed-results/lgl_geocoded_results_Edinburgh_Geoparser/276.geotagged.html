<p><span class="loc">London</span> can get to work . White believes the budgets may lay the foundation for establishing <span class="loc">London</span> as a "transportation gateway" which would see air cargo from <span class="loc">Europe</span> shipped across <span class="loc">North America</span> after landing in <span class="loc">London</span> after <span class="loc">Canada</span> and <span class="loc">Europe</span> recently agreed to an open skies agreement, a kind of free-trade deal for air cargo. "We have a natural asset here -- we have to turn it into something," White said of London's central geographic location, close to two <span class="loc">U.S.</span> states and <span class="loc">Toronto</span>. "It would give as another good area (to market the city). We have the university, life sciences, technology, logistics and manufacturing and we see this is a good match."</p>
