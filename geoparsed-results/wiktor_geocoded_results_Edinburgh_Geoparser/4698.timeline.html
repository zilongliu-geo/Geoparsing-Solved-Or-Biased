  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ballan</span> /bəˈlæn/ is a small town in the state of Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span> located on the <span class="loc">Werribee River</span>, 78 kilometres (48 mi) northwest of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Ballan</span> had a population of 2,774. It is the main administrative centre for the Shire of <span class="loc">Moorabool</span> local government area. During the Victorian Gold Rush, it became an important staging point for coaches travelling to the Ballarat goldfields. The area around <span class="loc">Ballan</span> was part of the tribal area of the Wautharong people, part of the Kulin nation. The area was rich in fauna, including kangaroo, kangaroo rats, bandicoots, dingos, and two species of native cat. Many species had vanished by the end of the 19th century, with European settlement. The first European settlers crossed <span class="loc">Bass Strait</span> landing near <span class="loc">Geelong</span> and worked their way up the <span class="loc">Moorabool River</span> with their sheep flocks. <span class="per">Robert von Steiglitz</span> first settled the area in <span class="date">1838</span>; he named the area after <span class="loc">Ballan</span> in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. Other early settler names included <span class="loc">Cowie</span>, <span class="loc">Stead</span>, <span class="loc">Wallace</span> and <span class="loc">Egerton</span>. There were clashes between indigenous Australians and white settlers during settlement. <span class="per">Robert von Steiglitz</span> stated in his journal</p><br><br>
