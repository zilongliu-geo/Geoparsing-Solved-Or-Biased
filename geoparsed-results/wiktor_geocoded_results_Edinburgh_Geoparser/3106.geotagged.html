<p>Cove is a city in <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 552 at the 2010 census. Euro-Americans first settled here in 1862, and in 1863 they established a post office named <span class="loc">Forest Cove</span>. Samuel G. French was the first postmaster. To avoid confusion between <span class="loc">Forest Cove</span> and another <span class="loc">Oregon</span> community, Forest Grove in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, post office authorities changed the name to Cove in 1868. Cove was platted in the 1870s along Ruckles Road, only the second road over the <span class="loc">Blue Mountains</span>. This area was well known to the <span class="loc">Cayuse</span> and <span class="loc">Nez</span> Perce Tribes who referred to it as Wiweeletitpe(wee-walla-tit-puh), meaning "Many creeks flowing at that place". Cove lies east of <span class="loc">La Grande</span> and north of Union along the eastern edge of the Grande Ronde Valley of northeastern <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. <span class="loc">Mill Creek</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Grande Ronde River</span>, flows west from the <span class="loc">Wallowa Mountains</span> through Cove. <span class="loc">Mount Fanny</span> rises to about 7,200 feet (2,200 m) about 3 miles (5 km) east of the city. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.77 square miles (1.99 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 237 passes through Cove.</p>
