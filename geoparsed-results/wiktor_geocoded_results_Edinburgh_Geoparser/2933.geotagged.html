<p>Garland is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. It is a large city northeast of Dallas and is a part of the Dallasâ€“Fort Worth metroplex, as well as a suburb of Dallas. It is located almost entirely within <span class="loc">Dallas County</span>, except a small portion located in Collin and Rockwall Counties. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 226,876, making it the 87th-most populous city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span> and the 12th-most populous city in the state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Garland is second only to the <span class="loc">City of Dallas</span> in <span class="loc">Dallas County</span> by population and has easy access to downtown Dallas via public transportation including two Dart Blue line stations and buses. Immigrants began arriving in the Peters colony area around 1850, but a community was not created until 1874. Two communities sprang up in the area: Embree, named for the physician K. H. Embree, and <span class="loc">Duck Creek</span>, named for the local creek of the same name. A rivalry between the two towns ensued as the area began to grow around the Santa Fe Railroad depot. Eventually, to settle a dispute regarding which town should have the local post office, <span class="loc">Dallas County</span> Judge Thomas A. Nash asked visiting Congressman Joe Abbott to move the post office between the two towns. The move was completed in 1887. The new location was named Garland after U.S. Attorney General Augustus Hill Garland. Soon after, the towns of <span class="loc">Embree</span> and <span class="loc">Duck Creek</span> were combined, and the three areas combined to form the <span class="loc">city of Garland</span>, which was incorporated in 1891. By 1904, the town had a population of 819 people.</p>
