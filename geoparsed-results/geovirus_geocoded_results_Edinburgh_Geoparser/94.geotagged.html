<p>With the <span class="loc">United States</span> flu season having started this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), The Weather Channel and Google's FluTrends websites report today low flu levels. All three sources say there are no, or minimal, reports of the flu in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, and <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. All three indicate <span class="loc">Alabama</span> has moderate flu levels. Google FluTrends indicates that at the same time last year, the flu level nationally was at moderate. During the early part of the month, there were some concerns about the quality of flu reporting as the CDC and other government supported flu tracking organizations were impacted by the <span class="loc">US</span> government shutdown. Some non-profits and private organizations provided their own data during this period to fill the information void. The CDC advises people to get a flu vaccine as the best means of avoiding getting the flu. Dr. Harry Leider, Chief Medical Officer for Walgreens, also is encouraging people to get the flu vaccine now before the flu becomes more widespread. For the 2013/2014 flu season in the <span class="loc">US</span>, there are two types of vaccines available. One provides immunization for two influenza A viruses and an influenza B virus â€” specifically, an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus; an A(H3N2) virus, similar for antigenic purposes to cell-propagated prototype virus A/Victoria/361/2011; and a virus similar to B/Massachusetts/2/2012. A second type of vaccine provides immunization for two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses.</p>
