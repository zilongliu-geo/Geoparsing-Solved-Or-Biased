<p><span class="loc">Chuka</span> is a town on the eastern slopes of <span class="loc">Mount Kenya</span>, in <span class="loc">Kenya</span> about 65 km south Of <span class="loc">Meru Town</span>. It falls within <span class="loc">Tharaka-Nithi County</span> and the former <span class="loc">Eastern Province</span>. Between 1992 and 2009, <span class="loc">Chuka</span> was the capital of <span class="loc">Meru</span> <span class="loc">South District</span> (split off from <span class="loc">Meru District</span>) but was later amalgamated into <span class="loc">Tharaka-Nithi County</span>. The people of the area are Gichuka speaking, a dialect of Kimeru language. <span class="loc">Chuka</span> Town is chiefly occupied by the <span class="loc">Chuka</span> people, one of the nine Meru dialect Speakers. They dwell on the south-eastern slopes of Mt. <span class="loc">Kenya</span>, and cover the area between the <span class="loc">Thuci</span> River in the south, and the <span class="loc">Nithi River</span> in the north. It is a common tradition with the <span class="loc">Chuka</span> that they have always been in the forests of Mt. <span class="loc">Kenya</span> hence they moved down to their present abode. Other versions of the <span class="loc">Chuka</span> migratory tradition say that they came out from <span class="loc">Mbwa</span> with the other <span class="loc">Meru</span>. The <span class="loc">Chuka</span> are believed to have sprung from the <span class="loc">Tharaka</span>, another of the meru subtribes. They have also a form of blood-brotherhood with the <span class="loc">Igembe</span> and the <span class="loc">Tigania</span> of the northern meru dialects. On the other hand, there are some customs, as, for instance, the method of circumcision, by which the <span class="loc">Chuka</span> are similar to the <span class="loc">Embu</span>. The <span class="loc">Chuka</span> are primarily <span class="loc">Meru</span> who, having climbed the first slopes of Mt. <span class="loc">Kenya</span>, clearing the forest for cultivation (even at present the fields of the <span class="loc">Chuka</span> are on the lower section of their country), mixed with the aboriginal inhabitants of the forest and established some kind of contact with the <span class="loc">Embu</span>. These aboriginal forest inhabitants seem to have been the <span class="loc">Gumba</span>, now only remembered by some traditions and described as very small people. It seems certain that they were a pygmy race. http://orvillejenkins.com/profiles/meru.html</p>
