<p>Eden is a town in <span class="loc">Lamoille County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,323 at the 2000 census. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 64.3 square miles (166.5 km2), of which 63.6 square miles (164.7 km2) is land and 0.7 square mile (1.8 km2) (1.10%) is water. 15.9 square miles are conserved land. The Babcock Nature Preserve, a geologically significant tract of land used by Johnson State College and students of other <span class="loc">Vermont</span> State Colleges is located in Eden. The preserve is used for teaching courses in geology, field biology, and field ornithology. <span class="loc">Eden Notch</span> is located in Eden on Route 100. The Essex-Orleans Senate district includes the town of Eden, as well as parts or all of <span class="loc">Essex</span>, <span class="loc">Orleans</span>, <span class="loc">Franklin</span> and <span class="loc">Lamoille</span> counties. It is represented in the <span class="loc">Vermont</span> Senate by Vincent Illuzzi (R) and Robert A. Starr (D). An asbestos mine on <span class="loc">Belvidere Mountain</span> which operated from 1936 to 1993 left an estimated 3,500,000 cubic yards (2,700,000 m3) of mill tailings. In 2008, the state warned residents of Eden and nearby towns that there was a "health risk" for people living within a 10 miles (16 km) radius of the mine. Aboveground mill tailings were estimated at 16,000,000 cubic yards (12,000,000 m3). In April 2009, the Vermont Department of Health released a revised study which found that all of the deaths related to the asbestos mine were caused by occupational exposure. The report also concluded that people living near the mines had no increased risk of asbestos-related illness vis-a-vis people living anywhere else in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>.</p>
