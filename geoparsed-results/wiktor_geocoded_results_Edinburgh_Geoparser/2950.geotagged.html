<p>Auburn is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Weld County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Auburn is five miles southeast of Downtown <span class="loc">Greeley</span>. In the 1960s Auburn was a farming community with no general stores and no post offices. Many of the families were first, second, and third generation immigrants with German-Russian, Mexican, and Swedish heritage. Families attended Baptist, Catholic, and Congregational churches in <span class="loc">Greeley</span>, <span class="loc">Gilcrest</span>, and <span class="loc">Platteville</span>. On December 14, 1961, Union Pacific's "<span class="loc">City of Denver</span>" passenger train collided with a school bus, killing twenty children who were on board. Sixteen children and the driver survived. The crash was the deadliest traffic accident in <span class="loc">Colorado</span> history. Auburn is within <span class="loc">Weld County</span> School District Six. As of 2008 residents are zoned to Bella Romero Elementary School in an unincorporated area, Heath Middle School in <span class="loc">Greeley</span>, and <span class="loc">Greeley West High</span> School in <span class="loc">Greeley</span>. For many years Auburn had a school district and a school. A legislative study posted by the mid-1950s recommended reorganizing <span class="loc">Colorado</span>'s school districts and declared school district reorganization as the state's main priority. Between 1956 and 1961 nearly 700 school districts closed, leaving 275 open. As a consequence, many small schools in <span class="loc">Colorado</span> began to close as a result of the district closures. The Auburn School District and the three-room school in Auburn closed, causing children to attend schools in <span class="loc">Greeley</span> beginning in 1961. During that year children were assigned to Delta Elementary School, Meeker Junior High School, and Greeley High School. Delta Elementary School no longer exists.</p>
