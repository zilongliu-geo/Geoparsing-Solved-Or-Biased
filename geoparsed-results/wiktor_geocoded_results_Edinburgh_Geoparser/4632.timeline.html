The population of the city is around 200,000. The local economy is supported by a mix of agricultural and industrial enterprises. It is famous for one of the largest markets in <span class="loc">South Korea</span>, <span class="loc">Osan Market</span>, which has been in continuous operation since <span class="date">1792</span>. The city was the scene of brutal battles with communist forces during the <span class="org">Korean War</span> in <span class="date">1950</span> (see Battle of <span class="loc">Osan</span>), before being liberated by American forces soon afterwards; there is a statue dedicated to <span class="org">UN</span> forces on the outskirts of the city. The United States Air Force base named after the city, <span class="loc">Osan</span> <span class="loc">AB</span>, is not actually located in the city, but is instead 8 km (5 mi) south, in the Songtan section (formerly a separate city) of Pyeongtaek. <span class="loc">Osan</span> Station is a large subway station located in the heart of <span class="loc">Osan</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Seoul</span> Subway Line 1 and the KTX. There is a bus terminal next to the subway station and many buses stop in front of the subway station.</p><br><br>
