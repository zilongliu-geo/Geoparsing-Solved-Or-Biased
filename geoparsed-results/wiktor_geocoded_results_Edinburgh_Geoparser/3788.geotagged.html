<p><span class="loc">Johnstown</span> is a community in the United Counties of <span class="loc">Leeds</span> and <span class="loc">Grenville</span>, in <span class="loc">eastern Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, part of the township of Edwardsburgh/Cardinal. It is located at the Canadian terminus of the Ogdensburg–Prescott International Bridge and at the southern terminus of Highway 416 and Highway 16. In 1673, the French settlers, along with the allied Natives, built a storehouse in modern-day <span class="loc">Johnstown</span>. It was situated on the shores of Old <span class="loc">Breeches</span> River, now called <span class="loc">Johnstown</span> Creek. The storehouse was used to hold supplies headed upriver to fur trading posts such as Fort Frontenac (Now, Kingston). It was in use until 1758. Fort de Lévis was a French fort which was located on Chimney Island (Formerly known as <span class="loc">Isle Royale</span>), in the St. <span class="loc">Lawrence River</span> just off of the shores of <span class="loc">Johnstown</span>. It was built in 1760 in preparation for a British attack, as an attempt to block their advance down river. The original design, created by Francis de Gaston, Chevalier de Levis intended for the fort to be built with stone walls, have 200 guns, and house 2,500 troops. In contrast, the fort was small and made of wood, with five cannons and about 200 soldiers. In the same year it was built, the fort was captured by the British in the Battle of the <span class="loc">Thousand Islands</span>.</p>
