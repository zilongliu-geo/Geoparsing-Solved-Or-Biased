<p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> in the area known as the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Delta, that extends west of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. As of the 2010 census, the population was 77,435. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat and largest city is <span class="loc">Pine Bluff</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>'s 21st county, formed on November 2, 1829, from portions of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> and <span class="loc">Pulaski</span> counties, and named for Thomas Jefferson, third President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Pine Bluff</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county is bisected by the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River, which was critical to its development and long the chief transportation byway. The area that would later become <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was occupied by the <span class="loc">Quapaw</span> when French explorers established the Arkansas Post in the 17th century; the foreigners claimed this area as <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, part of New <span class="loc">France</span>. In March 1819, Robert Crittenden was appointed secretary of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Territory. That same year, Joseph Bonne, traveling upstream on the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River from Arkansas Post, built a cabin on a “high bluff covered with pine trees” on the river’s south bank. Several years later, James Scull, also from Arkansas Post, established a tavern and small inn on the river's north bank, across from what would become the site of <span class="loc">Pine Bluff</span>.</p>
