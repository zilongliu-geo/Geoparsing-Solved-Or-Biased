<p><span class="loc">Bradford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Orange County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,797 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Bradford</span> is located on the county's eastern border, bordering both the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, and is a commercial center for some of its surrounding towns. The first settler was John Hosmer in 1765. Originally called Waits Town or <span class="loc">Waits River</span> Town after Joseph Wait, it was changed to <span class="loc">Mooretown</span> when 3,000 acres (1200 hectares) were granted on May 3, 1770 by <span class="loc">New York</span> patent to Sir Henry Moore, 1st Baronet, who in turn conveyed them to 30 settlers. The remainder of the land was appropriated by squatters. In 1788, the name was changed by the Vermont General Assembly to <span class="loc">Bradford</span>. Although the chief occupation of the town was farming, mills developed at falls on the <span class="loc">Waits River</span>. On October 10, 1848, the <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> &amp; Passumpsic Rivers Railroad formally opened to <span class="loc">Bradford</span>. By 1859, when the town's population was 1,723, industries included a foundry and machine shop, two gristmills, three sawmills, a paper mill and whetstone factory. <span class="loc">Bradford</span> also manufactured farm implements, wooden ware and tinware.</p>
