  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hamilton</span> is the capital of the British Overseas Territory of <span class="loc">Bermuda</span>. It is the territory's financial centre and a major port and tourist destination. Its population of 1,010 (<span class="date">2010</span>) is one of the smallest of any capital city. The history of <span class="per">Hamilton</span> as a British city began in <span class="date">1790</span> when the Bermuda Government set aside 145 acres (59 ha) for its future seat, and was officially incorporated in <span class="date">1793</span> by an <span class="org">Act of Parliament</span> and named for Governor <span class="per">Henry Hamilton</span>. The Colony's capital relocated to <span class="per">Hamilton</span> from <span class="loc">St. George</span>'s in <span class="date">1815</span>. The City has been at the political and military heart of <span class="loc">Bermuda</span> ever since. Government buildings include the parliament, Government House to the north, the former Admiralty House of the Royal Navy to the west (both in <span class="loc">Pembroke</span>), and the British Army garrison headquarters at Prospect Camp to its east. The Town of <span class="per">Hamilton</span> became a City in <span class="date">1897</span>, ahead of the consecration in <span class="date">1911</span> of the Cathedral of the Most <span class="loc">Holy Trinity</span> (Church Of <span class="loc">England</span>), which was under construction at the time. A Catholic cathedral, St. Theresa's, was later constructed. <span class="date">Today</span>, the city overlooking <span class="loc">Hamilton Harbour</span> is primarily a business district, with few structures other than office buildings and shops. The <span class="loc">City of Hamilton</span> has long maintained a building height and view limit, which states that no buildings may obscure the Cathedral. In the 21st century, buildings have been planned and some are under construction that are as high as 10 stories in this area. Bermuda's local newspaper, The Royal Gazette, reports "If you don't recognise the city, from <span class="date">15 years ago</span>, we don't blame you as it has changed so much".</p><br><br>
