  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Oxford County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,110 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is home to the Oxford Plains Speedway, the annual <span class="loc">Oxford County</span> Fair, and Oxford Casino. The town includes the village of <span class="loc">Welchville</span>. The land was part of Shepardsfield Plantation (also called Bog Brook Plantation), granted on <span class="date">March 8, 1777</span> by the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> to <span class="per">Alexander Shepard</span>, Jr. of <span class="loc">Newton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. On <span class="date">March 6, 1792</span>, the plantation was incorporated as <span class="loc">Hebron</span>, with <span class="loc">Oxford</span> its southwesterly portion. First settled in <span class="date">1794</span>, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was set off and incorporated on <span class="date">February 27, 1829</span>. It annexed land from <span class="loc">Otisfield</span> in <span class="date">1830</span>, and <span class="loc">Paris</span> in <span class="date">1838</span>. The town was named after <span class="loc">Oxford</span>, in <span class="loc">England</span>. Farmers grew mostly hay, and the town became noted for cattle. Mills were established at 2 water power sites; these developed in the 19th-century into principal villages within the town, especially after the arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway in the 1850s. <span class="loc">Welchville</span> was located on the <span class="loc">Little Androscoggin River</span>, where the woolen textile mill of the <span class="org">Harper Manufacturing Company</span> was established. At the outlet of <span class="loc">Thompson Lake</span> was <span class="loc">Oxford</span> village, first called <span class="per">Craigie</span>'s Mill for the sawmill and gristmill built by <span class="per">Andrew Craigie</span>, a Boston apothecary and land speculator. This was also the site of a grisly murder that, to <span class="date">this day</span>, goes unsolved. Here were erected a barrel stave mill, a shovel handle factory, and the woolen textile mills of the <span class="org">Robinson Manufacturing Company</span>. The railroad brought seasonal tourists to <span class="loc">Thompson Lake</span>, where inns and hotels opened. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a recreational area with fine architecture remaining from its prosperous mill town past. The Congregational Church, built in <span class="date">1842</span>â€“<span class="date">1843</span>, is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>.</p><br><br>
