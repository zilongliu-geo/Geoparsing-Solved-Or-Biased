<p>Franklin is a town in <span class="loc">Pendleton County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 721 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Pendleton County</span>. Franklin was established in 1794 and named for Francis Evick, an early settler. The Town of Franklin is situated in the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> Mountains on the eastern edge of the Monongahela National Forest and along the South Branch of the <span class="loc">Potomac River</span>. This region was populated by Native American cultures for centuries prior to the arrival of English immigrants in the mid-18th century. During the French and Indian War, conflict between the early settlers and Native American populations included two battles at frontier fortifications at <span class="loc">Upper Tract</span> and <span class="loc">Fort Seybert</span> in 1758, both ten miles distant from the future location of Franklin. The land on which Franklin was laid out was first patented by brothers Francis and George Evick in 1769. <span class="loc">Pendleton County</span> was divided from parts of August, Hardy, and <span class="loc">Rockingham Counties</span> (Virginia) by an act of the Virginia General Assembly in 1787. The earliest court sessions in the new county were held at the home of Captain Zeruiah Stratton near the present-day village of Ruddle until Francis Evick offered a part of his land to become a county seat around 1789. Additional lots were divided off of Evick's land to form the new town. On December 19, 1794, the Virginia General Assembly chartered the town of Franklin and recognized it as the seat of <span class="loc">Pendleton County</span>. Franklin grew steadily over the first half of the 19th century, becoming a local center of commerce and industry. In 1834, there were two stores, two tanneries, three saddlers, two carpenters, two shoemakers, two blacksmiths, one gunsmith, one tailor, one hat-maker, and one cabinet-maker listed among the town's residents.</p>
