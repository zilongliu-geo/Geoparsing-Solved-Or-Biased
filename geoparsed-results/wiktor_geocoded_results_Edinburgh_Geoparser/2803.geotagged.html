<p><span class="loc">Newcastle</span> is a small town in <span class="loc">County Down</span>, <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>. It had a population of 7,444 in the 2001 Census. The seaside resort lies on the <span class="loc">Irish Sea</span> coast at the base of <span class="loc">Slieve Donard</span>, one of the <span class="loc">Mourne Mountains</span>, and is known for its sandy beach and the <span class="loc">Royal County</span> Down Golf Club. The town lies within the Down District Council area. The town aims to promote itself as the "activity resort" for <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span> and its most special attribute is its location at the foot of <span class="loc">Slieve Donard</span>. The town has benefited from a multi million upgrade which makes it a high quality seaside attraction. The town is twinned with <span class="loc">New Ross</span>, <span class="loc">County Wexford</span>, in the <span class="loc">Republic of Ireland</span>. The name of the town is thought to derive from the castle built by Felix Magennis of the Magennis clan in 1588, which stood at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Shimna</span> River. This castle was demolished in 1830. The town is referred to as New Castle in the Annals of the Four Masters in 1433 so it is likely that he built on the site of an existing structure.</p>
