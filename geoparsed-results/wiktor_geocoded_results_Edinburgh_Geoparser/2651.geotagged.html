<p>Douglas is a community on <span class="loc">Douglas Island</span> in southeastern <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, directly across the Gastineau Channel from downtown <span class="loc">Juneau</span>. Today, Douglas is a residential community on <span class="loc">Douglas Island</span> and the only traditional school left on Douglas is Gastineau Elementary, which serves all the <span class="loc">Douglas Island</span> elementary aged students. The Douglas Public Library is part of the Capital City Libraries, and a couple restaurants and bars exist (The Island Pub, Louie's Douglas Inn, and The Douglas Café). The town’s population dropped over the years, but recently is up to about 3000 people, or close to 10 percent of the City and <span class="loc">Borough of Juneau</span>’s population. Douglas gets its water and electricity from <span class="loc">Juneau</span> and has a mix of onsite and municipal (diverted to <span class="loc">Juneau</span>) wastewater treatment. The Alaska Department of Corrections has its headquarters in Douglas. <span class="loc">Douglas Island</span> was originally a border of the Auke people’s and Taku people’s territory. It was not usually used for year-round settlement, but as a place to spend the summer, or at times a place for battles. Some historical reports indicate an early settler to the area may be credited for the naming of <span class="loc">Douglas Island</span>.</p>
