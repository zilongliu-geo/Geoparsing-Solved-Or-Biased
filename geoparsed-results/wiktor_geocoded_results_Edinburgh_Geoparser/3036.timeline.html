  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Glasgow</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Valley County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, with an estimated population of 3,380 as of <span class="date">2014</span>. American Indians inhabited the region for <span class="date">centuries</span>, and extensive buffalo and pronghorn antelope herds provided ample food for the nomadic tribes. The <span class="loc">Nakoda</span>, <span class="loc">Lakota</span>, and Dakota peoples alternately inhabited and claimed the region from the 16th to the late 19th <span class="date">centuries</span>. In <span class="date">1804</span> the <span class="per">Lewis</span> and <span class="per">Clark</span> expedition came within 15 miles (24 km) of <span class="date">the future</span> site of <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> and noted the extensive herds of buffalo and various game. In <span class="date">1851</span>, the <span class="loc">US</span> government formed the first treaty with the Native American tribes, in <span class="date">1885</span> the tribes engaged in the last known buffalo hunt in the region, and in <span class="date">1887</span>, a treaty was signed where the tribes surrendered 17,500,000 acres (7,100,000 ha), which led from <span class="date">1888</span> to the formation of the <span class="loc">Fort Peck Indian Reservation</span> and the removal of the tribes from the <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> area. <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> was founded in <span class="date">1887</span> as a railroad town by <span class="per">James J. Hill</span>, who was responsible for creating many communities along the Hi-Line. The town was named after <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> in <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> grew during <span class="date">the 1930s</span> when President <span class="per">Franklin D. Roosevelt</span> authorized the construction of the Fort Peck Dam, which became a major source of employment for the <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> area.</p><br><br>
