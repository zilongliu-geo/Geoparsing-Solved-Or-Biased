<p>Wellington is a town in the unitary authority of Telford and Wrekin and ceremonial <span class="loc">county of Shropshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> and now forms part of the new town of Telford, with which it has gradually become contiguous. The total town population of Wellington was 25,554 in 2011 making it by far the largest of the borough towns and the third largest town in <span class="loc">Shropshire</span> when counted independently from Telford. However the town centre serves a greater area of approximately 60,000. Its name is most likely derived from that of a Saxon settler - Weola - whose farmstead would have been located somewhere in the centre of town, possibly near The Green. A church has stood near that site for almost 1000 years and a priest is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The original churchyard still remains. A new church, designed by George Steuart, was built in 1789. Wellington's first market charter was granted to Giles of <span class="loc">Erdington</span>, lord of the manor, and is dated 1244 (See citation in external links) and a market still exists today. The market had an open-sided market hall by 1680 - and possibly much earlier - but this was dismantled c.1805 (See Citation in external links). In 1841, a market company formed to purchase the market rights from Lord Forester in 1856. Several years later in 1848, the company built a town hall with the butter market below, creating a permanent covered home for traders.</p>
