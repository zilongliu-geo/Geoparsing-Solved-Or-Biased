Its former name was <span class="loc">Sabang</span>, which is the river that runs through it. The majority of Buenavistans trace their ancestry to the Don Cornelio Sadiua family. In 1942, the Japanese Imperial forces landed in <span class="loc">Buenavista</span> at <span class="loc">Patay Ilog</span> before making their way to the capital. Due to its rugged terrain, relative isolation, and fierce pro-American sentiment, <span class="loc">Buenavista</span> was the headquarters for the resistance movement. Japanese forces and the Resistance and guerrillas frequently engaged in skirmishes within the town borders. Occupying Japanese forces burned the school and municipal building, after holding captives composed a member from each Buenavista family. Guerrilla forces eventually re-captured the town.</p>
