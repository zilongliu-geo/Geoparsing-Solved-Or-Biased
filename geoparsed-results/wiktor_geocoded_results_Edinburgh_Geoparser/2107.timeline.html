  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salo</span> (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈsɑlo]) is a town and municipality of <span class="loc">Finland</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">province of Western Finland</span> and is part of the <span class="loc">Southwest Finland region</span>. The municipality has a population of 54,243 (<span class="date">June 30, 2015</span>) and covers an area of 2,168.27 square kilometres (837.17 sq mi) of which 181.78 km2 (70.19 sq mi) is water. The population density is 27.31/km2 (70.7/sq mi). <span class="loc">Salo</span> is located between the capital <span class="loc">Helsinki</span> and the provincial capital <span class="loc">Turku</span>, making it a busy small city. The short distance from these bigger cities keeps the <span class="loc">Salo region</span> and its business life growing. Farming also plays a considerable part in the area. <span class="date">Today</span> its main claim to notability is as a developing and manufacturing plant for <span class="org">Nokia</span>, and can therefore be considered as the original home town of <span class="org">Nokia</span> phones. <span class="org">Nokia</span> also is one of biggest employers in this region. In Finnish salo means woodland, backwoods but also a wooded island. It is thought that <span class="loc">Salo</span> has meant the island that over thousand <span class="date">years</span> ago existed to the south of the current town but is <span class="date">today</span> a hill, not even very close to the sea.</p><br><br>
