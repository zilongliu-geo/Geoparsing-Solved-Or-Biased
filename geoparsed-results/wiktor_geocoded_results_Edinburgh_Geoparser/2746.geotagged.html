<p><span class="loc">Perth</span> /ˈpɜːrθ/ is a town in <span class="loc">Eastern Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Tay River</span>, 83 kilometres (52 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">Ottawa</span>, and is the seat of <span class="loc">Lanark County</span>. The town was established as a military settlement in 1816, shortly after the War of 1812. Many of the first settlers were military veterans on half pay, while others were military veterans from <span class="loc">France</span>, <span class="loc">Germany</span>, <span class="loc">Poland</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span> or <span class="loc">Ireland</span> who were offered land in return for their service. The Rev. William Bell, who arrived in June 1817, noted in his diaries that the settlement was more European than the Scottish settlement described to him. A wave of Scottish and Irish immigrants quickly followed. Many of the Scottish immigrants were stonemasons; their work can be seen in many area buildings and in the locks of the <span class="loc">Rideau Canal</span>. The first secretary/stores-keeper (and eventually postmaster and superintendent) of the settlement was Daniel Daverne, brought up from the Quarter Masters General Department in <span class="loc">Kingston</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span> to assume these positions. <span class="loc">Perth</span> is home to <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s oldest pioneer burial ground, St. Paul's United Church Cemetery, formerly The <span class="loc">Old Methodist Burying Ground</span>. This cemetery is at the south-east end of the Last Duel Park on Robinson Street. The Craig Street Cemetery, sometimes referred to as the "<span class="loc">Old Burying Grounds</span>" also contains many historic graves and saw use from 1820–1873.</p>
