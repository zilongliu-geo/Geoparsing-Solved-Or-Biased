<p><span class="loc">Hanover</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">York County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, 19 miles (31 km) southwest of <span class="loc">York</span> and 54 miles (87 km) north-northwest of <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and is 5 miles (8.0 km) north of the Mason-Dixon line. The town is situated in a productive agricultural region. The population was 15,289 at the 2010 census. The borough is served by the 717 area code and the Zip Codes of 17331-34. <span class="loc">Hanover</span> is named after the German <span class="loc">city of Hannover</span>. In 1727, John Digges, an Irish nobleman of Prince George's County, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, obtained a grant of 10,000 acres (40 km2) of land where <span class="loc">Hanover</span> is now located from Charles Calvert, the fourth Lord Baltimore. The area was called Digges Choice, and in 1730, a group of Catholics started the settlement that became known as the <span class="loc">Conewego</span> Settlement. Settlers from both <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> began moving into the area in the 1730s. At this time, the northern border of <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and the southern border of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> did not agree with each other, and the area that is now <span class="loc">Hanover</span> was in the disputed area claimed by both states. This led to numerous disputes about property ownership from the 1730s until 1760. The dispute was settled when <span class="loc">Maryland</span> and <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> hired British experts Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon to survey what became known as the Masonâ€“Dixon Line. This line was surveyed between 1763 and 1767, and put an end to decades of disputes over rights and ownership.</p>
