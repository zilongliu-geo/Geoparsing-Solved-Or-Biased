  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>More rain on the way <span class="date">Tuesday night</span>. <span class="date">A day</span> after the state’s climatologist declared the drought officially over in most of north <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, the first of two more rain-making weather systems pushed toward metro <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> <span class="date">early Tuesday</span>. The National <span class="per">Weather Service</span> said a frontal system will likely produce an inch of rain across north <span class="loc">Georgia</span> <span class="date">late Tuesday</span> into <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, with as much as 3 to 4 inches of rain possible across central and southern parts of the state. The rain should taper off <span class="date">Wednesday night</span>, with another cold front arriving <span class="date">late Thursday</span>, forecasters said. That system “also seems to be a good precipitiation producer, with another 1 to 2 inches expected,” the Weather Service said. On <span class="date">Monday</span>, state climatologist <span class="per">David Stooksbury</span> said that an usually wet <span class="date">March</span> “has brought major drought relief to North <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. Except for the <span class="loc">Lake Lanier</span> and <span class="loc">Lake Hartwell</span> basins, “the remainder of north <span class="loc">Georgia</span> is drought-free,” <span class="per">Stooksbury</span> said. The Weather Service has recorded 7.12 inches of rain so far <span class="date">this month</span> at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, a surplus of 1.89 inches. For the year, the city’s official rain gauge has tallied 13.70 inches of rain, only 1.24 inches below normal. The forecast for metro <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> calls for mostly cloudy skies, with a 40 percent chance of showers and highs in the low 60s <span class="date">Tuesday afternoon</span>. The chance of rain jumps to 100 percent overnight, before falling back to 30 percent on <span class="date">Wednesday</span>. Lows <span class="date">Tuesday night</span> will be in the low 50s, followed by highs <span class="date">Wednesday</span> in the upper 60s. <span class="date">Thursday</span> will begin mostly sunny, with a 40 percent chance of shower and thunderstorms during the afternoon, when highs will be in the mid-70s, the Weather Service said. A 90 percent chance of rain is predicted for <span class="date">Thursday night</span>, along with lows around 50 degrees. Partly sunny skies, highs in the upper 60s and a 20 percent chance of showers are forecast for <span class="date">Friday</span>. <span class="date">The first part of the weekend</span> should be nice, with mostly sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-70s on <span class="date">Saturday</span>, followed by a 40 percent chance of rain on <span class="date">Sunday</span>.</p><br><br>
