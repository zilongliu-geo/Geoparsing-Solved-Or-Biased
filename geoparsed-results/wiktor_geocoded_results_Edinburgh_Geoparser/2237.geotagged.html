<p>Mocha or <span class="loc">Mokha</span> (Arabic: المخا‎ al-Mukhā  Yemeni pronunciation: [elˈmoχæ]) is a port city on the <span class="loc">Red Sea</span> coast of <span class="loc">Yemen</span>. Until Aden and Hodeida eclipsed it in the 19th century, Mocha was the principal port for <span class="loc">Yemen</span>'s capital <span class="loc">Sana</span>'a. Mocha is famous for being the major marketplace for coffee from the 15th century until the early 18th century. Even after other sources of coffee were found, Mocha beans (also called <span class="loc">Sanani</span> or Mocha Sanani beans, meaning from <span class="loc">Sana</span>'a) continued to be prized for their distinctive flavor—and remain so even today. According to the Portuguese Jesuit missionary Jerónimo Lobo, who sailed the <span class="loc">Red Sea</span> in 1625, Mocha was "formerly of limited reputation and trade" but since "the Turkish assumption of power throughout <span class="loc">Arabia</span>, it has become the major city of the territory under Turkish domination, even though it is not the Pasha's place of residence, which is two days' journey inland in the <span class="loc">city of Sana</span>'a." Lobo adds that its importance as a port was also due to the Ottoman law that required all ships entering the <span class="loc">Red Sea</span> to put in at Mocha and pay duty on their cargoes.</p>
