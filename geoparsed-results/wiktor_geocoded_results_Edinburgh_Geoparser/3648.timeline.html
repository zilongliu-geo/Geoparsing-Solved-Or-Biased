It is located on the southern shore of the <span class="loc">Sognefjorden</span> in the traditional <span class="loc">district of Sogn</span>.

Other villages in the municipality include <span class="loc">Feios</span>, <span class="loc">Fresvik</span>, <span class="loc">Nese</span>, and <span class="loc">Vangsnes</span>. <span class="loc">Vik</span> was established as a municipality on <span class="date">1 January 1838</span> (see formannskapsdistrikt).
