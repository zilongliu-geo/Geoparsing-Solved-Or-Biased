<p>Harrison is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 2,114 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Clare County</span>. The city is named after <span class="loc">U.S.</span> President William Henry Harrison. Harrison is near the junction of <span class="loc">US</span> 127 and M-61. <span class="loc">US</span> 127 actually bypasses the city on the east, though a business route serves the downtown area. Clare is 14 miles (23 km) south on <span class="loc">US</span> 127, while <span class="loc">Grayling</span> is 40 miles (64 km) to the north. Harrison is bordered along its eastern side by <span class="loc">Budd Lake</span>. Harrison was originally founded as a lumber town, with sawmills located on the shores of <span class="loc">Budd Lake</span>. One of the lumber companies donated the land which is now Wilson State Park. The <span class="loc">City of Harrison</span> attracts thousands of visitors from throughout the state, with its "twenty lakes in twenty minutes" and large amount of state land for recreational sports. The biggest local events are the <span class="loc">Clare County</span> Fair and Frostbite Open Golf Tournament on <span class="loc">Budd Lake</span>. There are several historic buildings in the <span class="loc">city of Harrison</span>. The Surrey House is a relic of the lumber town days. The <span class="loc">Clare County</span> Newspaper building, located downtown, is the oldest building in Harrison, dating back to 1898. Owners Rauch and Bucholz family gives tours of the Cleaver building, in addition to a walking tour of downtown Harrison.</p>
