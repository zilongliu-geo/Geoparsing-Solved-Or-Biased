  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Mitchell</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Wheeler County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 130 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It was founded in <span class="date">1873</span> and was named after <span class="per">John H. Mitchell</span>, a politician. The <span class="loc">Painted Hills</span> unit of the <span class="loc">John Day Fossil Beds National Monument</span> is about 9 miles (14 km) northwest of <span class="per">Mitchell</span>. <span class="org">Mitchell School</span>, a public school with an enrollment of about 70 students, is in <span class="per">Mitchell</span>. At the request of William "Brawdie" <span class="loc">Johnson</span>, a blacksmith, a post office was established at <span class="per">Mitchell</span> in <span class="date">1873</span>. <span class="loc">Johnson</span>, the first postmaster, suggested the name <span class="per">Mitchell</span> after <span class="per">John Hipple</span> <span class="per">Mitchell</span>, a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senator from <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. <span class="per">Senator Mitchell</span> held the office in <span class="date">1873</span>−79, <span class="date">1885</span>−97, and <span class="date">1901</span>−05. Platted in <span class="date">1885</span>, the community was incorporated in <span class="date">1893</span>. In <span class="date">1872</span> the first school in <span class="loc">Wheeler County</span> was established near <span class="per">Mitchell</span>, and in <span class="date">1874</span> it was relocated to the town itself. Over <span class="date">the next two decades</span>, <span class="per">Mitchell</span> grew to include a store, assay office, two churches, two hotels, livery stable, three houses of ill-repute (one of which is still standing), five saloons, a flour mill, a livery stable, and an apothecary. There were also two newspapers, The Sentinel and The News. The business district, including the saloons, grew up along <span class="loc">Bridge Creek</span> and became known locally as "Tiger Town". The church and most of the city's homes were built at higher elevation on a bench overlooking the creek; this part of town was known locally as "Piety Hill". About half the town was destroyed by fire in <span class="date">1899</span>, but it was later rebuilt.</p><br><br>
