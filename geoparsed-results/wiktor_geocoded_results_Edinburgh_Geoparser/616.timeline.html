  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> is a suburb of north-western <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> is located 33 kilometres north-west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district, in the local government area of The Hills Shire. In <span class="date">1799</span>, <span class="per">Joseph Foveaux</span> was granted 300 acres (1.2 km2), which he expanded to over 2,000 acres (8.1 km2) and later sold to <span class="per">John Macarthur</span> in <span class="date">1801</span>. <span class="per">John</span> and <span class="per">Elizabeth Macarthur</span> farmed sheep on this property in addition to their properties at <span class="per">Camden</span> and <span class="per">Parramatta</span>. For much of the time that the <span class="loc">Macarthur</span>'s owned this farm <span class="per">John</span> was overseas and it fell to <span class="loc">Elizabeth</span> to manage the various <span class="per">Macarthur</span> properties and flocks. Reference is made by her to "my Seven <span class="loc">Hills Farm</span>" and this refers to the property, part of which later became "<span class="loc">Bella Vista</span>". Although claims are made by some that the Seven <span class="loc">Hills Farm</span> exclusively was used by the Macarthurs for the breeding of their merino flocks, this is clearly not the case as the documentary evidence of the <span class="per">Macarthur</span> papers shows that their Merino rams were paddocked at "<span class="loc">Elizabeth</span> Farm" at Parramatta. The <span class="loc">Seven Hills</span> farm was isolated and stock there were always in danger from theft and aboriginal attack. Two of <span class="per">Macarthur</span>'s stockmen were killed on the farm by natives in <span class="date">1805</span>. In fact the sheep at the <span class="per">Macarthur</span>'s <span class="loc">Seven Hills</span> farm had their genesis in the 600 sheep which were purchased from <span class="per">Foveaux</span> at the same time as the property. What can justifiably be claimed about the site is that it was one of the first major Australian sheep breeding farms and that the results later achieved at <span class="per">Camden</span> with fine merino sheep only followed <span class="per">Elizabeth</span>'s efforts at <span class="loc">Seven Hills</span>. Part of this land was later acquired by the <span class="per">Pearce</span> family and became known as <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span>. All the buildings on the site <span class="date">today</span> date from this period of its history with no extant buildings from the <span class="per">Macarthur</span> period. In the 1890s, <span class="per">Edward Henry Pearce</span> (<span class="date">1839</span>â€“<span class="date">1912</span>) of <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> was declared the "largest and most successful orange grower in the colony." <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> was sold by the <span class="loc">Pearces</span> in <span class="date">1950</span>.</p><br><br>
