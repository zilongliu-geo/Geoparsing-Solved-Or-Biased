<p>The village of <span class="loc">Ayr</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> is a settlement located within the Township of <span class="loc">North Dumfries</span> in the <span class="loc">Regional Municipality of Waterloo</span> in Southwestern <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. <span class="loc">Ayr</span> is located south of <span class="loc">Kitchener</span> and west of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>. In 1824, Abel Mudge (son of Elijah Mudge Sr) constructed a sawmill and flour mill at the junction of <span class="loc">Cedar Creek</span> and the <span class="loc">Nith River</span> (building at 14 Northumberland St., <span class="loc">Ayr</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>). This was the first of three distinct settlements, <span class="loc">Jedburgh</span> in the east (Main St.), Nithvale in the west (Piper St.) and Mudge's Mill in the centre (Stanley/Northumberland Streets) in what is today the Village of <span class="loc">Ayr</span>. <span class="loc">Jedburgh</span> began in 1832 when John Hall, a young immigrant from <span class="loc">Jedburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, purchased a 75-acre (300,000 m2) parcel of land that included the area now flooded by <span class="loc">Jedburgh</span> Dam. By 1850 Hall had developed several industries, including a flour mill, sawmill and distillery with water power provided by the damming of <span class="loc">Cedar Creek</span>. At the same time a smaller settlement, Nithvale, was founded to the west of Mudge's Mill where a small sawmill opened along the <span class="loc">Nith River</span>, its claim on history being that in 1837 it was a meeting and drilling place for MacKenzie's followers just prior to the Upper <span class="loc">Canada</span> Rebellion.</p>
