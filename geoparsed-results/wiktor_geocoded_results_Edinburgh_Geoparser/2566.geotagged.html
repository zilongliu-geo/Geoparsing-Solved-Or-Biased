<p>Helena is a town in southeastern <span class="loc">Alfalfa County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Residents pronounce the town's name with a long E: "Heh-LEE'-nuh." The population was 1,403 at the 2010 census. It is the site of the James Crabtree Correctional Center, run by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, with a population of 1,003 inmates in 2010. It is the site of the Timberlake Public School district, shared with the nearby towns of <span class="loc">Goltry</span>, <span class="loc">Jet</span>, and <span class="loc">Nash</span>. On June 1894, Helen S. Monroe received a postal designation for Helena.  Monroe became the first postmaster and the town's namesake. Shortly after the Cherokee Outlet opened to settlement, numerous small communities emerged in what was then southwestern <span class="loc">Woods County</span> (now Alfalfa county). When the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Valley and Western Railway survey bypassed the nearby settlement of <span class="loc">Carwile</span>, those residents began migrating closer to the proposed railroad, near where H. H. Anderson had established a store around 1896. The townsite was laid out nearby in 1902, and the village was incorporated the following year, by which time the population was 160.</p>
