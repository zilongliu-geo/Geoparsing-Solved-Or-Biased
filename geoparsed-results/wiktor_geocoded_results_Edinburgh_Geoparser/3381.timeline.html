  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Sparks is a city in <span class="loc">Washoe County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was founded in <span class="date">1904</span> and incorporated on <span class="date">March 15, 1905</span> and is located just east of <span class="loc">Reno</span>. The <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> population count was 90,264. It is the fifth most populous city in <span class="loc">Nevada</span>. Sparks is located within the <span class="loc">Renoâ€“Sparks metropolitan</span> area. In the early historical period, the area that is <span class="date">now</span> Sparks was inhabited by the Washoe people. Euro-American settlement of the area began in the early 1850s, and the population density in the area remained very low until <span class="date">1904</span> when the Southern Pacific Railroad built a switch yard and maintenance sheds there. The city that sprung up around them was first called <span class="per">Harriman</span> after <span class="per">E. H. Harriman</span>, president of the Southern Pacific. The city was quickly renamed Sparks after John Sparks, the Governor of <span class="loc">Nevada</span> at that time. Sparks remained a small town until <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, when economic growth in <span class="loc">Reno</span> triggered a housing boom north of the railroad in the area of Sparks. During <span class="date">the 1970s</span>, the area south of the railroad started to fill up with warehouses and light industry. In <span class="date">1984</span>, the tower for the Nugget Casino Resort was finished, giving Sparks its first, and currently only, high-rise casino. In <span class="date">1996</span>, the redevelopment effort of the B Street business district across from the Nugget that started in <span class="date">the early 1980s</span> took a step forward with the opening of a multi-screen movie complex and the construction of a plaza area. This area, <span class="date">now</span> known as Victorian Square, is a pedestrian-friendly district that hosts many open-air events.</p><br><br>
