  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county located in the state of <span class="loc">Florida</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 73,090. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Key West</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> includes the islands of the <span class="loc">Florida Keys</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Key West</span>, <span class="loc">FL</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. Although 87% of the county's land area is on the mainland, that region is part of the <span class="loc">Everglades</span> and is virtually uninhabited. Over 99% of the county's population lives on the <span class="loc">Florida Keys</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was created in <span class="date">1823</span>. It was named for <span class="per">James Monroe</span>, the fifth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, who served from <span class="date">1817</span> to <span class="date">1825</span>. According to the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span>, the county has a total area of 3,738 square miles (9,680 km2), of which 983 square miles (2,550 km2) is land and 2,754 square miles (7,130 km2) (73.7%) is water. It is the largest county in <span class="loc">Florida</span> by total area. More than 99 percent of the <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> population lives in the island chain known as the <span class="loc">Florida Keys</span>. Two thirds of the large area in what local residents call "mainland <span class="loc">Monroe</span>" is protected by virtue of being part of the <span class="loc">Everglades</span> National Park, and the remainder by the <span class="loc">Big Cypress National Preserve</span> in the northeastern interior. The area, officially named Cape Sable <span class="org">Census County Division</span>, is virtually uninhabited. As of the Census of <span class="date">2000</span>, this area had 86.9 percent of the county's land area (2243.58 out of 2,582.00 km2 (997 sq mi)), but only 0.075 percent of its population (60 out of 79,589). The Census Bureau defines this area as Census Tract 9701 of <span class="loc">Monroe County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>. With a population density of only 0.0267/kmÂ² (0.0693/sq mi), if it were a separate county or county-equivalent, only the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area of central <span class="loc">Alaska</span> would have a lower population density out of all <span class="loc">U.S.</span> counties. The only three populated places appearing on detailed maps and in the USGS geographic name database are Flamingo, <span class="loc">Pinecrest</span> (not to be confused with much larger <span class="loc">Pinecrest</span> of neighboring <span class="loc">Miami-Dade County</span>), and <span class="loc">Trail City</span>. Flamingo, located on the south coast and at the end of State Road 9336 (Flamingo Lodge Highway), is the location of the Flamingo Lodge and the Flamingo Ranger Station (with Visitor Center &amp; Marina). 11 km (7 mi) northeast on the highway is the West Lake Trail (station). <span class="loc">Pinecrest</span>, located in the northern interior of the county (in the <span class="loc">Big Cypress National Preserve</span>) on Loop Road (given that name since it forms a loop with <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 41 further north), hosts the Loop Road Education Center. <span class="loc">Trail City</span> is 6 km (4 mi) west of <span class="loc">Pinecrest</span> on Loop Road. Loop Road can be found on most maps as CR 94, although the roadway no longer has a numbered designation and is <span class="date">now</span> managed by the National Park Service.</p><br><br>
