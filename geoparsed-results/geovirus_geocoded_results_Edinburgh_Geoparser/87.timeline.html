  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The United Nations has reported that a total of 978 people have been killed by a cholera epidemic in the African nation of <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>, an increase of 25% from just <span class="date">three days ago</span>. The <span class="org">UN</span> also says that there have been 18,413 reported cases in the country since the epidemic began in <span class="date">August of 2008</span>. The outbreak of the disease has been quickened by the lack of proper sanitation and the collapse of water systems and healthcare. The area worst affected by cholera is <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>'s capital of <span class="loc">Harare</span>, where 208 people died out of 8,454 suspected cases. The town of <span class="loc">Beitbridge</span>, which is located on the border with <span class="loc">South Africa</span>, has also been hard hit, with 3,546 cases reported and 91 people dead. The South African <span class="loc">Red Cross</span> has sent medical aid to <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>, and has asked for funds to treat thirty thousand people. The <span class="org">UN</span> says that as many as sixty thousand people could become affected by the disease if no action is taken. <span class="date">Last Thursday</span>, Zimbabwean president <span class="per">Robert Mugabe</span> announced in a televised address that the outbreak had been halted, saying that "I am happy to say our doctors are being assisted by others, and the WHO [World Health Organization] have <span class="date">now</span> arrested cholera." <span class="per">Mugabe</span> has also accused Western powers of plotting to use the epidemic as a reason to overthrow him. "<span class="date">Now</span> that there is no cholera, there is no cause for war," he stated. Other Zimbabwean high-ranking officials have also blamed the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> for spreading cholera on purpose. The <span class="org">UN Security Council</span> will have a briefing on the Zimabwean cholera crisis soon.</p><br><br>
