  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a county located in the eastern portion of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 52,566. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Troy. The county was founded <span class="date">December 14, 1818</span>, and named for Major General <span class="per">Benjamin Lincoln</span> of the American Revolutionary War. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is part of the St. Louis, <span class="loc">MO-IL Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. According to <span class="org">Goodspeed's History</span> of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> (<span class="date">1888</span>), <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> was named by Major <span class="per">Christopher Clark</span>, the first permanent white settler, when he addressed the Territorial Legislature saying, "I was born, sir, in <span class="loc">Link-Horn County</span>, <span class="loc">N.C.</span>, I lived for <span class="date">many years</span> in <span class="loc">Link-Horn County</span> in old Kain-tuck. I wish to die in <span class="loc">Link-Horn County</span>, in <span class="loc">Missouri</span>; and I move, therefore, that the blank in the bill be filled with the name Link-Horn." The motion was carried unanimously and the clerk, not adopting the frontier parlance of the Major, wrote "<span class="per">Lincoln</span>" in the blank space of the bill. Others say it was named for Major General <span class="per">Benjamin Lincoln</span> who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.</p><br><br>
