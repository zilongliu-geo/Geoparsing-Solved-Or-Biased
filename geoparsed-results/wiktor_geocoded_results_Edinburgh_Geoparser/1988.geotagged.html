<p><span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span> is a suburb in southern <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span> is located 17 kilometres south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district and is part of the <span class="loc">St George</span> area. <span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span> lies across two local government areas, the <span class="loc">City of Hurstville</span> and the <span class="loc">City of Canterbury</span>. It is often colloquially referred to as "Bevo". The postcode is 2209, which it shares with neighbouring Narwee. <span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span> is mostly residential, consisting of many freestanding red brick and tile bungalows built in the years immediately after World War 2. Many of these feature late Art Deco design elements. Medium density flats have been built in the areas close to King Georges Road and Stoney Creek Road. <span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span> was originally known as <span class="loc">Dumbleton</span> after a local farm in the area, circa 1830. This name was generally disliked by residents who lobbied to supplant it with a more glamorous alternative to coincide with the arrival of the <span class="loc">East Hills</span> railway line, which opened 31 December 1931. The name was changed to <span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span>, at a time when <span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span> in <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span> was becoming famous for being the home of many famous movie stars. Real estate developments followed in the 1930s and 1940s. The post office opened 1 October 1940.</p>
