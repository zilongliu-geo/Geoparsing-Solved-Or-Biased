  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Agustin</span> (formerly Guintigui-an and <span class="loc">Badajoz</span>) is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Romblon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. <span class="loc">San Agustin</span> was known during Spanish times as Guintigui-an because of the abundance of a fish called "tigue" in the area. <span class="per">Negrito</span> and <span class="per">Mangyan</span> tribes from <span class="loc">Panay</span> and <span class="loc">Mindoro</span> were the first inhabitants, as well as migrants from island of <span class="loc">Romblon</span>, and southern <span class="loc">Tablas</span>. In the early part of Spanish conquest, the first settlement was at barangay <span class="loc">Cabolutan</span>. The early settlers found it very trying at times to cross the channel to Romblon town to attend to civil and religious duties. To solve this problem, <span class="loc">Cabolutan</span> leaders discussed the matter such as building a visita in their settlement of around 250 souls. Finally in <span class="date">1635</span>, the first church building made of coral stone and lime was started. In <span class="date">1700</span>, Spanish authorities decided to separate <span class="loc">Cabolutan</span> in <span class="loc">Tablas Island</span> from <span class="loc">Romblon</span>, with its seat at visita <span class="loc">Cabolutan</span> subjugating all settlements west of <span class="loc">Tablas Island</span>. The new pueblo or town of <span class="loc">Cabolutan</span> progressed slowly and grew more populous despite frequent Moro kidnapping raids. However, in <span class="date">1790</span>, a smallpox epidemic almost wiped out the town's entire population. The heavy casualty toll caused the puebloâ€™s abolition which led to re- incorporation to <span class="loc">Romblon</span> until <span class="date">1855</span>, when another pueblo named Guintigui-an was founded some 4 kilometers south of the old town site. The town was founded by <span class="per">Don Laureano</span> <span class="per">Montesa</span> together with his brother <span class="per">Don Esteban</span> and cousin <span class="per">Don Luis Montesa</span>, who became Tiniente Absoluto in <span class="loc">Romblon</span>. Its jurisdiction included what is <span class="date">now</span> the towns of <span class="loc">Calatrava</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span>. The construction of the <span class="loc">Cotta</span> (fort) at Payong-Payong hill (located in present-day barangay Cagbo-aya), started in <span class="date">1873</span>. <span class="loc">Cotta</span> protected the community from Muslim pirates and still stands <span class="date">today</span>. In <span class="date">1868</span>, the town was renamed "Badajoz" by <span class="per">Andres Lebarde</span>, a visiting Spanish soldier, after his native <span class="loc">city of Badajoz</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>.</p><br><br>
