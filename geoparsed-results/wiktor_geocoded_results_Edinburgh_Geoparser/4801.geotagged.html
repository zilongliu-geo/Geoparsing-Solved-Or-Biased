It is part of the Provo–Orem, <span class="loc">Utah Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 850 at the 2000 census.

It is about halfway between <span class="loc">Santaquin</span> and <span class="loc">Nephi</span>, about 1.6 km (1 mi) west of Interstate 15. <span class="loc">Mona</span>, one of the early settlements along the Old Mormon Road, was originally settled in 1852.

It was later renamed <span class="loc">Willow Creek</span> for its water source, then <span class="loc">Starr</span> for a local settler, before receiving its present name. Burl Ives was once jailed in <span class="loc">Mona</span> for singing "Foggy Foggy Dew", because it was considered bawdy by the authorities. <span class="loc">Mona</span> is located at 39°48′55″N 111°51′23″W (39.815392, -111.856354).
