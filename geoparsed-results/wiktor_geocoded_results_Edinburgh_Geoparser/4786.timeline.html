  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Princeton</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Bureau County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,700 at the <span class="date">2014</span> census. <span class="loc">Princeton</span> is part of the Ottawaâ€“Streator <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which is included within the Chicago-Naperville Combined Statistical Area. Due to its location where Interstate 80 meets the Amtrak system, as well as its well-preserved main street and historic housing stock, <span class="loc">Princeton</span> has become a popular satellite town for Chicagoland and the <span class="loc">Quad Cities</span>. <span class="loc">Bureau County</span> was a <span class="loc">New England</span> settlement. The original founders of <span class="loc">Princeton</span> consisted entirely of settlers from <span class="loc">New England</span>. These people were "Yankees," descended from the English Puritans who settled <span class="loc">New England</span> in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of <span class="loc">New England</span> farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal. When they arrived in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Bureau County</span> there was nothing but a virgin forest and wild prairie, the New Englanders laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their <span class="loc">Yankee</span> <span class="loc">New England</span> values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian. Culturally <span class="loc">Bureau County</span>, like much of northern <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, would be culturally very continuous with early <span class="loc">New England</span> culture, for most of its history. During the time of slavery, it was a stop on the Underground Railroad at the home of <span class="per">Owen Lovejoy</span>.</p><br><br>
