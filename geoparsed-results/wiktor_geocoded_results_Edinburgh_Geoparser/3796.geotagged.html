<p>Hay is a town in the <span class="loc">western Riverina region</span> of south <span class="loc">western New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is the administrative centre of Hay Shire local government area and the centre of a prosperous and productive agricultural district on the wide Hay Plains. Located on the main route, approximately midway between the large <span class="loc">cities of Sydney and Adelaide</span> at the junction of the <span class="loc">Sturt</span>, <span class="loc">Cobb</span> and Mid-Western Highways, Hay is an important regional and national transport node. The town itself is built beside the <span class="loc">Murrumbidgee River</span>, part of the Murray-Darling river system; <span class="loc">Australia</span>'s largest. The main business <span class="loc">district of Hay</span> is situated on the north bank of the river. Aboriginal communities in the western <span class="loc">Riverina</span> were traditionally concentrated in the more habitable river corridors and amongst the reedbeds of the region.  The district surrounding Hay was occupied by at least three separate Aboriginal groups at the time of European settler expansion onto their lands.  The area around the present township appears to have been a site of interaction between the Nari-Nari people of the Lower Murrumbidgee and the Wiradjuri who inhabited a vast region in the central-western inland of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>.</p>
