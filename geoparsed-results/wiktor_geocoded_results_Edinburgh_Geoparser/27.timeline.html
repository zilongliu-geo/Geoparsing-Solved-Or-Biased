  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bala</span> is a Canadian community famous for the <span class="loc">Bala</span> Falls. It is located in <span class="loc">Muskoka Lakes Township</span> in <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, where <span class="loc">Lake Muskoka</span> empties into the Moon River. It is considered one of the hubs of cottage country located north of <span class="loc">Toronto</span>. Thus, its year-round population of several hundred is increased by thousands of seasonal residents and <span class="date">weekend</span> day-trippers during <span class="date">summer</span> <span class="date">months</span>. It is known as the Cranberry Capital of <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, as the province's largest cranberry farms, Johnston's <span class="loc">Cranberry Marsh</span> and Wahta Iroquis Growers, are located nearby. It was once the smallest incorporated town in <span class="loc">Canada</span>, until amalgamation as part of <span class="loc">Muskoka Lakes Township</span>. <span class="loc">Bala</span> was settled by <span class="per">Thomas Burgess</span> in <span class="date">1868</span>. <span class="per">Thomas Burgess</span> opened a sawmill and store to serve the area's scattered settlers. <span class="per">Thomas Burgess</span> named it after the town of <span class="loc">Bala</span> in <span class="loc">Wales</span> with which it is officially twinned. Located on the <span class="loc">Canadian Shield</span>, it proved unsuitable for farming and its fortunes declined as logging became less economically viable. Railway connections helped to re-establish the village as a popular location for <span class="date">summer</span> resorts. In <span class="date">1914</span>, the town incorporated with Burgess' son as the first mayor making it the smallest incorporated town in <span class="loc">Canada</span>.</p><br><br>
