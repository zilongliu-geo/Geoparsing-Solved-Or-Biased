<p><span class="loc">Barra</span>, traditionally known as <span class="loc">Niumi</span>, is a city in The <span class="loc">Gambia</span>, located in the <span class="loc">district of Lower Niumi</span>. The predominant languages of the city are Serer and Wolof. Although Mandinka-speaking Africans always referred to the state along the north bank of the <span class="loc">Gambia</span> River's estuary as <span class="loc">Niumi</span>, not everyone did. For a long time it was called "Barra" in the creolized trade language of the river, and between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries British and French records use "Barra" or "Bar" more frequently than "Niumi". The <span class="loc">city of Barra</span> has an "Al Kali" which is basically the village coordinator who keeps everything in order. The people of <span class="loc">Barra</span> go to the "Al Kali", leader of the village, with any requests. The former "Al Kali" of <span class="loc">Barra</span>, formally known as Kenbugul Faye, died in September 2014 due to natural causes. He was 92. Ebrima Kenbugul Faye was the Al Kali of the city for over 5 years and has 28 children. His son continues to uphold the family name by taking the place of his father. In early 2015, the <span class="loc">city of Barra</span> conducted elections for their new "Al Kali" with two candidates. The other candidate was of the Senghore family and was defeated. Alhagi Faye is now the Al Kali of <span class="loc">Barra</span>.</p>
