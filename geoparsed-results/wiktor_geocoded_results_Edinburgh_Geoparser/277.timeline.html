  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Ada</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Pontotoc County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 16,810 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, an increase of 7.1 percent from 15,691 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The city was named for <span class="per">Ada Reed</span>, the daughter of an early settler, and was incorporated in <span class="date">1901</span>. <span class="per">Ada</span> is home to East Central University, and is the headquarters of the Chickasaw Nation. <span class="per">Ada</span> is an <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> Main Street City, an <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> Certified City, and a Tree City <span class="loc">USA</span> member. In the late 1880s, the <span class="loc">Daggs</span> family (by way of <span class="loc">Texas</span>) became the first white family to settle what is <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="per">Ada</span>, which was formerly known as <span class="loc">Daggs</span> Prairie. In <span class="date">April 1889</span>, <span class="per">Jeff Reed</span> (a native <span class="loc">Texan</span>, and relative of the <span class="loc">Daggs</span> family) was appointed to carry the mail from Stonewall to Center (which was later combined with <span class="loc">Pickett</span>), two small communities in then Indian Territory. With his family and his stock, he sought a place for a home on a prairie midway between the two points, where he constructed a log house and started <span class="per">Reed</span>'s Store. Other settlers soon built homes nearby. In <span class="date">1891</span>, a post office was established and named after <span class="per">Reed</span>'s oldest daughter, <span class="per">Ada</span>. <span class="per">Ada</span> incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1901</span> and grew rapidly with the arrival of the St. <span class="per">Louis</span> and <span class="per">San</span> Francisco Railway line. Within <span class="date">a decade</span> the Santa Fe Railroad and the <span class="org">Oklahoma Central Railway</span> also served the town.</p><br><br>
