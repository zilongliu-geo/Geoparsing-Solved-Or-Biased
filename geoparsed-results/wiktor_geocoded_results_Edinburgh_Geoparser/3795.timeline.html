  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Peterborough</span> /ˈpiːtəbrə/ is a town on the Great Ocean Road in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>; approximately three hours' drive from <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. The town was believed to have been founded when the schooner SS <span class="loc">Schomberg</span> was wrecked in the middle of the 19th century, though the town was not sufficiently populated to justify a Post Office until <span class="date">10 April 1890</span>. It has since become a fishing village, and at the <span class="date">2006</span> census, <span class="loc">Peterborough</span> had a population of 178. The town has two public tennis courts and beaches, and a nine-hole golf course at the <span class="org">Peterborough Golf Club</span> on Schomberg Road. The town is situated near The <span class="loc">Twelve Apostles</span>, and <span class="per">London Arch</span> land formations; and is part of the Shipwreck Coast. Many ships have been wrecked in the vicinity, due to limestone cliffs eroding away and leaving many patches of harder rock concealed just under the waves quite a distance out to sea, and this erosion is ongoing, evidenced by the <span class="loc">London Bridge</span> formation collapsing in <span class="date">the early 1990s</span> to form <span class="per">London Arch</span>. One of the most famous wrecks was the Falls of Halladale which was wrecked in <span class="date">1908</span> in thick fog, and became a tourist attraction for <span class="date">the next few years</span> as it remained on the reef it was stuck on.</p><br><br>
