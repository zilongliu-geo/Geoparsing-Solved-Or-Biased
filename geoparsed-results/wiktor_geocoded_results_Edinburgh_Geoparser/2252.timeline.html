  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Chale</span> is a village and civil parish on the <span class="loc">Isle of Wight</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is located three kilometres from <span class="loc">Niton</span> in the south of the Island in the area known as <span class="org">the Back of the Wight</span>. The village of <span class="loc">Chale</span> lies at the foot of St. Catherine's Down. <span class="loc">Chale</span> is recorded in the Domesday book as "Cela", which probably derives from the Old English word "ceole", meaning "throat". This is thought to refer to the nearby ravine or chine at <span class="loc">Blackgang</span>. The name was also recorded as "Chele" or "Chielle", but it has been "<span class="loc">Chale</span>" since the 12th century. There were 3 manors in <span class="loc">Chale</span> at the time of the Domesday Book: <span class="loc">Chale</span>, <span class="per">Gotten</span> and <span class="per">Walpen</span>. The Parish Church of <span class="per">St Andrew</span> was founded by <span class="per">Hugh Gendon</span> in <span class="loc">Chale</span> in <span class="date">1114</span>. However, the present church dates from the 14th century. It has 6 bells in its tower. One might have been made about <span class="date">1360</span>. It has some fine stained glass windows. The <span class="loc">Chale</span> Abbey farm has a window that dates from the 14th century. The name Abbey refers to the style of the building, not its religious use. <span class="loc">Chale</span> <span class="loc">Abbey Farm</span> and <span class="loc">Walpen</span> Manor are two of the oldest buildings on the <span class="loc">Isle of Wight</span>.</p><br><br>
