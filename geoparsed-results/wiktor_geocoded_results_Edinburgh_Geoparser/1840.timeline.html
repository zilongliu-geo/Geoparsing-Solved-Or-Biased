  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Parker</span> (Mojave 'Amat Kuhwely, formerly 'Ahwe Nyava) is the county seat of La <span class="loc">Paz County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, on the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> in <span class="loc">Parker</span> Valley. The population was 3,083 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Founded in <span class="date">1908</span>, the town was named after <span class="per">Ely Parker</span>, the first Native American commissioner for the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> government. The original town site of <span class="per">Parker</span> was surveyed and laid out in <span class="date">1909</span> by a railroad location engineer by the name of Earl. <span class="per">H. Parker</span> for the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> &amp; California Railway. The town's name and origin began when a post office called <span class="per">Parker</span> was established <span class="date">January 6, 1871</span>, at <span class="per">Parker</span>'s Landing and the site of the <span class="org">Parker Indian Agency</span>, named for <span class="per">Ely Parker</span>, on the <span class="loc">Colorado River Indian Reservation</span>, 4 miles down river from the site of the railroad bridge of the modern town, to serve the Indian agency. What became <span class="loc">Parkers</span> Landing was established on the river as the place to land and pick up cargo and personnel for the <span class="org">Indian Agency</span> and the <span class="org">U. S. Army</span> detachment that was stationed there at <span class="loc">Camp Colorado</span> from <span class="date">1864</span> to <span class="date">1869</span> during the first <span class="date">years</span> of the Reservation. <span class="loc">Camp Colorado</span> was abandoned after wind blown sparks from the departing steamboat <span class="loc">Cocopah</span> rapidly burned down the brush huts of the officers of the garrison, and endangered its barracks and storehouses.</p><br><br>
