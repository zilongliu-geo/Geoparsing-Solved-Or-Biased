  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Brooklyn (formerly <span class="loc">Swainsville</span>) is a village in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 1,206 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is located just off <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 12 (formerly <span class="loc">US</span> 112) in <span class="org">Columbia</span> Township. Brooklyn is located in a portion of central lower <span class="loc">Michigan</span> known for its lush, rolling green landscapes in the <span class="loc">Irish Hills</span> area of Southeast <span class="loc">Michigan</span> which contains scenic lakes surrounding <span class="loc">Hayes State Park</span> and <span class="loc">Cambridge Junction Historic State Park</span> which adjoins the <span class="loc">Michigan</span> <span class="loc">International Speedway</span>. The area was primarily a <span class="date">summer</span> vacation spot for residents of metropolitan <span class="loc">Detroit</span> who owned cottages near lakes in the area. With the nearby additions of Interstate 94 in <span class="date">the late 1950s</span> and <span class="loc">Michigan</span> <span class="loc">International Speedway</span> in <span class="date">the late 1960s</span>, Brooklyn established a year-round population. This city is also 14 miles (23 km) southeast of Jackson, 37 miles (60 km) southwest of Ann Arbor and 56 miles (90 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Lansing</span>. The village was founded by <span class="per">Calvin Swain</span>, who filed the first land claim on <span class="date">June 16, 1832</span> and named his settlement <span class="loc">Swainsville</span>. In a town meeting vote on <span class="date">August 5, 1836</span>, the community elected to change the town's name to Brooklyn. The town is named after Brooklyn, <span class="loc">New York</span>.</p><br><br>
