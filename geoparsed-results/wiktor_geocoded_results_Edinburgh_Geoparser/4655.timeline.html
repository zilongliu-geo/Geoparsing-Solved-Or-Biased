  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Baldwin</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,525 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, metropolitan statistical area. First called Flintstown Plantation, it was granted in <span class="date">1774</span> by the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> to survivors of the <span class="org">Concord</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, company commanded by <span class="per">Captain John Flint</span>. It replaced a grant of about <span class="date">1735</span> which gave them Township No. 3, because when state borders were adjusted in <span class="date">1741</span>, the town turned out to be in New Hampshire—present-day Walpole. On <span class="date">June 23, 1802</span>, Flintstown was incorporated as <span class="per">Baldwin</span>, named for Colonel <span class="per">Loammi Baldwin</span>, for whom the <span class="per">Baldwin</span> apple was named. <span class="loc">Sebago</span> was set off and incorporated in <span class="date">1826</span>. The surface of the town is broken, but with soil favorable to grain and hay. <span class="per">Baldwin</span> would be noted for its orchards, and a factory was established in <span class="loc">East Baldwin</span> for drying apples. There was also a corn factory. Brooks provided water power for various mills which produced board lumber, barrel staves and shooks. During times of drought, the <span class="loc">Saco</span> Water Power Company could regulate water at <span class="loc">Great Falls</span> to run mills down the <span class="loc">Saco River</span> in <span class="loc">Saco</span> and in <span class="loc">Biddeford</span>. The <span class="loc">Portland</span> and Ogdensburg Railroad followed the <span class="loc">Saco</span> River valley for the length of <span class="per">Baldwin</span>.</p><br><br>
