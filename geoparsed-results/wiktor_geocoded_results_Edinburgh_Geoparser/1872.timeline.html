  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Muta</span> (German: Hohenmauthen) is the largest settlement and the centre of the Carinthia Statistical Region of northern <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. Traditionally, it is part of <span class="loc">Styria</span> because it was part of the Duchy of <span class="loc">Styria</span>. <span class="loc">Muta</span> was first attested in written sources in <span class="date">1255</span> as Muttenberch (and as Můtenberch in <span class="date">1265</span>–67, Moutenberch in <span class="date">1279</span>, Maeut in <span class="date">1349</span>, Mautenberch in <span class="date">1405</span>, and Mawt in <span class="date">1459</span>). The Slovene name is derived from the Slovene common noun muta 'toll (payment)', derived from Middle High German mûte 'toll (payment)'. It therefore refers to a place where tolls were collected. <span class="loc">Muta</span> is the site of a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The Croatian Mass Grave (Slovene: Grobišče Hrvatov) is a cluster of seven locations in the northeast part of the settlement on the bank of the <span class="loc">Drava River</span>. It contains the remains of Croatians. The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to <span class="loc">Saint Margaret</span> (Slovene: sveta <span class="loc">Marjeta</span>) and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of <span class="loc">Maribor</span>. It was first mentioned in written documents dating to <span class="date">1349</span>. In the 17th century it was extended and widened. There are two other churches in <span class="loc">Muta</span>. The church dedicated to John the Baptistin the hamlet of Spodnja Muta in the settlement is an 11th-century Romanesque rotunda with an Early Gothic sanctuary added. Fourteenth-century wall paintings survive in the church and the wooden painted ceiling is from the late 16th and early 17th century. The church on the bank of the <span class="loc">Drava River</span> in the south of the settlement is dedicated to <span class="loc">Saint Peter</span> and is a late Romanesque single-nave building from the 13th century with various alterations over the <span class="date">centuries</span>.</p><br><br>
