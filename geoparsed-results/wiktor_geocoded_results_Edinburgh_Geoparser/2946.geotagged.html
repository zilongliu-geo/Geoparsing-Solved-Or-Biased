<p>Auburn is a town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,953 at the 2010 census, with an estimated population of 5,158 in 2013. The town was ranked number one of "<span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>'s Most Beautiful Towns" in July 2010 by WMUR News 9. Auburn was originally settled by Native Americans in 1624. It was a fishing settlement called by Native Americans "Massabesic" (the current name of the town's largest lake). British settlers arrived in the area in 1720 and made peace with the Native Americans until the French and Indian War. The Massabesic settlement was destroyed, and the nearby town of <span class="loc">Chester</span> claimed the land. It was known as <span class="loc">Chester Woods</span>, <span class="loc">Chester</span> <span class="loc">West Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Long Meadow</span>, and then Auburn. Auburn became an independent town on June 25, 1845, with a population of 1,200 people. As with Auburn, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, Auburn, Massachusetts and Auburn, <span class="loc">New York</span>, the name is from Oliver Goldsmith's popular 18th-century poem, "The Deserted Village", which begins: Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain,</p>
