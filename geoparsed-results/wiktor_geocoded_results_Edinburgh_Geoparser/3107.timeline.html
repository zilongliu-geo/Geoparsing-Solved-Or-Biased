  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Cove is a city in <span class="loc">Chambers County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 510 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 323 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. Cove is located in northwestern <span class="loc">Chambers County</span> at 29°48′48″N 94°49′30″W (29.813446, -94.825020), on the west side of <span class="loc">Old River Lake</span>, an arm of the <span class="loc">Trinity River</span>. Interstate 10 passes the northern end of the town, with access from Exit 803. I-10 leads west 35 miles (56 km) to Houston and east 49 miles (79 km) to <span class="loc">Beaumont</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, Cove has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.2 km2), of which 1.2 square miles (3.1 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2), or 4.11%, is water. This site was originally called <span class="per">Winfree</span>'s Cove, after an early pioneer settler named <span class="per">A. B. J. Winfree</span>. In <span class="date">1871</span>, the first cotton gin was operating there under the ownership of <span class="per">William Icet</span>. <span class="date">Nine years later</span>, <span class="per">Icet</span> sold the gin and ran a shipyard with the help of his two sons until <span class="date">1915</span>. The post office at Cove was first opened in <span class="date">1894</span> (<span class="date">now</span> closed). The <span class="per">Icet</span> family also operated a sawmill at the site, which had a population of 150 residents by <span class="date">1920</span>. After <span class="date">the 1940s</span>, the nearby established chemical plants helped to boost the population. In <span class="date">the 1970s</span> there were rumors that <span class="loc">Baytown</span>, 13 miles (21 km) to the southwest, intended to annex the community. On <span class="date">September 22, 1970</span>, 84 residents sent a petition to nearby <span class="loc">Beach City</span> to annex the community. On <span class="date">November 24, 1970</span>, <span class="loc">Beach City</span> annexed Cove, an area bounded generally on the west by FM-2354, on the east by the <span class="per">Old</span> and <span class="per">Lost</span> Rivers, on the south by Lawrence Road, and on the north by a line just north of FM-565. On <span class="date">December 2, 1970</span>, <span class="loc">Beach City</span> extended its Cove annexation to include the property where the old Cove Community Building sits. <span class="loc">Baytown</span> did not concur. In <span class="date">1971</span>, <span class="loc">Baytown</span> sued <span class="loc">Beach City</span> in an attempt to stop the annexation of Cove. In <span class="date">1973</span>, <span class="loc">Beach City</span> released its claim to what are <span class="date">now</span> the city limits of Cove. An incorporation election was held and <span class="org">the City of Cove</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">May 23, 1973</span>. <span class="per">Leroy Stevens</span> was Cove's first mayor. The City Council of <span class="loc">Beach City</span> presented to <span class="per">Mayor Stevens</span> Cove's first municipal seal, which is believed to be the one still in use.</p><br><br>
