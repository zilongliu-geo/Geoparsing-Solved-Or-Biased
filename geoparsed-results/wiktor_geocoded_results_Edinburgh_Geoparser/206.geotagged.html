<p>Guadalupe is a small city located in Santa <span class="loc">Barbara County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. According to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census of 2010, the city has a population of 7,080. Guadalupe is economically and socially tied to the city of <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span>, which is about ten miles to the east. The first European land exploration of Alta <span class="loc">California</span>, the Spanish Portol√† expedition, camped near today's Guadalupe on September 1, 1769. Franciscan missionary and expedition member Juan Crespi noted in his diary that they found "a very large lake". The lake has since mostly filled in, leaving a low-lying plain traversed by the <span class="loc">Santa Maria River</span> and several tributaries. When Mission La Purisima was established in 1787, the area became part of the mission's pasture land. In 1840, following secularization of the mission, the area became part of the <span class="loc">Rancho Guadalupe</span> land grant. <span class="loc">Rancho Guadalupe</span> was settled by pioneers of many unique backgrounds, such as European, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Mexican. The small town was incorporated as the <span class="loc">city of Guadalupe</span> on May 19, 1946. The city name honors <span class="loc">Our Lady of Guadalupe</span>, the title given to the Virgin Mary.</p>
