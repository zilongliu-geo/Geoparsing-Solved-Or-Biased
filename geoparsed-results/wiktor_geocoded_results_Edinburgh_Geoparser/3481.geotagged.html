<p>Hudson is a town in <span class="loc">Caldwell County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,776 at the 2010 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Hickory–Lenoir–Morganton Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Hudson is a picturesque small town in the foothills of Western <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. It was once known for its furniture industry but as of late for its international businesses such as Shurtape, Beocare and Outdura. According to its most recent census, Hudson has a population of approximately 3800 people but during the day, this swells to over 11,000 due to those who work in town and those who attend school at Caldwell Community College and other surrounding schools. Google recently located a server facility very close to the town as well. Hudson's landmarks are the "HUB" (the Hudson Uptown Building, the former Hudson Elementary school where locals can gather for special events), the Gold Mine Fine Jewelry &amp; Gifts, the Hudson Library, the Hudson Volunteer Fire Department, the Hudson Post Office, the Hudson Optimist Club, Donna's <span class="loc">Cafe</span>, Vintage Cafe, Yesteryear Antiques and Hudson Primary Care.</p>
