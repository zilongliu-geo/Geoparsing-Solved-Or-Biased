  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, surrounded by the cities of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and <span class="loc">West Hollywood</span>. Originally a Spanish ranch where lima beans were grown, <span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1914</span> by a group of investors who had failed to find oil, but found water instead and eventually decided to develop it into a town. By <span class="date">2013</span>, its population had grown to 34,658. Sometimes referred to as "90210", one of its primary ZIP codes, it is home to many actors and celebrities. The city includes the Rodeo Drive shopping district and the <span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span> <span class="loc">Oil</span> Field. Gaspar de Portolá arrived in the area that would become <span class="loc">Beverly Hills</span> on <span class="date">August 3, 1769</span>, travelling along native trails which followed the present-day route of Wilshire Boulevard. The area was settled by <span class="per">Maria Rita Quinteros</span> de <span class="loc">Valdez</span> and her husband in <span class="date">1828</span>. They called their 4,500 acres (18 km2) of property the <span class="loc">Rancho Rodeo</span> de las <span class="loc">Aguas</span>. in <span class="date">1854</span>, she sold the ranch to <span class="per">Benjamin Davis Wilson</span> (<span class="date">1811</span>–<span class="date">1878</span>) and <span class="per">Henry Hancock</span> (<span class="date">1822</span>–<span class="date">1883</span>). By the 1880s, the ranch had been subdivided into parcels of 75 acres (0.30 km2) and was being rapidly bought up by anglos from <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and the East coast.</p><br><br>
