  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Lagos /ˈleɪɡɒs/ (Yoruba: Èkó) is a city in the Nigerian state of <span class="loc">Lagos</span>. The conurbation is the largest city in <span class="loc">Nigeria</span> and the African continent. <span class="loc">Lagos</span> is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and also one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. <span class="loc">Lagos</span> is a major financial centre in <span class="loc">Africa</span>; the mega city has the highest GDP, and also houses one of the largest and busiest ports on the continent. <span class="loc">Lagos</span> initially emerged as a port city which originated on a collection of islands, which are contained in the present day Local Government Areas (LGAs) of <span class="loc">Lagos Island</span>, <span class="loc">Eti-Osa</span>, <span class="loc">Amuwo-Odofin</span> and <span class="loc">Apapa</span>; the islands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of <span class="loc">Lagos Lagoon</span>, while protected from the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach, which stretch up to 100 km (60 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanization, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present day Lagos Mainland, <span class="per">Ajeromi-Ifelodun</span> and <span class="per">Surulere</span>. This led to the classification of <span class="loc">Lagos</span> into two main areas - the Island, which was the initial <span class="loc">city of Lagos</span>, before it expanded into the area known as the Mainland. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the <span class="loc">Lagos City</span> Council, until the creation of <span class="loc">Lagos State</span> in <span class="date">1967</span>, which led to the splitting of <span class="loc">Lagos city</span> into the present day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and an addition of other towns (which <span class="date">now</span> make up 13 LGAs) from the then <span class="loc">Western Region</span>, to form the state.</p><br><br>
