<p><span class="loc">Changi</span> is a district located at the eastern end of <span class="loc">Singapore</span>. Sharing borders with <span class="loc">Pasir Ris</span> and <span class="loc">Tampines</span> to the west and <span class="loc">Changi</span> Bay to the east, <span class="loc">Changi</span>, excluding the two water catchments and islands of <span class="loc">Singapore</span>, is the largest district in the country by area. Today, <span class="loc">Changi</span> is an aviation hub. Being home to both <span class="loc">Changi Airport</span> and <span class="loc">Changi Air Base</span>. Also located within <span class="loc">Changi</span> is <span class="loc">Singapore</span>'s largest prison, <span class="loc">Changi Prison</span>. It became infamous as a Japanese prisoner of war camp during the occupation of <span class="loc">Singapore</span> in World War II. <span class="loc">Changi Prison</span> continues to be <span class="loc">Singapore</span>'s oldest operating internment facility, in the form of the new <span class="loc">Changi Prison</span> Complex. The early Malay place name of <span class="loc">Changi</span> was <span class="loc">Tanjong Rusa</span>, which is found in the 1604 E.G. de Eredia map of <span class="loc">Singapore</span>. The native place name <span class="loc">Changi</span> is found very early in <span class="loc">Singapore</span>'s history. In the 1828 map by Franklin and Jackson, the extreme southeastern tip of the island is referred to as <span class="loc">Tanjong Changi</span>. The local name <span class="loc">Changi</span> must have been a significant point for the Malays, especially in the days of the sixteenth century <span class="loc">Johor</span> kingdom located on the <span class="loc">Johor</span> River. Vessels using the <span class="loc">Johor Straits</span> would have to pass by <span class="loc">Changi</span>.</p>
