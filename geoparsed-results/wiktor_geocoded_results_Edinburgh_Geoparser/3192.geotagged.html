<p>Madison is a borough in <span class="loc">Morris County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the population was 15,845, reflecting a drop in population of 685 (âˆ’4.1%) from the 16,530 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 680 (+4.3%) from the 15,850 counted in the 1990 Census. It is known as "The <span class="loc">Rose City</span>" and was named in honor of President James Madison. Native Americans occupied the areas that would become <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> and Madison following the retreat of the <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> Glacier for many thousands of years. Settlements of the <span class="loc">Lenape</span> were agriculturally based following matrilineal lines.The protected lands nearby, Jockey Hollow, are what is remaining of the settlement. Occupation changed with the seasons, the variable nature of the climate, and to preserve the fertility of the rich soil. Their fishing and hunting territories were wide-ranging and similarly divided among the three clans of the matrilineal culture in this Eastern Woodland environment. Trade with these native peoples for food and furs was conducted by the Dutch during the period of colonization of New Netherland. Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the <span class="loc">Lenape</span>, Dutch <span class="loc">West India</span> Company policy required their colonists to purchase land that they settled, but typically, trading relationships were established in this area, rather than Dutch settlements.</p>
