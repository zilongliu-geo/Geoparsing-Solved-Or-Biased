<p><span class="loc">Lancaster</span> /ˈlæn.kæstər/ is a charter city in northern <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, in the Antelope Valley of the western <span class="loc">Mojave Desert</span> in Southern <span class="loc">California</span>. As of 2013, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> was the 31st largest city in <span class="loc">California</span>. <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is part of a twin city complex with its southern neighbor <span class="loc">Palmdale</span> and together they are the principal cities within the Antelope Valley region and <span class="loc">California</span>'s <span class="loc">High Desert</span>. <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is located approximately 70 miles (110 km) north (by highway) of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, near the <span class="loc">Kern County</span> line. It is separated from the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> Basin by the <span class="loc">San Gabriel Mountains</span> to the south, and from <span class="loc">Bakersfield</span> and the <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Joaquin</span> Valley by the <span class="loc">Tehachapi Mountains</span> to the north. The population of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> grew from 37,000 at the time of its incorporation in 1977 to over 156,000 in 2010. According to the Greater Antelope Valley Economic Alliance report of 2015, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> has a population of 168,049. The area where <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is now located, known as the Antelope Valley, was originally home to the Paiute Indians. <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>'s origins as a settlement start with the Southern Pacific Railroad, which is believed to first use the name <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, where a station house, locomotive watering facilities and section gang housing were built when the railroad laid track through the town's future location. In Sept. 18r the Southern Pacific completed the line through the Antelope Valley, linking <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. The origin of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>'s name is unclear, attributed variously to the surname of a railroad station clerk, the moniker given by railroad officials, or the former <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> home (<span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>) of unknown settlers. Train service brought passengers through the water-stop-turned-community, which, with the help of promotional literature, attracted new settlers. The person credited with formally developing the town is Moses Langley Wicks, who in 1884 bought property from the railroad for $2.50 per acre, mapped out a town with streets and lots, and by September was advertising 160-acre tracts of land for $6 an acre. The following year, the <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> News started publication, making it the first weekly newspaper in the Antelope Valley. By 1890, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> was bustling and booming, and thanks to adequate rainfall, farmers planted and sold thousands of acres of wheat and barley.</p>
