<p><span class="loc">Livingston</span> is an unincorporated community located in <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Once a thriving commercial center, <span class="loc">Livingston</span> was nearly deserted by the Civil War. Recent commercial and residential development has revived the lost community. In 1829, the county seat was moved from <span class="loc">Beatties Bluff</span> to <span class="loc">Livingston</span>. A courthouse and jail were built by 1833, and the town was incorporated in 1836. That same year, the county seat was officially moved to Canton, though <span class="loc">Livingston</span> "unofficially" remained the county seat until 1858, because its courthouse continued to be used until that year. <span class="loc">Livingston</span> became an important trading center for nearby plantations. A Methodist church was established in <span class="loc">Livingston</span> around 1830, and there was a Masonic Lodge from 1854 to 1866, when Union forces ransacked and destroyed it. By the 1850s, railways had been established across the county, and <span class="loc">Livingston</span> had been bypassed. Most of the town's residents moved and businesses shut down, though the post office remained until at least 1902. The only remains of the original town are a cemetery, and the foundation of the court square.</p>
