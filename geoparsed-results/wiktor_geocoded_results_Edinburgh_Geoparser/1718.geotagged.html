<p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is a community in the town of <span class="loc">Halton Hills</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> and is part of the <span class="loc">Regional Municipality of Halton</span>. It is situated on the <span class="loc">Credit River</span>, located approximately 60 km west of <span class="loc">Toronto</span>, making it part of the Greater Toronto Area. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> takes its name from George Kennedy, who settled in the area in 1821. By 1650, the once plentiful Hurons had been wiped out by European diseases, and the <span class="loc">Iroquois</span>. The region was now open to the Algonquian Ojibwa (also known as <span class="loc">Mississauga</span>), who moved in. By 1850 the remaining Mississauga natives were removed to the Six Nations reserve, where the New Credit Reserve was established. Commencing in 1781, the British government purchased blocks of land from the Mississauga Nation. In 1818, they purchased land that later became the townships of Esquesing and Nassagaweya. The task of laying out the townships fell to Timothy Street and Abraham Nelles. Charles Kennedy was hired by Nelles to survey the northern part of the townships, and Charles Kennedy received a significant parcel of land as payment for his work.</p>
