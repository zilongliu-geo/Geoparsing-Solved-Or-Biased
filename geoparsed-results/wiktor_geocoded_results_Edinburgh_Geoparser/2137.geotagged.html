It once produced over 400 short tons (360 t) of cast iron annually. In the winter of 1799, a small party of Indians, led by their chief, Captain Susap, joined the colonists at Troy, built their camps on the river and wintered near them. These Indians were nearly starving, which probably arose from the moose and deer, which formerly abounded here, being destroyed by the settlers. Their principal employment was making baskets, birch-bark cups and pails, and other Indian trinkets. They left in the spring and never returned. One of the party was a squaw, Molly Orcutt, who became quite noted among the settlers as a healer. She was found dead on Mount white Cap, in <span class="loc">East Andover</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, in 1817, having died, it is believed, at an age of 140 years.</p>
