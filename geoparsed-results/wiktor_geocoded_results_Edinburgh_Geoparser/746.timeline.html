  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Windsor</span> is a town lying <span class="loc">west of Sydney</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Windsor</span> is located in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Hawkesbury</span>. It sits on the <span class="loc">Hawkesbury River</span>, on the north-western outskirts of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> metropolitan area. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Windsor</span> had a population of 1,803. <span class="loc">Windsor</span> is the third-oldest place of British settlement on <span class="org">the Australian</span> continent. Settlement at the location was first established about <span class="date">1791</span>, near the head of navigation on the <span class="loc">Hawkesbury River</span> (known as Deerubbin in Dharuk) and taking advantage of the fertile river flats for agriculture. The area was originally called <span class="loc">Green Hills</span>, but renamed <span class="loc">Windsor</span> (after <span class="loc">Windsor</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>). The town was officially proclaimed in a Government and <span class="per">General Order</span> issued from Government House, <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, dated <span class="date">15 December 1810</span>, Governor <span class="per">Lachlan Macquarie</span> having "marked out the district of <span class="loc">Green Hills</span>", which he "... called <span class="loc">Windsor</span>", after Windsor-on-the-Thames. While in <span class="loc">Windsor</span>, <span class="per">Macquarie</span> ordered the main institutions of organised settlement to be erected, such as a church, school-house, gaol and "commodious inn" (The <span class="per">Macquarie</span> Arms). Of these new buildings, the most outstanding was <span class="per">Francis Greenway</span>'s <span class="per">Saint Matthew</span>'s Anglican Church, for which <span class="per">Macquarie</span> himself chose the site. <span class="per">Samuel Marsden</span>, principal chaplain of the colony, consecrated the church on <span class="date">8 December 1822</span>.</p><br><br>
