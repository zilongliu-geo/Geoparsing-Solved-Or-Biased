  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greenville</span>, commonly known as <span class="loc">Edgemont</span>, is a census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Greenburgh in <span class="loc">Westchester County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,116 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The majority of its residents refer to it as <span class="loc">Edgemont</span> and that is the name of its school district. It is a suburb of New <span class="loc">York City</span>, lying 22 miles (35 km) north of <span class="loc">Columbus Circle</span>. It is a bedroom community, with many of its residents working in Midtown Manhattan. Other workplaces of Greenville residents are in the office parks of <span class="loc">White Plains</span>, <span class="loc">Purchase</span>, <span class="loc">Armonk</span>, <span class="loc">Westport</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> or <span class="loc">Stamford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, as well as many local businesses in southern <span class="loc">Westchester County</span>. The limits of the CDP are essentially defined by the areas served by the <span class="org">Edgemont Union Free School District</span> and the <span class="org">Greenville Fire Department</span>. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was originally a development designed by different architects for <span class="date">summer</span> homes for Manhattanites. With its antique colonial homes and outstanding schools, it is an attractive option for those seeking to move from New <span class="loc">York City</span>. Metro-North trains are accessible via the <span class="loc">Scarsdale</span> and <span class="loc">Hartsdale</span> train stations, and they run 25â€“46 minutes to <span class="loc">Grand Central Terminal</span>, depending on if one has an express or local train.</p><br><br>
