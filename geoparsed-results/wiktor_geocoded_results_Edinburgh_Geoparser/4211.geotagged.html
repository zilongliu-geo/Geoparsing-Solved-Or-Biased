<p>Livermore (formerly Livermores, <span class="loc">Livermore Ranch</span>, and <span class="loc">Nottingham</span>) is a city in <span class="loc">Alameda County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. With an estimated 2014 population of 86,870, Livermore is the most populous city in the Tri-Valley. Livermore is located on the eastern edge of <span class="loc">California</span>'s <span class="loc">San</span> Francisco Bay Area. Livermore was founded by William Mendenhall and named after Robert Livermore, his friend and a local rancher who settled in the area in the 1840s. Livermore is the home of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, for which the chemical element livermorium is named (and thus, placing the city's name in the periodic table). Livermore is also the <span class="loc">California</span> site of <span class="loc">Sandia National Laboratories</span>, which is headquartered in <span class="loc">Albuquerque</span>, <span class="loc">NM</span>.

The <span class="loc">Livermore</span> Valley is located about 30 miles (48 km) east of and behind the first coastal range of mountains that surround the <span class="loc">San</span> Francisco Bay Area. The <span class="loc">Livermore</span> Valley has an east-west orientation with mountain passes on the west and east connecting the <span class="loc">San</span> Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley. The passes are used by railroads and highways to connect the <span class="loc">San</span> Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley. <span class="loc">Livermore</span> Valley is about 15 miles (24 km) long (east to west), 10 miles (16 km) wide (north to south), and surrounded by <span class="loc">California</span> coastal range mountains and foothills.</p>
