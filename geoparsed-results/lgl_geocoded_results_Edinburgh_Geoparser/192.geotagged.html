<p>Gainesville man gets 15 years for killing baby. A Gainesville man cut a plea deal minutes before a jury was to be selected to determine whether he murdered an 11-month-old boy. Tony Servance Jr., 20, the boyfriend of the Markel Barton’s mother, pleaded no contest to second-degree murder for Markel’s death in November 2007. According to court records, Servance was alone with Markel when the baby stopped breathing. Servance reportedly gave police at least two versions of what happened to Markel. An autopsy showed there was blunt-force trauma to the baby’s head, which caused the internal bleeding that resulted in death. Acting Circuit Judge Mary Day Coker sentenced Servance to 15 years in prison to be followed by 24 months of probation and also ordered him to attend anger management classes. Markel’s mother chose not to make a statement during sentencing.</p>
