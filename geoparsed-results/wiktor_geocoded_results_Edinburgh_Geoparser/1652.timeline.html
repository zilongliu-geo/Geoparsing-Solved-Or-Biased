According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 69,911. In the <span class="date">2013</span> election, it had 45,468 registered voters. <span class="loc">Bogo</span> is located in the northeastern coast of <span class="loc">Cebu province</span>, on the principal island of <span class="per">Cebu</span>. It is 101 kilometres (63 mi) from <span class="loc">Cebu City</span> and is accessible by land and sea. <span class="loc">Bogo</span> has an area of 103.5 square kilometres (40.0 sq mi), which constitutes 2.3% of the area of <span class="per">Cebu</span> island and 2.1% of the total land area of <span class="loc">Cebu province</span>. The city marches with: <span class="loc">Medellin</span> to the north, <span class="loc">San Remigio</span> to the west, and <span class="loc">Tabogon</span> to the south; on the east it is bound by <span class="loc">Camotes Sea</span>. <span class="loc">Bogo</span> comprises 29 barangays: The <span class="date">year 1600</span> saw the founding of a real settlement which was subsequently transformed into a barangay with small huts made of cogon grass and bamboo, standing where the <span class="org">Bogo Central Extension</span> <span class="date">now</span> stands. While the barangay was then part of another community in the north (<span class="date">today</span>'s town of <span class="loc">Daanbantayan</span>), the natives enjoyed tacit freedom of self-rule although they continued to pay tributes and taxes to the chieftain of <span class="loc">Daanbantayan</span>. This barangay grew in prominence and for this reason, it was separated from <span class="loc">Daanbantayan</span>. In <span class="date">January 1850</span> the <span class="per">Bishop of Cebu</span>, appointed Spanish friar Fr <span class="per">Jaime Micalot</span> as the first parish priest of <span class="loc">Bogo</span> and decreed <span class="loc">Saint Vincent Ferrer</span> as the town's patron saint.</p><br><br>
