<p><span class="loc">Northern Province</span> is one of <span class="loc">Zambia</span>'s ten provinces. It covers approximately one sixth of <span class="loc">Zambia</span> in land area. The provincial capital is <span class="loc">Kasama</span>. The province is made up of 8 districts, namely <span class="loc">Kasama</span> (the provincial capital), <span class="loc">Chilubi</span>, <span class="loc">Kaputa</span>, <span class="loc">Luwingu</span>, <span class="loc">Mbala</span>, <span class="loc">Mporokoso</span>, <span class="loc">Mpulungu</span> and <span class="loc">Mungwi</span>. Currently, only <span class="loc">Kasama</span> and <span class="loc">Mbala</span> have attained municipal council status, while the rest are still district councils. It is widely considered to be the heartland of the <span class="loc">Bemba</span>, one of the largest tribes in <span class="loc">Zambia</span>. Since this article was published the new <span class="loc">Muchinga Province</span> has taken the Eastern districts of <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> and <span class="loc">Chama</span> district to form <span class="loc">Zambia</span>'s tenth province. Notable landmarks in <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> include <span class="loc">Lake Tanganyika</span>, <span class="loc">Lake Bangweulu</span>, and the corresponding wetlands, Lake Mweru-wa-Ntipa, and a number of waterfalls including <span class="loc">Lumangwe Falls</span>, <span class="loc">Kabwelume</span> Falls, <span class="loc">Chishimba</span> and <span class="loc">Kalambo Falls</span>. Efforts are being made by the Zambian government, along with a number of non-governmental organizations, to increase the visibility of the many natural and historical treasures in the <span class="loc">Northern Province</span>. Tourism has proven an effective way to bring economic growth in other parts of <span class="loc">Zambia</span>, i.e. <span class="loc">Livingstone</span> and <span class="loc">Victoria Falls</span>. However, a lack of infrastructure along the vast distances between major points of interest makes visiting this part of the country difficult.</p>
