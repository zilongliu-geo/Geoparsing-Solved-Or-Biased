  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Palmerston</span> (population 10,599 in <span class="date">2011</span>) is an unincorporated community located at the south end of the town of <span class="loc">Minto</span> in northern part of <span class="loc">Wellington County</span> in <span class="loc">southern Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. <span class="loc">Palmerston</span> was a key division point for the Grand Trunk and later the Canadian National Railway in Southwestern Ontario with 65 subdivisions; <span class="loc">Owen Sound</span>, <span class="loc">Kincardine</span>, <span class="loc">Durham</span>, <span class="loc">Fergus</span>, <span class="loc">Guelph Junction</span> and <span class="loc">Stratford</span>. In its original concept the railroad was to run from <span class="loc">Guelph</span> to <span class="loc">Harriston</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and would not have gone through <span class="loc">Palmerston</span>. <span class="loc">Listowel</span> needed to be linked to the railroad and it was decided to bend the route toward <span class="loc">Listowel</span>. It was also decided that a yard with maintenance shops would be needed. The mainline under <span class="org">Canadian National</span> ownership became part of the <span class="loc">Fergus</span>, <span class="loc">Owen Sound</span> and <span class="loc">Southampton Subdivisions</span>. Passenger service ceased in <span class="date">1971</span>. The subdivisions were abandoned starting with <span class="loc">Fergus</span> to <span class="loc">Palmerston</span> <span class="date">August 1983</span>, <span class="loc">Harriston</span> Jct. to <span class="loc">Port Elgin</span> and <span class="loc">Southampton</span> in <span class="date">1988</span>, <span class="loc">Guelph</span> to <span class="loc">Fergus</span> <span class="date">1988</span> and <span class="loc">Palmerston</span> to <span class="loc">Harriston</span> <span class="date">1995</span>. And all rail service terminated in <span class="date">1996</span> with CN abandoning the line from <span class="loc">Stratford</span> to <span class="loc">Harriston</span>.</p><br><br>
