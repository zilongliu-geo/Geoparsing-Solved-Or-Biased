<p>Mitchell (sometimes known as Michael or St Michael's) is a village in mid <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is situated 14 miles (22 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Redruth</span> and 17 miles (27 km) west-southwest of <span class="loc">Bodmin</span> on the A30 trunk road. Mitchell straddles the old course of the A30 road but a dual carriageway bypass now carries the traffic north of the village. A 16th-century coaching inn called the Plume of Feathers stands in the main street. The original name was La Medeshole and the first recorded mention of the village was in a court case in 1234 establishing the legal status of an annual market on <span class="loc">St Francis</span>'s Day. A chapel of <span class="loc">St Francis</span> for the use of wayfarers existed from 1239 until its destruction at the Reformation. From the Middle Ages on, the <span class="loc">borough of Mitchell</span> elected two members to the Unreformed House of Commons but was disenfranchised by the Reform Act 1832. Walter Raleigh and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington were both MPs representing Mitchell. At <span class="loc">Carland Cross</span>, a mile west of Mitchell, there are Iron Age burial mounds and flint arrow heads have been found in local fields.</p>
