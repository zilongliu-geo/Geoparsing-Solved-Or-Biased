<p>A "white powder" has been discovered at the Michael J. Dillon courthouse at 68 Court Street in downtown Buffalo, <span class="loc">New York</span>. According to Buffalo Fire Chief, Don Mcfeely, "a call was placed to 911 at approximately 1:58 p.m. [EST], by a woman working on the third floor" of the courthouse after she opened a "letter which contained a suspicious white powder." The building was immediately evacuated, which had at least 200 people in it, but it is unknown where the occupants of the building went, as only fire, police, and government officials were observed around the outside of the building. No decontamination site was seen, but according to witnesses, Hazmat officials were seen entering the building with bio-hazard suits. Mcfeely also stated that the letter "contained codes," but would not elaborate on what the codes were or what they meant and that a "message was written on the letter which suggested that the powder was harmful." Preliminary tests performed on the scene determined that the powder was not Anthrax, but the test did not "rule out anything else that maybe harmful," stated Mcfeely. "The letter has been removed from the building and has been taken to the FBI field office in Buffalo for further tests." The letter was not addressed to anyone specifically, being addressed to just the courthouse itself.</p>
