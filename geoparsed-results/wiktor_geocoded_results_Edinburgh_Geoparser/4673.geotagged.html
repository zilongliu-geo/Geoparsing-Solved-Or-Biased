<p>Warburton is a town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 72 kilometres east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>'s central business district. Its local government area is the Shire of Yarra Ranges. At the 2011 census, Warburton had a population of 2,171. The name "Warburton" has been shared between two townships over the years. The mining town of "Yankee Jim's Creek" was located on the gold-bearing slopes of Mount <span class="loc">Little Joe</span>, and was renamed "Warburton" after the mining warden of the district, Charles Warburton <span class="loc">Carr</span>. Gold depletion caused a declining population in the 1880s, so the town was renamed "Old Warburton" and the town of "Upper Warburton" on the banks on the <span class="loc">Yarra River</span> was renamed "Warburton". The Post Office opened around 1884. Two earlier offices named Warburton were renamed as Launching Place and Hoddle's Creek. Warburton was connected to <span class="loc">Lilydale</span> by a Victorian Railways branch line, which was closed in 1965. The railway path is now used for the <span class="loc">Lilydale</span> to Warburton Rail Trail, a rail trail used by pedestrians, cyclists, and horse-riders.</p>
