<p><span class="loc">Guildford</span> is a small settlement situated on the <span class="loc">Loddon River</span>, 130 kilometres (81 mi) north-west of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located on the Midland Highway between <span class="loc">Daylesford</span> and <span class="loc">Castlemaine</span>. The population recorded at the 2011 census was 245. Facilities in the town include a post office (in a building dating from 1901), hotel, community hall and a general store. It is thought that the town was named after <span class="loc">Guildford</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. The area was known as Yarrayne to the original inhabitants of the area, the Jajowarrung people. The first European to explore the area was Major Thomas Mitchell in 1836. By the 1840s pastoral runs had been established and, in the following decade, gold miners flocked to the area during the rush at the <span class="loc">Mount Alexander</span> goldfields. The largest encampment of Chinese miners in Victoria (estimates vary from 5000-6000 individual miners) was situated at the junction of the <span class="loc">Loddon River</span> and <span class="loc">Campbells Creek</span>. Tensions ran high between the white miners and the Chinese which erupted in numerous local conflicts. This anti-Chinese hostility, combined with discriminatory taxation against Chinese miners, saw the Chinese population dwindle and eventually all but disappear by the end of the gold rush.</p>
