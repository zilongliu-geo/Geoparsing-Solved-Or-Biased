  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Concordia</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Bolivar County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, located on the eastern edge of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Levee, approximately 2.5 mi (4.0 km) west of <span class="loc">Mississippi Highway</span> 1. Once an important <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River shipping point for cotton, little remains of the community but a cemetery. <span class="loc">Concordia</span> is one of the oldest communities in <span class="loc">Bolivar County</span>. The Concordia Cemetery, located south of the community, has been used since <span class="date">1848</span>, and is marked with a historic plaque. The Concordia Methodist Church was also located there. <span class="loc">Concordia</span> was officially formed in <span class="date">1866</span>, and included "Carson's Landing", located north of the settlement. <span class="loc">Concordia</span> had a population of about 250 by <span class="date">1879</span>, when yellow fever struck, killing half the population. The town was quarantined for a period. When the <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> and <span class="loc">Texas Railway</span> was built in <span class="date">1889</span>, it passed 3 mi (4.8 km) east of the town, and many residents abandoned <span class="loc">Concordia</span> and moved to the nearby railway town of <span class="loc">Gunnison</span>. The town became further isolated sometime prior to <span class="date">1939</span>, when the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River changed its course. The river had previously followed the "Concordia Bend", with the town located on the east bank. Following the diversion, the main channel of the river moved approximately 5 mi (8.0 km) west, creating "<span class="loc">Old River Lake</span>", and oxbow lake, as well as Island No. 70 and Island No. 71.</p><br><br>
