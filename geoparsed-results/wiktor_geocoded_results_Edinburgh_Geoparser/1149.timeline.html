  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">El Paso</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Woodford</span> and <span class="loc">McLean</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The population was 2,810 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The <span class="loc">Woodford County</span> portion of <span class="loc">El Paso</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Peoria</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">El Paso</span> is a small community in central <span class="loc">Illinois</span> that took on more characteristics of a highway community after the construction of Interstate 39, which supplanted the older alignment of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 51. In addition, <span class="loc">El Paso</span> is a potential stop for Chicago-Peoria traffic via <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 24. <span class="loc">El Paso</span> was founded by <span class="per">George Gibson</span> and <span class="per">James Wathen</span>. Gibson named the city "<span class="loc">El Paso</span>" after <span class="loc">El Paso</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, or from the passing or crossing of two railroads. In <span class="date">August 1975</span>, the city became the last locality in the contiguous <span class="loc">United States</span> to convert its telephone service from manual switching; prior to that time, telephones in the city could not be dialed directly from any outside location, the assistance of an operator being necessary to place the call, and local telephone numbers consisted of four digits. (Certain parts of the outer <span class="loc">Aleutian</span> Islands of <span class="loc">Alaska</span> could not be dialed directly until <span class="date">the early 1980s</span>.)</p><br><br>
