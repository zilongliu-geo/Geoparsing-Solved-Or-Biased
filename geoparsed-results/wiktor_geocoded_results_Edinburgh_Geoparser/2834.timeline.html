As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 101,407. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Gettysburg</span>. The county was created on <span class="date">January 22, 1800</span>, from part of <span class="loc">York County</span> and named in honor of the second President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="per">John Adams</span>. On 1â€“3 <span class="date">July 1863</span>, <span class="loc">Gettysburg</span> and its vicinity was the site of the pivotal battle of the American Civil War, and as a result is a center for Civil War tourism. <span class="loc">Adams County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Gettysburg</span>, <span class="loc">PA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Harrisburg-York-Lebanon, <span class="org">PA Combined Statistical Area</span>.

The <span class="loc">Borough of Gettysburg</span> is located at the center of <span class="loc">Adams County</span>. This county seat community is surrounded on three sides by the <span class="loc">Gettysburg</span> National Military Park (GNMP). The <span class="org">Eisenhower National Historic Site</span> adjoins GNMP on its southwest edge. Most of <span class="loc">Adams County</span>'s rural landscapes and its mid-19th century roadway pattern remain intact <span class="date">today</span>. Thirteen historic roadways converge at or near <span class="loc">Gettysburg Borough</span>. Two circular rings of towns surround <span class="loc">Gettysburg</span>; the first ring is typically found at a distance of about 7 miles (11 km) from <span class="loc">Gettysburg</span>. The second ring is found at a distance of 12 to 15 miles (24 km) from the County Seat. This "spokes and wheel" pattern represents one of the few examples of Central Place Theory in the Eastern <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p><br><br>
