<p>Over 40 children have died in an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in <span onClick="goto_name('China')" class="loc">China</span>, and the country's capital of <span onClick="goto_name('Beijing')" class="loc">Beijing</span> reported its first death due to the disease on Wednesday. According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing Health Bureau spokeswoman Deng Xiaohong said that the 13-month-old boy died Sunday while en route to the hospital. Health authorities state that 24,934 children in mainland <span onClick="goto_name('China')" class="loc">China</span> are afflicted with the disease, and 42 children have died from it. The cause of the disease has been identified as Enterovirus 71 (EV-71). HFMD can also be caused by Coxsackievirus. Another child infected with the virus died Monday, but as he died in <span onClick="goto_name('Hebei province')" class="loc">Hebei province</span> his death was counted there. Xinhua News Agency also reported that a 21-month-old boy died Monday of the virus in <span onClick="goto_name('Hubei province')" class="loc">Hubei province</span>. After an order was given last week by the Ministry of Health of the <span onClick="goto_name('People_s Republic of China')" class="loc">People's Republic of China</span> that all cases must be reported, the count of those infected has increased markedly. Eastern <span onClick="goto_name('China')" class="loc">China</span> saw a large number of cases in early March, but this information was not made public until late April. In March, Children under age six in <span onClick="goto_name('eastern Anhui province')" class="loc">eastern Anhui province</span> began being admitted to hospitals with symptoms of the virus, and the outbreak spread quickly after that. The <span onClick="goto_name('city of Fuyang')" class="loc">city of Fuyang</span> in <span onClick="goto_name('Anhui province')" class="loc">Anhui province</span> was especially hard-hit by the outbreak. "The majority of patients who were in critical condition have recovered," said a Health Ministry official in a statement on Monday. As of Monday, 3,606 HFMD infections had been reported in <span onClick="goto_name('Beijing')" class="loc">Beijing</span>. Deaths have occurred in the <span onClick="goto_name('provinces of Anhui')" class="loc">provinces of Anhui</span>, Guangdong, Guangxi, <span onClick="goto_name('Hainan')" class="loc">Hainan</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Hunan')" class="loc">Hunan</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Zhejiang')" class="loc">Zhejiang</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Beijing')" class="loc">Beijing</span> and <span onClick="goto_name('Hubei')" class="loc">Hubei</span>. "What I know is the death rate has gone down drastically since early May. There are very, very few cases with complications — 99 percent of these are mild cases," said World Health Organization (WHO) <span onClick="goto_name('China')" class="loc">China</span> representative Hans Troedsson in a statement on Wednesday. Incidents of the disease are expected to peak in June and July. <span onClick="goto_name('China')" class="loc">China</span> is also dealing with a magnitude-7.9 earthquake which hit the country Monday and has killed almost 15,000. The outbreak is a concern to the government, as the country prepares for the 2008 Summer Olympics in <span onClick="goto_name('Beijing')" class="loc">Beijing</span> this August. "We are confident the potential outbreak will not affect the <span onClick="goto_name('Beijing')" class="loc">Beijing</span> Olympic Games," China's Health Ministry spokesman Mao Qunan stated. And at a joint press conference held by China's Ministry of Health and the WHO, he further noted that, "<span onClick="goto_name('China')" class="loc">China</span> is confident that it can control the spread of the disease with effective prevention methods."</p>
