<p><span class="loc">Edinburg</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Hidalgo County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 81,029 according to the 2012 census estimate. <span class="loc">Edinburg</span> is part of the McAllen–Edinburg–Mission and <span class="loc">Reynosa–McAllen metropolitan</span> areas. In 1908, John Closner, William Briggs, Argyle McAllen, Plutarco de la Viña and Dennis B. Chapin developed a new community (the town square of which is now located at the crossroads of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 281 and State Highway 107). The town was named Chapin in honor of one of the developers. It is a local myth that <span class="loc">Edinburg</span> became the county seat of <span class="loc">Hidalgo County</span> in a dramatic, nighttime covert operation in which the county records were removed from the previous county seat. However, historical records show more practical reasons. The original <span class="loc">Hidalgo County</span> Courthouse in the <span class="loc">City of Hidalgo</span> was under frequent danger of flooding because of the town's proximity to the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>, which sometimes encroached on the building. Additionally, <span class="loc">Texas</span> law required that the courthouse be close to the geographic center of the county. When Dennis Chapin was involved in the shooting death of Oscar J. Rountree at the <span class="loc">Dan</span> <span class="loc">Breen Saloon</span> in <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, the community changed its name to <span class="loc">Edinburg</span> to honor <span class="loc">John Young</span>, a prominent businessman who was born in <span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. The town was officially named in 1911 and incorporated in 1919.</p>
