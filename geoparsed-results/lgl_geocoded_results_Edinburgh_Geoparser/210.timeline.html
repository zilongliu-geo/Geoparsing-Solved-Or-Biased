  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>OSCE Envoy Condemns Dvani Attack that Killed One Policeman. “Such incidents are further raising tensions in an already fragile environment,” he said in a statement. “The Georgian authorities are still investigating, but there seems little doubt that this was a deliberately targeted attack.” “They also underline the importance of the presence of the OSCE Military Observers who are able to monitor such incidents and credibly report on them,” he added. Police pickup type vehicle with 5 policemen exploded on a mine while patrolling area near the village <span class="loc">Dvani</span>, which is seven kilometers south-west of the breakaway region’s capital Tskhinvali. Support police car, assisting the wounded police crew, was blown up by a second mine about 15 minutes after the first explosion. <span class="org">EU Monitoring Mission</span> in <span class="loc">Georgia</span> (EUMM) said the first explosion seemed to be triggered by a trip-wire. OSCE chairperson’s special envoy said “little doubt that this was a deliberately targeted attack.”</p><br><br>
