  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Liverpool</span> is a Canadian community and former town located along the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> of <span class="org">the Province of Nova</span> Scotia's <span class="loc">South Shore</span>. It is situated within <span class="org">the Region of Queens Municipality</span> which is the local governmental unit that comprises all of <span class="loc">Queens County</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>. <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>'s harbour was an ancient seasonal camp of <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>'s native Mi'kmaq and was known as Ogomkigeak meaning "dry sandy place" and Ogukegeok, meaning "place of departure". <span class="per">Samuel de Champlain</span> originally named the harbour <span class="per">Port Rossignol</span>, in honour of <span class="per">Captain Rossignol</span>, an early 17th-century founder of New <span class="loc">France</span> in <span class="loc">North America</span> who used the harbour for fur trading. Later <span class="per">Nicolas Denys</span>, a pioneering 17th-century French explorer and trader of <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>, was granted land here by the leader of <span class="per">Acadia, Isaac</span> de Razilly (c. <span class="date">1632</span>). Following the Expulsion of the Acadians during the French and <span class="org">Indian War</span> (<span class="date">1754</span>–<span class="date">1763</span>), <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> was founded by New <span class="loc">England</span> Planters (commercially organized settlers) as a fishing port in <span class="date">1759</span>, originally named <span class="per">Lingley</span> after Admiral <span class="per">Charles Lingley</span>, and then renamed after <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> in <span class="loc">England</span> – which also lies along its own <span class="loc">Mersey River</span>. <span class="per">Silvanus Cobb</span> was an original proprietor of the town. In <span class="date">1759</span> <span class="per">Capt. Cobb</span> became a proprietor of the new township of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>. <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> township was to run from <span class="loc">Cape Sable Island</span> to Port Medway and continuing 14 miles inland from the shore. Sylvanus transported many of the other original residents to the new settlement. On <span class="date">July 1, 1760</span>, at the first meeting of the proprietors, <span class="per">Capt. Cobb</span> made a petition to be granted a piece of land to build a house and a wharf. The land was granted and the house was built at the foot of present day <span class="loc">Wolfe</span> Street. There is a park and monument to <span class="loc">Cobb</span> at the site of his original home which was built from materials he transported from <span class="loc">New England</span>.</p><br><br>
