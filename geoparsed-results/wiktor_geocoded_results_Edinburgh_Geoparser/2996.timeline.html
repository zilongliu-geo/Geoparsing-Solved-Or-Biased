  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Worcester</span> (/ˈwʊstər/ WUUSS-tər, locally also /ˈwᵻstə/ WISS-tə) is a city and the historic county seat of <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> until <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> disbanded county government in <span class="date">1998</span>. Named after <span class="loc">Worcester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, as of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census the city's population was 181,045, making it the second largest city in <span class="loc">New England</span> after <span class="loc">Boston</span>. <span class="loc">Worcester</span> is located approximately 40 miles (64 km) west of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, and 38 miles (61 km) east of <span class="loc">Springfield</span>. Due to its location in Central <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, amidst <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>' major metropolitan regions, <span class="loc">Worcester</span> is known as the "<span class="org">Heart of the Commonwealth</span>", thus, a heart is the official symbol of the city. However, the heart symbol may also have its provenance in lore <span class="date">that Valentine's Day</span> cards were invented in the city. <span class="loc">Worcester</span> was considered its own region for <span class="date">centuries</span>; however, with the encroachment of <span class="loc">Boston</span>'s suburbs in <span class="date">the 1970s</span> after the construction of Interstate 495 and Interstate 290, it <span class="date">now</span> marks the western periphery of the Boston-Worcester-Providence (MA-RI-NH) <span class="org">U.S. Census Combined Statistical Area</span> (CSA), or Greater <span class="loc">Boston</span>. The city features many examples of Victorian-era mill architecture.</p><br><br>
