  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Trindade</span> is a city and municipality in Goi치s state, <span class="loc">Brazil</span>. It is famous for the religious celebrations held there in <span class="date">July</span> and is <span class="date">now</span> the third most important pilgrimage site in <span class="loc">Brazil</span>. On the west side of the city is a purpose-built raceway where, in <span class="date">2014</span>, the city hosted a MotoCross World Championship, <span class="per">Grand Prix</span> race. <span class="loc">Trindade</span> is part of the Goi칙nia Microregion, which has over one million six hundred thousand inhabitants. It is located approximately 30 km. west of Goi칙nia, to which it is connected by a four-lane highway, GO-060. Although <span class="loc">Trindade</span> became a city in <span class="date">1943</span>, its origins go back to <span class="date">1840</span>, when, according to local folklore, in a small village called <span class="loc">Barro</span> <span class="loc">Preto</span> <span class="loc">Constantino</span> Xavier and his wife <span class="loc">Ana Rosa</span> found in their fields a small clay medallion showing the <span class="loc">Holy Trinity</span> crowning the <span class="org">Virgin</span> Mary. Soon a palm covered chapel was raised to be later replaced by a mortar chapel covered with tiles. Lands were donated by local farmers and a religious shrine began to take form. Followers decided to embellish the simple clay medallion and it was taken to Piren칩polis to be worked on by the greatest artist of the region. The original clay medallion returned to <span class="loc">Trindade</span> substituted by a wooden representation and that is what is seen by pilgrims <span class="date">today</span> in the main church.</p><br><br>
