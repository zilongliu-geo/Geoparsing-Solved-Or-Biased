<p><span class="loc">Bowling Green</span> students endorse fee for new arena. <span class="loc">BOWLING GREEN</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span> (AP) &#x97; Students at <span class="loc">Bowling Green</span> State University have voted to approve a fee to help build a new campus arena. In an online vote, 2,630 undergraduates cast ballots in favor of the $60-per-semester fee, and 1,182 opposed it. The school said Saturday that about 28 percent of the eligible student population voted. Public universities must get an OK from the Ohio Board of Regents before they can raise fees, and a show of student support is a requirement for that approval. Collection of the new student fee wouldn't begin until the $36 million arena is finished in late 2011. The proposed 4,700-seat arena would replace <span class="loc">Anderson Arena</span> as the home for basketball and volleyball games and would also would be used for concerts and other events.</p>
