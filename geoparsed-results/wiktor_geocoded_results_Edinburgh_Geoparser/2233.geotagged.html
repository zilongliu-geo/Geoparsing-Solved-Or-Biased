<p>Melrose, Montana, once known as "<span class="loc">Camp Creek</span>", had its early beginnings as a tiny stage stop along the <span class="loc">Big Hole River</span> that would eventually become a terminus for the railroad, a shipping and receiving point for the Hecla Consolidated Mining Company and Bryant Mining District, consisting of <span class="loc">Hecla</span>, Lion City, Greenwood, <span class="loc">Norwood</span>, and <span class="loc">Glendale</span>. The area along the <span class="loc">Big Hole River</span> was settled as early as 1870, three families shared the valley, Jefferson McCauley, John Stone and William Bowe. In 1875, William Bowe bought out two squatters giving them a combined total of $250.00. William Bowe pre-empted 160 acres of land and subsequently added 80 acres of Desert land. William built himself a modest home in 1875 and later purchased a structure in Rocker which he moved to <span class="loc">Camp Creek</span> (later Melrose), establishing himself as a Stage Stop and Hotel Entrepreneur. On December 25, 1876, William was married to Lucina Phillips who had recently divorced Adam Fleser of whom "<span class="loc">Fleser</span> Mountain" was named. She brought four children from this marriage and settled with William Bowe in their Hotel/Stage Stop. <span class="loc">Lucina</span> was no stranger to greeting and caring for travelers as her ex-husband Adam also operated a tiny stage stop along the base of Mount Fleser. It is likely that the married couple mutually agreed to operate the stage stop together as <span class="loc">Lucina</span> could tend to the meals and needs of the traveler while Billy could provide stable and other services.</p>
