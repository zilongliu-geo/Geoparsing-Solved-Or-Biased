<p><span class="loc">Dandong</span> (simplified Chinese: 丹东; traditional Chinese: 丹東; pinyin: Dāndōng), previously known as <span class="loc">Andong</span>, is a prefecture-level city in <span class="loc">southeastern Liaoning province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. It is the largest Chinese border city, facing <span class="loc">Sinuiju</span>, <span class="loc">North Korea</span> across the <span class="loc">Yalu River</span>, which demarcates the Sino-North Korean border. To the southwest of the city, the river flows into <span class="loc">Korea Bay</span>. <span class="loc">Dandong</span> has therefore had a dynamic history because of its strategic location for the northeast's rich natural resources and because of its convenient access to the ocean. It is designated as a major export production centre for the province, and is a port city connected by rail with <span class="loc">Shenyang</span> and <span class="loc">Sinuiju</span>. A significant amount of trade with <span class="loc">North Korea</span> flows through the city. The size of the administrative city (prefecture) is 14,981.4 square kilometres (5,784.4 sq mi). As of 2010, the built-up area made of 3 urban districts is 830 square kilometres (320 sq mi) in size and had 865,576 inhabitants. The administrative city contained approximately 2.45 million inhabitants as of the 2010 census. The <span class="loc">Hushan</span> <span class="loc">Great Wall</span>, the far eastern end of the <span class="loc">Great Wall</span> of <span class="loc">China</span>, is located here.</p>
