  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dinan</span> (French: [di.nɑ̃]) is a walled Breton town and a commune in the Côtes-d'Armor department in northwestern <span class="loc">France</span>. Its geographical setting is exceptional. Instead of nestling on the valley floor like <span class="loc">Morlaix</span>, most urban development has been on the hillside, overlooking the river <span class="loc">Rance</span>. The area alongside the River <span class="loc">Rance</span> is known as the port of <span class="loc">Dinan</span> and is connected to the town by the steep streets Rue Jerzual and its continuation outside the walls the <span class="per">Rue de Petit</span> Fort. This river has moderate turbidity and its brownish water is somewhat low in velocity due to the slight gradient of the watercourse; pH levels have been measured at 8.13 within the <span class="loc">city of Dinan</span> and electrical conductivity of the waters have tested at 33 micro-siemens per centimetre. In the centre of <span class="loc">Dinan</span> the <span class="loc">Rance</span> <span class="date">summer</span> flows are typically in the range of 500 cubic feet per second (14 m3/s). For <span class="date">many years</span>, the bridge over the River <span class="loc">Rance</span> at <span class="loc">Dinan</span> was the most northerly crossing point on the river, but the tidal power station at the mouth of the estuary, constructed in <span class="date">the 1960s</span> downstream from <span class="loc">Dinan</span>, incorporates a 750 metre long tidal barrage which doubles as a crossing point nearer to the sea.</p><br><br>
