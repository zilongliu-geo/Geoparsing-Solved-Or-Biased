<p><span class="loc">Fuxi</span> (/fu˧˥ɕi˥/; Chinese: 伏羲) or <span class="loc">Fu Xi</span>, also romanized as <span class="loc">Fu-hsi</span>, is a culture hero in Chinese legend and mythology, credited (along with his sister Nü Wa) with creating humanity and the invention of hunting, fishing and cooking as well as the Cangjie system of writing Chinese characters c. 12,000 BCE. He was also known as Paoxi (t 庖犧, s 庖牺), also romanized as Pao-hsi. <span class="loc">Fu Xi</span> was counted as the first of the Three Sovereigns at the beginning of the Chinese dynastic period. On one of the columns of the Fu Xi Temple in <span class="loc">Gansu Province</span>, the following couplet describes <span class="loc">Fu Xi</span>'s importance: "Among the three primogenitors of Huaxia civilization, <span class="loc">Fu Xi</span> in <span class="loc">Huaiyang Country</span> ranks first." During the time of his predecessor Nü Wa (who, according to some sources, was also his wife and/or sister), society was matriarchal and primitive. Childbirth was seen to be miraculous, not requiring the participation of the male, and children only knew their mothers. As the reproductive process became better understood, ancient Chinese society moved towards a patriarchal system and <span class="loc">Fu Xi</span> assumed primary importance.</p>
