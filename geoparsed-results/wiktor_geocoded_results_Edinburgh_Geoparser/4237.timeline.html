  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bangor</span> is a suburb in southern <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Bangor</span> is located 28 kilometres south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district, in the local government area of the <span class="loc">Sutherland Shire</span> in the area commonly called <span class="loc">Menai</span>. <span class="loc">Bangor</span> sits south of the <span class="loc">Georges River</span> and to the west of the <span class="loc">Woronora River</span>. The name '<span class="loc">Bangor</span>' was selected in <span class="date">1895</span> by the land's owner, a farmer named <span class="per">Owen Jones</span>, after his birthplace <span class="loc">Bangor</span> in <span class="loc">Wales</span>. To avoid confusion with <span class="loc">Bangor</span> in <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, the Postmaster General's Office changed the suburb name to <span class="loc">Menai</span> in <span class="date">1910</span>. Another Australian <span class="loc">Bangor</span> is located in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Menai Bridge</span> is a town opposite the original <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, on the <span class="loc">Menai Strait</span> in <span class="loc">Wales</span>. When <span class="loc">Menai</span> expanded, the eastern section was renamed <span class="loc">Bangor</span> in <span class="date">1976</span>. As part of the modern development of <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, the streets were all named with an Aboriginal theme. <span class="loc">Bangor</span> is a mostly residential suburb with a small shopping centre which consists of <span class="org">Bangor Community Pharmacy</span>, <span class="org">Bangor Post Office</span>, <span class="loc">Bangor</span> Bakery, The Chicken Spot, IGA, Peter's <span class="loc">Bangor</span> Chinese, Thai Max, <span class="org">ABC</span> School Wear, <span class="loc">Bangor Dry Cleaners</span>, <span class="loc">Bangor Butchers</span> and <span class="org">Doug Frost Swim School</span>.</p><br><br>
