  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lubao</span> is a first class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Pampanga</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">May 2010</span> census, it has a population of 150,843 people. It is bounded by the municipalities of <span class="loc">Guagua</span> on the north, Sasmuan on the east, <span class="loc">Floridablanca</span> on the west and <span class="loc">Orani</span>, <span class="loc">Bataan</span> on the south. Located at the south-western part of <span class="loc">Pampanga</span>, it is noted for rice, sugar cane, fish, and sampaguita. The name <span class="loc">Lubao</span> was derived from the indigenous word “lubo” which means low. “Lubo” is characteristically muddy and flooded; later, the term evolved into “lubao,” which is the town’s present name. The Austronesian word is associated with the low or depressed elevation of the town. Hence, <span class="loc">Lubao</span> is synonymous to its ancient name Baba. <span class="loc">Lubao</span> is politically subdivided into 44 barangays. As the first Augustinian missionary center in Central and Northern <span class="loc">Luzon</span>, majority of the residents in <span class="loc">Lubao</span> are Roman Catholics. <span class="loc">Lubao</span> at present has six parishes : <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Agustin Parish</span>, Plaza, <span class="loc">Lubao</span>(oldest in <span class="loc">Pampanga</span> - Established <span class="date">1572</span>) <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Roque</span> <span class="loc">Dau</span> Parish, <span class="loc">San Roque Dau</span>, <span class="loc">Lubao</span> (established <span class="date">Oct</span>.1, <span class="date">1990</span>)</p><br><br>
