<p>Delta, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, is a community in the Township of <span class="loc">Rideau Lakes</span>, <span class="loc">Leeds</span> and <span class="loc">Grenville County</span> in Eastern <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. The village is located between two lakes, Upper <span class="loc">Beverley</span> and Lower <span class="loc">Beverley</span>, along highway 42, approximately 15 kilometers <span class="loc">west of Athens</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span> and 28 kilometers <span class="loc">east of Westport</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. The original name for Delta was <span class="loc">Stevenstown</span>, chosen for its founder, Baptist Clergyman Abel Stevens. Stevens, a British Loyalist from <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, settled in the area in 1796, attracted by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe's offer of free land in <span class="loc">Upper Canada</span>. Within 2 years, Stevens had convinced about 100 families to relocate to the region. Among many of his achievements, Stevens founded the village's first mill (the predecessor to the Old Stone Mill, built by William Jones, not by Stevens as is commonly mistaken), a Baptist church in neighbouring <span class="loc">Philipsville</span>, and an iron-works in what is now known as <span class="loc">Lyndhurst</span>. Delta saw a few name changes during its early years. After the construction of the stone mill, the name of <span class="loc">Stevenstown</span> was changed to Stone Mills. In 1821, it was changed once more to <span class="loc">Beverley</span>, in honour of the Legislative Assembly member Sir John Beverley Robinson. Then, finally, in 1886, the name was changed to Delta, after an application for a town post office was rejected upon the discovery that a village already existed by the name of <span class="loc">Beverley</span>. 'Delta' was chosen because the shape of the two <span class="loc">Beverley</span> Lakes, connected by the village, resembles triangles - the shape of the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet, delta.</p>
