  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Raleigh</span> is a town located northwest of <span class="loc">St. Anthony</span>. It had a population of 295 in <span class="date">1956</span>, declining to 248 by the <span class="date">2006</span> census. <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> was originally named <span class="loc">Ha Ha Bay</span>, after the bay where it is located.

With abundant fish in nearby rivers, the <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> area is popular for ice fishing. <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> had a population of 295 in <span class="date">1956</span>. In the mid-1980s the population grew to as much as 414 with more than 100 school age children. Locals were proud of their community and <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> dominated the local hockey league.</p><br><br>
