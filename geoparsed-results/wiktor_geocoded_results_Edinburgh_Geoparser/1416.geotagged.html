<p><span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is a town located in <span class="loc">Fairfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It borders the towns of <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span>, <span class="loc">Trumbull</span>, <span class="loc">Easton</span>, <span class="loc">Weston</span>, and <span class="loc">Westport</span> along the <span class="loc">Gold Coast</span> of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 59,404. In July 2006, Money magazine ranked <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> the ninth "best place to live" in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, and the best place to live in the Northeast. In 1635, Puritans and Congregationalists in the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span>, dissatisfied with the rate of Anglican reforms, sought to establish an ecclesiastical society subject to their own rules and regulations. The Massachusetts General Court granted them permission to settle the towns of <span class="loc">Windsor</span>, <span class="loc">Wethersfield</span>, and <span class="loc">Hartford</span> in the area now known as <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. On January 14, 1639, a set of legal and administrative regulations called the Fundamental Orders was adopted, and established <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> as a self-ruled entity. By 1639 these settlers had started new towns in the surrounding areas. Roger Ludlowe, framer of the Fundamental Orders, purchased the land presently <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, and established the name.</p>
