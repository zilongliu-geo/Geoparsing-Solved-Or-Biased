<p><span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is a county located along the northwest border of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 96,317. The county seat is <span class="loc">Rome</span>. <span class="loc">Floyd County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Rome</span>, <span class="loc">GA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 518 square miles (1,340 km2), of which 510 square miles (1,300 km2) is land and 8.6 square miles (22 km2) (1.7%) is water. The northern third of <span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is located in the <span class="loc">Oostanaula River</span> sub-basin of the ACT River Basin (Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin). The eastern third of the county is located in the <span class="loc">Etowah River</span> sub-basin of the larger ACT River Basin, while the western third of <span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is located in the Upper <span class="loc">Coosa River</span> sub-basin of the same ACT River Basin.

This was the former US Post Office and Courthouse. The county has a council-manager form of government, with five county council members elected at-large. Two members are elected as representatives of the <span class="loc">city of Rome</span> and must reside there; the other three are elected from the county as residents outside the city limits. The at-large voting tends to reward candidates who can muster majority votes from across the whole county, which requires more money and organization for campaigns. This system makes it difficult for minorities to elect representatives of their choice. The council hires a professional county manager to manage daily operations.</p>
