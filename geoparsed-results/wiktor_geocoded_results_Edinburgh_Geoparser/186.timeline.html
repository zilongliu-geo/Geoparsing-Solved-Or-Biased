  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">San Rafael</span> Municipality is a municipality located in northern <span class="loc">Veracruz</span> state in central <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The municipal seat is <span class="loc">San Rafael</span>, <span class="loc">Veracruz</span>. The area was home to a French immigrant community starting in the early 19th century. French surnames and people with light skin can still be found, although the French language as mostly disappeared. The municipal seat has a museum dedicated to this heritage. The town of <span class="loc">San Rafael</span> was founded as part of a colonization effort by French immigrants in the first half of the 19th century. These French originally settled in <span class="loc">Jicaltepec</span> on the other side of the <span class="loc">Bobos</span> River, but local landowner <span class="per">Rafael Martínez</span> de la <span class="loc">Torre</span> also offered them land on this side. Another indicator is French style names on some of the businesses, as well as a European style local bread sold in stores called “pan de agua.” The entrance to the town from the highway is marked by the <span class="per">Plaza del Reloj</span> (Clock Square). The monumental clock is relatively new but it was built in French style. The <span class="org">San Rafael Museum</span> is in front of the <span class="per">Plaza del Reloj</span> and is dedicated to <span class="per">San Rafael</span>’s French history. It contains a collection of tools, utensils, photographs and more related to the immigrants as well as a room with pre Hispanic artifacts from the region.</p><br><br>
