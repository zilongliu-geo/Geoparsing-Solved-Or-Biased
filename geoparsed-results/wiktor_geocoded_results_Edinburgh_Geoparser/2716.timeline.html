  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bangou</span> is a village of the Bamileke people in the <span class="loc">West Province</span> of <span class="loc">Cameroon</span> with a population of around 12,000. However, most people that consider themselves "from <span class="loc">Bangou</span>" do not reside in <span class="loc">Bangou</span>, but in Yaoundé, <span class="loc">Douala</span>, <span class="loc">Nkongsamba</span> or other cities in <span class="loc">Cameroon</span> and the world. In fact there are Bangou associations in <span class="loc">France</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, <span class="loc">Belgium</span> and the <span class="loc">United States</span> as well as possibly other countries. There are also NGOs formed exclusively for the development of <span class="loc">Bangou</span> such as Association Solidarité <span class="loc">France</span> <span class="loc">Bangou</span> (ASFB) and American Association for the Development of <span class="loc">Bangou</span> (AADB). <span class="loc">Baloungou</span> is a <span class="loc">district of Bangou</span> with a population of about 3,500. The current mayor of <span class="loc">Bangou</span> is Mboutchouang Rosette, the mother of <span class="per">Chantal Biya</span>, President <span class="per">Paul Biya</span>'s wife. The traditional Chief is Tayo II Marcel. While the Chief does not have legal or political authority, his role as a traditional leader helps to settle disputes among groups of people and families in lieu of the legal court systems. Like many other villages in the West region, agriculture is the predominant economic subsistence in <span class="loc">Bangou</span>. The main staple crops that are cultivated are corn, potatoes, yams, bananas, plantains, and beans. Sources of meat are beef, goat, pigs, fish and "bush meat" that people hunt from the forests.</p><br><br>
