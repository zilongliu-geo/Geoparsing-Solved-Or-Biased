  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Birmingham</span> (/ˈbɜːrmɪŋəm/) is a city and metropolitan borough in the <span class="loc">West Midlands</span> of <span class="loc">England</span>. It is the largest and most populous British city outside <span class="loc">London</span>, with a population in <span class="date">2014</span> of 1,101,360. The city is in the <span class="loc">West Midlands</span> Built-up Area, the third most populous built-up area in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, with a population of 2,440,986 at the <span class="date">2011</span> census. A medium-sized market town in the medieval period, <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> grew to international prominence in the 18th century at the heart of the Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution, which saw the town at the forefront of worldwide advances in science, technology and economic development, producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society. By <span class="date">1791</span> it was being hailed as "the first manufacturing town in the world". Birmingham's distinctive economic profile, with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades, encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided a diverse and resilient economic base for industrial prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century. Perhaps the most important invention in British history, the industrial steam engine, was invented in <span class="loc">Birmingham</span>. Its resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of broad-based political radicalism, that under leaders from <span class="per">Thomas Attwood</span> to <span class="per">Joseph Chamberlain</span> was to give it a political influence unparalleled in <span class="loc">Britain</span> outside <span class="loc">London</span>, and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy. From the <span class="date">summer of 1940</span> to the <span class="date">spring of 1943</span>, <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz. The damage done to the city's infrastructure, in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners, led to extensive demolition and redevelopment in subsequent <span class="date">decades</span>.</p><br><br>
