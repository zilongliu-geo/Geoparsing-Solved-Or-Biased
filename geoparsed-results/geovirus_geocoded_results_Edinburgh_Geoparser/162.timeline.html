  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Cattle at a farm in <span class="loc">Surrey</span>, <span class="loc">UK</span> have tested positive for foot-and-mouth disease. After symptoms were reported late on <span class="date">2 August</span>, the farm was isolated. Following testing, officials from Defra (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) confirmed the outbreak on <span class="date">3 August</span>. A three kilometre exclusion zone and a ten kilometre surveillance zone have been put into place around the farm, near <span class="loc">Wanborough</span>. All livestock on the farm have been slaughtered and incinerated. Any movement of livestock in the <span class="loc">UK</span> has been banned and the <span class="org">EU</span> has banned exports under emergency measures, expected to be confirmed on <span class="date">Monday</span>. Farmers are urged to watch their animals carefully for symptoms, and report any to Defra officials. The government's emergency committee <span class="org">Cobra</span> met to discuss the situation before the announcement, with Prime Minister <span class="per">Gordon Brown</span> participating via telephone. Brown cut short his holiday in <span class="loc">Dorset</span> to return to <span class="loc">London</span> on <span class="date">Saturday</span>, when another meeting of <span class="org">Cobra</span> was held. Environment Secretary <span class="per">Hilary Benn</span> also returned from holiday in <span class="loc">Italy</span>. The last outbreak of foot-and-mouth in the <span class="loc">UK</span> was in <span class="date">2001</span>. It resulted in the slaughtering of up to 7 million animals, and losses estimated at Â£8 billion. In <span class="loc">France</span>, the government has asked for all the animals imported during <span class="date">the last ten days</span> to be tested. All meetings including animals have been forbidden on the French territory.</p><br><br>
