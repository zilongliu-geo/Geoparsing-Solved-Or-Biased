It got its name from a <span class="loc">Montogawe</span> Hill located at the <span class="loc">Suague River</span>, that had the appearance of the face of a man. The word <span class="loc">Montogawe</span> was derived from the Spanish word “Monte” meaning, mountain, and “Gawe” a vernacular word meaning, face of a man. Old folks claimed that such hill was an enchanted one, because no matter how high the flood was, it never submerged. Thus, the place was significantly called <span class="loc">Montogawe</span>.</p><br><br>
