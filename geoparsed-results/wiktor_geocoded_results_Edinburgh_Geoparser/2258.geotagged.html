<p><span class="loc">Balla</span> (pronounced <span class="loc">Bal</span>) (Irish: <span class="loc">Balla</span>, meaning "wall"), is a small town in <span class="loc">County Mayo</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span> on the N60 National secondary road, the main road between <span class="loc">Castlebar</span> and <span class="loc">Claremorris</span>. The economy of the village survives mainly on passing trade, from the busy N60 which carries over 7,000 vehicles through the village every day. <span class="loc">Balla</span> has only one street. It is notable for its round tower. It used to be a significant shop and market centre. It fell into decline and lost its railway station, but has enjoyed something of a revival as a residential area for people working in <span class="loc">Castlebar</span>. In early times the village was known as 'Ros Dairbhreach', meaning 'The Height of the <span class="loc">Oak Wood</span>'. The continuing importance of the oak to the local community is reflected in the appropriately named "Dawn Oak 2000" project. At the beginning of the 21st century, 2000 oak trees were planted, creating a new wood in <span class="loc">Balla</span>'s town park. According to Adrian Room in A Dictionary of Irish Placenames, the name refers to the Tobar Mhuire, known in English as the Blessed Well, i.e., of the Blessed Virgin Mary) to the west of <span class="loc">Balla</span>. This was enclosed by a wall in the 7th century, traditionally by St. Mo Chua.</p>
