  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ely</span> (/ˈiːli/, EE-lie) is the largest city and county seat of White <span class="loc">Pine County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Ely</span> was founded as a stagecoach station along the <span class="loc">Pony Express</span> and Central Overland Route. Ely's mining boom came later than the other towns along <span class="loc">US</span> 50, with the discovery of copper in <span class="date">1906</span>. Though the railroads connecting the First Transcontinental Railroad to the mines in <span class="per">Austin</span> and <span class="per">Eureka</span> have long been removed, the railroad to <span class="loc">Ely</span> is preserved as a heritage railway by the <span class="loc">Nevada</span> Northern Railway and known as <span class="org">the Ghost Train of Old</span> <span class="loc">Ely</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 4,255. <span class="loc">Ely</span> was founded as a stagecoach station along the <span class="loc">Pony Express</span> and Central Overland Route. Ely's mining boom came later than the other towns along <span class="loc">US</span> 50, with the discovery of copper in <span class="date">1906</span>. This made <span class="loc">Ely</span> a mining town, suffering through the boom-and-bust cycles so common in the West. Originally, <span class="loc">Ely</span> was home to a number of copper mining companies, Kennecott being the most famous. With a crash in the copper market in the mid-1970s, Kennecott shut down and copper mining disappeared (temporarily).</p><br><br>
