<p>Tara is a town in the <span class="loc">Darling Downs</span> region of <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 300 kilometres (190 mi) west of the state capital, <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>. At the 2006 census, Tara had a population of 819. Important industries in the area around Tara include wheat, beef and wool. Attractions near Tara include Southwood National Park, a remnant area of the southern brigalow belt. Immediately surrounding the urban area of Tara, there are a number of rural subdivisions of 'lifestyle blocks'. The blocks are usually between 13 to 40 ha in area. The population of the 2000 Rural Subdivision blocks exceeds that of the town itself. On 14 March 2011 a blockade against coal seam gas development began at a property called <span class="loc">Kenya</span> near Tara. The following day a woman was arrested after she stopped the movement of a bulldozer working for Queensland Gas Company. The next month Bob Irwin was arrested and fined for participating in a rally at the same location. He was protesting against plans to build a coal seam gas pipeline.
