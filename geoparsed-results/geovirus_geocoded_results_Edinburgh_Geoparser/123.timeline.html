  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">United States</span> and Vietnamese officials began meetings in <span class="loc">Hanoi</span> on <span class="date">Tuesday</span> to discuss further funding to help victims still suffering from exposure to the chemical Agent Orange. Officials in <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> are requesting more funding from the <span class="loc">US</span> in order to clean up the <span class="org">Da Nang International Airport</span>, a major "hot spot" for Agent Orange. Vietnamese Vice Minister of Natural Resources and Environment <span class="per">Nguyen Cong</span> claimed that "the committed funds from the <span class="loc">US</span> government have not been disbursed." The Vietnamese government claims it will cost US$58 million to clean up the <span class="loc">Da Nang</span> airport and two other contaminated locations. The <span class="loc">US</span> has so far pledged $8 million. Agent Orange was used during the <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> war in order to defoliate the dense <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> jungle. Vietnamese officials say that up to three million Vietnamese suffer from exposure to it <span class="date">today</span>. The chemical has been linked to dangerous diseases such as diabetes, cancer and birth defects.</p><br><br>
