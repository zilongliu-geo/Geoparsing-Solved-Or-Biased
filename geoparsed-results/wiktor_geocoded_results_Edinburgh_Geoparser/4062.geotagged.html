<p><span class="loc">Tanta</span> (Egyptian Arabic: طنطا Ṭanṭa  pronounced [ˈtˤɑntˤɑ], Coptic: ⲧⲁⲛⲧⲁⲑⲟ) is a city in <span class="loc">Egypt</span>. It is the country's fifth largest populated area, with an estimated 429,000 inhabitants (2008). <span class="loc">Tanta</span> is located 94 km (58 mi) north of <span class="loc">Cairo</span> and 130 km (81 mi) southeast of Alexandria. The capital of the Gharbia Governorate, it is a centre for the cotton-ginning industry and the main railroad hub of the <span class="loc">Nile Delta</span>. <span class="loc">Tanta</span> is known for its sweets, eaten during the mulid (Arabic: المولد‎) festivals. The main streets are Al-Bahr (Algeish) Street, Al-Galaa Street, Al-Nahaas Street, Hassan Radwan Street, Saeed Street and El-Helw Street. <span class="loc">Tanta</span> has cotton ginning factories and textile industries, and is also a university town (Tanta University since 1972) and an institute attached to the Al-Azhar University in <span class="loc">Cairo</span> as well as the seat of a Metropolitan of the Coptic Church. This city comes to life in late October at the end of the cotton harvest. About two million people from around the Delta and other parts of the Arab world come for the Moulid of Sayid Ahmed el-Badawi, which is an eight-day celebration. The moulid is centered around the Mosque and Tomb of Sayid Ahmed el <span class="loc">Badawi</span>. El Badawi was the founder of one of <span class="loc">Egypt</span>'s largest Sufi orders called Badawiya. He was born in <span class="loc">Morocco</span>, but emigrated to <span class="loc">Arabia</span>. He was sent to <span class="loc">Tanta</span> in 1234 as a representative of the order from <span class="loc">Iraq</span>. He was given permission to start a new order in <span class="loc">Tanta</span> and it soon flourished. His tomb was destroyed in the mid-nineteenth century but another was built and is the center of the festival. During the festival many sugar-coated nuts called 'hubb el 'Aziz' ('seeds of the Beloved Prophet') are eaten. They have been considered a delicacy since ancient times. The Museum of Tanta contains collections from the present day back to Pharaonic times.</p>
