  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Portillo</span> is a ski resort in <span class="loc">South America</span>, located in the Andes mountains of <span class="loc">Chile</span>. In the <span class="loc">Valpara√≠so Region</span>, it is near the city of <span class="loc">Los Andes</span>, and 160 km (100 mi) by vehicle from Santiago. Its hotel sits at an elevation of 2,880 m (9,450 ft) above sea level, and the highest lift reaches 3,310 m (10,860 ft). The lowest lift loads at 2,548 m (8,360 ft), yielding a vertical drop of 762 m (2,500 ft). Ski Portillo has 35 named runs and 14 lifts. Plans to build the ski area were drawn up in <span class="date">the 1930s</span>. Construction began in <span class="date">1942</span> and the ski area was opened in <span class="date">1949</span>. Several of the ski lifts on the west side of the valley were destroyed by avalanches in <span class="date">1965</span> and were rebuilt in time for <span class="loc">Portillo</span> to host the Alpine World Ski Championships in <span class="date">August 1966</span>. Those championships marked the emergence of <span class="per">Jean-Claude Killy</span>, who won gold medals in the downhill and combined events. <span class="loc">Portillo</span> has since become one of the principal destinations for ski racers to train during the northern hemisphere <span class="date">summer</span> and hosts the national ski teams of <span class="loc">Austria</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>, and the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p><br><br>
