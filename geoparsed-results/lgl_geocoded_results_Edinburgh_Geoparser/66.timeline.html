  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>City schools look at alternative calendar. Building capacity can be maximized through having balanced calendars. <span class="per">Rigell</span> said students could be split into groups, with different groups being in class at different times - for example, three groups can be in session at one time while one group is on vacation. If overcrowding became a major issue, <span class="per">Rigell</span> said this could solve it in a more cost-effective manner than adding to an existing school or building a new one. <span class="per">Rigell</span> said he would poll other school systems that currently have balanced calendars to see how they have implemented them. He will also poll systems that have had balanced calendars in <span class="date">the past</span> and dropped them to see what shortcomings they found. That information will be presented to the <span class="org">Board</span> as it is collected. <span class="loc">Bevins</span> said he could check with <span class="loc">McMinn County</span> School <span class="org">Board</span> Chairwoman Pat Chester to see if the county has interest in exploring an alternative calendar. <span class="date">More than 10 years ago</span>, a task force was appointed from among the county's three public school systems - <span class="loc">Athens</span>, <span class="loc">McMinn County</span> and <span class="loc">Etowah</span> - to study that possibility but no changes resulted.</p><br><br>
