  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>'He will not be forgotten,Kate, that I promise you'. The remains of <span class="per">Stephen Carroll</span> are carried in <span class="loc">Banbridge</span> <span class="date">yesterday</span> 'To the love of my life. I will never forget you. I love you <span class="date">now</span> and always, Kate' IT was just after 1.20pm when one simple act illustrated the truly seismic changes brought about by the North's peace process. And then, in the middle of a Northern Irish town and watched by <span class="per">Protestants</span> and <span class="per">Catholics</span> alike, he walked behind the coffin of a murdered policeman. <span class="date">Twelve years ago</span> -- when the last Northern policeman was shot dead -- such a public tribute by a southern policing figure would have triggered a riot. Most children watching the sad procession <span class="date">yesterday</span> never knew what it was like to live with the almost daily torrent of bombings and shootings. They do <span class="date">now</span>. Many had heard a police wife tell in a radio interview how their 12-year-old son tearfully begged his father not to go to work <span class="date">this week</span>. He didn't want him to get shot. Some of those who once followed a violent path are <span class="date">now</span> in the North's government. Some are not, but they still came to <span class="loc">Banbridge</span> <span class="date">yesterday</span>. They faced the TV cameras and appealed for the killings to stop and said there was no popular support for the dinosaurs still wedded to <span class="date">the past</span>. The requiem Mass for <span class="per">Mr Carroll</span> brought together a remarkable coalition of former terrorists, police officers, church leaders and politicians of all hues. <span class="loc">Banbridge</span> also turned out in force to say goodbye. Thousands lined the three-mile route from <span class="per">Mr Carroll</span>'s home to St Therese's church. A three-minute silence was held in the centre of the town and then the cortege passed, 18 officers walking ahead of the hearse, six motorcycle outriders ahead of them. A piper played a lament called the '<span class="loc">Flowers of the Forest</span>' and mourners wept as the hearse passed by. Amid the roses, carnations and lilies, a floral tribute had also been sent from <span class="loc">England</span> by the family of murdered soldier Sapper <span class="per">Patrick Azimkar</span>. As well as cards from his own parents, son <span class="per">Shane</span>, siblings and grandchildren, <span class="per">Mr Carroll</span>'s heartbroken widow Kate left her own simple tribute. It said: "To the love of my life. I will never forget you. I love you <span class="date">now</span> and always, Kate." Then, she watched as her husband's casket, clad in a PSNI flag, was borne into the church by six fellow officers. "He will nor be forgotten Kate, I promise you," <span class="per">Mr Orde</span> said, adding <span class="per">Mr Carroll</span> (48) knew an unexpected violent act like this could <span class="date">one day</span> happen given the hatred in some hearts. <span class="per">Canon Liam Stevenson</span>, the <span class="loc">Banbridge parish</span> priest, told mourners the killing of <span class="per">Mr Carroll</span> was designed to destabilise the peace process. The word patriot, he said, had been horribly abused. "The killers of Constable <span class="loc">Carroll</span> have abused the term patriotism. "A perfectly laudable aspiration such as patriotism is robbed of its intrinsic value when it's allied to violence and death in pursuit of its objectives." <span class="per">Bishop McAreavey</span> ended by sending a direct message to the killers: "You are greatly mistaken. Your way of thinking is backward looking. As soft rain began to fall outside, <span class="per">Bishop McAreavey</span>'s words were met by hope, tears and thunderous applause.</p><br><br>
