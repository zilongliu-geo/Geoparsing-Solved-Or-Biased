<p>Laura is a small town (population about 120) north of <span class="loc">Lakeland</span> in Cook Shire, <span class="loc">Cape York Peninsula</span> in <span class="loc">northern Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is on the only road north towards the tip of the peninsula, and is the centre for the largest collection of prehistoric rock art in the world. It also forms the northern apex of the "Scenic Triangle" between <span class="loc">Cooktown</span>, <span class="loc">Lakeland</span>, and Laura. At the 2006 census, Laura and the surrounding area had a population of 225. Some of the world's most extensive and ancient rock painting galleries surround the tiny town of Laura, some of which are available for public viewing. Laura has an Interpretive Centre from which information on the rock art and local Aboriginal culture is available and tours can be arranged. Laura is only a few kilometres from the southern entrance to Lakefield National Park. Aboriginal people have made their home in the <span class="loc">Laura River</span> valley for at least 50,000 years. In the wet season, they would camp under rock shelters on the high ground. This is where their rock art can be found.</p>
