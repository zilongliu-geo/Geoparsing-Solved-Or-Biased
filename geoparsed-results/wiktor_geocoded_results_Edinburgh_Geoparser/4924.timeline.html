  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Beaver County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 5,636. The county seat is Beaver. The name was given because of the presence of many beaver dams on the <span class="loc">Beaver River</span>, which runs through the area. It is located in the <span class="loc">Oklahoma Panhandle</span>. The land where <span class="loc">Beaver County</span> is located has been under several jurisdictions. At one time, it was part of <span class="loc">Texas</span> before <span class="loc">Texas</span> became a state of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Then in the Compromise of <span class="date">1850</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> ceded the land that would eventually become the Oklahoma panhandle to the <span class="loc">United States</span> government. The area was known as "<span class="loc">No Man's Land</span>" because it belonged to no state or territorial government. There was a period of time (<span class="date">1886</span> - <span class="date">1890</span>) that it was a separate organized territory, known as Cimarron Territory. After becoming part of the Oklahoma Territory in <span class="date">1890</span>, <span class="loc">Beaver County</span> (first called <span class="loc">Seventh County</span>) covered the entire <span class="loc">Oklahoma Panhandle</span>. At statehood in <span class="date">1907</span>, <span class="loc">Cimarron County</span> was taken from the western one-third, while <span class="loc">Texas County</span> was taken from the middle, leaving <span class="loc">Beaver County</span> only in the east. Its borders are <span class="date">now</span> at 100째W (east), 37째N (north), 36.5째N (south), and approximately 100.8째W (west).</p><br><br>
