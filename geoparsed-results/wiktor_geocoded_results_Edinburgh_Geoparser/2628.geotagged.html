<p>Alexandra, informally abbreviated to Alex, is a township located in the <span class="loc">Gauteng province</span> of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It forms part of the <span class="loc">city of Johannesburg</span> and is located near the upper-class suburb of <span class="loc">Sandton</span>. Alexandra is bounded by <span class="loc">Wynberg</span> on the west, Marlboro and Kelvin on the north, <span class="loc">Kew</span>, <span class="loc">Lombardy West</span> and <span class="loc">Lombardy East</span> on the south. It is commonly known as "Gomorrah" among local residents. Alexandra is one of the poorest urban areas in the country. Alexandra is situated on the banks of the <span class="loc">Jukskei</span> River. In addition to its original, reasonably well-built houses, it also has a large number (estimated at more than 20,000) of informal dwellings or "shacks". Alexandra was established in 1912, on land originally owned by a farmer, a Mr Papenfus, who tried to establish a white residential township there, naming it after his wife, Alexandra. However, because it was (at the time) a considerable distance from the center of <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span>, this was not a great success. Consequently, in 1912, Alexandra was proclaimed as a so-called "native township". Because the township was proclaimed before the South African 1913 Land Act, it was one of the few urban areas in the country where black people could own land under a freehold title.</p>
