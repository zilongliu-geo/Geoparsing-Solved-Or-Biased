  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Milan</span> /ˈmaɪlən/ is a city in <span class="per">Monroe</span> and <span class="per">Washtenaw</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 5,836 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. About 60% of the city's area and 75% of its residents are located on the <span class="loc">Washtenaw County</span> side adjacent to <span class="loc">York Township</span> in <span class="loc">Washtenaw County</span>; while 40% percent of the city's area and 25% of its residents are located on the <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> side adjacent to <span class="loc">Milan</span> Township. The city was founded in <span class="date">1831</span> by <span class="per">John Marvin</span>, Bethuel Hack, and <span class="per">Harmon Allen</span>. Hack was the first postmaster, and he named the community "Farmer" since everyone there was a farmer. Drug store owner <span class="per">Henry Tolan</span> took over as postmaster and renamed the community "Tolanville" after himself. <span class="per">Next, David</span> <span class="loc">Woodard</span> became the post master, with the post office in his flour mill. He renamed the community "Woodard's Mills." The postmaster in <span class="loc">Washington</span> <span class="loc">D.C.</span> noticed the confusion caused by this swift change in names and decreed that it would henceforth be called "<span class="loc">Milan</span>" after the neighboring <span class="loc">Milan</span> Township. French settlers in the area named the township "<span class="loc">Milan</span>" because they once hoped to produce grapes and wine in the area, so the Italian city by that name seemed appropriate, given <span class="loc">Italy</span>'s reputation for wine-making. The river going through <span class="loc">Milan</span> and <span class="loc">Milan</span> township is the Saline River, part of the <span class="loc">River Raisin</span> watershed. "<span class="loc">River Raisin</span>" refers to Raisin, the French word for grape. Small wild grapes were growing on the banks of the river, so early French settlers in the <span class="per">Monroe</span> area hoped that this area would be wine country. Just southeast of <span class="loc">Milan</span>, along Plank road, is an old community by the name of "Grape" which is a reflection of this desire to create a wine producing area. <span class="loc">Milan</span> became a village in <span class="date">1885</span>. It continued as a village until <span class="date">1967</span>, when it was incorporated as a city.</p><br><br>
