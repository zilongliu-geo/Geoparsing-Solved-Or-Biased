  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Henry County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,160 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 2,180 in <span class="date">2000</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Henry County</span>. Before <span class="date">1843</span>, the land where <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is currently located was the private property of a man named <span class="per">Rev. Ithamar Pillsbury</span>, who was very well known amongst the Yankee settlers (migrants from <span class="loc">New England</span> and upstate <span class="loc">New York</span> who were descended from the English Puritans who settled <span class="loc">New England</span> in the 1600s) who were moving to <span class="loc">Henry County</span> in large numbers at that time. <span class="per">Reverend Pillsbury</span> deeded a large portion of his land to the town council and they immediately agreed it was a good place to lay out a town. Lots were sold to incoming migrants and on <span class="date">June 9</span> of <span class="date">1843</span> (after some quarreling among the town founders about how to finance it) construction began on the town. Roads were laid out, post routes established, public buildings erected and people were invited to move there. The original settlers were entirely of <span class="loc">New England</span> origins or were Yankees from upstate <span class="loc">New York</span> whose families had moved to that place from <span class="loc">New England</span> only one generation earlier, in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War. This resulted in <span class="loc">Henry County</span> being culturally very contiguous with early <span class="loc">New England</span> culture.</p><br><br>
