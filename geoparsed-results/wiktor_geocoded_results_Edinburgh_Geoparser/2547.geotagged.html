<p><span class="loc">Birlik</span> (Kazakh: Бiрлiк) is a village (selo) in <span class="loc">Talgar District</span> of <span class="loc">Almaty Region</span> of south-eastern <span class="loc">Kazakhstan</span>. It is located several kilometres to the west of the district's administrative centre <span class="loc">Talgar</span> and several kilometres southeast of the former capital of <span class="loc">Kazakhstan</span>, <span class="loc">Almaty</span>. It is directly accessed via a road from <span class="loc">Almaty</span> to <span class="loc">Talgar</span>. The main road leads west and then forks off to the northwest, joining the A351 highway which leads to the <span class="loc">Turksib District</span> in the eastern suburbs of <span class="loc">Almaty</span> and the airport. To the south of the village, across the main road, the area is mountainous and climbs dramatically from the approximate elevation of 900 metres in <span class="loc">Birlik</span> village. In 1987, the village was a part of Belbulaksy Selsoviet when the country was part of the Soviet Union. Industrial factories are located to the north of the village. Given its proximity to <span class="loc">Almaty</span> and excellent international connections through the airport, very close to <span class="loc">Birlik</span>, <span class="loc">Birlik</span> is a developing settlement. In recent years there has been interest from investors, including an Indian firm looking to develop beer factory production facilities in <span class="loc">Birlik</span>.</p>
