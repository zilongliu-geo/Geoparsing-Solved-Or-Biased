<p>Saint-Pierre is a town and commune of <span class="loc">France</span>'s <span class="loc">Caribbean</span> overseas department of <span class="loc">Martinique</span>, founded in 1635 by Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc. Before the total destruction of Saint-Pierre in 1902 by a volcanic eruption, it was the most important <span class="loc">city of Martinique</span> culturally and economically, being known as "the <span class="loc">Paris</span> of the <span class="loc">Caribbean</span>". While Fort-de-France was the official administrative capital, Saint-Pierre was the cultural capital of <span class="loc">Martinique</span>. After the disaster, Fort-de-France grew in economic importance. Saint-Pierre was founded in 1635 by Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc, a French trader and adventurer, as the first permanent French colony on the island of <span class="loc">Martinique</span>. The Great Hurricane of 1780 produced a storm-surge of 8 metres (25 ft) which "inundated the city, destroying all houses" and killed 9,000 people. The <span class="loc">city of Saint-Pierre</span> was never restored to its old glory, though some villages were built some decades later on its place. Today, the town is the district capital of the <span class="loc">Caribbean</span> North <span class="loc">district of Martinique</span>. It has been designated as a "<span class="loc">city of Art and History</span>". There are many historic remains, and a Volcanological Museum (Mus√©e vulcanologique Franck Perret).</p>
