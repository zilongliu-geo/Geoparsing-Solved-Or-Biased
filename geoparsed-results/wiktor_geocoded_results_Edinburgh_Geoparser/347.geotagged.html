<p>Laura is a hamlet in <span class="loc">Montrose Rural</span> Municipality 315, <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It previously held the status of village until December 31, 1954 and again at an unknown date but was restructured back to hamlet status on December 28, 1978. The hamlet is located southwest of <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span> along Highway 7 and Canadian National Railway Saskatoon-Rosetown stub. For a wonderful description of a youngster growing up in Laura during the period prior to and through the Great Depression, the book entitled "The Fledgling Years - A childhood on the Prairies" by William C. Macklon (publisher Western Producer Prairie Books, <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span>, <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span>, copyright 1990) is a delightful read. Prior to the Great Depression, Laura was a bustling active pioneer farming community. Prior to December 31, 1954, Laura was incorporated as a village, and was restructured as a hamlet under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Mountrose on that date. The hamlet was incorporated under village status at an unknown date. That status was again taken over by the jurisdiction of the Rural Municipality of Mountrose on December 28, 1978.</p>
