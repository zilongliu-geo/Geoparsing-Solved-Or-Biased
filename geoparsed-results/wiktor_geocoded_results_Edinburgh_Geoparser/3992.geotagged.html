<p>Not to be confused with <span class="loc">Tanjung Kupang</span> in <span class="loc">Johore</span> <span class="loc">Kupang</span> (Indonesian : Kota <span class="loc">Kupang</span>, Indonesian pronunciation: [ˈkupaŋ] ; Dutch spelling: <span class="loc">Koepang</span>) is the capital of the Indonesian <span class="loc">province of East</span> <span class="loc">Nusa Tenggara</span>, and has an estimated population in 2011 of 349,344. It is the biggest city and port on the island of <span class="loc">Timor</span>. <span class="loc">Kupang</span> was an important port and trading point during the Portuguese and Dutch colonial eras. There are ruins and remnant signs of the colonial presence in the city. Representatives of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) approached <span class="loc">Kupang</span> in 1613 after having conquered the Portuguese fort on <span class="loc">Solor</span>. At this time the place and its hinterland was governed by a raja of the <span class="loc">Helong</span> tribe which claimed descent from <span class="loc">Ceram</span> in <span class="loc">Maluku</span>. <span class="loc">Kupang</span> was well situated for strategic control over parts of <span class="loc">Timor</span>, since it was possible to monitor shipping activities to the south coast of the island. Moreover, the <span class="loc">Koinino</span> River provided fresh water for the inhabitants. A VOC-Helong agreement was made, but due to the lack of VOC commitment on <span class="loc">Timor</span>, <span class="loc">Kupang</span> was later influenced by the Portuguese mestizo population of Flores, the Topasses. A Portuguese stronghold was established by the 1640s. However, the VOC was firmly established on <span class="loc">Solor</span> in 1646, and renewed contacts with the local raja. In January 1653 a Dutch fortification, Fort Concordia, was built on a height to the left of the river estuary. <span class="loc">Kupang</span> became the base of the Dutch struggle against the Portuguese. After a series of Dutch defeats in 1655, 1656 and 1657, large refugee groups from the VOC allies Sonbai and Amabi settled in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Kupang</span> in 1658 and formed small kingdoms on land that traditionally belonged to the <span class="loc">Helong</span>. They were followed by two other groups, Amfoan (1683) and Taebenu (1688). The <span class="loc">Helong</span> raja remained the "lord of the land" (tuan tanah) but was closely dependent on the VOC authorities. Apart from the old <span class="loc">Helong</span> territory, <span class="loc">Timor</span> was largely dominated by the Portuguese up to 1749.</p>
