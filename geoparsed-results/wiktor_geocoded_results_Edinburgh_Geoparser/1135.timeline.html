  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Brighton</span> is the northernmost suburb of <span class="loc">Brisbane City</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, located 19 kilometres (12 mi) north of the Brisbane CBD. The Nashville locality makes up much of the southwest of the suburb. At the <span class="date">2011</span> Australian Census the suburb had a population of 9,012. <span class="loc">Brighton</span> features mostly suburban housing. The large nursing home Eventide, run by the Queensland Government, is within <span class="loc">Brighton</span>. <span class="loc">Brighton</span> was also home to the World War II barracks of the <span class="org">RAAF Air Training School</span> between <span class="date">December 1940</span> to <span class="date">May 1946</span> and was built on reclaimed land. After this time it became The <span class="org">Eventide Nursing Home</span>. More than 700 patients were transferred from <span class="loc">Dunwich</span> on <span class="loc">North Stradbroke Island</span> to the facility. It was announced in <span class="date">late 2012</span> that the nursing home will close because ensuring the aging buildings complied with building codes was uneconomic.

The median age of the <span class="loc">Brighton</span> population was <span class="date">40 years</span> of age, <span class="date">3 years</span> above <span class="org">the Australian</span> median. 78.4% of people living in <span class="loc">Brighton</span> were born in <span class="loc">Australia</span>, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were <span class="loc">England</span> 5.3%, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> 4.3%, <span class="loc">Scotland</span> 0.8%, <span class="loc">Philippines</span> 0.6%, <span class="loc">Ireland</span> 0.5%.</p><br><br>
