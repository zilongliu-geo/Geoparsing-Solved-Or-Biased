  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Kendall</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Orleans County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,724 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The Town of <span class="per">Kendall</span> is in the northeast corner of the county and is northwest of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. The town was part of the Connecticut Tract, also called the 100,000 Acre Tract. The first settlers arrived circa <span class="date">1812</span>. The <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal opened in <span class="date">1825</span>, making a ready market for wheat and lumber. It also made the way easier for more settlement. The first Norwegian immigrant community in the <span class="loc">United States</span> was begun at the <span class="loc">Kendall</span> Settlement in <span class="date">1825</span>. They settled in a body along the lakeshore in the northeast part of town. Norwegian-American pioneer leader <span class="per">Cleng Peerson</span> subsequently founded a settlement in the Fox River Valley of <span class="loc">Illinois</span> during <span class="date">1834</span>, near the community of <span class="loc">Norway</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The Town of <span class="per">Kendall</span> was incorporated from the Town of <span class="loc">Murray</span>. On <span class="date">April 7, 1837</span>, about half of the Town of <span class="loc">Murray</span> became the new Town of <span class="per">Kendall</span>. It was formerly called "<span class="loc">North Murray</span>" and was settled slowly due to swampy terrain, being called the "<span class="per">Black North</span>," due to the bogs and forests. The town was named after <span class="per">Amos Kendall</span>, the <span class="org">U.S. Postmaster General</span> under Presidents <span class="per">Andrew Jackson</span> and <span class="per">Martin</span> <span class="loc">Van Buren</span>.</p><br><br>
