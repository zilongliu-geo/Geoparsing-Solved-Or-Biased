<p><span class="loc">Hastings</span> is an amalgamated village within the municipality of <span class="loc">Trent Hills</span>, <span class="loc">Northumberland County</span>, in the <span class="loc">province of Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is on the <span class="loc">Trent River</span> in what is considered to be Ontario's "cottage country". <span class="loc">Hastings</span> had a population of 1,208 at the 2001 Census. It is known as "The Hub of the Trent" as <span class="loc">Hastings</span> is directly on the <span class="loc">Trent River</span> and serves as a major centre for tourists, boaters, and fishermen. One of <span class="loc">Hastings</span>' notable symbols is a tall, blue water tower which is perched prominently on high ground in the northern portion of the community. <span class="loc">Hastings</span> is now part of the municipality of <span class="loc">Trent Hills</span> and makes up the second most substantial population centre in the municipality. The current mayor of <span class="loc">Trent Hills</span> is Hector Macmillan. Macmillan was first elected at the 2003 municipal election and on October 27, 2014, was re-elected for a fourth term. A marina was built in <span class="loc">Hastings</span> which added to the already bustling waterfront. In continuation of the street-scape design theme from the new Hastings Village Marina a Hastings Waterfront &amp; Downtown Improvement Plan was prepared in early 2009. In 2009, after a four-year break, the local <span class="loc">Chamber of Commerce</span> was revived.</p>
