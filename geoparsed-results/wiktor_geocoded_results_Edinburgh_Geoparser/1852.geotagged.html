<p><span class="loc">Farmington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Dakota County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 21,086 at the 2010 census. It is a part of the Minneapolis-St. <span class="loc">Paul metropolitan</span> area. Settlers began arriving in Empire Township, in which <span class="loc">Farmington</span> grew, in the early 1850s. The village of <span class="loc">Dakota City</span> began around the intersection of the <span class="loc">Minnesota Central</span>, <span class="loc">Hastings</span>, and Dakota railroads, and also the <span class="loc">Vermillion River</span>. The popular city train station in <span class="loc">Dakota City</span> was <span class="loc">Farmington</span> Station and non-residents began confusing the two names and identifying the town as <span class="loc">Farmington</span>. The town's name was then permanently changed from <span class="loc">Dakota City</span> to <span class="loc">Farmington</span>. The present name was given for the numerous farms near the original town site. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> received its village charter in 1872 making <span class="loc">Farmington</span> the second oldest community in <span class="loc">Dakota County</span> after the county seat, <span class="loc">Hastings</span>. A notable event in <span class="loc">Farmington</span>'s history is the movement of the <span class="loc">Dakota County</span> Fair to <span class="loc">Farmington</span> in 1869. Another event, the Great Fire of <span class="loc">Farmington</span> on November 22, 1879, destroyed several houses, stores, a hotel, and a grain elevator in the current downtown area. Farmington High School graduated its first class in 1884. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> was one of the first communities in the <span class="loc">United States</span> to offer rural free mail delivery in 1897.</p>
