  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Body found in <span class="loc">Kish</span> River identified. A body found <span class="date">this weekend</span> in the <span class="loc">Kishwaukee River</span> was identified <span class="date">Monday</span> as that of a Wisconsin man last seen <span class="date">Christmas Day</span> in <span class="loc">DeKalb</span>. The body of 56-year-old <span class="per">James C. Verduin</span> was found about <span class="date">2:45 p.m. Sunday</span> in the river near <span class="loc">Hopkins Park</span> in <span class="loc">DeKalb</span>. <span class="per">Verduin</span> was identified <span class="date">Monday</span> during an autopsy, <span class="loc">DeKalb County</span> Coroner <span class="per">Dennis Miller</span> said. Preliminary autopsy results show <span class="per">Verduin</span>, a father of two from <span class="loc">West Allis</span>, <span class="loc">Wis.</span>, drowned, <span class="per">Miller</span> said. “We don’t suspect any foul play,” <span class="per">Miller</span> said, adding there were no wounds, bruises or other marks on the body. “There was no sign of a struggle.” <span class="per">Miller</span> said <span class="per">Verduin</span> probably died <span class="date">Christmas Day</span> or <span class="date">Dec. 26</span>, and has been in the river since then. A couple walking their dog <span class="date">Sunday afternoon</span> in <span class="loc">Hopkins</span> Park noticed the body floating face up in the water behind the 200 block of <span class="per">Joanne Lane</span>, according to police reports. Police do not know where <span class="per">Verduin</span> entered the water. “When you’re dealing with rivers, currents can certainly have a huge effect on where you’re going to find an object,” <span class="loc">DeKalb</span> Police <span class="per">Lt. Gary Spangler</span> said. “He could have went into the river 100 yards of where we found him, he could have gone in by the hotel. We just don’t know.” <span class="per">Verduin</span>’s body might have been stuck on something in the river, <span class="per">Spangler</span> and <span class="per">Miller</span> said, which is why it hadn’t been found until <span class="date">now</span>. If that was the case, recent heavy rainfalls caused the river to swell and could have dislodged him, <span class="per">Spangler</span> said. Authorities believe <span class="per">Verduin</span> wandered into the river, <span class="per">Spangler</span> said. “We are aware of some emotional issues that could have contributed to the death,” he added. The body of <span class="per">Verduin</span>, who was found wearing only boxer shorts, was discolored but intact, according to police reports. <span class="per">Verduin</span> “more than likely discarded the clothing before or while in the water,” <span class="per">Spangler</span> said, but added that the clothing has not been found. <span class="per">Verduin</span> was expected to attend a family gathering <span class="date">Dec. 27</span>, but left a message for his family that he needed some time away by himself, his brother, <span class="per">Bill Verduin</span>, told the Daily Chronicle in <span class="date">January</span>. The family is not sure why he was in the <span class="loc">DeKalb</span> area on <span class="date">Christmas Day</span>, when he was involved in a one-car accident on Interstate 88. <span class="per">Verduin</span> declined treatment at the scene of the accident, according to police reports, but appeared a bit disoriented by people he came in contact with after the accident. <span class="per">Miller</span> said <span class="per">Verduin</span> showed no signs of head trauma. His family has said <span class="per">Verduin</span> had diabetes. After his car crashed into a tollway truss, it was towed from the scene, and the tow truck driver dropped <span class="per">Verduin</span> off at the Best Western <span class="loc">DeKalb Inn</span> &amp; Suites, police said. <span class="date">Two days later</span>, a hotel employee called <span class="per">Verduin</span>’s family and asked them to pick up his belongings, noting that he had never checked out. The family called police, who searched the area around the hotel that night, police said. Several additional air and ground searches were conducted in the <span class="date">days</span> and <span class="date">weeks</span> following his disappearance. Phone messages left <span class="date">Monday</span> with <span class="per">Verduin</span>’s family members were not immediately returned.</p><br><br>
