<p><span class="loc">Minden</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,297 at the 2010 census. The town is located at the western edge of the county and south of the Mohawk River, which forms its northern border. It has possessed a post office from 1802 to 1903. This area was first settled by Europeans around 1748. It was probably named after <span class="loc">Minden</span>, in <span class="loc">Germany</span>. Among the early European settlers in the 18th century were Palatine Germans; these Protestants had come to <span class="loc">New York</span> as refugees from religious warfare. Their passage was paid by Queen Anne's government in exchange for their work at camps along the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>, producing naval stores for <span class="loc">England</span>. During the American Revolution, rebel colonists constructed a small fort in 1778 at <span class="loc">Fort Plain</span> village. In 1780, the village was attacked by Tories and allied natives. They burned and sacked the community, but were not able to overcome the defenders at the fort. Following the war, the town of <span class="loc">Minden</span> was formed in 1798 from the Town of <span class="loc">Canajoharie</span>. It was part of a rural area that was important for agriculture and dairy farming.</p>
