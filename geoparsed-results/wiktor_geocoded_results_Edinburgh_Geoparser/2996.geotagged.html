<p><span class="loc">Worcester</span> (/ˈwʊstər/ WUUSS-tər, locally also /ˈwᵻstə/ WISS-tə) is a city and the historic county seat of <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> until <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> disbanded county government in 1998. Named after <span class="loc">Worcester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, as of the 2010 Census the city's population was 181,045, making it the second largest city in <span class="loc">New England</span> after <span class="loc">Boston</span>. <span class="loc">Worcester</span> is located approximately 40 miles (64 km) west of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, and 38 miles (61 km) east of <span class="loc">Springfield</span>. Due to its location in Central <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, amidst <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>' major metropolitan regions, <span class="loc">Worcester</span> is known as the "Heart of the Commonwealth", thus, a heart is the official symbol of the city. However, the heart symbol may also have its provenance in lore that Valentine's Day cards were invented in the city. <span class="loc">Worcester</span> was considered its own region for centuries; however, with the encroachment of <span class="loc">Boston</span>'s suburbs in the 1970s after the construction of Interstate 495 and Interstate 290, it now marks the western periphery of the Boston-Worcester-Providence (MA-RI-NH) U.S. Census Combined Statistical Area (CSA), or Greater <span class="loc">Boston</span>. The city features many examples of Victorian-era mill architecture.</p>
