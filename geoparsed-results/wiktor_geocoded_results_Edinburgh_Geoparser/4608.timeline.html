  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Douglas County</span> is a county located in the south-central portion of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 13,684. The county seat and only incorporated community is Ava. The county was officially organized on <span class="date">October 19, 1857</span>, and is named after <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senator <span class="per">Stephen A. Douglas</span> (D-Illinois) and later Democratic presidential candidate. Previously, the county seat was located at <span class="loc">Arno</span>, west of Ava. Prior to that, <span class="loc">Vera Cruz</span> (formerly called <span class="loc">Red Bud</span>) was the county seat. <span class="loc">Vera Cruz</span> is located on <span class="loc">Bryant</span> Creek, which flows through the middle of the county. The Civil War Battle of Clark's Mill took place near <span class="loc">Vera Cruz</span> on <span class="date">November 7, 1862</span> and resulted in a Confederate victory. After the American Civil War, during a period of general chaos, a group from the western part of the county broke into the Arno courthouse and removed the records back to <span class="loc">Vera Cruz</span>. <span class="date">Later in 1871</span>, a new town site was selected, present-day Ava, near the location of the former <span class="org">U.S. Civil War</span> military Post Office, Militia Spring. The location of this new town seemed to satisfy most of the residents of <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> to be their point of county government.</p><br><br>
