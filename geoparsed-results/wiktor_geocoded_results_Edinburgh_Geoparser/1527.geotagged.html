<p><span class="loc">Valencia</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [baËˆlensja]) is the capital <span class="loc">city of Carabobo State</span>, and the third largest <span class="loc">city of Venezuela</span>. The city is an economic hub that contains <span class="loc">Venezuela</span>'s top industries and manufacturing companies. The population of <span class="loc">Valencia</span> and the nearby metropolitan area reached 1,827,165 in 2010, and it is expected to grow dramatically in the years to come. <span class="loc">Caracas</span> lies some 172 kilometres (107 miles) away to the east. The area was already inhabited in the fourth millennium BC. The inhabitants were mainly hunters and gatherers who might have already developed some elementary forms of agriculture. Between AD 200 and 1000 an important settlement was formed close to <span class="loc">Lake Valencia</span>. Around the year 1000, waves of migration started to come from the Orinoco river area, probably arriving along the Pao river. The fusion of previous settlements with these new populations gave rise to the Vacencioide culture. People in the area belonged mostly to Arawak groups. They were hunters and gatherers who also fished and grew maize and cotton. Their houses were built on artificial mounds in valleys that were often flooded by water from <span class="loc">Lake Valencia</span>.</p>
