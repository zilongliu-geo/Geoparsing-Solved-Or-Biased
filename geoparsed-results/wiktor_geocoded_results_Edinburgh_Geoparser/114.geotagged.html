<p>Richmond is a town in <span class="loc">Sagadahoc County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,411 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> statistical area. Richmond is the departure point for state boat service to <span class="loc">Swan Island</span>, site of the Steve Powell Refuge and Wildlife Management Area. The tract of land which comprises <span class="loc">Richmond</span> and <span class="loc">Gardiner</span> was purchased in 1649 from the Abenaki Indians by Christopher Lawson. In 1719, Fort <span class="loc">Richmond</span> (<span class="loc">Maine</span>) was built by <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> on the western bank of the <span class="loc">Kennebec River</span> at what is today Richmond village. Named for Ludovic Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, the fort included a blockhouse, trading post, chapel, officers' and soldiers' quarters, all surrounded by a palisade. During Dummer's War, following the battle at <span class="loc">Arrowsic</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, Fort Richmond was attacked in a three-hour siege by warriors from <span class="loc">Norridgewock</span> (1722). Houses were burned and cattle slain, but the fort held. <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> and other settlements near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Kennebec</span> were destroyed. The defense was enlarged in 1723 during Dummer's War. On August 19, 1724, a militia of 208 soldiers departed Fort Richmond under command of captains Jeremiah Moulton and Johnson Harmon, traveled up the <span class="loc">Kennebec</span> in 17 whaleboats and sacked <span class="loc">Norridgewock</span>. Fort Richmond would be rebuilt in 1740, attacked by another tribe in 1750, then dismantled in 1755 when forts <span class="loc">Shirley</span> (also called <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>), Western and Halifax were built upriver.</p>
