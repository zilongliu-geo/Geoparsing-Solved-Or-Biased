<p><span class="loc">Edinburg</span> (originally <span class="loc">Edinburgh</span>) is a town in <span class="loc">Saratoga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,384 at the 2000 census. The town is named after the <span class="loc">city of Edinburgh</span> in <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. The Town of <span class="loc">Edinburg</span> is in the northwest part of the county and is north of Schenectady. It is within the <span class="loc">Adirondack</span> Park. The Town of <span class="loc">Edinburg</span> is located within the <span class="loc">Adirondack</span> Park on the shores of the <span class="loc">Great Sacandaga Lake</span> in northwestern <span class="loc">Saratoga County</span>. The first recorded settlers arrived in the Sacandaga River Valley area via Fish House in 1787. Abijah Stark came with his family from <span class="loc">Coleraine</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and settled first just north of Fish House near the Providence town line. They were followed shortly by the <span class="loc">Andersons</span>, Westcotts, Randall and Bass families These people came because of the tall, virgin pine forests, fertile lands of the river valley and more "elbow room." Many of these heads of households had seen the valley before, when serving their country during the Revolutionary War. They had heard that land here was cheap and "the living was better for less work."</p>
