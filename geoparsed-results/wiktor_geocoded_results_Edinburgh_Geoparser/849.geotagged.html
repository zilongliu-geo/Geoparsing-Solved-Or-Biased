The traditional leader of <span class="loc">Ota</span> is the <span class="loc">Olota</span> of <span class="loc">Ota</span>, <span class="loc">Oba</span> Alani Oyede. Historically, <span class="loc">Ota</span> is the capital of the Awori <span class="loc">Yoruba</span> ethnic group. As of 1999, <span class="loc">Ota</span> has the third largest concentration of industries in <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. It also possesses a large market and an important road junction, found just north of the tollgate on the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway. <span class="loc">Ota</span> is also well known as the home of former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo's farm, the Canaanland compound of the megachurch Winners' Chapel, and the <span class="loc">Africa</span> Leadership Forum. Traditional Awori <span class="loc">Yoruba</span> folklore tells that Olofin's children, Osolo and Eleidi Atalabi founded <span class="loc">Ota</span> after migrating south from <span class="loc">Isheri</span>. As the town developed, it eventually came to be locally ruled by a crowned oba, called the <span class="loc">Olota</span>, whose ruling privilege came from the <span class="loc">Yoruba</span> traditional home of Ile-Ife. <span class="loc">Ota</span> soon became important in the production and sale of cocoa. In 1842, the expansion of the Egba nation brought <span class="loc">Ota</span> under the control of <span class="loc">Abeokuta</span>, however <span class="loc">Ota</span> held a semi-independent status within the Egba kingdom, and remained the capital of the Awori people.</p>
