  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Springtime at the Garden Festival returns to Riverbanks . Garden- goers can learn new skills during timed demonstrations, consult the experts on how to keep their backyards in bloom, shop for plants, tools, and garden art at more than 40 vendor stations, and listen to live music from local bluegrass band, Woodwork Roadshow. Interactive demonstrations being held throughout the day will cover topics such as gardening in small spaces, flower arranging, and cooking with herbs. In addition, there will be how- to demonstrations for folks who have an artistic flairâ€” crafting dream catchers for the garden, how to paint a pot and creating clay pot characters. Educational tables will provide information on everything from managing those pesky fire ants to maintaining your yard. Container and floral arrangements created by local florists and garden centers using only plants grown in zone 8 will be on display. Clemson Extension will be available to answer questions at the home and garden information center. Woodwork Roadshow will play two sets in the amphitheater, one from 11:30 am - 1 pm and another from 2 pm to 3:30 pm.
