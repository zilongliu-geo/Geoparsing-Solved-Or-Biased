  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Washington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Rappahannock County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. The site of this town was surveyed by <span class="loc">George Washington</span> himself in <span class="date">July 1749</span>. It was the first of what would be many American places to be named after <span class="date">the future</span> first president. Its population was just 135 people at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 183 in the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is also the county seat of <span class="loc">Rappahannock County</span>. It is nicknamed <span class="loc">Little Washington</span> to avoid confusion because of its proximity to <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span>, which lies only 70 miles (110 km) to the north east. The Town of <span class="loc">Washington</span> was formerly the location of a trading post utilized by frontier families and members of the resident Manahoac tribe. All of the territory in and around the current town was under the ownership of <span class="per">Thomas Fairfax</span>, 6th <span class="per">Lord Fairfax</span> of Cameron. In <span class="date">1748</span>, <span class="per">Lord Fairfax</span> met a 16-year-old <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, a distant relative of his. Being impressed by his character, <span class="per">Fairfax</span> employed <span class="loc">Washington</span> to survey his lands west of the <span class="loc">Blue Ridge Mountains</span>. On <span class="date">July 24, 1749</span>, the town layout as it appears <span class="date">today</span> was surveyed and platted by <span class="loc">Washington</span> with the assistance of his chainmen <span class="per">John Lonem</span> and <span class="per">Edward Corder</span> as part of his service to <span class="per">Fairfax</span>. The village was officially established as a Town by the <span class="org">Virginia General Assembly</span> on <span class="date">December 14, 1795</span> when it gained the requisite population of 200. Records from an <span class="date">1835</span> gazetteer state that the town contained one academy, fifty-five dwellings, four mercantile stores, two taverns, one house of worship, twenty-seven trade shops, and two large flour mills.</p><br><br>
