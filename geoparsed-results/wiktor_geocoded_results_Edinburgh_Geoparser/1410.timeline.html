  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Augusta Township is a township in the United Counties of <span class="loc">Leeds</span> and <span class="loc">Grenville</span>; located in <span class="loc">eastern Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. <span class="loc">Augusta</span> is situated along the <span class="loc">Saint Lawrence River</span>, and extends back into rural hamlets. The township is located between the <span class="loc">city of Brockville</span> to the west, and the town of <span class="loc">Prescott</span> to the east. The hamlets and villages within <span class="loc">Augusta</span> were established prior to <span class="date">the 1900s</span>; primarily by the United Empire Loyalists. There are plenty of buildings and homes still standing in the township <span class="date">today</span> that were built by early settlers; many of these historic homes are even still occupied by direct descendants of the first settlers. In <span class="date">2013</span>, it was discovered that <span class="per">Samuel Bass</span>, the Canadian abolitionist mentioned in <span class="per">Solomon Northup</span>'s <span class="date">1853</span> memoir <span class="date">12 Years</span> a Slave, was from <span class="loc">Augusta</span> township. According to early census records, Bass was born in <span class="loc">Augusta</span> in <span class="date">1807</span>; while here, he married <span class="per">Lydia Catlin</span> Lane, with whom he fathered four children. His wife and children remained in the area, and some of his descendants still reside here to <span class="date">this day</span>. Bass' grandparents were among the first Loyalists to settle in the area, and his parents are buried at <span class="loc">Maynard</span>.</p><br><br>
