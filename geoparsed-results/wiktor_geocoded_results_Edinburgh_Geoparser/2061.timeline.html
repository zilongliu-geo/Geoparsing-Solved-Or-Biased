  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Taiping</span> (Chinese pronunciation: /tʰaɪ̯⁵¹piŋ/; Malay pronunciation: /taipeŋ/)(Chinese: 太平, Tàipíng; <span class="loc">Jawi</span>: تايڤيڠ) is a town located in <span class="loc">Larut</span>, <span class="loc">Matang</span> and <span class="loc">Selama District</span>, <span class="loc">Perak</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. With a population of 217,647 (in <span class="date">2011</span>), it is the second largest town in <span class="loc">Perak</span> after <span class="loc">Ipoh</span>, the state capital. <span class="loc">Taiping</span> took over <span class="loc">Kuala Kangsar</span>'s role as the state capital from <span class="date">1876</span> to <span class="date">1937</span>, but was then replaced by <span class="loc">Ipoh</span>. Its development slowed down after that, but in <span class="date">recent years</span> the town has begun developing rapidly again. <span class="org">Perak State Museum</span> is located in the town. <span class="loc">Taiping</span> also receives some limelight for being the wettest town in <span class="loc">Peninsular Malaysia</span>. The average annual rainfall is about 4,000mm in <span class="loc">Taiping</span> while the peninsula's average is 2,000mm – 2,500mm. Its unusual rainfall has also led to a fertile collection of flora and century-old rain trees in the Taiping Lake Gardens. The area developed quickly in the 19th century when tin was discovered. The mines attracted large numbers of settlers, particularly Chinese. Feuds began between the different groups of Chinese immigrants and became so bitter that in the early 1870s, the British intervened and assumed control of the town. <span class="loc">Taiping</span> was the capital for the <span class="loc">districts of Larut</span>, <span class="loc">Matang</span> and <span class="loc">Selama</span> in <span class="loc">Perak</span>. Before <span class="date">1937</span>, <span class="loc">Taiping</span> was the capital of the state of <span class="loc">Perak</span> and the center of a long and drawn out war resulting in a change of rulership for the state. <span class="loc">Taiping</span> used to be known as Klian Pauh - Klian meaning mine while <span class="loc">Pauh</span> is a type of small mango.</p><br><br>
