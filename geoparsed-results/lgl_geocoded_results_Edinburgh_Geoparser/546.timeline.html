  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Lamar County</span> sales tax still booming. <span class="per">Paris</span> and <span class="per">Roxton</span> continue to reap sales tax benefits from the construction of natural gas pipelines through <span class="loc">Lamar County</span> and a compressor station near <span class="loc">Howland</span>. <span class="per">Paris</span> showed a 22.83 percent increase in <span class="date">January</span> sales tax collections compared to <span class="date">a year ago</span> and <span class="per">Roxton</span> showed a 48.84 percent increase, according to a report on <span class="date">March</span> sales tax distributions <span class="date">Friday</span> by Texas Comptroller Susan Combs. Local entities receive half of the sales taxes collected on materials purchased for the pipeline with the municipalities where purchases are made receiving half. Both Sun Valley and <span class="loc">Toco</span> showed gains in <span class="date">March</span> distributions on taxes collected in <span class="date">January</span>. Sun Valley’s <span class="date">March</span> check for $5,039 was up 15.92 percent from <span class="date">March 2008</span> while <span class="loc">Toco</span> received $4,365.75, an increase of 18.88 percent. Combs delivered $433.4 million in <span class="date">March</span> sales tax payments to <span class="loc">Texas cities</span>, counties, transit systems and special purpose taxing districts, down 0.6 percent compared to <span class="date">March 2008</span>. But for the calendar year, local sales tax allocations remain up 2.2 percent compared to <span class="date">the first three months</span> of <span class="date">2008</span>. “State sales tax collections declined in <span class="date">February</span> as important sectors such as retail trade and construction continue to struggle,” Combs said. “While state sales tax revenue has grown 2.8 percent through the first half of <span class="date">fiscal 2009</span>, further declines are expected as the economy continues to weaken.” <span class="per">Paris</span> collected $597,667.29 in <span class="date">March</span> based on <span class="date">January</span> sales taxes compared to $486,559.61 in <span class="date">2008</span>. Year to date the city has received $2,104,006.98 compared to $1.623,427.54 in <span class="date">2008</span>. (See accompanying chart.)</p><br><br>
