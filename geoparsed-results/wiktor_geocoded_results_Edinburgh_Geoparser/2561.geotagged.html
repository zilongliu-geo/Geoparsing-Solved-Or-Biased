<p><span class="loc">Vega</span> is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Oldham County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 936 at the 2000 census. In 1879, the area was opened by the state for homesteading. The first settler, N.J. Whitfield, arrived in 1899. On October 17, 1899, he purchased an area of <span class="loc">Oldham County</span> known as 'Section 90' for $1.00 per acre. In 1903, Whitfield sold a 100-foot strip of land that extended across the southern part of <span class="loc">Oldham County</span> to the <span class="loc">Choctaw</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, and <span class="loc">Texas</span> (later <span class="loc">Rock Island</span>) Railroad as a right-of-way. He then sold portions of land on the south side of the right-of-way to other settlers. A.M. Miller and Howard <span class="loc">Trigg</span> surveyed the town site that eventually became <span class="loc">Vega</span> in May 1903. The name <span class="loc">Vega</span>, which is Spanish for "meadow," was chosen because it reflected the vast prairie and surrounding countryside of the area. Soon after, Miller opened a store, and a post office, saloon, and a school that doubled as a Masonic Lodge were built in the community. In 1907, ranchers Patrick and John <span class="loc">Landergin</span> purchased a part of the LS Ranch from Swift &amp; Company. Working in association with the <span class="loc">Amarillo</span>-based Pool Land Company, the Landergin brothers brought more prospective settlers to the community. The following year, they established a bank in <span class="loc">Vega</span>. When the railroad was completed, <span class="loc">Vega</span> began to thrive. There were several stores, a blacksmith, two churches, and a newspaper – the Vega Sentinel – operating in the community by early 1909.</p>
