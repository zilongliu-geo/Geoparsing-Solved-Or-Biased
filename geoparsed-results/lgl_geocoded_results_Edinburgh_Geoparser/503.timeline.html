  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Logan-Rogersville students relocate into new building. Logan-Rogersville kindergartners try out a new jungle gym. Students recently moved into a new building. (<span class="per">Donna Baxter</span> / for the News-Leader) Logan Elementary was formed in <span class="date">1952</span> when eight eastern <span class="loc">Greene County</span> rural districts consolidated. High school students had a choice -- <span class="loc">Rogersville</span> or <span class="loc">Springfield</span>. <span class="date">Two years later</span>, seven rural Christian and <span class="loc">Webster County</span> districts consolidated into <span class="loc">Rogersville</span>. In <span class="date">1965</span>, <span class="loc">Rogersville</span> voted to annex to Logan. A new high school was built in southeast <span class="loc">Greene County</span>. All grade 7 and 8 students -- who up to that time had attended the two elementary buildings -- were moved into the old high school in <span class="loc">Rogersville</span>. The elementaries remained separate until <span class="date">1983</span> when the district was reorganized. K-5 students attended Logan and grade 6-8 students went to <span class="loc">Rogersville</span>. After several subsequent reorganizations, Logan-Rogersville has five campuses (including the Logan building) with a population of nearly 2,300.</p><br><br>
