<p><span class="loc">Swansea</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Bristol County</span> in southeastern <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. It is located at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Taunton River</span>, just west of <span class="loc">Fall River</span>, 47 miles (76 km) south of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, and 12 miles (19 km) southeast of Providence, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. The population was 15,865 at the 2010 census. The villages of Hortonville and Ocean Grove are located in the town. <span class="loc">Swansea</span> was named for the Welsh <span class="loc">city of Swansea</span>, which had been the hometown of some original settlers. John Miles, the founder of the first Baptist Church in <span class="loc">Wales</span>, moved to <span class="loc">Swansea</span> in 1662/3. William Brenton had purchased the land from Native Americans. Parts of its territory were originally part of <span class="loc">Rehoboth</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. In 1667 the first Baptist church in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> relocated to <span class="loc">Swansea</span> from <span class="loc">Rehoboth</span> after experiencing religious intolerance there, and <span class="loc">Swansea</span> was incorporated as an independent town. On June 20, 1675, the first Indian attack of King Philip's War had all 70 settlers confined to their stockade. By June 25 the entire town had been burned, although a handful of the colonists escaped to <span class="loc">Taunton</span>. When the active war ended in 1676, the town was soon rebuilt.</p>
