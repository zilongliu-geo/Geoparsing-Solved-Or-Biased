<p>Brooklyn is a small unincorporated community in <span class="loc">southern Forrest County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. It is part of the Hattiesburg, <span class="loc">Mississippi Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Brooklyn was settled in association with the construction of an early railroad in the area, the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad. The town was originally called <span class="loc">Bullis</span> after one of the construction engineers. It was later renamed Brooklyn after one of the pioneer families. Two of the early settlers, John and Sam Perkins, ran the Perkins Merchandise store and Perkins Ferry on <span class="loc">Black Creek</span>. At that time, <span class="loc">Black Creek</span> was used to raft logs cut from the pine forests surrounding Brooklyn down to the trade center of Pascagoula. Brooklyn is located at latitude 31.0562946, longitude -89.1861676. Brooklyn is served by <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 49. The <span class="loc">City of Brooklyn</span> is served by the <span class="loc">Forrest County</span> School District. Also located in Brooklyn are Forrest County Agricultural High School (grades 9-12) and <span class="loc">South Forrest Attendance</span> Center (grades 1-8). FCAHS students are known as "Aggies." SFAC students are known as "Rebels." Clear Creek Methodist Protestant Church First Baptist Church of Brooklyn</p>
