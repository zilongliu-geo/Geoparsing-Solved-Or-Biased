<p><span class="loc">Adams County</span> is the fifth-most populous of the 64 counties of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 441,603. The county seat is <span class="loc">Brighton</span>. The county is named for Alva Adams, Governor of the State of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. <span class="loc">Adams County</span> is part of the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area. On May 30, 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act created the Territory of Nebraska and Territory of <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, divided by the Parallel 40Â° North (168th Avenue in present-day <span class="loc">Adams County</span>). The future <span class="loc">Adams County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, occupied a strip of <span class="loc">northern Arapahoe County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas Territory</span>, immediately south of the Nebraska Territory. In 1859, John D. "Colonel Jack" Henderson built a ranch, trading post, and hotel on <span class="loc">Henderson Island</span> in the <span class="loc">South Platte River</span> in <span class="loc">Arapahoe County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory. Jack Henderson was the former editor and proprietor of the <span class="loc">Leavenworth</span> (<span class="loc">Kansas Territory</span>) Journal and an outspoken pro-slavery politician who had been accused of vote fraud in eastern <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. Henderson sold meat and provisions to gold seekers on their way up the <span class="loc">South Platte River Trail</span> to the gold fields during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. <span class="loc">Henderson Island</span> was the first permanent settlement in the <span class="loc">South Platte River Valley</span> between Fort <span class="loc">Saint Vrain</span> in the <span class="loc">Nebraska Territory</span> and the Cherry Creek Diggings in the <span class="loc">Kansas Territory</span>. Jack Henderson eventually returned to eastern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and (ironically) fought for the Union in the American Civil War. <span class="loc">Henderson Island</span> is today the site of the <span class="loc">Adams County</span> Regional Park and Fairgrounds.</p>
