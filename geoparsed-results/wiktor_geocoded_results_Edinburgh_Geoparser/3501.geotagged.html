<p>Clinton is a village in <span class="loc">Oneida County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,942 at the 2010 census. It was named for George Clinton, the first Governor of <span class="loc">New York</span>. The Village of Clinton, site of Hamilton College, is within the Town of <span class="loc">Kirkland</span>. The village was known as the "village of schools" due to the large number of private schools operating in the village during the 19th century. The Clinton High School, Middle School, and Elementary School are located towards the center of the village, as are the business offices for the district. The village centers around a park where many community events take place. The Kirkland Art Center hosts many activities throughout the year including the KAC Road Race. Also, a local favorite, the Clinton Cider Mill located on Elm Street produces cider on site each Fall. The Clinton Arena was home to the Clinton Comets of the Eastern Hockey League, which ended play at the arena in 1973. Portions of the movie "Slap Shot" were filmed at the famed Clinton Arena. Its hockey program is widely regarded as one of the best in <span class="loc">New York</span> State, despite the small size of the school. The team won back to back State Championships twice. First in 1994-1995 and 1995â€“1996 and again in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006. In 2005 and 2006, Clinton's Cross Country team won back to back scholar athlete state championships.</p>
