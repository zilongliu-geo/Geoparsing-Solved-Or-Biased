<p><span class="loc">Kendal</span> /ˈkɛndəl/, anciently known as <span class="loc">Kirkby</span> in <span class="loc">Kendal</span> or <span class="loc">Kirkby</span> <span class="loc">Kendal</span>, is a market town and civil parish within the <span class="loc">South Lakeland District</span> of <span class="loc">Cumbria</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically in <span class="loc">Westmorland</span>, it is situated about 8 miles (13 km) south east of <span class="loc">Windermere</span>, 19 miles (31 km) north of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, 23 miles (37 km) north east of Barrow-in-Furness and 38 miles (61 km) north west of <span class="loc">Skipton</span>. The town lies on the <span class="loc">River Kent</span>, and has a total resident population of 28,586, making it the third largest settlement in <span class="loc">Cumbria</span> behind <span class="loc">Carlisle</span> and Barrow-in-Furness. <span class="loc">Kendal</span> today is known largely as a centre for tourism, as the home of <span class="loc">Kendal</span> mint cake, and as a producer of pipe tobacco and tobacco snuff. Its buildings, mostly constructed with the local grey limestone, have earned it the nickname the Auld Grey Town. <span class="loc">Kendal</span> is listed in the Domesday Book as part of <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span> with the name Cherchebi. For many centuries it was called Kirkbie <span class="loc">Kendal</span>, meaning "village with a church in the valley of the <span class="loc">River Kent</span>". The earliest castle was a Norman motte and bailey (now located on the west side of the town) when the settlement went under the name of Kirkbie Strickland.</p>
