<p><span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> is the second largest town in <span class="loc">Dominica</span>, with 2,977 inhabitants. It lies on the <span class="loc">Indian River</span> on <span class="loc">Dominica</span>'s northwest coast, in Saint John Parish. Cabrits National Park is located on a peninsula to the north of town. <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> has its own sea port in <span class="loc">Prince Rupert Bay</span>. <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> was initially chosen as the capital of <span class="loc">Dominica</span>, but only served in that capacity in 1760. After malaria broke out there the same year, the capital was moved to <span class="loc">Roseau</span>, where it remains. The Ross University School of Medicine, which has over 1,000 students mainly from the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Canada</span>, is located near <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>, in <span class="loc">Picard</span>. The school's presence is a major economic resource for the local people. A farmer's market runs Tuesdays, <span class="loc">Fridays</span>, and Saturdays in the city. The area is the birthplace of Exile One's Gordon Henderson, and local politician Roosevelt Douglas Benjamin's Park is the primary sporting venue and has hosted first-class cricket. The area has many plans for tourism and employment in general. The Japanese Government is currently funding and constructing a fish processing plant in <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>.</p>
