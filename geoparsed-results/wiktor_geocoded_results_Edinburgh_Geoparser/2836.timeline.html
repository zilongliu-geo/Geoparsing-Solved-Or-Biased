  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Adams County</span> lies in northeastern <span class="loc">Indiana</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span> and shares its eastern border with <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. It was officially established in <span class="date">1836</span>. The county seat is <span class="loc">Decatur</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, its population was 34,387, an increase of 2.27% from 33,625 in <span class="date">2000</span>. The county has four incorporated cities and towns with a total population of over 15,000, as well as many small unincorporated communities. The county is divided into 12 townships which provide local services. There are four <span class="loc">Indiana</span> state roads in the county, as well as three <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Routes and one railroad line. <span class="loc">Adams County</span> was created by statute on <span class="date">February 7, 1835</span>, and organized <span class="date">March 1, 1836</span>. Its name honors the sixth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="per">John Quincy Adams</span>. The site of the county seat was chosen <span class="date">May 18, 1836</span>. The first non-Native American settlers arrived in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Adams County</span> in <span class="date">1835</span>. They arrived as a result of the end of the Black Hawk War as well as the completion of the <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal. They consisted entirely of settlers from <span class="loc">New England</span>. These were "Yankee" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled <span class="loc">New England</span> in the colonial era. They were primarily members of the <span class="per">Congregational Church</span> though due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before coming to what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Adams County</span>. The <span class="per">Congregational Church</span> subsequently has gone through many divisions and some factions are <span class="date">now</span> known as the Church of Christ and the <span class="per">United Church</span> of Christ. When the <span class="loc">New England</span> settlers arrived in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Adams County</span> there was nothing but a dense virgin forest and wild prairie.</p><br><br>
