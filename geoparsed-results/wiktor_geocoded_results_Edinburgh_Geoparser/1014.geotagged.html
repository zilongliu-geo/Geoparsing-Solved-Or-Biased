<p><span class="loc">Somerset</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Perry County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,481 at the 2010 census. Saint Joseph Church, the oldest Catholic church in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, is located just outside <span class="loc">Somerset</span> on State Route 383. The village of <span class="loc">Somerset</span> was established in 1810 by settlers from <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> at the spot on Zane's Trace located midway between <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> and <span class="loc">Zanesville</span>. Seven years later, parts of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, <span class="loc">Muskingum</span>, and <span class="loc">Washington</span> counties were merged to create <span class="loc">Perry County</span>, and the house of a <span class="loc">Somerset</span> resident was named the first temporary courthouse. In 1819, the county government arrange for the erection of a purpose-built courthouse in <span class="loc">Somerset</span>; while most of the building was used for a jail, it also included a courtroom and space for some county offices. Ten years later, a permanent courthouse was constructed on the village's public square. In 1833, <span class="loc">Somerset</span> contained county buildings, nine stores, six taverns, about 120 dwelling houses, and more than 600 inhabitants. As the village of <span class="loc">New Lexington</span> grew in importance, its residents began to agitate for the county seat to be moved to their community. From 1851 to 1859, the state legislature passed three separate laws to permit the county seat to be moved; contentious elections and a decision by the <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> of <span class="loc">Ohio</span> saw the county seat move to <span class="loc">New Lexington</span>, back to <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, and finally back to <span class="loc">New Lexington</span>. After it ceased to be used as a courthouse, the building was leased to <span class="loc">Somerset</span> for use as its village hall.</p>
