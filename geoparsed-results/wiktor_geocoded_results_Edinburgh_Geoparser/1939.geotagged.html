<p>Riverton is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">King County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,407 at the 2010 census. Riverton was formerly part of the Riverton-Boulevard Park CDP, which was split up for the 2010 census into Riverton and Boulevard Park. Riverton also refers to a neighboring former community in part of what is now <span class="loc">Tukwila</span> in the Duwamish River Valley. It was on the left bank of the Duwamish, not far from the location on the right bank of the present-day Tukwila Community Center. Riverton lent its name to an early 20th-century bridge, variously known as the Riverton Draw Bridge, the Riverton Drawspan, and <span class="loc">King County</span> Bridge 622-A. Built 1903, the bridge developed a reputation for being rather unsafe. It closed to vehicles 1919, and was demolished 1927. A remnant of the central pier can still be seen in the river as of 2009, visible either from the riverbank or from the 119th St. S. pedestrian bridge or the <span class="loc">Allentown</span> Bridge. Riverton is located at 47°29′41″N 122°18′40″W (47.494614, -122.311248). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of 1.182 square miles (3.061 km²), of which, 1.182 square miles (3.061 km²) of it is land and 0.000 square miles (0.000 km²) of it (0%) is water.</p>
