  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Arcos is a Brazilian municipality located in the center of the state of <span class="loc">Minas Gerais</span>. Its population as of <span class="date">2007</span> was 34,763 people living in a total area of 510 km². The city belongs to the meso-region of <span class="per">Oeste de Minas</span> and to the micro-region of <span class="loc">Formiga</span>. It became a municipality in <span class="date">1938</span>. The city center of Arcos is located at an elevation of 740 meters just off state highway MG-429. Neighboring municipalities are: Luz (N), Japaraíba (NE), <span class="per">Santo Antônio</span> do Monte (E), <span class="loc">Formiga</span> (SE), Córrego <span class="loc">Fundo</span> (S), Pains (SW), and <span class="loc">Iguatama</span> (W). Distances to other cities <span class="loc">Belo Horizonte</span>/MG - 210 km Formiga/MG - 32 km Japaraíba/MG - 39 km Divinópolis/MG - 95 km There are several explanations for the name of the city, but the most accepted is the theory that rims ("arcos" or "aros" in Portuguese) of barrels were left on the bank of the stream that crosses the region to mark the trail for cattle heading west to the Triângulo Mineiro. The pioneers knew of the place along the stream where the barrel rims could be found. Little by little the place became known as "Córrego dos Arcos", <span class="org">Stream of the Barrel Rims</span>. However the city only received the name in <span class="date">1833</span>. Before it had been called São Julião. <span class="date">Today</span> this name belongs to a rural community of the municipality which has the chapel of São Julião.</p><br><br>
