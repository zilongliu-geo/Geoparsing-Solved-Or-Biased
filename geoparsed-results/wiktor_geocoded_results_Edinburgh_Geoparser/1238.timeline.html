  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">La Carolina</span> is a Municipality located in the <span class="loc">province of Jaén</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>. According to the <span class="date">2014</span> census, the municipality has a population of 15,808 inhabitants. <span class="loc">La Carolina</span> was formerly the capital of the <span class="loc">Intendencia</span> of the Nuevas Poblaciones de Andalucía y <span class="loc">Sierra Morena</span> founded in this formerly remote and desolate area of the <span class="loc">Sierra Morena</span> in <span class="date">1767</span> by <span class="per">King Carlos III</span>. The object of the plan, drawn up by his minister <span class="per">Pablo de Olavide</span>, administrator of <span class="loc">Andalucia</span>, was to populate the area around Despeñaperros gorge. Known as "the gateway to <span class="loc">Andalucia</span>"; this pass was a notorious point on the Cadiz-to-Madrid royal highway for bandits. Other towns of note in this plan were <span class="loc">La Carlota</span> and <span class="loc">La Luisiana</span>. The <span class="loc">Intendencia</span> administrative division was wrapped up in <span class="date">1813</span>. Six thousand Catholic settlers arrived from <span class="loc">Belgium</span>, <span class="loc">Germany</span>, <span class="loc">Austria</span> and <span class="loc">Switzerland</span> to take advantage of the generous offers of land and livestock being made to colonizers (five chickens, five goats, five sheep, two cows, and a sow per family). With <span class="date">a few years</span>, about half of them had died from illness or gone home: the rest gradually lost their national identities over the <span class="date">years</span>, and took on the language and customs of their host country. One can still find people in this area with Germanic surnames such as Eisman, Minch, <span class="per">Smidt</span> and <span class="per">Kobler</span>.</p><br><br>
