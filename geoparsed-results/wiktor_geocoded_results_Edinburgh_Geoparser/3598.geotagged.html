<p>George Town (Chinese: 乔治市; pinyin: Qiáozhì Shì, <span class="loc">Tamil</span>: ஜோர்ஜ் டவுன்) is the capital city of the Malaysian state of Penang, located on the north-east corner of the island. It had an estimated population of 500,000 as of 2010. The metropolitan area (which consists of <span class="loc">Jelutong</span>, <span class="loc">Sungai Pinang</span>, <span class="loc">Sungai Nibong</span>, Gelugor, <span class="loc">Air Itam</span>, Tanjung Bungah and <span class="loc">Tanjung Tokong</span>) has a population of 2.5 million, which makes it the second largest metropolitan area and the biggest northern metropolis in <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. Excluding the metropolitan area, the area of George Town is the seventh largest city by population in <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. Together with <span class="loc">Alor</span> Setar and Malacca City, it is one of the Malaysian oldest cities in the <span class="loc">Straits of Malacca</span> since its foundation by Francis Light, who was a captain and trader for the British <span class="loc">East India</span> Company (EIC) after being instructed by his company, Jourdain Sullivan and de <span class="loc">Souza</span> to establish presence in the <span class="loc">Malay Archipelago</span>. Light gained control of <span class="loc">Penang Island</span> through a treaty negotiated with the Sultan of <span class="loc">Kedah</span>, although in the early stages of negotiation the Sultan refused to cede the island. The <span class="loc">Fort Cornwallis</span> was then established and he was successful in increasing the island import values and settlement population especially with the free trade policy the British used at the time. The Sultan of <span class="loc">Kedah</span> tried to regain control of the area when he saw the British had failed to provide protection to them as promised earlier in the treaty they had signed when the Sultan was attacked by the Siamese, the plan was however ended with a failure when Light implemented night raids on the Sultan's fortress. Prior to its successful trading post, many Chinese traders began to settle in the town as well to other areas in <span class="loc">Penang Island</span> to participate in agriculture and to manage plantations. This was continued under the administration of Straits Settlements with the migration of more Chinese together with Indian workers prior to the Industrial Revolution in <span class="loc">Britain</span>.</p>
