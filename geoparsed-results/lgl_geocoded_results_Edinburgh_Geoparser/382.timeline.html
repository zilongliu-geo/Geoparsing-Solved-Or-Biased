  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Reward raised in murder case. The reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect in the <span class="date">June 2007</span> murder of a <span class="loc">Tennessee Colony</span> man has been upped to $5,000. On <span class="date">June 1, 2007</span>, <span class="loc">Melton</span> <span class="per">Lewis Paris</span>, 51, was found shot to death inside his residence at 341 CR <span class="date">2701</span> between <span class="loc">Tennessee Colony</span> and Yard in northern <span class="loc">Anderson County</span>. <span class="per">Paris</span> had been shot once in the head, according to <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> <span class="per">Sheriff Greg Taylor</span>. On <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, <span class="per">Taylor</span> told the Herald-Press that the <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> Crimestoppers’ board of directors recently voted to increase the reward in <span class="per">Paris</span>’ case from $1,000 to $5,000. There have been few solid leads in the case, the sheriff admitted. “Unfortunately, we don’t have anything new,” <span class="per">Taylor</span> said <span class="date">Wednesday</span>. “Occasionally, we’ll have somebody who thinks they have some knowledge of it, but nothing’s panned out so far. This $5,000 (reward) might help.” <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> Sheriff’s <span class="per">Capt. Tommy Barr</span> is heading the investigation, with <span class="per">Sgt. Larry Warrick</span> providing assistance, according to the sheriff. Authorities have said they were dispatched to <span class="per">Paris</span>’ residence during the late afternoon hours of <span class="date">June 1, 2007</span> after a friend of the decedent reported coming to the man’s residence and discovering him laying on the floor in a puddle of blood. Around the time of the murder, <span class="per">Taylor</span> told the Herald-Press that “the lifestyle of the deceased...tends to increase the possibility of a lot of suspects.” Anyone with possible information about the case should call Crimestoppers at (903) 729-TIPS (8477).</p><br><br>
