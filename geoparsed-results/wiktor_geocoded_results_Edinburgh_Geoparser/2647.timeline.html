  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Douglas</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,471 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It includes the sizable <span class="per">Douglas</span> State Forest, managed by the <span class="org">Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation</span> (DCR). The name of <span class="per">Douglas</span> was first given to the territory of the town in the <span class="date">year 1746</span>. New Sherburn or "New Sherburn Grant" had previously been its designation, since its first occupancy by the English settlers which was as early as <span class="date">1715</span>. The original settlers came primarily from <span class="loc">Sherburn</span>, although many hailed from <span class="loc">Natick</span> as well. New Sherburn was removed from <span class="loc">Suffolk County</span> (or <span class="loc">Middlesex county</span>?) to <span class="loc">Worcester County</span> at its formation on <span class="date">April 2, 1731</span>. The name <span class="per">Douglas</span> was given in <span class="date">1746</span>, when Dr. <span class="per">William Douglas</span>, an eminent physician of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, in consideration of the privilege of naming the township offered the inhabitants the sum of $500.00 as a fund for the establishment of free schools together with a tract of 30 acres (12 ha) of land with a dwelling house and barn thereon. <span class="per">Douglas</span>'s forests gave rise to a woodcutting industry and the <span class="per">Douglas</span> axe company. A woolen manufacturing company, on the <span class="loc">Mumford River</span> in <span class="loc">East Douglas</span>, in recent times held by the Schuster family, has been prominent in the history of this community. <span class="per">General Lafayette</span>, of <span class="loc">France</span>, stopped here during the Revolutionary War, to change horses, on his way to <span class="loc">Boston</span> to join <span class="per">General Washington</span>. <span class="per">Lafayette</span> was a hero of the American Revolution and the French Revolution.</p><br><br>
