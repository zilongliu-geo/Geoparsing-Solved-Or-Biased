  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Manchester</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hartford County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the town had a total population of 58,241. The urban center of the town is the <span class="loc">Manchester</span> census-designated place, with a population of 30,577 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Manchester</span> was settled by colonists around <span class="date">1672</span> as a farming community, although at the time it was known just as <span class="loc">Orford Parish</span> (the name that can be found on the memorial to the Revolutionary soldiers from the town). The many rivers and brooks provided power for paper, lumber and textile industries, and the town quickly evolved into an industrial center. The town of <span class="loc">Hartford</span> once included the land <span class="date">now</span> occupied by the towns of <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">East Hartford</span>, and <span class="loc">West Hartford</span>. In <span class="date">1783</span>, <span class="loc">East Hartford</span> became a separate town, which included <span class="loc">Manchester</span> in its city limits until <span class="date">1823</span>. The Pitkin Glassworks operated from 1783-1830 as the first successful glassworks in <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. The Pitkin Glassworks Ruin have been preserved by a historical society. In <span class="date">1838</span>, the Cheney family started what became the world's largest silk mill. Eventually, <span class="loc">Manchester</span> became an ideal industrial community. The mills, houses of the owners, and homes of the workers are <span class="date">now</span> part of the <span class="org">Cheney Brothers</span> Historic District, a National Historic Landmark.</p><br><br>
