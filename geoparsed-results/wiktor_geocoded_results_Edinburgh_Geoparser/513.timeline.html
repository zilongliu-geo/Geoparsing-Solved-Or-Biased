  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Jackson</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Butts County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Butts County</span>. The population was 5,045 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 3,934 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The community was named after governor <span class="per">James Jackson</span>. Founded in <span class="date">1826</span>, <span class="per">Jackson</span> began as a 303-acre (1.23 km2) plot purchased for the purpose of starting the town. The plot was divided into squares and each square into lots. The first buyer of a lot in the new town was John D. Swift of <span class="loc">Newton County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. During the Civil War, much of <span class="per">Jackson</span> was razed by the army of <span class="per">General William T. Sherman</span> during his <span class="date">March</span> to the Sea. After the war, <span class="per">Jackson</span>, like much of the South, struggled economically for <span class="date">decades</span>. <span class="per">Jackson</span> remained little more than a small village until the arrival of the railroads in the latter half of the 19th century. On <span class="date">May 5, 1882</span>, the first train arrived in <span class="per">Jackson</span>, heralding a new era in transportation of people and goods. During the 20th century, <span class="per">Jackson</span> grew and industrial textile mills became the largest employer of local citizens. The arrival of Interstate 75 just a few miles to the southwest of the city gave citizens quick access to <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> and <span class="loc">Macon</span>. The numerous schools throughout the county consolidated into one central school system located in <span class="per">Jackson</span>, and the schools desegregated in <span class="date">1968</span>. In <span class="date">the 1970s</span>, <span class="per">Jackson</span> slowly became a bedroom community. City taxes were also abolished in <span class="date">the 1970s</span>.</p><br><br>
