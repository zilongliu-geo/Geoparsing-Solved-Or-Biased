  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Two local events to aid leukemia victim. <span class="per">Terry Chase</span> is suffering from a rare form of leukemia and is looking to the community for help. The 60-year-old <span class="loc">Alton</span> man was diagnosed with leukemia in <span class="date">August</span> and discovered that his form of the disease does not respond to typical cancer drugs. Instead, he requires a stem cell transplant - a procedure similar to a bone marrow transplant, except that only stem cells from the marrow are used. "What initially seemed like a simple part of the whole thing, to find a donor, get a transplant, turned into the biggest hurdle of all of it," <span class="per">Chase</span> said. <span class="per">Chase</span> had to stop working due to chemotherapy and weekly blood transfusions. He is married with two stepchildren. <span class="per">Mike Guglielmo</span>, <span class="loc">New England</span> ambassador for the bone marrow donor center DKMS <span class="loc">Americas</span>, is organizing a bone marrow drive <span class="date">today</span> at the <span class="org">Meredith Community Center</span> from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. A second group is conducting a drive <span class="date">tomorrow</span> at Pizzeria Uno in <span class="org">Concord</span>, at 15 Fort Eddy Road, from noon to 6 p.m. The Uno's drive is also a fundraiser, and 20 percent of proceeds from anyone who eats at the restaurant during that time will be given to the <span class="per">Chase</span> family. Getting on the national bone marrow registry requires only a cheek swab.</p><br><br>
