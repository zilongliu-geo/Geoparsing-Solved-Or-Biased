  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Committee plans <span class="date">May</span> benefit along with dedication. It may have seemed, at times, like it might never get there, but the <span class="org">Dublin Veterans Project</span> is moving closer to its fundraising and dedication goal. "We are 80 percent to our goal," project committee member <span class="per">Michael Kehoe</span> said during <span class="loc">Dublin City</span> Council's regular session <span class="date">Monday, March 16</span>. The committee has raised nearly $612,000 toward its goal of $790,000, he said, with eight of 25 trees designated in the sycamore grove section of the memorial. In <span class="date">2006</span>, <span class="loc">Dublin City</span> Council committed $250,000 to the project, with another $250,000 in funds to be raised by the Veterans Project fundraising committee. At the time, plans proposed to have the completed project's dedication on <span class="date">Veterans Day</span> in <span class="date">2007</span>. But the project ran into obstacles when city staff learned in <span class="date">July 2007</span> that the total construction cost for the Grounds of Remembrance memorial was approaching, if not exceeding, $800,000. The cost overrun resulted in the Veterans Project committee unanimously approving a motion to allow project design firm Plant Architect Inc. of <span class="loc">Toronto</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> a second chance to come back to the committee with a design for the Grounds of Remembrance project that would meet the original $500,000 budget. The project was designed to include an entry sign, a copper clad loggia, a memory wall, a dedication wall, walking path and associated site work, according to information from the city. City Council unanimously approved a resolution accepting a base bid of $478,840 from the <span class="org">McDaniel Construction Corp.</span> as the lowest and best bid for the project in <span class="date">August 2008</span> and construction began shortly after. The project committee has a fundraiser, the Red, <span class="per">White</span> and <span class="per">Blue</span> Bash, scheduled for 6:30 to <span class="date">8:30 p.m. May 1</span> at the Villas at <span class="loc">Coffman Park</span>, <span class="loc">Kehoe</span> said. Tickets are $300 each and include a dedication stone, he said. "If they have already purchased a stone, we will offer another option," he said. The dedication of Grounds of Remembrance in Dublin Veterans Park is on track to take place <span class="date">Memorial Day</span>, <span class="date">Monday, May 25</span>, "following the parade led by the VFW and <span class="loc">American Legion</span>," <span class="per">Kehoe</span> said. "You have all done an incredible job raising the funds and increasing awareness of this very important memorial," <span class="per">Dublin Mayor Marilee Chinnici-Zuercher</span> said. In other council business, legislation was approved authorizing the city to enter into a pre-annexation agreement for 5,600 acres on the east side of Hyland-Croy Road at 8600 Hyland-Croy Road in Jerome Township, in order to obtain city water and sewer services. Legislation amending the annual appropriations ordinance for the fiscal year ending <span class="date">Dec. 31, 2009</span>, also was approved. In addition, council approved a resolution allowing the city to enter into an agreement allowing the operation of a Subway restaurant in the <span class="org">Dublin Community Recreation Center</span>. The city previously had a lease agreement with <span class="org">TehKu Tea Co</span>. TehKu ceased operations at the center in <span class="date">August 2008</span> due to its inability to prosper, according to information from the city. "We learned a lot from that experience," Dublin Recreation Services Director Matt Earman said. Following a patron survey conducted by city staff, Subway was found to meet the primary criteria of providing prompt service for all menu options, a variety of healthy food options, and a business strategy with proven success inside a recreation center similar to the DCRC -- the <span class="loc">Natatorium</span> in <span class="loc">Cuyahoga Falls</span>, he said. The estimated timeframe for full operation at the DCRC is eight to <span class="date">12 weeks</span>, according to information from the city. The center's restaurant will include breakfast sandwiches as well as the full Subway menu. Council adjourned to a closed session for discussion of legal, land acquisition and personnel matters, according to information from the city, at the request of <span class="loc">Dublin City</span> Manager <span class="per">Terry Foegler</span>.</p><br><br>
