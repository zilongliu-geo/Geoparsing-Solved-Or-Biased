  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Antonio</span> is a large district in <span class="loc">Oakland</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, encompassing the land east of <span class="loc">Lake Merritt</span> to <span class="loc">Sausal Creek</span>. It is one of the most diverse areas of the city. It takes its name from <span class="loc">Rancho San Antonio</span>, the name of the land as granted to <span class="per">Luís María Peralta</span> by the last Spanish governor of <span class="loc">California</span>. The settlement that became <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> began in <span class="date">1851</span> when <span class="per">J.B. Larue</span> purchased <span class="per">Peralta</span>'s land west of <span class="loc">San Antonio Creek</span>. The site was west of Clinton. <span class="per">Larue</span> built a store and wharf and the community grew up around them. The <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="loc">Oakland</span> Railroad built a station at <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>. When the Central Pacific Railroad took over the line in <span class="date">1870</span>, the name was changed to Brooklyn. When the Southern Pacific Railroad took over the line in <span class="date">1883</span>, the name was changed to <span class="loc">East Oakland</span>. Clinton and <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> joined in <span class="date">1856</span> to form a new town called Brooklyn named after the ship that had brought Mormon settlers to <span class="loc">California</span> in <span class="date">1846</span>. Brooklyn joined with nearby Lynn to incorporate in <span class="date">1870</span> under the name Brooklyn. In <span class="date">1872</span>, Brooklyn voters approved their city's annexation by <span class="loc">Oakland</span>.</p><br><br>
