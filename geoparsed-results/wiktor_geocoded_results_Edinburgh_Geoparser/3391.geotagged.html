<p><span class="loc">Karara</span> is a town and locality in the <span class="loc">Darling Downs</span> region within the <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is in the Southern Downs Region local government area. In the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Karara</span> had a population of 278 people. The town is on the Cunningham Highway, 208 kilometres (129 mi) south west of the state capital, <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>. The highway passes through the locality from the east to the south-west. The Toowoomba-Karara Road connects the highway through to the north of the locality to <span class="loc">Leyburn</span> and ultimately through to <span class="loc">Toowoomba</span>. The <span class="loc">South Western</span> railway line passes through the locality roughly parallel and to the north of the highway. Both the line and <span class="loc">Karara</span> railway station are no longer in active use. The Durakai State Forest occupies the southern and eastern areas within the locality; otherwise it is freehold land predominately used for farming apart from a small urban centre. There are a number of creeks running south to north through the locality which is in the drainage basin of the <span class="loc">Condamine River</span>. The name <span class="loc">Karara</span> is believed to be an Aboriginal name for <span class="loc">Canal Creek</span>. The <span class="loc">South Western</span> railway line from <span class="loc">Warwick</span> to <span class="loc">Karara</span> was opened in 1904.</p>
