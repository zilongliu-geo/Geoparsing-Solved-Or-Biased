<p>Jefferson (also known as <span class="loc">Owendale</span>) is an unincorporated community within <span class="loc">Cardston County</span>, <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It community is located approximately 16 km (9.9 mi) southeast of <span class="loc">Cardston</span>, which is home to <span class="loc">Cardston County</span>'s municipal office. One of Jefferson's two services at this point in time is an unmanned postal box outlet (Rural Route 2 Site 10). It shares the same postal code as <span class="loc">Cardston</span> (T0K 0K0), and in fact, mail going to the Jefferson area is addressed to <span class="loc">Cardston</span> - as Jefferson-bound mail is sorted at <span class="loc">Cardston</span> - then delivered to Jefferson by Canada Post on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. There is a new Canada Post box installment after the old, green one was covered by debris when the neighboring abandoned Jefferson Garage collapsed in a windstorm in 2003. The garage had been abandoned for generations and the wooden structure had seemed to be on the verge of collapse for years. The now-flattened garage had been beside an old General Store, but that store was converted into a family home generations ago. The other service for the community is the Jefferson Waste Transfer Site, constructed in the 1980s to replace an old open-air dump that was located in a small gully two miles west of Jefferson. The newer Waste Transfer Site is located only about a quarter-mile east of Jefferson, and is manned only one day a week.</p>
