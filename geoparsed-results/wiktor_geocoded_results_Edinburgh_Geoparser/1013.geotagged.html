<p><span class="loc">Somerset</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Bristol County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 18,165 at the 2010 census. It is the birthplace and hometown of Clifford Milburn Holland (1883â€“1924), the chief engineer and namesake of the Holland Tunnel in New <span class="loc">York City</span>. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> was first settled in 1677 on the Shawomet lands, and was officially incorporated in 1790. It was named for <span class="loc">Somerset Square</span> in <span class="loc">Boston</span>, which was, in turn, named for the <span class="loc">county of Somerset</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. It was once a vital shipping point, and after the War of 1812 it was one of <span class="loc">America</span>'s chief distribution points. In 1872, it became the site of a major coal port, and in the early 20th century a large cannery existed in the town. However, as neighboring <span class="loc">Fall River</span>'s industry grew, it absorbed much of Somerset's, and the town took on more of a suburban character. In fact, the town's population grew during the Great Depression, as many people from <span class="loc">Fall River</span> and other localities moved to the suburb. Today, the town's major industry (other than suburban services) is power generation, with the Montaup Electric Company plant upriver (founded in 1923) and the <span class="loc">Brayton Point</span> Power Plant at the town's southern tip (founded in 1963). <span class="loc">Brayton Point</span> has been the target of much criticism for its pollution problems.</p>
