  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a county located in east central <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 34,273. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Chandler. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Oklahoma City</span>, <span class="loc">OK Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. In <span class="date">2010</span>, the center of population of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> was located in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, near the town of Sparks. The <span class="loc">United States</span> purchased the large tract of land known as the Louisiana Purchase from <span class="loc">France</span> in <span class="date">1803</span>. <span class="per">Washington Irving</span>, <span class="per">Charles J. Latrobe</span>, and <span class="per">Count Albert</span> de Pourtal√®s accompanied <span class="per">Henry L. Ellsworth</span> and others on an expedition in Indian Territory that may have passed through the far northwestern corner of <span class="date">the future</span> <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>. The <span class="loc">Osage</span> hunted on land that includes present-day <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> until they ceded the area in an <span class="date">1825</span> treaty to the federal government. The government then assigned the land to the Creek and the Seminoles after they were removed from the southeastern <span class="loc">United States</span>. After the Civil War in <span class="date">1866</span>, these tribes were forced to give up lands that included present-day <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> in Reconstruction Treaties for siding with the Confederacy. The federal government then used the area to resettle the <span class="per">Sac</span> and <span class="per">Fox</span>, Potawatomi, <span class="per">Kickapoo</span> and <span class="per">Ioway</span> tribes. Established in <span class="date">1870</span>, the <span class="per">Sac</span> and <span class="per">Fox</span> agency, established on the eastern edge of the present-day county, was the first settlement in the area.</p><br><br>
