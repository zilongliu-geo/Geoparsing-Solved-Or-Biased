  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> is an incorporated town in <span class="loc">Livingston County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,265 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> is located at 40°45′15″N 88°17′35″W (40.754256, -88.293023). According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> has a total area of 2.71 square miles (7.02 km2), all land. Founding of Chatsworth Chatsworth was laid out by Zeno Secor (<span class="date">1809</span> – <span class="date">25 October 1875</span>) and Cornelia <span class="per">Gilman</span> on <span class="date">8 June 1859</span>. Both founders were from <span class="loc">New York</span>. <span class="loc">Secor</span> was a member of the <span class="org">Board of Directors</span> of the company that was building the <span class="loc">Peoria</span> and Oquawka Railroad. He was a noted civil engineer and marine engine designer, who was involved with a number of railroads. <span class="loc">Secor</span> was later president of the <span class="loc">Toledo</span> <span class="per">Peoria</span> and <span class="per">Western</span> Railroad. <span class="loc">Secor</span> is best known for building a number of ironclad warships for the <span class="org">Union</span> Navy. Cornelia <span class="per">Gilman</span> was perhaps the person of that name who was the wife of <span class="per">Samuel Gilman</span>, another director of the firm, and the man who gave his name to the nearby town of <span class="loc">Gilman</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> is perhaps named for <span class="loc">Chatsworth House</span>, the home of the <span class="per">Duke of Devonshire</span>. Trains were running along the <span class="loc">Peoria</span> and Oquawka Railroad before the town was platted. The railroad soon became the <span class="loc">Toledo</span>, <span class="loc">Peoria</span> and Western.</p><br><br>
