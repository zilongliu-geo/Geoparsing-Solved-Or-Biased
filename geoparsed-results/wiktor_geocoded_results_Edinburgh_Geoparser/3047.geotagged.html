<p><span class="loc">Luni</span> is an abandoned town and the name of a frazione of the comune (municipality) of <span class="loc">Ortonovo</span>, province of <span class="loc">La Spezia</span>, in the easternmost end of the <span class="loc">Liguria region</span> of northern <span class="loc">Italy</span>. It gives its name to Lunigiana, a region spanning eastern <span class="loc">Liguria</span> and <span class="loc">northern Tuscany (province</span> of Massa-Carrara). Points of interest include remains of the elliptical Roman amphitheatre (1st century AD) and the Archaeological Museum. Located in a plain near the <span class="loc">Tyrrhenian Sea</span> and close to the borders with <span class="loc">Tuscany</span>, <span class="loc">Luni</span> is crossed by the river <span class="loc">Magra</span> and lies between <span class="loc">Sarzana</span> (7 km in north) and <span class="loc">Carrara</span> (5 km in south). It is 4 km far from <span class="loc">Ortonovo</span>, 15 from <span class="loc">Massa</span> and 30 from <span class="loc">La Spezia</span>. The village is served by the National Highway 1 "Aurelia", crossed at <span class="loc">Luni</span> Mare by the A12 motorway and counts a railway station on the Pisa-Genoa line. In the 5th century, it was still notable, as it was chosen as episcopal see. Captured by the Goths in the following century, it was reconquered by the Byzantines in 552, who however lost it to the <span class="loc">Lombards</span> in 642. The latter damaged the city's economy, favouring the trades routes that passed through the nearby port of <span class="loc">Lucca</span> to the south. <span class="loc">Luni</span> had been reduced to a small village at the time of the Lombard king Liutprand, later, it was a countship see under <span class="loc">Charlemagne</span>, exactly on the border between the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Italy</span> and the Papal States.</p>
