<p>Hope is a city in <span class="loc">Hempstead County</span> in southwestern <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Hope is the county seat of <span class="loc">Hempstead County</span> and the principal city of the Hope Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> and <span class="loc">Nevada</span> counties. Hope is the birthplace of two long-serving <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> governors: Bill Clinton (who went on to become the 42nd President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> after the 1992 election) and Mike Huckabee (who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016). Hope began in 1873, when a railroad was built through the area. The town was named for Hope Longborough, the daughter of a railroad executive. The climate is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the KÃ¶ppen Climate Classification system, Hope has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated Cfa on climate maps. Hope is also known for growing watermelons and continues to produce records for the largest specimens in the world. The last record was set by Lloyd Bright in 2005 with a 268.8 pound watermelon. The Watermelon Festival is celebrated annually from Thursday-Saturday during the second week of August. The watermelon is used in the municipal logo and the Hope slogan: A Slice of the Good Life.</p>
