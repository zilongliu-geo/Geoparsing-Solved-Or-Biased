  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Torrential monsoon rains for <span class="date">the past 11 days</span> have inundated parts of southeast <span class="loc">Asia</span>, heavily flooding areas of <span class="loc">India</span>, <span class="loc">Nepal</span>, and <span class="loc">Bangladesh</span> and affecting over 20 million people. An estimated 1,400 have been killed across the region, as waterborne diseases have proliferated and become highly virulent in the humid and wet conditions. The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, is currently providing relief to affected areas. In the Northern Indian states of <span class="loc">Bihar</span> and <span class="loc">Uttar Pradesh</span>, as many as 12.5 million people have been displaced or affected by flooding. Clashes with police in <span class="loc">Bihar</span> have left 20 villagers injured and one man dead, since many are staging protests after being forced from their homes. UNICEF estimates as many as 1,103 may have died in 138 districts throughout northern <span class="loc">India</span>. Hospitals are reaching dangerous volumes as disease is sickening thousands. Many are ill from dehydration, exposure and dysentery. Aid workers warn that malaria is a serious risk. The <span class="org">Indian Air Force</span> began dropping aid packages containing medical supplies and food <span class="date">yesterday</span>. Santosh Mishra, a villager in the <span class="loc">Gondra district</span> of <span class="loc">Uttar Pradesh</span> remarked, "I have not seen such flooding in <span class="date">the last 24 years</span>." Bodies of two students of the IIM <span class="loc">Indore</span> swept in the flash floods in <span class="loc">Indore</span> were recovered.</p><br><br>
