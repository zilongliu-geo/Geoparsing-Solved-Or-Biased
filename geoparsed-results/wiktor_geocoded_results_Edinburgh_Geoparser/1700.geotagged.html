<p><span class="loc">Lagoa</span> (Portuguese pronunciation: [lɐˈɣoɐ]; Portuguese for lagoon) is a municipality in the southwestern part of São <span class="loc">Miguel</span> Island in the <span class="loc">Azores</span>. The population in 2011 was 14,442, in an area of 45.59 km². <span class="loc">Lagoa</span> is located east of <span class="loc">Ponta Delgada</span>, the island capital. The area of <span class="loc">Lagoa</span> was settled just after the first colonists came to the island of São <span class="loc">Miguel</span>, and its first inhabitants established their homes in the areas that would eventually form the villages of <span class="loc">Lagoa</span> and Água de <span class="loc">Pau</span>. It is believed that early settlers chose the area for its sheltered bay, which was necessary for their loading and unloading of cargo, livestock and provisions. The <span class="loc">Porto</span> dos <span class="loc">Carneiros</span> was one of these areas, so named for the fact that sheep, as well as other animals, were offloaded within its cove. The celebrated Portuguese historian, Father Gaspar Frutuoso referred to <span class="loc">Lagoa</span>, in the way that the first settlers named it, a name that was dependent on where they made their homes: “The village of <span class="loc">Lagoa</span>, called this owing to the existence of a "lake in front" of the doors to the Church (a reef) and its port where [it was large enough for ships] to battle, where in the past there were large catches of fish, since the ocean would enter it, and the livestock would drink from its waters and others would pass time swimming in its waters..."</p>
