<p>The <span class="loc">District of Kent</span> is a district municipality located 116 kilometres (72 mi) east of <span class="loc">Vancouver</span>, British Columbia. Part of the <span class="loc">Fraser Valley Regional District</span>, <span class="loc">Kent</span> consists of several communities, the largest and most well-known being Agassiz—the only town in the municipality—Harrison Mills, <span class="loc">Kilby</span>, Mount Woodside, <span class="loc">Kent</span> Prairie, Sea <span class="loc">Bird Island</span> and <span class="loc">Ruby Creek</span>. Included within the municipality's boundaries are several separately-governed Indian reserves, including the Seabird Island First Nation's reserves on and around the island of the same name. <span class="loc">Kent</span>'s only incorporated municipal neighbours are <span class="loc">Chilliwack</span>, to the south across the <span class="loc">Fraser</span>, and Harrison Hot Springs which is an enclave on the north side of the municipality at the south end of <span class="loc">Harrison Lake</span>. Chehalis, to the west across the <span class="loc">Harrison River</span> from Harrison Mills, is unincorporated and largely an Indian reserve community of the Chehalis First Nation of the Sts'Ailes people. Located north of <span class="loc">Chilliwack</span> and south of Harrison Hot Springs, <span class="loc">Kent</span> is made up of several communities. <span class="loc">Agassiz</span> is the district's commercial and industrial centre, and also the largest community. Harrison Mills in western <span class="loc">Kent</span> consists of mainly agricultural land and is home to the British Columbia Heritage Kilby Museum and Campground. Harrison Highlands (formerly known as Mount Woodside, which is still the name of the mountain Harrison Highlands is located on) is a residential resort development located in central-west <span class="loc">Kent</span> targeted towards residents from <span class="loc">Vancouver</span>. <span class="loc">Ruby Creek</span> to the northeast is a mixed rural-residential community. Rockwell Drive, at the eastern shore of <span class="loc">Harrison Lake</span>, serves as a residential and commercial resort-like community.</p>
