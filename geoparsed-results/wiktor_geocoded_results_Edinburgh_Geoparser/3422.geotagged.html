<p><span class="loc">Guinea</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Caroline County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Guinea</span> is 8.5 miles (13.7 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Bowling Green</span>. The modern spelling of the name has been altered from the earlier "Guiney" or "Guiney's", so called after an old <span class="loc">Caroline County</span> family, the Guineys (also spelled Guinney, Gwinny, or Ginny in various records). <span class="loc">Guinea</span> was the site of a Civil War era railroad station on the <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">Fredericksburg</span> and <span class="loc">Potomac Railroad</span> known as Guiney's Station. About four thousand captured Union soldiers were collected at Guiney's station after the Battle of <span class="loc">Chancellorsville</span>. General Robert E. Lee ordered the wounded General Stonewall Jackson to be taken away from the field hospital at the front lines near <span class="loc">Chancellorsville</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span> to a safer location at Guiney's Station. The location is notable as being the place where Confederate General Stonewall Jackson died on May 10, 1863. The human remains of General Stonewall Jackson were placed on a one-car train at Guiney's Station on the morning of Monday, May 11, 1863 for transport to <span class="loc">Richmond</span>.</p>
