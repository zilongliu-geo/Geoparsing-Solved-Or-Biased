<p>Magdalena is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Laguna</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 22,976 people. Magdalena is politically subdivided into 24 barangays. Magdalena was formerly a barrio of <span class="loc">Majayjay</span>, <span class="loc">Laguna</span>. A petition from the residents of the barrio for the creation of a new town was presented on September 15, 1819. It was proclaimed a new town by Governor General Don Mariano Fern√°ndez de <span class="loc">Folgueras</span> on January 18, 1820, and was originally named "Magdalena de Ambling". The name was derived from its patron saint <span class="loc">Maria Magdalena</span> and the barrio of Ambling where it was established. The first <span class="loc">Teniente Alcalde</span> or <span class="loc">Capitan</span> (the highest political authority in a town) was Don Mauricio <span class="loc">San Mateo</span>. They first established a makeshift school in 1820, which was the very first requirement for it to be a town. The municipal hall was also constructed. A small chapel was also constructed and it gave way to the construction of a church in 1829. The church was made of stones and bricks and donations were solicited from the residents. The construction was finished in 1861. The construction of the concrete town hall and the church convent started in 1871, and was finished in 1884.</p>
