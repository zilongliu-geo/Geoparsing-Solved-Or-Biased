  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Trenton is a small city in <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> in the southeast portion of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 18,853. The city is part of Downriver, a collection of mostly blue-collar communities south of <span class="loc">Detroit</span> on the west bank of the <span class="loc">Detroit River</span>. Many residents are employed in the city's factories such as the <span class="org">Chrysler</span> Trenton Engine Plant, Solutia, and the Trenton Channel Power Plant. Oakwood South Shore Hospital (formerly known as <span class="org">Seaway Hospital</span>) is located within city limits and has 203 beds. The former McLouth Steel plant is also located in the city. There is rail service in the city. The city operates the 21,000-square-foot (2,000 m2) <span class="org">Trenton Veterans Memorial Library</span> and a historical museum. Trenton has 15 churches of 10 denominations. The Battle of Monguagon took place in Trenton on what is <span class="date">now</span> the site of <span class="per">Elizabeth Park</span>. <span class="per">Elizabeth Park</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> park system and was the first county park in <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, designated in <span class="date">1919</span>. The founder of Trenton is considered to be Abram <span class="per">Caleb Truax</span>, a member of the territorial militia in attendance when General <span class="per">William Hull</span> surrendered <span class="loc">Detroit</span> to the <span class="org">British General</span> <span class="per">Isaac Brock</span> early in the War of <span class="date">1812</span>. After the war, in <span class="date">1816</span>, <span class="per">Truax</span> acquired a large tract of land in the Michigan Territory along the <span class="loc">Detroit River</span> from the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> government and constructed a sawmill, church and store in what is <span class="date">today</span> downtown Trenton. When Territorial Governor <span class="per">Lewis Cass</span> organized Monguagon Township in <span class="date">1827</span>, <span class="per">Truax</span> became the first Township Supervisor. He laid out the village of Truaxton in <span class="date">1834</span>. A post office had been established there named "Monguago" in <span class="date">1828</span> with <span class="per">Truax</span> as the first postmaster. The post office name was changed to "Truago" in <span class="date">1837</span>, and to "Trenton" in <span class="date">1847</span>, after a type of limestone mined from a local quarry. The village was platted and recorded under the name Trenton in <span class="date">1850</span> by Abram's son and daughter <span class="per">George Brigham</span> <span class="per">Truax</span> and <span class="per">Sophia</span> <span class="per">Slocum</span>, the wife of industrialist <span class="per">Giles Slocum</span>. The <span class="per">Slocum</span> family estate was given to the county, becoming what is known as <span class="per">Elizabeth Park</span>, named after <span class="per">Elizabeth Slocum</span>.</p><br><br>
