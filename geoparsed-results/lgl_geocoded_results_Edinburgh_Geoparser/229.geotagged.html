<p>Family of <span class="loc">Jordan</span> motorcyclist finds him injured in ditch. A wife’s quick action may have saved her husband’s life after his motorcycle went off the road in Sand Creek Township early Wednesday morning. When Lori Whipps received a call that her husband Roger hadn’t shown up for work, she and family members immediately went looking from him. They discovered him in a ditch on Marystown Road, about one-third of a mile north of Highway 282 around 5 a.m. <span class="loc">Scott County</span> Deputy Sgt. Bob Mulvehill said it appeared Roger Whipps, who wasn’t wearing a helmet, lost control while going around a curve and he was ejected from his motorcycle. The <span class="loc">Jordan</span> resident was flown to North Memorial Medical Center in <span class="loc">Robbinsdale</span>, where he remains in critical condition. It is unclear what caused the man to leave the roadway. Mulvehill said the Whipps was still unresponsive as of Thursday morning.</p>
