  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wayne County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, the population was 93,772. The county seat is <span class="loc">Lyons</span>. The name honors General <span class="per">Anthony Wayne</span>, an American Revolutionary War hero and American statesman. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">NY</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area and lies on the south shore of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span>, forming part of the northern border of the <span class="loc">United States</span> with <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Its location during the early westward expansion of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, on an international border and in a fertile farming region, has contributed to a rich cultural and economic history. Two world religions sprung from within its borders, and its inhabitants played important roles in abolitionism in the <span class="date">years</span> leading up to the American Civil War. Nineteenth century War of 1812 skirmishes, <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> sailing ship commerce and <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal barge traffic have since yielded to contemporary recognition as one of the world's most productive fruit growing regions. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> ranks as the top apple producing county in <span class="loc">New York</span>. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the land <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> encompasses was originally part of the Iroquois Confederacy, which had existed from around <span class="date">August 31, 1142</span>. <span class="loc">When counties</span> were established in <span class="loc">New York</span> State on <span class="date">November 1, 1683</span>, it became part of <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of <span class="loc">New York</span> State and all of the present State of <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, extending (in theory) westward to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. In <span class="date">1804</span>, after numerous acts of subdividing, <span class="loc">Seneca County</span> was formed by the splitting of <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span>, which, in turn, was reduced in size by combining portions of <span class="loc">Seneca</span> and the remainder of <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span> to form <span class="loc">Tompkins County</span> in <span class="date">1817</span>.</p><br><br>
