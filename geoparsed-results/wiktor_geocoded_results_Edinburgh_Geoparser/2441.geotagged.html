<p><span class="loc">Los Algodones</span>, <span class="loc">Baja California</span>, is a small Mexican town located on the extreme northeastern tip of the municipality of <span class="loc">Mexicali</span>, approximately 16 km (9.9 mi) <span class="loc">west of Yuma</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. Its official name is <span class="loc">Vicente Guerrero</span>, although most people use <span class="loc">Algodones</span> or Molar City when referring to it. It reported a population of 5,474 as of the 2010 Mexican census. It also serves as a borough seat of its surrounding area. <span class="loc">Los Algodones</span> is the northernmost town in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, and at its northeastern tip is the northernmost point in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, and in Latin <span class="loc">America</span>. Another interesting geographical distinction is that if someone were to travel in any of the four cardinal directions from anywhere in <span class="loc">Algodones</span> (due north, due east, due south, or due west), they would cross a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> border. Situated near the borders of both southeastern <span class="loc">California</span> and southwestern <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">Los Algodones</span> has become a popular tourist attraction in recent years due in part to inexpensive shopping and restaurants as well as inexpensive medical care and prescription medicines. The warm, dry climate of the area attracts a number of older tourists from across the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Canada</span> who settle during the winter in the nearby towns of <span class="loc">Yuma</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span> and <span class="loc">Winterhaven</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. Organized day trips from the <span class="loc">Coachella</span> Valley are popular among seniors as well.</p>
