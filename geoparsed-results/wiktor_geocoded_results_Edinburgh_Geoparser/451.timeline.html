  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sula</span>  is a municipality in Møre og <span class="loc">Romsdal county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Sunnmøre district</span>. The administrative centre is the village of Langevåg. Other villages include Solevåg, Fiskarstrand, Veibust, Leirvågen, and Mauseidvågen. <span class="loc">Sula</span> is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Møre og <span class="loc">Romsdal county</span>, and it is part of the Ålesund Region since it is just south of the city of Ålesund. The municipality encompasses the island of <span class="loc">Sula</span> and the many small surrounding islets. Originally, most of the island of <span class="loc">Sula</span> was part of the old Borgund Municipality and the small southwestern part of the island was part of Ulstein Municipality (see formannskapsdistrikt). On <span class="date">1 July 1958</span>, the southwestern part of <span class="loc">Sula</span> island was transferred to Borgund Municipality. In <span class="date">1968</span>, Borgund Municipality (including all of the island of <span class="loc">Sula</span>) was merged with the town of Ålesund to form the large Ålesund Municipality. On <span class="date">1 January 1977</span>, the entire island of <span class="loc">Sula</span> and the many small islets around it were separated from Ålesund Municipality to become a separate municipality. The initial population of the new Sula Municipality was 6,302.</p><br><br>
