<p>Stanton is a small village situated at the eastern end of the <span class="loc">Weaver Hills</span>, <span class="loc">Staffordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Stanton is located 146 miles (235.0 km) north-west of <span class="loc">London</span> and 18.4 miles (29.6 km) east of <span class="loc">Stoke-on-Trent</span>. It has a population of 232 according to the 2001 Census. The landscape around the village is mainly pastureland bounded by dry stone walls. Evidence of early human activity can be found at <span class="loc">Stanton</span> with three bronze age barrows on the hilltop of Thorswood. In 1953 a gold bracelet was found in the parish dated circa 800 BC, now housed in the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery, <span class="loc">Stoke on Trent</span>. Stanton is listed in the Domesday Book as Stantone, the name means "Stone Farmstead" which could refer to its building material, some prominent stone or its site on stony ground. The stone itself is an excellent building material, mainly sandstone, being used to build the majority of farmhouses and cottages in the village. In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson described Stanton in his Imperial Gazetteer of <span class="loc">England</span> and <span class="loc">Wales</span> as "a township-chapelry in <span class="loc">Ellastone parish</span>, <span class="loc">Stafford</span>; 2½ miles WNW of <span class="loc">Clifton</span> r. station, and 3½ W of Ashborne. Post town, Ashborne. Real property, £1,996. Pop., 403. Houses, 81. The living is annexed to <span class="loc">Ellastone</span>. Archbishop Sheldon was a native.".</p>
