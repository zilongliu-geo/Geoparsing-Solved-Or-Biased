  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Martin County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 24,505. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Williamston</span>. The county was formed in <span class="date">1774</span> from the southeastern part of <span class="loc">Halifax County</span> and the western part of <span class="loc">Tyrrell County</span>. It was named for <span class="per">Josiah Martin</span>, the last royal governor of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> (<span class="date">1771</span>–75). Whereas <span class="loc">Dobbs County</span> and <span class="loc">Tryon County</span>, named for <span class="per">Martin</span>'s predecessors <span class="per">Arthur Dobbs</span> and <span class="per">William Tryon</span>, were abolished after American independence, <span class="loc">Martin County</span> was neither abolished nor renamed, a fact which has been attributed to the popularity of <span class="per">Alexander Martin</span>, twice governor of the state (<span class="date">1782</span>–84, <span class="date">1789</span>–92). The <span class="loc">Martin County Courthouse</span> was listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> in <span class="date">1979</span>. <span class="loc">Martin County</span> is a member of the Mid-East Commission regional council of governments. <span class="loc">Martin County</span> has tended to vote in line with the rest of the country in presidential elections. In <span class="date">2008</span>, <span class="per">Barack Obama</span> won the county with 52.2% of the vote. This was very similar to his national figure of 52.91%.</p><br><br>
