<p>Annual trivia bee raises $3,750 for literacy council. Florida State University is not one of the original Southeastern Confernce members. The <span class="loc">Atlas Mountains</span> make up a mountain range that runs through western <span class="loc">Africa</span> in <span class="loc">Morocco</span>, <span class="loc">Tunisia</span> and Lybia. Placing fines, taxes and bail money in the middle of the board, and giving it to the first person to land on Free Parking is not an official Monopoly rule. Mary Travers of the ’60s folk group, Peter, Paul and Mary was born and raised in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The University of the Kentucky broke the color barrier in SEC football. Those were just a few of the bits of knowledge the 18 teams participating in the 11th annual Laurel County Adult Education and Literacy Trivia Bee were asked in their quest to take home the really big trophy. When the smoke cleared, the HSBC Juggernauts, Dale Crandall, John Matthews and Jason Jones, took home first place. As they celebrated their victory with some of their fellow HSBC employees, they admitted it was not all smooth sailing. “We had our lowest score with the SEC questions and we were fortunate with the Monopoly questions to make some good guesses,” Jones said. The team vowed they will return in 2010 to defend their title. Kathryn Hardeman, executive director of Laurel County Adult Education and Literacy, said the event raised $3,750 for the organization. “That money is used to pay for scholarships,” Hardeman said. “Most of the grant money we receive is marked for specific projects. It’s nice to have some money you can use however you need it.” The team from St. Joseph <span class="loc">London</span> finished second, followed by the team from First Christian Chruch in third. “We had really good participation,” Hardeman said. “We are open to suggestions as we plan for next year.” The HSBC Juggernauts, Dale Crandall, John Matthew and Jason Jones are presented the trophy for winning the 2009 trivia bee by Katherine Hardeman and Tommy Weatherly of Laurel County Adult Education and Literacy.</p>
