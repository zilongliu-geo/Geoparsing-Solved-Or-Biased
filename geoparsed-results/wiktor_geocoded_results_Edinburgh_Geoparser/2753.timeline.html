  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Phoenix (/ˈfiːnɪks/) is the capital, and largest city, of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. With 1,445,632 people (as of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census), Phoenix is the most populous state capital in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, as well as the sixth most populous city nationwide. Phoenix is the anchor of the <span class="loc">Phoenix metropolitan</span> area, also known as <span class="org">the Valley of the Sun</span>, which in turn is a part of the Salt River Valley. The city is the 13th largest metro area by population in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, with approximately 4.3 million people in <span class="date">2010</span>. In addition, Phoenix is the county seat of <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span> and is one of the largest cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span> by land area. Settled in <span class="date">1867</span> as an agricultural community near the confluence of the <span class="per">Salt</span> and <span class="per">Gila</span> Rivers, Phoenix incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1881</span>. Located in the northeastern reaches of the <span class="loc">Sonoran Desert</span>, Phoenix has a subtropical desert climate. Despite this, its canal system led to a thriving farming community, many of the original crops remaining important parts of the Phoenix economy for <span class="date">decades</span>, such as alfalfa, cotton, citrus and hay (which was important for the cattle industry). In fact, the "Five C's" (Cotton, Cattle, Citrus, Climate, and Copper), remained the driving forces of Phoenix's economy until after World War II, when high tech industries began to move into the valley.</p><br><br>
