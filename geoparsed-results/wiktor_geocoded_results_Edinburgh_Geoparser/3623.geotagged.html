<p><span class="loc">Dongguan</span> (Chinese: 东莞) is a prefecture-level city in central <span class="loc">Guangdong province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>. An important industrial city located in the <span class="loc">Pearl River</span> Delta, Dongguan borders the provincial capital of <span class="loc">Guangzhou</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Huizhou</span> to the northeast, <span class="loc">Shenzhen</span> to the south, and the <span class="loc">Pearl River</span> to the west. It is part of the <span class="loc">Pearl River</span> Delta megacity with more than 44.78 million inhabitants at the 2010 census spread over nine municipalities (including <span class="loc">Macao</span>) across an area of 17,573 square kilometres (6,785 sq mi). Dongguan's city administration is considered especially progressive in seeking foreign direct investment. <span class="loc">Dongguan</span> ranks behind only <span class="loc">Shenzhen</span>, <span class="loc">Shanghai</span> and <span class="loc">Suzhou</span> in exports among Chinese cities, with $65.54 billion in shipments. It is also home to one of the world's largest, though largely empty, shopping malls, the New South <span class="loc">China</span> Mall. Although the earliest traces of human habitation in the area stretch back 5,000 years, Dongguan's emergence as a true city is a recent phenomenon. In 1839, at the outset of the First Opium War, large quantities of seized opium were destroyed in Humen, a town that now belongs to <span class="loc">Dongguan</span>. Several of the major battles of the war were fought in this area.</p>
