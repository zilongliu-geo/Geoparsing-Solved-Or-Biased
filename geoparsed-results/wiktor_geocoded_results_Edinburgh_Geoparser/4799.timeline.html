  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Toco</span> is the most northeasterly village on the island of <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> in the County of <span class="loc">Saint David</span> at the point where the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span> and the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> meet. <span class="loc">Tobago</span> lies only some 35 kilometers to the northeast which renders <span class="loc">Toco</span> the closest point in <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> to the sister island. The name <span class="loc">Toco</span> was ascribed to the area by its early Amerindian inhabitants. The meaning of the name is uncertain, yet its historical significance and value to the country is well noted. <span class="loc">Punta Galera</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Galera Point</span>) is one of the sights of <span class="loc">Toco</span>. <span class="loc">Galera</span> is a slight corruption of the word "galea", the name originally given to the southeastern point, <span class="loc">Galeota Point</span>, by <span class="per">Christopher Columbus</span>. The name was accidentally given to this point as well. The name stuck and it remains a popular tourist destination. The <span class="loc">Galera Point Lighthouse</span> in <span class="loc">Toco</span> was built in <span class="date">1897</span> and <span class="date">today</span> is surrounded by a park and picnic area. Not much activity took place in <span class="loc">Toco</span> after the Spanish colonized <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> in <span class="date">1531</span> until <span class="date">1631</span>, when <span class="per">Sir Henry Colt</span> and <span class="per">English</span> forces entered the territory without the knowledge of the Spanish. In <span class="date">1637</span>, the British were expelled by the Dutch, who had formed an alliance with the Amerindians in the area and were, not too long after, expelled by the Spanish.</p><br><br>
