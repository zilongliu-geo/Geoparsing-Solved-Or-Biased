  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Murray County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 39,628. The county seat is <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span>. <span class="loc">Murray County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Dalton</span>, <span class="loc">GA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Chattanooga-Cleveland-Dalton, TN-GA-AL Combined Statistical Area. In <span class="date">December, 1832</span> the <span class="org">Georgia General Assembly</span> designated the extreme northwestern corner of the state as <span class="loc">Murray County</span>. Formerly part of <span class="loc">Cherokee County</span>, the area was named for a distinguished <span class="loc">Georgia</span> statesman from <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="per">Mr. Thomas W. Murray</span>, a former speaker of the <span class="org">Georgia House</span>. Within <span class="date">a short time</span> the legislature found the county was too large to administer properly as the population grew, for the county then included what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Dade, Walker</span>, <span class="loc">Catoosa</span>, <span class="loc">Whitfield</span>, <span class="loc">Murray</span>, Gordon and parts of <span class="per">Bartow</span> and <span class="per">Chatooga</span> Counties, so further division became necessary. Within <span class="date">two decades</span>, <span class="loc">Murray County</span> came to be 342 square miles (886 km2) of land with Spring Place as its county seat until the railroad was built through <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span>. With <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> more accessible, the county seat was moved there.</p><br><br>
