  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Racine</span> and <span class="loc">Walworth</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, with the majority of the city located in <span class="loc">Racine County</span>. The population of the portion of the city inside <span class="loc">Racine County</span> was 10,464 as of the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the area, Native American mounds were constructed near the present location of <span class="loc">Burlington</span>. For example, around <span class="date">1830</span>, a small Potawatomi village stood in what is <span class="date">now</span> the Town of <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, though it wasn't larger than the present-day city. The earliest certain European presence in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Burlington</span> was in the <span class="date">fall of 1799</span>, when a group of French explorers and missionaries led by <span class="per">Francis Morgan</span> de Vereceones made a portage from the <span class="loc">Root River</span> to the <span class="loc">Fox River</span>, reaching the Fox at approximately <span class="loc">Burlington</span>'s present location. The first European settlers in <span class="loc">Burlington</span> were <span class="per">Moses Smith</span> (the son of a Revolutionary War veteran) and <span class="per">William Whiting</span>. <span class="per">Smith</span> and <span class="per">Whiting</span> had been in the area previously, making a so-called "jackknife claim" to the land (carving their names and the date on trees in the vicinity) on <span class="date">December 15, 1835</span>. The men then left the encampment and returned with <span class="per">Lemuel Smith</span> (<span class="per">Moses</span>' brother) as well as <span class="per">Benjamin Perce</span>, another member of the group. The four men searched for arable land and built a cabin on the east side of the <span class="loc">Fox River</span> (on what is <span class="date">now</span> Wehmhoff-Jucker Park.) Other settlers arrived in the spring and <span class="date">summer of 1836</span>, mostly from <span class="loc">New England</span>; they named their settlement <span class="loc">Foxville</span>. <span class="date">That year</span>, the residents of <span class="loc">Foxville</span> unanimously decided to change their settlement's name to "<span class="loc">Burlington</span>" after the city <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>; the Foxville name continued to be used, however, until that name was officially changed on <span class="date">July 15, 1839</span>.</p><br><br>
