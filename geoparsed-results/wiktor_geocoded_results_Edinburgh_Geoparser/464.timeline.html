  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Bar (Montenegrin: Бар, pronounced [bâr], Italian: <span class="loc">Antivari</span>, Albanian: Tivar) is a coastal town and seaport in southern <span class="loc">Montenegro</span>. It is the capital of the Bar Municipality and a center for tourism. In <span class="date">2011</span>, its population was 40,037. Bar is a shortened form of <span class="loc">Antivari</span>, which is derived from the town's location across the <span class="loc">Adriatic Sea</span> from <span class="loc">Bari</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>. Variations are in Italian, Antivari / Antibari; in Turkish, Bar; Albanian: Tivari; Greek: Θηβάριον, Thivárion, Αντιβάριον, Antivárion; in Latin, Antibarium. Local archaeological findings date to the Neolithic era. It is assumed that Bar was mentioned as the reconstructed Roman castle, Antipargal, in the 6th century. The name Antibarium was quoted for the first time in the 10th century. In the 6th and 7th <span class="date">centuries</span>, Slavs occupied the <span class="loc">Balkans</span>. <span class="loc">Duklja</span>, a Slavic, or Serbian state, was mentioned in the 10th century. <span class="per">Jovan Vladimir</span> (ruler <span class="date">1000</span> - <span class="date">1016</span>), of Skadarska Krajina is the first ruler of <span class="loc">Duklja</span> whose history is known. <span class="per">Stefan Vojislav</span> (ruler <span class="date">1018</span> - <span class="date">1043</span>), the eponymous founder of the Vojislavljević dynasty, defeated the Byzantines in a battle on a hill near Bar. He made Bar his seat of power. <span class="per">Vojislav</span> then expanded the area under his rule. Mihailo I of <span class="loc">Duklja</span> (ruler <span class="date">1050</span> - <span class="date">1081</span>), <span class="per">Vojislav</span>'s son, established the Archdiocese of <span class="loc">Antivari</span>. He continued to fight the Byzantines in order to secure the town's independence. This led to a union of states known as the <span class="org">Serbian Grand Principality</span>. From <span class="date">1101</span> to <span class="date">1166</span>, the principality was ruled by the Vukanović dynasty. However, for much of this time, Bar was under Byzantine rule. In <span class="date">1183</span>, <span class="per">Stefan Nemanja</span> conquered Bar and it stayed under Serbian control under the Nemanjić dynasty.</p><br><br>
