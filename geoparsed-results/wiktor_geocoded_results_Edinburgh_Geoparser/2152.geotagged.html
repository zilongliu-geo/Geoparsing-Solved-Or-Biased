<p><span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is a small city in and the parish seat of <span class="loc">DeSoto Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,001 at the 2010 census, a decline of more than 10 percent from the 2000 tabulation. <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is 77 percent African American. <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Shreveportâ€“Bossier City</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Battle of <span class="loc">Mansfield</span>, a Confederate victory under General Richard Taylor (son of Zachary Taylor), was fought here on April 8, 1864. This battle turned 42,000 Union troops away from their conquest of the <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> Confederate capital, <span class="loc">Shreveport</span>, and sent them in retreat to <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. The battle is commemorated at the <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> State Historic Site some four miles south of <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> off <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> Highway 175. The first woman's college west of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River, <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> Female College, was founded by the Methodist Church there in 1855. A two-year college, its first class graduated in 1856. Financial difficulties and the threat of war closed the college from 1860 to the end of the American Civil War, during which its buildings served as a hospital for soldiers wounded in the battle of <span class="loc">Mansfield</span>; it reopened in 1865. In 1930, Mansfield Female College merged with Centenary College of <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> in <span class="loc">Shreveport</span> and closed its doors permanently. In 2003, the <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> State Legislature moved to convert the main building of Mansfield Female College, the Lyceum, into a future museum.</p>
