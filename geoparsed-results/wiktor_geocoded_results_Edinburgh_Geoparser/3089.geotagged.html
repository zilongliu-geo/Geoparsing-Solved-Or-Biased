<p><span class="loc">Jordan</span> is a town in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Garfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 343 at the 2010 census. Originally settled in 1896, <span class="loc">Jordan</span> received a post office on July 11, 1899. The founder, Arthur Jordan, had hunted the area a great deal and in 1896 decided to bring his family here to settle along the banks of the <span class="loc">Big Dry Creek</span>. Before very long a town began to spring up around the post office. There were saloons, rooming houses, livery stables, blacksmiths and stores. In the later part of the 1910s the homestead boom hit <span class="loc">Garfield County</span>, which was then actually part of <span class="loc">Dawson County</span> to the east. By 1919, it became the consensus of many locals that they needed to form a county of their own and <span class="loc">Garfield County</span> was established. After much ado by competing towns in the area, <span class="loc">Jordan</span> was finally chosen as the county seat, by popular vote. <span class="loc">Jordan</span> was incorporated as a town in 1951. On March 25, 1996 an 81-day-long standoff between the antigovernment <span class="loc">Montana</span> Freemen and federal officers began near here.</p>
