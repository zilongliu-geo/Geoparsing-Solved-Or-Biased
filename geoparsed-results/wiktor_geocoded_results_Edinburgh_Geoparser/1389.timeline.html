  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Not to be confused with the town of The <span class="loc">Dalles</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Dallas</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 14,583 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Dallas is along <span class="loc">Rickreall Creek</span>, about 15 miles (24 km) west of <span class="loc">Salem</span>, at an elevation of 325 feet (99 m) above sea level. It is part of the <span class="loc">Salem Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Dallas was settled in the 1840s on the north side of <span class="loc">Rickreall Creek</span> and was originally named "Cynthian" or "<span class="loc">Cynthiana</span>". A <span class="date">1947</span> Itemizer-Observer article (quoted in <span class="date">100 Years</span> in <span class="loc">Polk County</span>: A Centennial Background) states: "[T]he town was called <span class="loc">Cynthiana</span> after <span class="loc">Cynthiana</span>, <span class="loc">Ky.</span>, so named by <span class="per">Mrs. Thos</span>. <span class="per">Lovelady</span>." The History of <span class="loc">Polk County</span> <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="date">1987</span>, Page 12, states: "To <span class="per">Mrs. Thomas J. Lovelady</span> was given the honor of naming the new settlement and she selected the name after her home town of <span class="loc">Cynthiana</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>." Another source claims that the origin of the name may come from the name of <span class="per">Jesse Applegate</span>'s wife, <span class="per">Cynthia Ann</span>. However, she lived in the <span class="loc">Salt Creek</span> area of northern <span class="loc">Polk County</span> and, according to the <span class="date">1850</span> Federal Census, had already left <span class="loc">Polk County</span> by <span class="date">1850</span>.</p><br><br>
