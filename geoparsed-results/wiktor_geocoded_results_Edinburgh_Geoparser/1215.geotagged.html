<p><span class="loc">Bedford</span>, a suburb of <span class="loc">Leigh</span>, <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span> is one of three ancient townships, <span class="loc">Bedford</span>, <span class="loc">Pennington</span> and <span class="loc">Westleigh</span>, that merged in 1875 to form the town of <span class="loc">Leigh</span>. <span class="loc">Bedford</span> was historically in <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>. <span class="loc">Bedford</span> means the "ford of <span class="loc">Beda</span>", which probably crossed the <span class="loc">Pennington Brook</span> near <span class="loc">Beaston Bridge</span> on Warrington Road. It was recorded as Beneford in 1200â€“21 and Bedeford in 1200 and 1296. There were several large houses or halls in the township. The manor was held of the Botelers of <span class="loc">Warrington</span> and was divided before the time from which records survive. <span class="loc">Bedford</span> Hall never assumed the role of a manor house and was occupied by tenants of the Kighleys who were absentee landlords. In 1301 half of the manor was held by the Kighleys, a quarter by the Sales who lived at the moated <span class="loc">Hopecarr</span> Hall and the rest by John Waverton of <span class="loc">Brick House</span>. Thomas Shuttleworth lived at Sandypool which was taken from the Kighley share. The area was largely rural and a small settlement grew at Butts where the road to <span class="loc">Warrington</span> branched from the <span class="loc">Leigh</span> to <span class="loc">Manchester</span> road. Several inns were situated near this junction and in 1641 there was a shop selling "cheese, gunpowder, hops, tobacco and a variety of other goods". There was a corn mill on the <span class="loc">Breaston</span> Brook.</p>
