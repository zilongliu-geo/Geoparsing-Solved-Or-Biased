  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Prospect is a suburb of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Prospect is located 32 kilometres west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Blacktown</span> and is part of the Greater <span class="loc">Western Sydney region</span>. The suburb of Prospect takes its name from the prominent nearby landmark of <span class="loc">Prospect Hill</span> - from the top of which people could get a prospect of (see a great distance) the surrounding countryside. Initially a settlement for emancipated convicts, it later became a village. Since colonisation, settlers cleared larger areas of land to raise livestock, build churches, inns, schools, shops and a large reservoir. The quarrying of blue metal was abundant in the area. Naturalist <span class="per">Charles Darwin</span> visited Prospect in <span class="date">January 1836</span>, to observe the geology. Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet in <span class="date">1788</span>, Prospect was inhabited by different groups of the Darug people including the Warmuli. The Aboriginals there were of the woods culture. As European settlement expanded, the aboriginal people's ability to pursue their traditional lifestyle, which was already severely limited, disappeared. <span class="loc">Prospect Hill</span> had been the frontier, which was the first, and perhaps, only area where large scale organised resistance by aboriginal people took place.</p><br><br>
