  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Alberton</span> is a town situated on the <span class="loc">East Rand</span> of <span class="loc">Gauteng Province</span> in <span class="loc">South Africa</span> which celebrated its centenary year in <span class="date">2005</span>. As of <span class="date">2007</span> it had a population of 202,202. It is known as a typical bedroom community, a community primarily residential in character, with most of its workers commuting to work in nearby suburbs or cities. The town has multiple access roads to all major freeways in <span class="loc">Gauteng</span>. <span class="loc">Alberton</span> is situated on the banks of the Natal Spruit close to the major urban centres of <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span> (15 kilometres southeast) and <span class="loc">Pretoria</span> (76 kilometres). At the age of 13 a boy by the name of <span class="per">Johannes Petrus Meyer</span> bought 11 hectares of his father’s farm <span class="loc">Elandsfontein</span>. He later built a house next to the Alberton stream or <span class="loc">Natalspruit</span>, close to where the civic centre stands <span class="date">today</span>, and married. After his wife died in <span class="date">1870</span> at the birth of their fourth daughter, he decided to start a general store and built his farmhouse mansion in <span class="date">1890</span>. The house was miraculously left unharmed during the <span class="org">Anglo Boer War</span> of <span class="date">1899</span>–<span class="date">1902</span> and can still be seen <span class="date">today</span> from the bypassing N12 freeway.</p><br><br>
