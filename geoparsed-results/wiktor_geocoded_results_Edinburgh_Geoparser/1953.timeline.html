The population was 21,348 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, an increase of 46.3% since the <span class="date">2000</span> Census. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is one of two principal cities of and included in the <span class="loc">Anniston-Oxford Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. According to the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span>, the city has a total area of 31.0 square miles (80.3 km2), of which 30.7 square miles (79.4 km2) is land and 0.35 square miles (0.9 km2), or 1.07%, is water. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> lies among the foothills at the southern end of the <span class="loc">Blue Ridge Mountains</span>. Nearby <span class="loc">Cheaha Mountain</span> is Alabama's highest point and offers expansive views of the surrounding wilderness and the city below. Much of the city's southern border is shared with the <span class="loc">Talladega National Forest</span>. Major bodies of water include <span class="loc">Oxford Lake</span>, Lake Hillabee, <span class="loc">Snows Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Choccolocco Creek</span>, which bisects the city.

When the town was formed, it was originally named <span class="loc">Lick Skillet</span>.
