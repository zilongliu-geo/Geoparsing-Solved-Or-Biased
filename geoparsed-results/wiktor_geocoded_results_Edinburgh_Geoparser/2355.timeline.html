  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Peru</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Nemaha County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 865 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="org">Peru State College</span> is located in <span class="loc">Peru</span>. The first attempt to settle the community occurred in <span class="date">1853</span> when some residents of <span class="loc">Peru</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. However troops from Fort Kearney forced them to leave because <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> Territory was still occupied by the <span class="loc">Otoe</span> (tribe). They then temporarily settled across the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River at <span class="loc">Sonora</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="org">Watson</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>). In <span class="date">1857</span> a community formed around a trading post called <span class="loc">Mount Vernon</span> on the bluffs above the river on the <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> side. In <span class="date">1857</span> settlers founded <span class="loc">Peru</span> down the hill from <span class="loc">Mount Vernon</span> directly on the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. In <span class="date">1861</span> a Methodist school called Mount <span class="org">Vernon Academy</span> opened. In <span class="date">1867</span> the school (which became <span class="org">Peru State College</span>) became the state's first normal school. Floods in the 1860s changed the course of the river pushing it nearly a mile from <span class="loc">Peru</span>. An <span class="date">1867</span> flood caused the <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> community of <span class="loc">McKissick Island</span> northeast of <span class="loc">Peru</span> to be surrounded by <span class="loc">Missouri</span> land and cause a border dispute that would not be resolved until <span class="date">1999</span>.</p><br><br>
