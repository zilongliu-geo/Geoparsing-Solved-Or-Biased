  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Beaver County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located 25 miles (40 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, it is part of the <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span> metropolitan area. The population was 3,657 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Like many places in and around <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span> and especially <span class="loc">Beaver County</span>, <span class="loc">Rochester</span> has been used for scenes in movies. Scenes in the <span class="date">1986</span> movie Gung Ho (starring <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span> native <span class="per">Michael Keaton</span>), the <span class="date">1996</span> movie Kingpin (starring <span class="per">Woody Harrelson</span>, <span class="per">Randy Quaid</span>, and <span class="per">Bill Murray</span>), and the <span class="date">2000</span> movie "Wonder Boys" (starring <span class="per">Michael Douglas</span>, <span class="per">Tobey Maguire</span>, and <span class="per">Robert Downey Jr.</span>) were shot in <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. What would eventually become <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was originally a Lenape village called Sawcunk before being settled in <span class="date">1799</span> in what was then the American frontier by white settlers. During this time, what would eventually became <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was known as <span class="loc">East Bridgewater</span>, <span class="loc">Fairport</span>, and <span class="loc">Beaver Point</span>. The borough adopted its current name in <span class="date">1834</span> when a local businessman who did regular business in <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span> decided to christen his home with the name <span class="loc">Rochester</span> so he could have a unique name to stamp his goods; the borough would officially be incorporated as such in <span class="date">1849</span>.</p><br><br>
