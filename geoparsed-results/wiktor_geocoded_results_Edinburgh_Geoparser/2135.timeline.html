  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Troy is a town in <span class="loc">Cheshire County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,145 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is situated at the base of <span class="loc">Mount Monadnock</span>. The town center village, where 1,221 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined as the Troy census-designated place (CDP), and is located along <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Route 12. It is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> as Troy Village Historic District. Settled in <span class="date">1762</span>, by <span class="date">1815</span> the community had grown so much that it sought its own incorporation. It was set off from <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> <span class="date">that year</span>, and included parts of <span class="loc">Fitzwilliam</span>, <span class="loc">Swanzey</span> and <span class="loc">Richmond</span>. A prominent citizen and friend of Governor <span class="per">John Taylor Gilman</span>, <span class="per">Captain Benjamin Mann</span> of Mason, suggested the name Troy. His daughter, <span class="per">Betsy</span>, was married to <span class="per">Samuel Wilson</span>, famous as "<span class="loc">Uncle Sam</span>", and at that time a resident of Troy, <span class="loc">New York</span>. At least seven members of <span class="per">Wilson</span>'s family were living in the town at the time, thus securing the name. The town hall, built in 1813-1814 near the rail-fenced common, was originally the village meetinghouse.</p><br><br>
