  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">El Paso</span> is a town and a municipality on the island of <span class="loc">La Palma</span>, Province of <span class="loc">Santa Cruz de Tenerife</span>, <span class="loc">Canary Islands</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>. It is situated in the middle of the island. The population of the municipality is 7,928 (<span class="date">2013</span>) and the area is 135.92 km², making it the largest municipality on the island of <span class="loc">La Palma</span>. The mean elevation is 600 m. The territory of the municipality includes the <span class="loc">Caldera de Taburiente</span>, a giant caldera constituting a national park. Many footpaths already crisscrossed <span class="loc">La Palma</span> before the Spanish conquest. A number of mountain passes east of present-day <span class="loc">El Paso</span> enabled cross-island communications. One of these was <span class="loc">Ajerjo</span> Pass by which the island's Spanish discoverer, <span class="per">Alonso Fernandez</span> <span class="per">de Lugo</span>, attempted to enter the <span class="loc">Caldera de Taburiente</span>, hence its local name the Captain's Pass (Paso del Capitán). The village of <span class="loc">El Paso</span> was named after this mountain pass by association. On <span class="date">3 May 1492</span> the mentioned <span class="per">Fernandez de Lugo</span> finishes the conquest of the island of <span class="loc">La Palma</span> by the Spanish when conquering the last remaining stronghold of the native Guanches, the kingdom of Aceró. To this goal, <span class="per">Fernandez</span> deceitfully invited its king Tanausú to an interview, to have him imprisoned on appearance. The island was made directly subject to the Spanish <span class="org">Crown</span>, a situation which would last until <span class="date">1812</span>. In <span class="date">this year</span> the new Spanish Constitution paved the way for decentralisation of the <span class="loc">Canary Islands</span> and subdivision into municipalities.[1]</p><br><br>
