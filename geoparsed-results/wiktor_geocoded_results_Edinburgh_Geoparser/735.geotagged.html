<p><span class="loc">Lourdes</span> (pronunciation: [luʀd]; <span class="loc">Lorda</span> in Occitan, pron. ['lurðɔ]) is a small market town lying in the foothills of the <span class="loc">Pyrenees</span>. It is part of the Hautes-Pyrénées department in the <span class="loc">Midi-Pyrénées region</span> in south-western <span class="loc">France</span>. Prior to the apparitions of the Virgin Mary in 1858, the most prominent feature of the town was the fortified castle that rises up from a rocky escarpment at its centre. In 1858 <span class="loc">Lourdes</span> rose to prominence in <span class="loc">France</span> and abroad due to the Marian apparitions seen by the peasant girl Bernadette Soubirous, who was later canonized. Shortly thereafter the city became one of the world's most important sites of pilgrimage and religious tourism. Today Lourdes hosts around six million visitors every year from all corners of the world. This constant stream of pilgrims and tourists transformed quiet <span class="loc">Lourdes</span> into the second most important center of tourism in <span class="loc">France</span>, second only to <span class="loc">Paris</span>, and the third most important site of international Catholic pilgrimage after <span class="loc">Rome</span> and the Holy Land. As of 2011, of French cities only <span class="loc">Paris</span> had more hotel capacity. The Virgin Mary appeared to Marie-Bernadette Soubirous on a total of eighteen occasions at <span class="loc">Lourdes</span>. <span class="loc">Lourdes</span> has become a major place of Roman Catholic pilgrimage and of miraculous healings. The 150th Jubilee of the first apparition took place on 11 February 2008 with an outdoor Mass attended by approximately 45,000 pilgrims.</p>
