According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.31 square miles (0.80 km2), all of it land. <span onClick="goto_name('Dundee')" class="loc">Dundee</span> is located in the extreme northeastern corner of <span onClick="goto_name('Nobles County')" class="loc">Nobles County</span>. The <span onClick="goto_name('Murray County')" class="loc">Murray County</span> line defines Dundee's northern border, and the <span onClick="goto_name('Jackson County')" class="loc">Jackson County</span> line defines its eastern border. Main highways Include: <span onClick="goto_name('Minnesota')" class="loc">Minnesota</span> State Highway 62 (west) <span onClick="goto_name('Nobles County')" class="loc">Nobles County</span> Road 1 <span onClick="goto_name('Dundee')" class="loc">Dundee</span> was established in 1879 when the St. Paul and Sioux City Railway Company built a branch line, then known as the <span onClick="goto_name('Heron Lake')" class="loc">Heron Lake</span> &amp; Black Hills Railroad. The first station out of <span onClick="goto_name('Heron Lake')" class="loc">Heron Lake</span> was proposed in the extreme northeastern corner of <span onClick="goto_name('Nobles County')" class="loc">Nobles County</span>, and was originally named Warren, in honor of Joseph Warren who fell at the Battle of <span onClick="goto_name('Bunker Hill')" class="loc">Bunker Hill</span>. The town was surveyed and platted in July 1879, and construction of a depot began on August 13. Mr. G. Foils moved to town and assumed duties of stationmaster on September 1. He was also named postmaster when a post office was established on November 1, 1879. It was at this time that the name was changed to <span onClick="goto_name('Dundee')" class="loc">Dundee</span>, after the <span onClick="goto_name('city of Dundee')" class="loc">city of Dundee</span>, <span onClick="goto_name('Scotland')" class="loc">Scotland</span>. The reason for the name change is lost to history, although it is known that stationmaster/postmaster G. Foils (whose first name is also lost to history) made the change. A Scottish Company known as the Dundee Improvement Company was then financing construction of an elevator, general store, and hotel in nearby <span onClick="goto_name('Kinbrae')" class="loc">Kinbrae</span>, and perhaps Mr. Foils thought he could attract investment in <span onClick="goto_name('Dundee')" class="loc">Dundee</span>. The first business was opened in the spring of 1880 by F. D. Lindquist and H. A. Scherlie. Several homes were also built in that second year, but real growth for <span onClick="goto_name('Dundee')" class="loc">Dundee</span> did not occur until the late-nineties when the country began to recover from the Panic of 1893. A census taken on December 23, 1897, gave the village a population of 187. At this time, citizens petitioned for incorporation, and on January 4, 1898, the county commissioners granted their request. A special election was held on February 15, and on March 11, 1898, the <span onClick="goto_name('Dundee')" class="loc">Dundee</span> council met for the first time. F. D. Lindquist was named village president.</p>
