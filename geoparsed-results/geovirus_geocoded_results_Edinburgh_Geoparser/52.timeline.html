  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The <span class="org">World Health Organisation</span> (WHO) said earlier today that polio has reemerged in several countries in <span class="loc">Africa</span>. WHO <span class="loc">Africa</span> regional director <span class="per">Luis Gomes</span> <span class="loc">Sambo</span> made the announcement at the beginning of a <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span> conference regarding child immunisation. "Several polio-free countries have suffered setback in polio eradication. The number of countries with polio outbreaks following wild poliovirus importations has increased from thirteen to nineteen in <span class="date">2009</span>," <span class="loc">Sambo</span> commented. He also added that "we need better management of the available resources for immunization, human resources, technologies and we need increased funding to improve the capacity of governments to purchase vaccines and we need also greater mobilization of people. We need to inform people that to bring their people to vaccination campaigns." The countries that have had increases in polio included <span class="loc">Angola</span>, <span class="loc">Chad</span>, and <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>. The WHO attributed the rise mostly to lack of immunisations. The agency estimates that 75% of children on the continent receive vaccines, and has said it will try to raise the number to 85%.</p><br><br>
