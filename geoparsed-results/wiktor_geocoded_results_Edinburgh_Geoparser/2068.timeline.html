  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lexington</span> is a town in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Lexington County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and is also the largest town in <span class="loc">Lexington County</span>. The population was 17,870 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> estimated <span class="date">2014</span> population is 20,905. In <span class="date">1735</span>, the colonial government of King <span class="per">George II</span> established eleven townships in backcountry <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, to encourage settlement, and to provide a buffer between Native American tribes to the West and colonial plantations in the Lowcountry. The townships included one named <span class="loc">Saxe Gotha</span>, which flourished with major crops of corn, wheat, tobacco, hemp, and flax, as well as beeswax and livestock. The Battle of <span class="loc">Tarrar</span> Springs was fought nearby on <span class="date">November 16, 1781</span>. In <span class="date">1785</span>, <span class="loc">Saxe Gotha</span> was replaced with <span class="loc">Lexington County</span>, in commemoration of the Battles of <span class="per">Lexington</span> and <span class="per">Concord</span> in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The county's first courthouse was built in <span class="loc">Granby</span>, but chronic flooding forced the courthouse to move in <span class="date">1820</span> to its present location, establishing the community of <span class="per">Lexington</span> Courthouse. The community was incorporated as the Town of <span class="per">Lexington</span> in <span class="date">1861</span>.</p><br><br>
