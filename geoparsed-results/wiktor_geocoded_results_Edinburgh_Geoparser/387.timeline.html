  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Lincoln /ˈlɪŋkən/ is the capital of the State of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> and the second-most populous city in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. Lincoln is also the county seat of <span class="loc">Lancaster County</span> Lincoln is located in the southeastern part of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> and is in the <span class="loc">Lincoln metropolitan</span> (statistical) area. Lincoln's population in <span class="date">2014</span> was estimated at 272,996. Lincoln was founded as the village of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> on the wild salt flats of what was to become <span class="loc">Lancaster County</span>. <span class="date">A short time</span> later, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> was renamed Lincoln and became Nebraska's capital. Sometimes referred to as the "<span class="loc">Star City</span>", many of Lincoln's primary employers fall within the service and manufacturing industries, including a growing high tech sector. The city is the home of the <span class="org">University of Nebraska</span>, has an unemployment rate of 2.2% (<span class="date">December 2015</span>, preliminary) and has the second tallest capitol building in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Prior to the expansion westward of settlers, the prairie was covered with buffalo grass. Plains Indians, descendants of indigenous peoples who occupied the area for <span class="date">thousands of years</span>, lived in and hunted along <span class="loc">Salt Creek</span>. The <span class="loc">Pawnee</span>, which included four tribes, lived in villages along the <span class="loc">Platte River</span>. The Great Sioux Nation, including the Ihanktowan-Ihanktowana and the <span class="loc">Lakota</span> located to the north and west, used <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> as a hunting and skirmish ground, although they did not have any long-term settlements in the state. An occasional buffalo could still be seen in the plat of Lincoln in the 1860s.</p><br><br>
