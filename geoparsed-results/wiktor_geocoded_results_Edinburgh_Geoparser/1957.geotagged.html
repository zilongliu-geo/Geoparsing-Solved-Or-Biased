<p><span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Chester County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is the closest town to Lincoln University. The population was 5,077 at the 2010 census. The borough was once called <span class="loc">Oxford Crossing</span> and <span class="loc">Oxford Village</span>. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is located near the half-way point on the main road from <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> to <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>. The owner of the stage between the two cities purchased Hood's Tavern and renamed it <span class="loc">Oxford</span> Hotel. It became the stopping point on the two-day trip between the two cities. In 1833, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was officially incorporated as a borough. Its first burgess (now called the mayor) was Thomas Alexander, who operated a general store thought to be the oldest building in <span class="loc">Oxford</span>. The northern half of <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was owned by the Dickey family in the 19th century. The <span class="loc">Dickeys</span> included the local Presbyterian minister, the Mr O'Malley of the local bank, a state Representative, and local businessmen. Reverend John Miller Dickey and his wife Sarah Emlen <span class="loc">Cresson</span> founded Ashmun Institute in 1854, and which later became Lincoln University. The family played a major role in re-routing the new <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="loc">Baltimore Central Railroad</span> (P&amp;BC) through <span class="loc">Oxford</span>. Track was laid in the 1850s. The railroad reached <span class="loc">Oxford</span> in 1860 and later connected to <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>. By the time of the Civil War, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was a bustling community. The business <span class="loc">district on Third Street</span> was entirely re-built at this time, including the <span class="loc">Oxford</span> Hotel (1858) and <span class="loc">Oxford</span> Hall (1862). <span class="loc">Oxford</span> became known for its confectionery and candy businesses and was the location of many manufacturing facilities. A second railroad, the <span class="loc">Peach Bottom</span> Railway, was built in the 1870s from <span class="loc">Oxford</span> to <span class="loc">Peach Bottom</span>. It carried farm products and passengers but was not profitable. It struggled through three bankruptcies and reorganized as the <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> and Southern Railway, finally closing permanently in 1918.</p>
