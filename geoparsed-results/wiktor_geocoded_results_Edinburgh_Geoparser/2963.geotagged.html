<p>Hope (Welsh: <span class="loc">Yr Hob</span>) is a small village in <span class="loc">Flintshire</span>, north-east <span class="loc">Wales</span>. The village is located approximately 3 miles / 4.5 km from the Wales-England border, on the course of the <span class="loc">River Alyn</span>. <span class="loc">Yr Hob</span> was originally the name of a commote within the cantref of Maelor in the medieval Kingdom of <span class="loc">Powys</span>. Hope belongs to a small group of closely related villages in its local area, including <span class="loc">Caergwrle</span>, <span class="loc">Abermorddu</span> and <span class="loc">Cefn-y-bedd</span>. One of the major features in the area is <span class="loc">Hope Mountain</span> (Mynydd yr Hob), to the west of the village, along with the extensive farmland of Shordley. At the 2001 Census, the population was 2,522, increasing to 4,224 at the 2011 Census. In 2007, the secondary school Castell Alun High, which is located in the village, became the only school in <span class="loc">North Wales</span> to be awarded 7 Grade 1s by Estyn, the school inspection service for <span class="loc">Wales</span>. The judgement makes Castell Alun one of the top schools in <span class="loc">Wales</span>. Hope has good transport links with local towns and cities, notably <span class="loc">Wrexham</span>, <span class="loc">Chester</span> and <span class="loc">Mold</span>, with the Borderlands Line running directly through Hope railway station giving access to <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> via the <span class="loc">Wirral</span> Peninsula.</p>
