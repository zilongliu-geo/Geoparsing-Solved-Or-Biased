  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has told people to stay away from Ugandan caves with bats, due to the fact that a tourist visiting <span class="loc">Uganda</span> was recently killed by the fatal Marburg virus. Health authorities in the <span class="loc">Netherlands</span> said that the forty-year-old tourist contracted the disease from fruit bats in a cave. A spokesperson for <span class="org">WHO</span> said that "it is an isolated case of imported <span class="loc">Marburg</span>." He continued, "people should not think about amending their travel plans to <span class="loc">Uganda</span> but should not go into caves with bats." The Health Ministry of <span class="loc">Uganda</span> advised people who have to enter caves in <span class="loc">Uganda</span> that they should exercise "maximum precaution not to get into close contact with the bats and non-human primates in the nearby forests". Marburg virus causes <span class="loc">Marburg</span> hemorrhagic fever, which is related to <span class="loc">Ebola</span>. It is believed that humans first caught the virus from Egyptian fruit bats. The first Ugandan case of the virus occurred approximately <span class="date">a year ago</span>; it involved a 29-year-old man who became symptomatic on <span class="date">July 4</span> and died on <span class="date">July 14</span>. A co-worker of the man had previously suffered from a similar disease, although he survived. The Soviet Union also reportedly prepared Marburg virus samples for use as a biological weapon in the time of war.</p><br><br>
