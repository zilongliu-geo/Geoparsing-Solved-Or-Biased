  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Franklin</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Pendleton County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 721 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Pendleton County</span>. <span class="org">Franklin</span> was established in <span class="date">1794</span> and named for <span class="per">Francis Evick</span>, an early settler. The Town of <span class="org">Franklin</span> is situated in the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> Mountains on the eastern edge of the Monongahela National Forest and along the South Branch of the <span class="loc">Potomac River</span>. This region was populated by Native American cultures for <span class="date">centuries</span> prior to the arrival of English immigrants in the mid-18th century. During the French and <span class="org">Indian War</span>, conflict between the early settlers and Native American populations included two battles at frontier fortifications at <span class="loc">Upper Tract</span> and <span class="loc">Fort Seybert</span> in <span class="date">1758</span>, both ten miles distant from <span class="date">the future</span> location of <span class="org">Franklin</span>. The land on which <span class="org">Franklin</span> was laid out was first patented by brothers <span class="per">Francis</span> and <span class="per">George</span> <span class="per">Evick</span> in <span class="date">1769</span>. <span class="loc">Pendleton County</span> was divided from parts of <span class="date">August</span>, Hardy, and <span class="loc">Rockingham Counties</span> (Virginia) by an act of the <span class="org">Virginia General Assembly</span> in <span class="date">1787</span>. The earliest court sessions in the new county were held at the home of <span class="per">Captain Zeruiah Stratton</span> near the present-day village of Ruddle until <span class="per">Francis Evick</span> offered a part of his land to become a county seat around <span class="date">1789</span>. Additional lots were divided off of <span class="per">Evick</span>'s land to form the new town. On <span class="date">December 19, 1794</span>, the <span class="org">Virginia General Assembly</span> chartered the town of <span class="org">Franklin</span> and recognized it as the seat of <span class="loc">Pendleton County</span>. <span class="org">Franklin</span> grew steadily over the first half of the 19th century, becoming a local center of commerce and industry. In <span class="date">1834</span>, there were two stores, two tanneries, three saddlers, two carpenters, two shoemakers, two blacksmiths, one gunsmith, one tailor, one hat-maker, and one cabinet-maker listed among the town's residents.</p><br><br>
