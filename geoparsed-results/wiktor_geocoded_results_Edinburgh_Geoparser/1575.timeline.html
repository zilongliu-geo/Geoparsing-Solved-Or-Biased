  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Marana</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Pima County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, located northwest of <span class="loc">Tucson</span>, with a small portion in <span class="loc">Pinal County</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population of the town is 34,961. <span class="loc">Marana</span> was the fourth fastest-growing place among all cities and towns in <span class="loc">Arizona</span> of any size from <span class="date">1990</span> to <span class="date">2000</span>. <span class="loc">Marana</span> is located at 32°23′12″N 111°7′32″W (32.386539, -111.125437). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 121.4 square miles (313.6 km²), of which, 120.7 square miles (312.3 km²) of it is land and 0.7 square miles (1.9 km²) of it (1.22%) is water. The town extends along Interstate 10 from the line between <span class="loc">Pinal</span> and <span class="loc">Pima County</span> to the <span class="loc">Tucson city</span> line, except the area around the non-affluent unincorporated community of <span class="loc">Rillito</span>. The town has a history of farming and ranching. The <span class="loc">Tucson Mountains</span> and the western half of Saguaro National Park are located to the south. Phoenix is approximately 90 minutes north via Interstate 10. The southern portion of <span class="loc">Marana</span> has grown considerably since <span class="date">the early 1990s</span> with the addition of businesses and some housing, much of it due to annexation of existing unincorporated areas. In <span class="date">1992</span>, the <span class="org">Marana Town Council</span> voted to annex an area of unincorporated <span class="loc">Pima County</span> that was located to the southeast of the town limits. The area selected was a narrow corridor of land that snaked its way south along Interstate 10, then to the east along Ina Road, and then south along Thornydale Road. These areas were mainly high density commercial businesses and shopping centers, including large retailers such as Super KMart (<span class="date">now</span> closed), Costco Wholesale, Target, and Home Depot. The areas were selected by <span class="loc">Marana</span> to be annexed, by their own admission, for their sales tax revenue. The large residential areas behind these commercial areas were not annexed. As a result, the <span class="loc">city of Tucson</span> filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of <span class="loc">Arizona</span> in and for the <span class="loc">County of Pima</span> (<span class="loc">City of Tucson</span> v Town of <span class="loc">Marana</span>) claiming that <span class="loc">Marana</span> illegally annexed the unincorporated areas in violation of existing state laws. However, on <span class="date">April 4, 1994</span>, <span class="per">Judge Lina Rodriguez</span> ruled in favor of <span class="loc">Marana</span>, allowing the annexation to stand. Following this suit, the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> State annexation laws were changed, forbidding municipalities from annexing small strips of land without taking large surrounding parcels as well. A “strip annexation” is no longer allowed under <span class="loc">Arizona</span> law.</p><br><br>
