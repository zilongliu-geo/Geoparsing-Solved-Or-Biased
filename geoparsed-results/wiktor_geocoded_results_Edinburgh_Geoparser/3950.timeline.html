His father bought 2,700 acres (11 km2) of land in Northern <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> from his friend <span class="per">George</span> <span class="org">Muse</span>, part of which <span class="org">Muse</span> had been awarded for his military service in the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span>. <span class="per">James Taylor Jr.</span> was one of the wealthiest men in the state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. In <span class="date">1848</span>, his estate was valued at more than $4 million. <span class="date">Today</span>, his home stands in the <span class="loc">East Row</span> local Historic District in the adjoining <span class="loc">City of Newport</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. <span class="loc">East Row</span> is the second-largest local district in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, and the <span class="per">Taylor</span> Mansion is the district's oldest house.</p><br><br>
