  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Police ready to enforce skate ban. <span class="loc">Ziegler</span> said many businesses in the downtown area have placed signs up banning skating on their property. He said since those signs have gone up, calls to those area for skaters have decreased. As of <span class="date">next week</span>, however, the entire downtown business area will be a posted zone prohibiting skating. Also, <span class="loc">Athens</span> <span class="per">Parks</span> and <span class="per">Recreation</span> Director <span class="per">Austin Fesmire</span> said the city parks are available for skating as long as there are no signs prohibiting it. <span class="per">Fesmire</span> added the steps at Athens Regional Park by the lake Pavilion have been signed as a no skating zone because of the danger of injury. <span class="per">Knox Park</span> is a no skating zone, also, along with the fountain area of Veterans Memorial Park and the tennis courts at Ingleside Ave.</p><br><br>
