  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Clinton Township residents of <span class="loc">Waters Edge</span> want in-ground pools. <span class="loc">Maira</span> said she had spoken with planning consultant <span class="per">Frank</span> Banish and had been advised that pools had not been included as an accessory use when the area was zoned <span class="date">about 10 years ago</span> because the plan at the time had called for high-density condominiums, not the single family homes that were eventually built. <span class="per">Cimei</span> said the ordinance amending the regulations would be considered by the council <span class="date">next month</span>, but would have to be referred to the Planning Board before it can be fully adopted. The timeline may take final adoption well into <span class="date">May</span>, further delaying potential pool construction. Depending on when the work can be done, the five hopeful residents may have to wait well into the <span class="date">summer</span> <span class="date">months</span> before realizing the cooling effect of their swimming pools.</p><br><br>
