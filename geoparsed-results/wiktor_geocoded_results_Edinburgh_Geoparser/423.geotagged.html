<p><span class="loc">Paris</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Bourbon County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies 18 miles (29 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Lexington</span> on the Stoner Fork of the <span class="loc">Licking River</span>. It is the seat of its county and forms part of the <span class="loc">Lexingtonâ€“Fayette Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 8,553. Joseph Houston settled a station in the area in 1776, but was forced to relocate due to prior land grants. In 1786, Lawrence Protzman purchased the area of present-day <span class="loc">Paris</span> from its owners, platted 250 acres (100 ha) for a town, and offered land for public buildings in exchange for the Virginia legislature making the settlement the seat of the newly formed <span class="loc">Bourbon County</span>. In 1789, the town was formally established as <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> after <span class="loc">Hopewell</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, his hometown. The next year, though, it was renamed <span class="loc">Paris</span> after the French capital to match its county and honor the French assistance during the American Revolution. The post office was briefly known as Bourbontown or <span class="loc">Bourbonton</span> in the early 19th century, but there is no evidence it was ever formally applied to the town itself. It was incorporated as <span class="loc">Paris</span> in 1839 and again in 1890.</p>
