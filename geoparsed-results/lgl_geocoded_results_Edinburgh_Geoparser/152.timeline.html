  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Compromise required for transportation bill to pass. <span class="loc">Ohio</span> lawmakers voted almost completely in lockstep with their parties on a bill to provide billions of dollars for road projects, move forward with plans for passenger trains and toughen rules on drivers. <span class="date">Now</span> they'll have to learn the art of the compromise. The <span class="org">House</span>, controlled by Democrats, approved nearly all of Gov. <span class="per">Ted Strickland</span>'s two-year, $9.5 billion transportation budget, including controversial provisions green-lighting speed cameras in construction zones; a study of passenger rail service connecting <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">Dayton</span> and <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>; stronger enforcement of seat-belt laws; and solar- and wind-energy projects on the right-of-way along the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> Turnpike. <span class="org">The Senate</span>, controlled by Republicans, wiped out nearly all of those provisions, although the train idea held on by a thread. Democrats say cameras to nab speeders in construction zones and enforcement of the seat-belt law as a primary offense meaning drivers can be ticketed even if it's their only violation will enhance public safety. Republicans say the changes are about money and infringe on personal freedom. Democrats say the rail plan would provide a new transportation option for Ohioans and stimulate economic development. Many Republicans say the idea hasn't been adequately researched and may not find enough riders. Democrats say the state owns plenty of unused land along the turnpike that could generate green energy. Republicans say the idea was too ill-defined for them to approve. Those disputes, and dozens of smaller differences between the <span class="org">House</span> and Senate bills, <span class="date">now</span> go to a bipartisan, six-member conference committee to iron out the differences. The committee is tasked with developing a final bill that both chambers will either accept or reject. Though once used regularly, conference committees became a far rarer occurrence in <span class="date">the past</span> decade-plus, as members of the Republican-controlled legislature grew to view the committees as a failure of compromise. But with a new Democratic-controlled <span class="org">House</span> and GOP-run Senate for the first time in <span class="date">16 years</span>, the conference committee should see a resurgence. "As a leader, you kind of want a bill to go conference committee because you have more control over it," said Sen. <span class="per">Jon Husted</span>, a Kettering Republican who served <span class="date">four years</span> as <span class="org">House</span> speaker. The conference committee is scheduled to do its work <span class="date">today</span>, <span class="date">Wednesday</span> and <span class="date">Thursday</span> if needed. It won't have time to dawdle: <span class="per">Strickland</span> must sign the final compromise bill by <span class="date">March 31</span>. The budget is for the 2010-11 fiscal <span class="date">years</span>, which begin <span class="date">July 1</span>, and the legislation doesn't take effect for <span class="date">90 days</span>. Conceivably, the conference committee could strip out the more controversial provisions such as the new driver rules and move forward on the rest of the bill. <span class="per">Scott Varner</span>, a spokesman for the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> <span class="loc">Department of Transportation</span>, said it's been at least a quarter-century since the agency's budget wasn't approved by the <span class="date">March 31</span> deadline. <span class="per">Herb Asher</span>, professor emeritus of political science at <span class="org">Ohio State University</span>, said he doesn't expect partisan wrangling to doom the transportation budget <span class="date">this year</span>. "You can't have endless stalemate," he said. "Transportation is very important to the state, very important to the economy." There could be horse-trading on some of the items; for example, Republicans could yield on the speed cameras in exchange for Democrats dumping the seat-belt provision. But <span class="per">Asher</span> said it doesn't have to be that simple. "Conference committees have a substantial amount of power," he said. "You don't have to split the difference." <span class="per">Husted</span> said it remains unknown how the new Statehouse political dynamics will play out. <span class="org">House</span> Speaker Armond <span class="per">Budish, D</span>-Beachwood, is new to the process and veteran Senate President Bill <span class="per">M. Harris</span>, R-Ashland, has been out of <span class="loc">Columbus</span> for <span class="date">weeks</span> with a badly broken leg. "What does happen will foreshadow how problems are solved with the operating budget, which is a far bigger issue," <span class="per">Husted</span> said of that $54.4 billion two-year spending plan, which will be decided in <span class="date">June</span>.</p><br><br>
