<p><span class="loc">Valladolid</span> (/ˌvælədəˈliːdˌ -ˈlɪd/ or /ˌbɑːjədəˈliːd/, Spanish: [baʎaðoˈlið]) is a city in <span class="loc">Spain</span> and the de facto capital of the autonomous region of Castile and Leon. It has a population of 309,714 people (2013 est.), making it <span class="loc">Spain</span>'s 13th most populous municipality and northwestern <span class="loc">Spain</span>'s biggest city. <span class="loc">Its metropolitan</span> area ranks 20th in <span class="loc">Spain</span> with a population of 414,244 people in 23 municipalities. The city is situated at the confluence of the Pisuerga and Esgueva rivers, and located within five winegrowing regions: Ribera del Duero, <span class="loc">Rueda</span>, <span class="loc">Toro</span>, <span class="loc">Tierra</span> de León, and <span class="loc">Cigales</span>. <span class="loc">Valladolid</span> was originally settled in pre-Roman times by the Celtic Vaccaei people, and later the Romans themselves. It remained a small settlement until being re-established by King Alfonso VI of Castile as a Lordship for the Count Pedro Ansúrez in 1072. It grew to prominence in the Middle Ages as the seat of the Court of Castile and being endowed with fairs and different institutions as a collegiate church, University (1241), <span class="loc">Royal Court</span> and Chancery and the Royal Mint. The Catholic Monarchs, Isabel I of Castile and Ferdinand II of <span class="loc">Aragon</span>, married in <span class="loc">Valladolid</span> in 1469 and established it as the capital of the Kingdom of Castile and later of united <span class="loc">Spain</span>. Christopher Columbus died in <span class="loc">Valladolid</span> in 1506, while authors Francisco de Quevedo and Miguel de Cervantes lived and worked in the city. The city was briefly the capital of <span class="loc">Habsburg</span> <span class="loc">Spain</span> under Phillip III between 1601 and 1606, before returning indefinitely to <span class="loc">Madrid</span>. The city then declined until the arrival of the railway in the 19th century, and with its industrialisation into the 20th century.</p>
