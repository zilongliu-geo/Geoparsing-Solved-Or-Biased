<p><span class="loc">Kerang</span> is a rural town on the <span class="loc">Loddon River</span> in northern Victoria in <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is the commercial centre to an irrigation district based on livestock, horticulture, lucerne and grain. It is located 279 kilometres (173 mi) north-west of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> on the Murray Valley Highway a few kilometres north of its intersection with the Loddon Valley Highway, elevation 78 metres (256 ft). At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Kerang</span> had a population of 3,872. <span class="loc">Kerang</span> is believed to be an Aboriginal word for Cockatoo. The Wemba-Wemba Aborigines are thought to have been the area's first occupants. Thomas Mitchell was the first European to visit the area, in 1836. Squatters began to settle in the area in 1845 and in 1848 Richard Beyes opened a public house at a river crossing near the future townsite. This was followed by a saddlery and a church. In 1857 Woodford Patchell built a bridge upriver from the settlement which drew traffic from the earlier settlement. He built a store, house and hotel that became the center of what was to become <span class="loc">Kerang</span>. Patchell was the first farmer in the state to use irrigation and experimented with oats, barley, maize, millet, tobacco, beet, cotton and sugarcane. The Post Office opened on 29 July 1858. An earlier Kerang office, quite distant, was renamed <span class="loc">Wedderburn</span> on the same day.</p>
