<p>Suburban sprawl encroaches on rural Ohio townships. <span class="loc">MAINEVILLE</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span> (AP) &#x97; Some rural townships in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> are imposing impact fees and other regulations on new residential development to keep suburban sprawl from encroaching on farmland. Officials in <span class="loc">Warren County</span>'s Hamilton Township outside <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span> say the population spurt there is putting pressure on safety services and roadways. To cope with growth costs, the township imposed an impact fee on new development that led to a bitter and unresolved court challenge from home builders. Government officials also have changed a zoning code to limit the density of homes in rural areas. From 2002 to 2007, the number of farms in <span class="loc">Warren County</span> fell 14 percent from 1,036 to 896, one of the sharpest declines in the state.</p>
