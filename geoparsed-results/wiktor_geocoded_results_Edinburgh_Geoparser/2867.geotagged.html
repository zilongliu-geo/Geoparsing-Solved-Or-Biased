<p><span class="loc">Valdez</span> /vælˈdiːz/ (Alutiiq: Suacit) is a city in Valdez-Cordova Census Area in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alaska</span>. According to the 2010 <span class="loc">US</span> Census, the population of the city is 3,976. The city is one of the most important ports in <span class="loc">Alaska</span>. The port of <span class="loc">Valdez</span> was named in 1790 after the Spanish Navy Minister Antonio Valdés y Fernández Bazán. <span class="loc">Valdez</span> is a fishing port, both for commercial and sport fishing. Freight moves through <span class="loc">Valdez</span> bound for the interior of <span class="loc">Alaska</span>. Sightseeing of the marine life and glaciers, together with both deep-sea fishing, and heli skiing support a tourist industry in <span class="loc">Valdez</span>. The oil from the Trans-Alaska pipeline is loaded onto ships at the <span class="loc">Valdez</span> oil terminal. Alyeska Pipeline Service Company is one of the biggest employers in town but it started to move several positions to its headquarters in Anchorage since the town council passed a resolution charging a tax to all the tankers coming into the port to be loaded with oil. This has had an impact in the population size and the economy. <span class="loc">Valdez</span> is connected to the interior of <span class="loc">Alaska</span> by the Richardson Highway, and is a port of call in the Alaska Marine Highway ferry system. Just north of <span class="loc">Valdez</span> on the highway is <span class="loc">Thompson</span> Pass, which has spectacular waterfalls and glaciers next to the highway. <span class="loc">Thompson</span> Pass is also known for treacherous driving conditions during the winter.</p>
