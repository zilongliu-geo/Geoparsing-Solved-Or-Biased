<p>Manhattan among added services. Despite losing $2.1 billion in revenue for 2008, American Airlines announced Monday that its subsidiary, American Eagle, would introduce six new regional services, including one from Manhattan Regional Airport. At a news conference Monday, American Airlines representative Dale Morris joked about the company not having gone bankrupt and said that a year ago, high fuel prices would not have permitted the new route from Manhattan to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Scheduled to begin Aug. 25, the twice-daily, non-stop service would offer 50 seats on an Embraer jet. Ticket fares have not been announced. They are expected to cost, one-way, about $40 to $100 more than a flight from <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> International to Dallas, when purchased two to three weeks in advance, said Richard Jankovich, airport advisory board chairman.</p>
