<p><span class="loc">Nakhodka</span> (Russian: Находка; IPA: [nɐˈxotkə]) is a port city in Primorsky Krai, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Trudny</span> Peninsula jutting into the <span class="loc">Nakhodka</span> Bay of the <span class="loc">Sea of Japan</span>, about 85 kilometers (53 mi) east of <span class="loc">Vladivostok</span>, the administrative center of the krai. Population: 159,719 (2010 Census); 148,826 (2002 Census); 160,056 (1989 Census). The <span class="loc">Nakhodka</span> Bay, around which the city is organized, was discovered in 1859 by the Russian corvette <span class="loc">Amerika</span>, which sought shelter in the bay during a storm. In honor of this occasion, the ice-free and relatively calm bay was named <span class="loc">Nakhodka</span>, which in Russian means "discovery" or "lucky find". Until the 20th century, the area around the bay remained uninhabited, with the first settlement a small fishing village founded in 1907. When the Soviet government decided to build a harbor in the area in the 1930s, a number of small settlements were founded, which were merged as a work settlement in the 1940s. On May 18, 1950, the settlement, by then with a population of about 28,000 residents, was granted town status.</p>
