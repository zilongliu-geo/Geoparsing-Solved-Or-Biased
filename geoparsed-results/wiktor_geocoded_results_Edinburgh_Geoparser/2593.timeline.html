  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sopo</span> is a civil parish in the municipality of <span class="loc">Vila Nova de Cerveira</span> in the Portuguese northern district of <span class="loc">Viana do Castelo</span>. The population in <span class="date">2011</span> was 557, in an area of 14.82 kmÂ². References from <span class="date">1258</span> identify the existence of several churches situated between the <span class="loc">Lima</span> and <span class="loc">Minho Rivers</span>, and that one of these churches, named <span class="loc">Zopo</span>, belonged to the <span class="per">Bishop of Tui</span>. By the beginning of the 16th century, the <span class="loc">parish of Sopo</span> was part of the Archdiocese of <span class="loc">Braga</span> and belonged to the municipality of <span class="per">Caminha</span>; comparably, <span class="loc">Sopo</span> was part of this municipality by <span class="date">1546</span>. A <span class="date">1580</span> census completed by friar Baltasar Limpo, in order to determine the condition of the deaconship, referred to the <span class="loc">parish of Santiago</span> de <span class="loc">Sopo</span> within the comarca of <span class="per">Caminha</span>, an area that was divided between the clergy of the archbishop and other lay clergy. <span class="per">Archbishop D. Diogo de Sousa</span> confirmed a donation to <span class="loc">Sopo</span>, completed by several people to the <span class="per">Marquis of Vila Real</span>. The Marquis, later, transferred the patronage of <span class="loc">Sopo</span> to his son, the <span class="per">Duke of Caminha</span>, who was, along with his father, implicated in the conspiracy against <span class="per">John IV</span>.</p><br><br>
