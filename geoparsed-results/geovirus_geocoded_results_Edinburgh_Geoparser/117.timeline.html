  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Researchers from <span class="loc">Asia</span>, <span class="loc">Africa</span>, <span class="loc">Europe</span>, and the <span class="loc">United States</span> have mapped resistance of malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum to antimalarial drug artemisinin, mainly in southeast <span class="loc">Asia</span>; correlated the resistance-causing mutation with slow parasite clearance; and found that prolonged therapy is highly effective against drug-resistant malaria. Their study was published in New <span class="loc">England</span> <span class="org">Journal of Medicine</span> on <span class="date">Thursday</span>. The mutation considered in this study was identified <span class="date">last year</span> as the molecular marker of artemisinin-resistant malaria. The current study found the mutation, located in the propeller domain of a Kelch protein on human chromosome 13, predicted when parasite clearance half-life would exceed five hours with 91.8% sensitivity and 88.4% specificity — usually correct in predicting both when long half-life would occur, and when it wouldn't. OpenClinica web-based database was used for collection of data which was used to assess parasite clearance rate. The study found a six-day treatment course effective against artemisinin-resistant malaria. The standard regimen consists of three-day dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment, and had a 25% rate of failure at day 42 in another recent study in <span class="loc">Pailin</span>, <span class="loc">Cambodia</span>. The prolonged regimen which includes <span class="date">three days</span> of artesunate followed by <span class="date">three days</span> of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, has shown 2% rate of failure at day 42 in the same area. Geometric mean of the half-life values were similar in two treatment groups of 60 patients each at each study site: one group received artesunate at a daily dose of 2 mg per patient's body-weight kilogram and the other 4 mg per kilogram. Afterwards, patients at several study sites were followed for <span class="date">42 days</span> — <span class="loc">Pailin</span>, <span class="loc">Cambodia</span>; Attapeu, <span class="loc">Laos</span>; <span class="loc">Binh Phuoc</span>, <span class="loc">Vietnam</span>; Shwe Kyin, <span class="loc">Myanmar</span>; and <span class="loc">Pingilikani</span>, <span class="loc">Kenya</span> — and for <span class="date">28 days</span> in <span class="loc">Kinshasa</span>, DR Congo. The treatment regimens were highly effective at all the study sites. Support for the study came from the <span class="org">UK Department for International Development</span>, the Worldwide <span class="org">Antimalarial Resistance Network</span>, <span class="org">the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute</span> of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of <span class="org">the National Institutes of Health</span>, and the <span class="per">Bill</span> and <span class="per">Melinda</span> Gates Foundation. Also, the UK-based <span class="org">Wellcome Trust</span> funds one of the participating research organizations, the Mahidol–Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Programme.</p><br><br>
