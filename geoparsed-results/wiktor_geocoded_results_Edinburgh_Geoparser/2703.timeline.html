  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Petersburg</span> (Tlingit: Gantiyaakw SÃ©edi "Steamboat Channel") is a census-designated place within <span class="loc">Petersburg Borough</span> on <span class="loc">Mitkof Island</span> in southeast <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. According to <span class="date">2009</span> Census Bureau estimates, its population was 2,824 full-time residents. The borough encompasses <span class="loc">Petersburg</span> and <span class="loc">Kupreanof</span>, plus mostly uninhabited areas stretching to the Canadian border and the southern boundary of the City and <span class="loc">Borough of Juneau</span>. While the <span class="loc">city of Petersburg</span> ceased to exist as a separate administrative entity (the borough assembly created a service area to assume operation of the former city's services), the tiny <span class="loc">city of Kupreanof</span> remains separate within the borough. Tlingits from <span class="loc">Kupreanof</span> Island had long used a <span class="date">summer</span> fish camp at the north end of <span class="loc">Mitkof Island</span>. Earlier cultures of indigenous people also used the island: remnants of fish traps and some petroglyphs have been carbon-dated back some <span class="date">1,000 years</span>. European explorers to <span class="loc">Mitkof Island</span> encountered the Tlingit. In the nineteenth century, <span class="per">Peter Buschmann</span>, a Norwegian immigrant, settled here, building a cannery, sawmill, docks and early structures. The settlement was named <span class="loc">Petersburg</span> after him, and it flourished as a fishing port. (Icebergs from the nearby <span class="loc">LeConte Glacier</span> provided a source for cooling fish). <span class="loc">Petersburg</span> originally incorporated as a town on <span class="date">April 2, 1910</span>. The town had attracted mostly immigrants of Scandinavian origin, thus giving <span class="loc">Petersburg</span> the nickname "<span class="loc">Little Norway</span>". The Sons of <span class="loc">Norway</span> hall was built on one of the piers. Three other canneries were built and the four have operated continuously since. With the establishment of the cannery, Alaskan Natives, including Chief <span class="per">John Lott</span>, began to work there and live year-round at the site.</p><br><br>
