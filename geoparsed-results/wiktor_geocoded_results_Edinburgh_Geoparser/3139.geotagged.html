<p>Charlotte (/ʃɑːrˈlɒt/ shar-LOT) is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 9,074. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Eaton County</span>. Charlotte is in the central portion of the county, on the boundary between <span class="loc">Eaton Township</span> and <span class="loc">Carmel Township</span>, though politically independent of both. Interstate 69 serves the city, and connects it to the state capital of <span class="loc">Lansing</span>. It is located 21.5 miles (34.6 kilometers) from downtown <span class="loc">Lansing</span>. In 1832 George Barnes purchased the land that would become Charlotte from the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Government. Barnes in turn sold the land to <span class="loc">Edmond</span> B. Bostwick, a land speculator from New <span class="loc">York City</span> three years later in 1835. Bostwick then sold portions of the land to H.I. Lawrence, Townsend Harris, and Francis Cochran. These four created the village which they named after Edmond Bostwick's wife Charlotte. Jonathan Searles became the first postmaster on March 17, 1838. Charlotte was incorporated as a village on October 10, 1863, and as a city on March 29, 1871. At various times Charlotte had the unofficial names of <span class="loc">Eaton Centre</span>, and <span class="loc">Carmel</span>. It was designated as the county seat when <span class="loc">Eaton County</span> was organized in 1837; however, due to a lack of population and buildings, county functions were conducted at <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> until 1840.</p>
