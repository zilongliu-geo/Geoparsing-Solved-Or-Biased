<p>Livingston is a township in <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the township's population was 29,366, reflecting an increase of 1,975 (+7.2%) from the 27,391 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 782 (+2.9%) from the 26,609 counted in the 1990 Census. Livingston was incorporated as a township by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on February 5, 1813, from portions of Caldwell Township (now Fairfield Township) and Springfield Township (now in <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>). Portions of the township were taken to form <span class="loc">Fairmount</span> (March 11, 1862, now part of <span class="loc">West Orange</span>) and <span class="loc">Roseland</span> (March 10, 1908). The township was named for William Livingston, the first Governor of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>; his family's coat of arms serves as the township's seal. Livingston's history dates back to 1699 when 101 <span class="loc">Newark</span> settlers wanted to move westward. They set up a committee to negotiate from <span class="loc">Lenni</span> Lenape Native Americans for the purchase of the Horseneck Tract which today includes Livingston and eight other municipalities to the north. Between 1698 and 1702, the rules for property ownership were unclear. There were many disputes between settlers and the English proprietors. For some unknown reasons, the <span class="loc">Newark</span> settlers did not obtain a grant from the proprietors before negotiating with the natives. They finally obtained the deed directly from <span class="loc">Lenni</span> <span class="loc">Lenape</span> in 1702 for Â£130. The settlements began until around the 1740s as the dispute between the proprietors and the settlers continued.</p>
