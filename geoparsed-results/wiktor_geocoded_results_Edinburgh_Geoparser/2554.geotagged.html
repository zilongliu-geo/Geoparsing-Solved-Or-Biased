<p><span class="loc">Dilla</span> (Amharic: ዲላ?) is a market town and separate woreda in southern <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. The administrative center of the Gedeo Zone in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region (SNNPR), it is located on the main road from <span class="loc">Addis Ababa</span> to <span class="loc">Nairobi</span>. The town has a longitude and latitude of 6°24′30″N 38°18′30″E, with an elevation of 1570 meters above sea level. It was part of Wenago woreda and is currently surrounded by Dila Zuria woreda. Until the completion in the early 1970s of the tarmac road to the <span class="loc">Kenya</span> border, <span class="loc">Dilla</span> had been located at the southern end of the all-weather road from <span class="loc">Addis Ababa</span> and thus became the major transfer and marketing point for coffee grown farther south, particularly of the much-prized Yirga Cheffe varietal (see coffee varietals). It remains a major center of the coffee trade. According to the SNNPR's Bureau of Finance and Economic Development, as of 2003 Dilla's amenities include digital telephone access, postal service, 24-hour electrical service, numerous banks, and a hospital. <span class="loc">Dilla</span> is the site of the Dilla College of Teachers' Education, which was founded in 1996 and was part of Debub University. The college become a full flagged University since 2007 and composed of more than 30 programs to Masters and bachelor's degree. A number of archeologically significant stelae fields are in the surrounding area, the most notable groups being those at Tutu Fella and Tutiti.</p>
