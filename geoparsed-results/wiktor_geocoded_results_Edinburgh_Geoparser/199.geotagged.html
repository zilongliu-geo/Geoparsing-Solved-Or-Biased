<p><span class="loc">Bara</span>, anciently spelt <span class="loc">Baro</span>, is an agricultural parish in <span class="loc">East Lothian</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, which adjoins the <span class="loc">parish of Garvald</span> to the east, and <span class="loc">Lauder</span> across the <span class="loc">Lammermuir Hills</span>. It is south-west of <span class="loc">Haddington</span>. About 1340 Robert de Lawder, Justiciary, was a witness, with James Lord Douglas, Robert de Keith, Henry St.Clair, Alexander de <span class="loc">Seaton</span>, all knights, plus the "Lord" William, Rector of the <span class="loc">parish of Morham</span>, <span class="loc">East Lothian</span>, to a charter of <span class="loc">Euphemia</span>, the widow of Sir John Giffard, Lord of Yester, relating to the tenement of land of 'Barow'. This was once a separate community and parish, with its own church and graveyard which stood in a corner of Linplum farm, to this day called kirk field. In 1743 part of the roof of the ancient church collapsed. The community was in some decline and the Presbytery decided not to repair the church but to conjoin the parish with adjoining <span class="loc">Garvald</span>, notwithstanding the fact that Morham church was slightly closer. The Glebe was on the north side of the road leading to <span class="loc">Garvald</span> and the manse stood where, in 1890, the <span class="loc">Bara</span> blacksmith's premises stood. The superiority of the parish was long in the hands of the <span class="loc">Hays</span> of Yester family and their cadets, and following the demise of Bara Kirk, Robert Hay of <span class="loc">Bara</span> &amp; Linplum enclosed the churchyard with a wall and planted it with trees and shrubs. Some of the church ruins are extant and just a few of the original headstones in the totally overgrown graveyard. Some of the older headstones were readable in the 19th century and half a dozen appear in John Martine's book. Others were transcribed in the 1950s.</p>
