  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Solar energy proposal goes down to defeat. Measure B falls short of a majority in a blow to <span class="per">Villaraigosa</span> and a labor group whose top officials proposed it. <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Fernando City</span> Councilwoman Nury Martinez wins school board seat. The solar energy ballot measure known as Measure B went down to defeat <span class="date">Thursday</span> as <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> election officials finished their count of the remaining 49,000 mail-in, provisional and damaged ballots. <span class="date">Sixteen days</span> after the election, city officials announced that Measure B had fallen short of a majority -- with 50.5% of voters opposing the plan and 49.5% in favor of it. The final count left Measure B trailing by 2,644 votes. The defeat dealt a blow to the hopes of <span class="per">Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa</span>, who had spent $145,000 from a campaign committee on behalf of the measure and appeared in a blitz of television commercials promoting it. But it also was a setback for <span class="org">the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers</span>, whose top officials had proposed Measure B. The union's various locals, nationals and affiliated nonprofit groups had spent more than $673,000 toward its passage -- more than half of the total collected by the Measure B campaign. Labor groups provided two-thirds of the campaign's funding. Measure B would have required the city Department of Water and Power to install 400 megawatts of solar panels by <span class="date">2014</span>. All the work would have been performed by DWP employees represented by the electrical workers union. Backers said it would have reduced the city's reliance on fossil fuels, provided more dependable power and created good jobs. Opponents said it would have hiked electrical rates significantly and locked out construction trade workers In the closely divided race to replace <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> school board member <span class="per">Julie Korenstein</span>, <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Fernando City</span> Councilwoman Nury Martinez defeated educator <span class="per">Louis Pugliese</span>, a two-time school board candidate. On election night, <span class="per">Pugliese</span> trailed <span class="loc">Martinez</span> by 482 votes.</p><br><br>
