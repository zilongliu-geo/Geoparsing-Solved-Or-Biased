<p><span class="loc">Eldorado</span> (/ɛldəˈreɪdoʊ/ or /ɛldəˈreɪdə/) is a city in <span class="loc">Saline County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,122 at the 2010 census, with a 1925 peak of 8,000. Although the city's name is spelled as if it were Spanish, the name was originally "Elder-Reado"—a combination of the last names of the town's two founders, Judge Samuel Elder and Joseph Read. According to legend, a signpainter for the railroad painted the name "Eldorado" on the train depot; as a result, the spelling and pronunciation was forever changed. <span class="loc">Eldorado</span> is included in the Illinois-Indiana-Kentucky Tri-State Area and is a bedroom community in the Harrisburg Micropolitan Statistical Area. In September, 1963, five months before The Beatles' first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show brought them stardom in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, George Harrison performed at the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in <span class="loc">Eldorado</span> with a local band. This was the first performance by a Beatle in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the time, Harrison and his brother were visiting their sister, Louise, who had recently relocated with her husband to nearby <span class="loc">Benton</span>.</p>
