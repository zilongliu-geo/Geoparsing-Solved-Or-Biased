  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Kettering</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> and <span class="loc">Greene</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, located almost entirely in <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>. It is a suburb of Dayton. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a total population of 56,163, making it the largest suburb in the <span class="loc">Dayton Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The area where the <span class="loc">city of Kettering</span> <span class="date">now</span> lies was settled from the late 1700s to the mid-1800s, largely as farmland. The population in the area started to grow, prompting the creation of (<span class="date">now</span> defunct) Van Buren Township in <span class="date">1841</span>. In <span class="date">November 1952</span>, township voters approved incorporating as the Village of <span class="loc">Kettering</span>. (In <span class="date">1953</span>, the western portion of the village voted to secede, forming a new township, which is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="org">the City of Moraine</span>). By <span class="date">1955</span>, the village's population had grown to 38,118, which qualified it to claim city status, with the official proclamation by the state on <span class="date">June 24</span>. The city is named for inventor <span class="per">Charles F. Kettering</span>, who resided here in his home, Ridgeleigh Terrace, from <span class="date">1914</span> until his death in <span class="date">1958</span>. <span class="per">Charles Kettering</span> is known for his numerous inventions and contributions to the Dayton area.</p><br><br>
