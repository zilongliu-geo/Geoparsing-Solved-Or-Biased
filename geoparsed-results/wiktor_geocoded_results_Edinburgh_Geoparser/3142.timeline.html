  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Heshan</span> (Chinese: 鹤山) is a county-level <span class="loc">city of Jiangmen</span> City in the southern part of <span class="loc">Guangdong Province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span> with a total land area of 1,108.3 square kilometres (427.9 sq mi) and a population of 360,000. If migrants this figure rises to around 550,000 persons residing within the city's borders. There are approximately 360,000 people of <span class="loc">Heshan</span> origin or descent living in other parts of the world. Situated about 60 kilometres (37 mi) south west of the provincial capital, <span class="loc">Guangzhou</span>, <span class="loc">Heshan</span> occupies a strategic location on the Pearl River Delta, commanding the northern gateway to Jiangmen's five prefectures. Along the opposite bank of the same river, lie the two municipalities of <span class="loc">Nanhai</span> and <span class="loc">Shunde</span>. <span class="loc">Heshan</span> is around one hour from <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> and <span class="loc">Macau</span> by road. The city's harbour can accommodate vessels of up to 3,000 long tons (3,050 t). Ships ply from here to <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> directly. <span class="loc">Heshan</span> was decreed as a prefecture in <span class="date">1732</span> during the reign of the <span class="per">Yongzheng Emperor</span> in the Qing dynasty. In <span class="date">1993</span>, its administrative status was changed to a county-level city. Its name, which means 'Mount Crane', was given to it because of a mountain within its boundary that closely resembles the shape of that bird.</p><br><br>
