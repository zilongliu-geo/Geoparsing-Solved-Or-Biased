<p><span class="loc">La Union</span> (Ilocano: Probinsya ti <span class="loc">La Union</span>; <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>: Luyag na <span class="loc">La Union</span>; <span class="loc">Tagalog</span>: Probinsya ng <span class="loc">La Union</span>), is a province in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> located in the <span class="loc">Ilocos Region</span> in the island of <span class="loc">Luzon</span>. Its capital is the city of <span class="loc">San Fernando</span>. The province is bordered by <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Benguet</span> to the east, Pangasinan to the south, and to the west by the shores of the <span class="loc">South China Sea</span>. La Unión, "The Union" in Spanish, was formed in 1850 when the Spanish colonial government of Governor-General Antonio Maria Blanco merged the three southern towns of <span class="loc">Ilocos Sur</span> province, the nine northern towns of <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>, and the western towns of <span class="loc">Benguet</span> to the east (Eastern Pais del Igorotes in the <span class="loc">Cordilleras</span>). Pangasinenses were the majority in the new province because most towns had been in the <span class="loc">Province of Pangasinan</span>. On October 29, 1849, Governor General Claveria issued a "promovido" to fuse the Pangasinan-Ilokos-Cordillera areas into "<span class="loc">La Union</span>". On March 2, 1850, Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco signed the Superior Decreto of <span class="loc">La Union</span> (34th province from Cebu-1565), with Captain Toribio Ruiz de la <span class="loc">Escalera</span> as the first Gobernador Military y Politico. Isabella II of <span class="loc">Spain</span> decreed the province's creation on April 18, 1854. In 1661, Andres Malong (Pangasinan) failed to recover <span class="loc">La Union</span> from the Spaniards after the Battle of <span class="loc">Agoo</span>. In 1896, the people of <span class="loc">La Union</span> began a revolt against the Spanish, who had called <span class="loc">La Union</span> “<span class="loc">Una</span> <span class="loc">Provincia</span> <span class="loc">Modelo</span>", ed by Manuel Tinio Y Bondoc under Emilio Aguinaldo. The Americans collaborated with the Filipinos to end the Spanish.</p>
