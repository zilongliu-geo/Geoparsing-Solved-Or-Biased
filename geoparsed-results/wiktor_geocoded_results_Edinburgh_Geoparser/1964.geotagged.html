<p><span class="loc">Topa</span> is a village in Mendhar Tehsil, <span class="loc">Poonch district</span> in the Indian state of <span class="loc">Jammu</span> and <span class="loc">Kashmir</span>. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Battle of <span class="loc">Topa</span> was fought here by 5 Gorkha Rifles. <span class="loc">Topa</span> is located at 33.65°N 74.11°E﻿ / 33.65; 74.11. It has an average elevation of 1,126 metres (3,694 feet). From anti infiltration operations conducted by the battalion from 5 August 1965 onwards in <span class="loc">Rajouri</span> and <span class="loc">Mendhar Sectors</span> of <span class="loc">Jammu</span> and <span class="loc">Kashmir</span>, it was evident that many strong infiltrating columns of Pakistani Army had been sent into our territory as part of <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>’s ‘Operation Gibraltar’. By third week of August 65, Headquarter 52 Mountain Brigade (Brigadier later Lieutenant General R D Hira, MVC) had been inducted into the sector for clearance of infiltrators from <span class="loc">Mendhar</span>, <span class="loc">Surankot</span> and <span class="loc">Krishna</span> Ghati area. For the operations 4/5 GR (FF), 14 <span class="loc">Kumaon</span> and 3/11 GR were put under command of the brigade and made responsible for anti infiltration operations in Mendhar in the South and Krishna <span class="loc">Gati</span> (KG) area of 93 Infantry Brigade Sector. Reports of major infiltration in Mendhar and Balnoi had been received and some of the roads had been blocked by <span class="loc">Paki</span> troops. Closer to <span class="loc">Mendhar</span>, <span class="loc">Paki</span>'s had occupied Topa feature, which effectively dominated fair weather road Mendhar - Balnoi, thus cutting off Balnoi and Krishna <span class="loc">Ghati</span> (93 Infantry Brigade). They had also established defences at a place called OP Hill, on the ridgeline across <span class="loc">Mendhar</span> River. The first priority of the brigade was to cut off maintenance routes of these <span class="loc">Paki</span> troops and clearance of road to Balnoi and KG. Alfa Company of 21 AK Battalion Pakistan Army, with additional troops and Razakars were reported to be occupying Topa Height (Pt 4571) and had effectively interdicted road communications in the area.</p>
