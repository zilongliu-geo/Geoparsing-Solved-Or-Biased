  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Aurora</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,508 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The <span class="loc">Honey Creek</span> area, near <span class="org">Aurora</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> was originally settled by pioneers from <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, including <span class="per">James D. Hillhouse</span>, E. B. <span class="per">Hillhouse</span>, Reverend A. A. <span class="per">Young, James</span> Barrow and <span class="per">James Gibson</span>. They were later instrumental in founding <span class="org">Aurora</span>. Their descendants include actor <span class="per">Brad Pitt</span> and novelist and national security analyst <span class="per">Raelynn Hillhouse</span>. <span class="org">Aurora</span> was laid out in <span class="date">1870</span>. It was reportedly named after <span class="org">Aurora</span>, the Roman goddess of dawn. Galena ore was discovered in <span class="date">1885</span> while digging a well on the farm of <span class="per">Thomas D. Liles</span> in <span class="date">November, 1885</span>, marking the beginning of <span class="org">Aurora</span> as a mining town. Mining of surface outcrops began in <span class="date">1886</span>. Large scale commercial mining began shortly afterwards as the mines grew deeper and zinc and galena were discovered. The zinc from the <span class="org">Aurora</span> mines was of exceptional purity and high grade. By <span class="date">1893</span> 12,651 tons of zinc ore were mined and shipped from <span class="org">Aurora</span>. The mines attracted prospectors and minors. <span class="org">Aurora</span>'s population peaked at 10,000 around <span class="date">1900</span>.</p><br><br>
