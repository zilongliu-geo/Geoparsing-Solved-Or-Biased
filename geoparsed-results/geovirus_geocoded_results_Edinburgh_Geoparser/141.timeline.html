  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>In the hills of <span class="loc">Weiswampach</span>, <span class="loc">Luxembourg</span> <span class="date">yesterday</span>, the 12th International WÃ¤mper <span class="per">Triathlon</span> became the setting for the national championship Olympic distance (1,5 km swimming, 40 km cycling, 10 km running) triathlon for both <span class="loc">Belgium</span> and <span class="loc">Luxembourg</span>. The Belgian championship was scheduled to take place in <span class="loc">Vilvoorde</span>, <span class="loc">Belgium</span>, but because the concentration of Salmonella bacteria in the water was too high, the Belgians moved to <span class="loc">Luxembourg</span>. On <span class="date">Saturday</span>, an event for children and for the handicapped took place, along with the 10 kilometre running event. On <span class="date">Sunday</span>, the Juniors and the athletes for the Promotion race started the day, followed at 15:00 by the elite athletes. Even though dark clouds hung over <span class="loc">Weiswampach</span> most of the afternoon, there was only a short rain shower during the cycling course. In the men's race, <span class="per">Peter Croes</span> (<span class="loc">Belgium</span>, Atriac team) and Dirk Bockel (<span class="loc">Luxembourg</span>, Celtic Diekirck team) started together for the final 10 kilometre run, but <span class="loc">Bockel</span> managed to outrun <span class="per">Croes</span> by 23 seconds, prolonging his victory of <span class="date">last year</span>. <span class="date">Last year</span>'s winner, Stijn Goris from <span class="loc">Belgium</span> (LTTL team), came in third, followed closely by Bas Diederen from the <span class="loc">Netherlands</span>. Lander Dircken (Atariac, <span class="loc">Belgium</span>) came in fifth. In the women's race, the top two athletes remained the same as <span class="date">last year</span>; Elisabeth "Liz" <span class="date">May</span> from <span class="loc">Luxembourg</span> managed to stay ahead of a pursuing group the entire race, and finished first ahead of <span class="per">Jessica Mayon</span>. <span class="per">Mayon</span> secured the title of Belgian 1/4 <span class="per">Triathlon</span> champion, in addition to the previously won <span class="org">Sprint</span> <span class="per">Triathlon</span> and <span class="per">Long</span> Distance championships. <span class="per">Evelyn Williamson</span> from <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> finished third.</p><br><br>
