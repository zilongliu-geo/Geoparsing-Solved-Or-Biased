  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Windsor</span> (/ˈwɪnzər/), <span class="loc">Ontario</span> is the southernmost city in <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is located on the southern shore of the <span class="loc">Detroit River</span>, directly across the river from <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. <span class="loc">Windsor</span> is a major contributor to <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s automotive industry and has much to offer by means of a storied history and a diverse culture. Prior to European exploration and settlement, the <span class="loc">Windsor</span> area was inhabited by the First Nations and Native Americans. <span class="loc">Windsor</span> was settled by the French in <span class="date">1749</span> as an agricultural settlement. It is the oldest continually inhabited European settlement in <span class="loc">Canada</span> west of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>. The area was first named Petite Côte ("Little Coast" – as opposed to the longer coastline on the <span class="loc">Detroit</span> side of the river). Later it was called La Côte de Misère ("Poverty Coast") because of the sandy soils near <span class="loc">LaSalle</span>. Windsor's French Canadian heritage is reflected in many French street names, such as <span class="loc">Ouellette</span>, <span class="loc">Pelissier</span>, <span class="loc">François</span>, <span class="loc">Pierre</span>, <span class="loc">Langlois</span>, <span class="loc">Marentette</span>, and <span class="loc">Lauzon</span>. The current street system of <span class="loc">Windsor</span> (a grid with elongated blocks) reflects the Canadien method of agricultural land division, where the farms were long and narrow, fronting along the river. <span class="date">Today</span>, the north-south street name often indicates the name of the family that at one time farmed the land where the street is <span class="date">now</span> located. The street system of outlying areas is consistent with the British system for granting land concessions. There is a significant French-speaking minority in <span class="loc">Windsor</span> and the surrounding area, particularly in the <span class="loc">Lakeshore</span>, <span class="loc">Tecumseh</span> and <span class="loc">LaSalle</span> areas.</p><br><br>
