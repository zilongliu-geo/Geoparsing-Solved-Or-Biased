  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> is a neighborhood in the northwestern <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> Valley region of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The area was home to Native Americans, some of whom left caves containing rock art. <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> was explored and colonized by the Spanish beginning in the 18th Century. The land was part of a Mexican land grant in the 19th Century, and after the <span class="loc">United States</span> took over the land following the <span class="org">Mexican War</span>, it was the largest such grant in <span class="loc">California</span>. Settlement and development followed. <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> has seven public and eight private schools. There are large open-space and smaller recreational parks as well as a public library and a transportation center. Distinctive features are the former <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> Reservoir, the Santa Susana Field Laboratory and a number of private businesses. Overall, <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> has one of the lowest densities of any neighborhood in the city, and it has a relatively high income level. The <span class="date">2000</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census counted 35,073 residents in the 15.24-square-mile <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> neighborhoodâ€”or 2,301 people per square mile, among the lowest population densities for both the city and the county. In <span class="date">2008</span>, the city estimated that the population had increased to 37,102. In <span class="date">2000</span> the median age for residents was 40, considered old for city and county neighborhoods; the percentages of residents aged 35 and older were among the county's highest.</p><br><br>
