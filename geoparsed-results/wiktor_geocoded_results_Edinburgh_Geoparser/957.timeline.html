  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> is an area of <span class="loc">Wolverhampton</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> near the city centre, currently undergoing major redevelopment. It is included within the ward of <span class="loc">Heath Town</span>. Landmarks within the district include the site of <span class="loc">Wolverhampton</span> Low Level railway station, and the disused Springfield Brewery that made Springfield Bitter from <span class="date">1873</span> to <span class="date">1991</span>. The brewery first opened in <span class="date">1873</span> when the <span class="per">William Butler</span> and Company needed bigger premises than their existing site in <span class="loc">Priestfield</span>. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> had an abundance of water and the land had remained fairly undeveloped as the ground was quite marshy in places. The company acquired the seven acre site, partly bordering <span class="loc">Grimstone</span> Street and built a new brewery with maltings, cooperage and stables. Production started at <span class="loc">Springfield</span> during <span class="date">the following year</span>. With the new brewery located close to the canal and railway lines, the company could begin to trade outside of the local area. The good communications also made the acquisition of public houses in other areas a viable proposition. This opportunity was improved when the Great Western Railway extended a siding into the site which was continually expanding to cope with the success of the company. Between 1881-3 a new brewing tower was constructed, enabling <span class="per">William Butler</span> and Company to increase production from 400 to 1,500 barrels <span class="date">a week</span>. In <span class="date">1960</span> Mitchell's and Butler's acquired the company and the Cape Hill brewery kept the Springfield Brewery open. Brewing stopped around <span class="date">1990</span> and the site was used simply as distribution centre. In <span class="date">2006</span> a fire destroyed much of the site.</p><br><br>
