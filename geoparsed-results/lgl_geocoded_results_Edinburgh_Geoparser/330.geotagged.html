<p>City weighing sump pump restrictions. A measure that would prohibit sump pumps or other residences’ drains from emptying directly onto the street raised questions this morning at the Mount Pleasant City Council’s Ordinance Committee meeting. According to city administrator Brent Schleisman, the change was prompted by the problems that arose when the water freezes. “When you have a freeze in the middle of the night, and it’s warm enough in the day to warm up, you get these ice patches all over the city where you have the sump pumps dumping into the city street.” Moreover, water seeping into the streets’ foundations and then freezing can damage the roads, he said, making them more expensive to maintain.</p>
