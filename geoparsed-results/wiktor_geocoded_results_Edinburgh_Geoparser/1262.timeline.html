  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Anderson</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">Denali Borough</span>, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and the borough's only incorporated community. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census the population was 246, down from 367 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The city is named after one of the original homesteaders. <span class="per">Anderson</span> is named after <span class="per">Arthur Anderson</span>, one of several homesteaders who settled in the area in <span class="date">the late 1950s</span>. In <span class="date">1959</span>, <span class="per">Anderson</span> subdivided his homestead into house lots and sold most of the lots to civilian workers from Clear Air Force Station, a Ballistic Missile Early Warning System station completed in <span class="date">1961</span>. An elementary school was built in the community in <span class="date">1961</span>, and <span class="per">Anderson</span> incorporated as a city on <span class="date">June 2, 1962</span>. In <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, a road was completed between <span class="per">Anderson</span> and <span class="per">Nenana</span>. A ferry across the <span class="loc">Tanana River</span> at <span class="per">Nenana</span> provided access to the Fairbanksâ€“Nenana Highway, and hence to Fairbanks and the contiguous North American highway system via the <span class="loc">Richardson</span> and <span class="loc">Alaska Highways</span>. The ferry was replaced with a bridge in <span class="date">1968</span>. In <span class="date">1972</span>, the George Parks Highway was completed, which provided direct road access to points south, including Anchorage.</p><br><br>
