  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montenegro</span> is a municipality of the state of <span class="loc">Rio Grande do Sul</span>, <span class="loc">Brazil</span>; 59.000 inhabitants. The town was established in <span class="date">1847</span> to be settled primarily by German immigrants from the <span class="loc">Hunsrück region</span> of southwest <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The local language was Riograndenser Hunsrückisch for most of its history, and it is still spoken there after <span class="date">150 years</span> of the initial settlement. <span class="date">Today</span>, however, Portuguese prevails, mostly as a result of the campaign of the "Nacionalização" (Nationalization) forcefully imposed on all German and Italian settled areas of southern <span class="loc">Brazil</span> by president and dictator <span class="per">Getúlio Vargas</span> in <span class="date">the 1940s</span>. In <span class="date">1909</span> a new railway line connected <span class="loc">Montenegro</span> to São <span class="loc">Leopoldo</span>, which led to a quickening of economic development both in <span class="loc">Montenegro</span> itself and in other regional municipalities such as Maratá, Salvador do <span class="loc">Sul</span> and Barão. The railway was extended in <span class="date">1932</span> and again in <span class="date">1950</span>, but at <span class="date">the end of the 1960s</span> it was closed. It was subsequently decided to convert the former railway station into a "Cultural Center". <span class="per">Cardinal Cláudio Hummes</span>, one of the candidates to the Catholic Church papacy in <span class="date">April 2005</span>, was born in the area. On <span class="date">July 2, 2008</span>, <span class="per">Pope Benedict XVI</span> erected the new Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="loc">Montenegro</span>, making it a Suffragan See in the province of the metropolitan archdiocese of <span class="loc">Porto Alegre</span>, from whose territory it was taken.</p><br><br>
