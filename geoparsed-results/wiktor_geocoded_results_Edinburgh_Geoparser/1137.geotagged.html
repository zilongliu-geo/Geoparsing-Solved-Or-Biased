<p>Brighton is a suburb 27 km north of <span class="loc">Hobart</span>, in <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is between <span class="loc">Pontville</span> and the outer <span class="loc">Hobart</span> suburb of <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> on the Midland Highway. At the 2006 census, Brighton had a population of 3,145. From 1826 onwards, the township was the site of the Brighton Barracks, a military accommodation facility until sold off for subdivision in the early 2000s. A Brighton Post Office opened on 1 June 1832. This was renamed <span class="loc">Pontville</span> in 1895 and closed in 1973. The current Brighton office opened on 22 May 1964. More recently it was used as emergency accommodation for refugees fleeing the conflicts in eastern <span class="loc">Europe</span>, namely <span class="loc">Kosovo</span>. The area surrounding Brighton was swept with bush and grass fires over the summer of January 2003 with fires reaching Cartwright street, the old army camp and the Midland highway placing the town under extreme threat. The Brighton area expected to see an increase in light industrial use, being serviced by both road &amp; rail with the construction of the Brighton Transport Hub. The area is also the site of a major horse racing training facility located at Brighton Racecourse known as the Brighton Training Centre, serving the thoroughbred, trotting &amp; pacing industry.</p>
