<p><span class="loc">Tala</span> (Greek: Τάλα) is a large suburban village 6 km <span class="loc">north of Paphos</span>, <span class="loc">Cyprus</span>. Many non-Cypriots (mostly British) have moved here permanently or have a summer home in <span class="loc">Tala</span>. Ayios Neofytos Monastery is 1 km north. <span class="loc">Tala</span> is the ancestral village of the singer Cat Stevens. His father, Stavros Georgiou, was born here in 1900. In his book 'Historic <span class="loc">Cyprus</span>' (second edition 1947), Rupert Gunnis (at that time Inspector of Antiquities on the island) wrote: The Church of <span class="loc">St. Catherine</span> is a large and well-built edifice in the Byzantine style, with a central dome. The narthex has been added later. A year ago or so two completely unnecessary doors were pierced in the south wall. There are considerable remains of frescoes on the west wall, more especially of the Judgement, and also three heads of animals with water gushing from their mouths, representing the sources of three rivers, perhaps the <span class="loc">Jordan</span>, <span class="loc">Tigris</span>, and <span class="loc">Euphrates</span>. The Gospels and church plate are Russian. About a mile from the village are the ruins of a large church dedicated to <span class="loc">St. George</span>. Founders' tombs remain on the north and south walls, with traces of painting in their arches.</p>
