<p><span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is a town in Isle of <span class="loc">Wight County</span>, in the <span class="loc">South Hampton Roads</span> subregion of the <span class="loc">Hampton Roads</span> region of Virginia in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,089 at the 2010 census. The town is most famous for the curing and production of the <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> ham. The Virginia General Assembly passed a statute defining "Smithfield ham" by law in 1926, with one of the requirements that it be processed within the town limits. Currently, Smithfield Foods, a Fortune 500 Company that owns Smithfield Packing Company and others, is the world’s largest pork processor and hog producer. The company, based in <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>, raises 12 million and processes 20 million hogs annually. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>, first colonized in 1634, is located on the <span class="loc">Pagan River</span>, not far from <span class="loc">Jamestown</span>. The Native Americans knew this area as Warascoyak, also spelled Warrosquoyacke, meaning “point of land.” Warrosquyoake Shire (with numerous variant spellings, including <span class="loc">Warrascoyack</span>, Warrascocke and "Warwick Squeak") was officially formed in 1634 in the Virginia colony, but had already been known as "<span class="loc">Warascoyack County</span>" before this. It was renamed Isle of <span class="loc">Wight County</span> in 1637.</p>
