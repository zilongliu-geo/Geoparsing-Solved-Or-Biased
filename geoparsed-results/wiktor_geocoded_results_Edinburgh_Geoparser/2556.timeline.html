  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span>, known locally as P.G., is the capital and largest town of <span class="loc">Toledo District</span> in southern <span class="loc">Belize</span>. <span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span> is the southernmost sizable town in the nation, with a population of about 5,000 people. Although the town bears a Spanish name, its inhabitants are mostly Kriol/English-speaking, and are primarily of Garifuna, East Indian, Kriol, and Maya descent. <span class="per">St. Peter</span> <span class="org">Claver Catholic</span> parish, with a large elementary school, serves the predominantly Catholic population of the town. <span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span> is a seaport and fishing town on the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span>. It was a small fishing village before it was settled by a number of Garifuna emigrants from <span class="loc">Honduras</span> in <span class="date">1823</span>. The Garifuna refer to the town as Peini. The town is about fifteen feet above sea level. <span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span> is the main point of transportation for people visiting the <span class="loc">Toledo district</span> and the offshore southern cayes. There is a small airport which serves domestic flights from Maya Island Air and Tropic Air. James Bus Line is based in <span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span> and offers a regular service to points north such as Independence, <span class="loc">Dangriga</span>, <span class="loc">Belmopan</span>, and <span class="loc">Belize City</span>. Water taxis offer daily crossings to <span class="loc">Puerto Barrios</span> and twice weekly service to <span class="loc">Livingston</span> in <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>. Unlike the purpose-built water taxis plying the routes between <span class="loc">Belize city</span> and the northern cays, the services from <span class="loc">Punta Gorda</span> are provided by small, open boats.</p><br><br>
