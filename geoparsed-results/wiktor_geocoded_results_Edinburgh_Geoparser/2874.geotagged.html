<p><span class="loc">Burbank</span> is a small farming unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Millard County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, located just east of the Nevada border. It is located in the southern part of Snake Valley, near the opening (northern border) of <span class="loc">Hamlin</span> Valley. It was founded as a Mormon farming community in the 1870s, with an early post office located at the <span class="loc">Dearden</span> Ranch. It was named after Margie Burbank Clay, the wife of local Judge E. W. Clay. Clay was used as the name of the major spring that was first used by the settlers. This spring is the main source of water for <span class="loc">Pruess Lake</span>, to the north. Outlaws, cattle rustlers, and uncertainty over the local water sources caused the abandonment of the community, with the exception of the <span class="loc">Dearden</span> Ranch. The <span class="loc">Dearden</span> Ranch was started in 1886 and has been home to the <span class="loc">Dearden</span> family ever since. The local springs that flow into <span class="loc">Lake Creek</span> have been informally named after the ranch, but are not named on maps or other documents, with the exception of water rights documents, which do name it <span class="loc">Dearden</span> Springs.</p>
