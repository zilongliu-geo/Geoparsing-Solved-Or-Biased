<p><span class="loc">Los Alamos</span> (Spanish for "the poplars" or "the aspens") is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa <span class="loc">Barbara County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Although located in the <span class="loc">Los Alamos</span> Valley, the town of <span class="loc">Los Alamos</span> is usually considered to be a part of the <span class="loc">Santa Ynez</span> Valley community. <span class="loc">Los Alamos</span> is also connected to other cities Vandenberg AFB, <span class="loc">Lompoc</span>, <span class="loc">Buellton</span> and other Santa <span class="loc">Barbara County</span> cities. The population was 1,890 at the 2010 census, up from 1,372 at the 2000 census. In 1839, José Antonio de la <span class="loc">Guerra</span>, a son of José de la Guerra y Noriega received the <span class="loc">Rancho</span> <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Alamos</span> Mexican land grant. The hills above <span class="loc">Rancho Los Alamos</span> served as a hideout for bandito, Salomon Pico, whose escapades were popularized by the character "Zorro." During the <span class="loc">USA</span>'s centennial year of 1876, Thomas Bell along with his nephew John S. Bell, and Dr. James B. Shaw (all from <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>), purchased acreage from <span class="loc">Rancho Los Alamos</span> and neighboring <span class="loc">Rancho</span> <span class="loc">La</span> <span class="loc">Laguna</span>. Both families allocated a half square mile from each of their new ranches to create the <span class="loc">Los Alamos</span> town site with "Centennial Street" as the central thoroughfare.</p>
