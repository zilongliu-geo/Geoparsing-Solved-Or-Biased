<p>Chandler is a city in <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and is a prominent suburb of the Phoenix, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).

In 1891, Dr. Alexander John Chandler, the first veterinary surgeon in <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Territory, settled on a ranch south of Mesa, studying irrigation engineering. By 1900, he had acquired 18,000 acres (73 km2) of land, and began drawing up plans for a townsite on what was then known as the Chandler Ranch. The townsite office opened on May 17, 1912, the same year that Chandler High School was established. The townsite was bounded by <span class="loc">Galveston</span> Street on the north, Frye Road on the south, <span class="loc">Hartford</span> Street on the west, &amp; Hamilton Street on the east. By 1913, a town center had become established, featuring the Hotel <span class="loc">San Marcos</span>, the first golf resort in the state.</p>
