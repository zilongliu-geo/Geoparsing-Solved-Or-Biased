  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Not to be confused with Barclay-Kingston, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> or <span class="loc">Kingston Estates</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. Kingston is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) along the border of <span class="loc">South Brunswick Township</span> in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span> and <span class="org">Franklin</span> Township in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, in <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the CDP's population was 1,493, of which 1,222 were in <span class="loc">South Brunswick Township</span> and 271 in <span class="org">Franklin</span> Township. The <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> State Planning Commission created the Kingston Village Advisory Committee to address issues related to this distinct area. Both <span class="loc">South Brunswick</span> and <span class="org">Franklin</span> appoint members to the committee, which holds an annual meeting to discuss issues pertinent to the Kingston area. Kingston is located in five historic districts and is part of the <span class="loc">Millstone River</span> Valley Scenic Byway. The <span class="loc">Delaware and Raritan Canal</span> and Rockingham State Historic Site are a short distance away. Jediah Higgins purchased 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) from the Native Americans in the early 18th century and the town of Kingston was established. Kingston's location on the <span class="loc">Lenape Assunpink</span> Trail where it crossed the <span class="loc">Millstone River</span> and later becoming part of the King's Highway was the prime factor in its early prominence.</p><br><br>
