  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Verdun</span> (/vɛrˈdʌn, vɜːr-/; French pronunciation: ​[vɛʁ.dœ̃]; medieval German: <span class="loc">Wirten</span>, official name before <span class="date">1970</span> Verdun-sur-Meuse) is a small city in the Meuse department in <span class="loc">Lorraine</span> in north-eastern <span class="loc">France</span>. It is a sub-prefecture (arrondissement) of the department. <span class="loc">Verdun</span> is the biggest city in <span class="loc">Meuse</span>, although the capital of the department is the slightly smaller <span class="loc">city of Bar-le-Duc</span>. <span class="loc">Verdun</span> (Latin: Verodunum, meaning "strong fort") was founded by the Gauls (as its Celtic name shows; "Dunum" is the Latinized version of a Celtic word meaning oppidum). It has been the seat of the bishop of <span class="loc">Verdun</span> since the <span class="date">4th century AD</span>, with interruptions. In the Treaty of <span class="loc">Verdun</span> in AD 843, the empire of <span class="loc">Charlemagne</span> was divided into three parts. The city has been famous for Dragées or sugared almonds from 1200 onwards; they were distributed at the baptism of French princes. <span class="loc">Verdun</span> was part of the middle kingdom of <span class="loc">Lotharingia</span>, and in <span class="date">1374</span> it became an <span class="org">Imperial Free City of the Holy Roman Empire</span>. The Bishopric of <span class="loc">Verdun</span> formed together with <span class="loc">Tull</span> (<span class="loc">Toul</span>) and <span class="org">Metz</span> the Three Bishoprics, which were annexed by <span class="loc">France</span> in <span class="date">1552</span> (recognized in <span class="date">1648</span> by the Peace of <span class="loc">Westphalia</span>).</p><br><br>
