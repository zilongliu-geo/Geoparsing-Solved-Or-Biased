<p>Salina (/səˈlaɪnə/ sə-LY-nə) is a city in <span class="loc">Sevier County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,393 at the 2000 census. The first permanent settlers (about 30 families) moved into the area in 1864 at the direction of leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They found abundant salt deposits nearby so they named the area "Salina". In 1866 troubles with Indians who used the area as their hunting ground (the Black Hawk War (<span class="loc">Utah</span>)) forced the white settlers to retreat to the Manti area. They returned to Salina in 1871, organized a militia, and constructed a fort and buildings for a school and a church. At that time they discovered coal deposits in "almost inexhaustible quantities" in the canyon east of the settlement. A creek north of the settlement was tapped to provide water for irrigation, domestic purposes, and to power various enterprises such as sawmills, grist mills, salt refineries and generation of electricity. The <span class="loc">Sevier River</span> was tapped in 1874, and by 1908 the area west of the settlement was being fully cultivated.</p>
