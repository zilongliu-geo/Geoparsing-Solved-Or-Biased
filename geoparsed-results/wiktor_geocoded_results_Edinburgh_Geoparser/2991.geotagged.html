<p><span class="loc">Acton</span> is a small community located in the southeast corner of <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, and has been included into the <span class="loc">city of Indianapolis</span>. The community was named for an early settler, General Acton. The community's former name was <span class="loc">Farmersville</span>. The town was renamed in 1854 when the U.S. Postal Service discovered there was already a town named <span class="loc">Farmersville</span> in <span class="loc">Posey County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. <span class="loc">Acton</span> was once a busy town as it had a blacksmith shop, a drug store, a bank, a telephone exchange, two grocery stores, a train depot, a pool hall, a post office, a school, three churches, three gas stations, a Ford and tractor dealership, and even two grain elevators. One of the grocery stores was in the Knights Of Pythias building that sat on Exchange Street next to the railroad tracks. It was destroyed by fire in 1962. A new building which currently houses the Dinner Bell market was built in 1963. The second grocery store is no longer in use, but is still standing at the corner of <span class="loc">Swails</span> Street and McGregor Road.</p>
