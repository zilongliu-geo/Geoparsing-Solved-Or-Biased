<p><span class="loc">Swansea</span> is a ghost town in La <span class="loc">Paz County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. It was settled around 1909 in what was then the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Territory. It served as a mining town as well as a location for processing and smelting the copper ore taken from the nearby mines. Prospecting and mining in the area first began around 1862, but the remote location and lack of transportation kept activity to a minimum. By 1904, the railroad was coming to nearby Parker, and local miners Newton Evans and Thomas Jefferson Carrigan saw an opportunity to develop the area. Within a few years, the two miners had built a 350-ton furnace, a water pipeline to the <span class="loc">Bill Williams River</span>, and hoists for five mine shafts. They called the new town Signal (not to be confused with the other <span class="loc">Arizona</span> ghost town of Signal). By 1908, the claims in the area had been consolidated by the Clara Gold and Copper Mining Company, which set up its headquarters in the mining camp that would become <span class="loc">Swansea</span>. That same year, what was to become the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> and <span class="loc">Swansea Railroad</span> connected Signal to <span class="loc">Bouse</span> some 25 miles (40 km) away. These two factors spurred the growth of the town, and its population quickly grew to about 300 residents.</p>
