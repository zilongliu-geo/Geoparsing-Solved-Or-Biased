  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salisbury</span> /ˈsɔːlzbəri/ is a northern suburb in <span class="loc">Adelaide</span>, <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is the seat of the <span class="loc">City of Salisbury</span>, and in the South <span class="org">Australian Legislative Assembly</span> electoral <span class="loc">district of Ramsay</span> and <span class="org">the Australian House of Representatives</span> divisions of <span class="loc">Wakefield</span> and <span class="loc">Port Adelaide</span>. The suburb is a service area for the <span class="loc">City of Salisbury</span> district, with an abundance of parklands, shops, cafes and restaurants. <span class="org">Parabanks Shopping Centre</span> is also located in <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, which includes <span class="loc">Harris</span> <span class="per">Scarfe</span> and <span class="per">Big</span> W as its signature retailers. The <span class="loc">City of Salisbury</span> is situated 25 kilometres north of <span class="loc">Adelaide</span>. It covers 161 square kilometres stretching from the beaches at Gulf <span class="loc">St Vincent</span> to the <span class="loc">Adelaide</span> Hills. The terrain is mostly flat with the <span class="loc">Little Para River</span> winding its way through the district to the sea. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, and the surrounding northern suburbs are perceived to have a relatively high crime rate. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> was founded when <span class="per">John Harvey</span> began selling town allotments in <span class="date">1848</span>, from land he had purchased along the <span class="loc">Little Para River</span> in <span class="date">the previous year</span>. The town was named after <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> which was close to his wife's hometown. There is a <span class="loc">Wiltshire Street</span> near <span class="loc">Park Terrace</span> in the city centre, parallel to <span class="per">John Street</span>. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> started its life as a service centre for the surrounding wheat and hay farms. <span class="org">Salisbury Post Office</span> opened around <span class="date">March 1850</span>. It grew slowly (from a population of 400-500 in <span class="date">1881</span>) until <span class="date">1940</span> when the establishment of an explosives and filling factory doubled the population almost overnight. The factory, which covered 4.5 square miles, was in production by <span class="date">mid 1942</span> and by <span class="date">January 1943</span> employed 6,500 persons producing 135,000 shells, bombs and mines weekly.</p><br><br>
