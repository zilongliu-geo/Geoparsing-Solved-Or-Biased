<p><span class="loc">Camden</span> is not a town in <span class="loc">Texas</span>. unincorporated community in east central <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located at the junction of Farm to Market Roads 942 and 62, eighty miles northwest of <span class="loc">Beaumont</span>. As of the year 2000, the community had approximately 1,200 residents. The Corrigan-Camden Independent School District serves area students. <span class="loc">Camden</span> <span class="loc">Texas</span> was a company town begun by the W. T. Carter &amp; Brother lumber company in the early 1900s. Virtually all the housing was built by the company and was rented by the company to its employees. After the sale of the company to Champion Paper in the late 1960s, all the public buildings and housing except those owned by Carter Heirs were sold and moved. The Camden School District was merged into the Corrigan School District with a new name of Corrigan-Camden School District. By the early 1970s all that was left was a post office, Champion company offices and a few vacation homes owned by Carters and DeWalch's. There is a theory that some early Carters were familiar with <span class="loc">Camden</span> <span class="loc">Maine</span> and that is the origin of the name <span class="loc">Camden</span> <span class="loc">Texas</span>.</p>
