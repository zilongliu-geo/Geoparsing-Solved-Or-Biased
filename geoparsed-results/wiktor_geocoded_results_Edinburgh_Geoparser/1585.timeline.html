  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wawa</span> is a township in the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Ontario</span>, located within the <span class="loc">Algoma District</span> and associated with <span class="loc">Wawa Lake</span>. Formerly known as the township of <span class="loc">Michipicoten</span>, after a nearby river of that name, the township was officially renamed in <span class="date">2007</span> for its largest and best-known community of <span class="loc">Wawa</span>. This area was first developed for fur trading. In the late 19th century, both gold and iron ore were found and mined, leading to the region's rise as the steel industry developed in Sault Ste. Marie, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. From <span class="date">1900</span>-<span class="date">1918</span> the Helen Mine had the highest production of iron ore of any mine in <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The township includes the smaller communities of <span class="loc">Michipicoten</span> and <span class="loc">Michipicoten River</span>, which are small port settlements on the shore of <span class="loc">Lake Superior</span>. These names are derived from the Ojibwe term for the river. Wawa's history is rich in mining, forestry, and the fur trade. Although mining attempts began as early as the late 1660s, it was not until <span class="date">1896</span> that gold was discovered along nearby <span class="loc">Wawa Lake</span>. The population quickly grew from only a handful of people to approximately a thousand.</p><br><br>
