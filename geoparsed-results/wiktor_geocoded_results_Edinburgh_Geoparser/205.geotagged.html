<p><span class="loc">San Felipe</span> is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Zambales</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 Philippine census, it has a population of 22,020 people. Much of the population are Ilocanos, descendants of migrants from Ilocos. The town was affected by the 1991 <span class="loc">Mount Pinatubo</span> eruption, being buried in about a meter in volcanic ash but damage was comparatively light. <span class="loc">San Felipe</span> was one among the little villages along the coastal region of <span class="loc">Zambales</span> during the pre-Spanish period. The first inhabitants were the Malay Zambas who lived in lowland which they themselves called <span class="loc">Hindol</span>. There were also Negritoes but most of them lived in mountains. A few years after the discovery of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, all places in the country had been explored by the Spanish authorities and the exploration of <span class="loc">Zambales</span> began in 1572 by Juan de Salcedo, grandson of <span class="loc">Miguel Lopez</span> de <span class="loc">Legaspi</span>, first Spanish Governor General of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. Juan de Salcedo and Spanish followers made a survey of its coastal region and organize communities which were first called encomiendas but which were later called pueblos. As the population of the villages increased which was caused by the steady immigration of Ilocanos from the <span class="loc">Ilocandia region</span> before 1800 until 1860, more pueblos were organized.</p>
