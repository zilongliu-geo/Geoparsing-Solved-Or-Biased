<p>Eureka (Hupa: do'-wi-lotl-ding' <span class="loc">Karuk</span>: uuth) is the principal city and county seat of <span class="loc">Humboldt County</span> in the Redwood Empire region of <span class="loc">California</span>. The city is located on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 101 on the shores of <span class="loc">Humboldt Bay</span>, 270 miles (430 km) north of <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and 100 miles (160 km) south of the Oregon border. At the 2010 census, the population of the city was 27,191, and the population of Greater Eureka was 45,034. Eureka is the largest coastal city between <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="loc">Portland</span>, and the westernmost city of more than 25,000 residents in the 48 contiguous states. It is the regional center for government, health care, trade, and the arts on the <span class="loc">North Coast</span> north of the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> Bay Area. Greater Eureka, one of California's major commercial fishing ports, is the location of the largest deep-water port between <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="loc">Coos Bay</span>, a stretch of about 500 miles (800 km). The headquarters of both the <span class="loc">Six Rivers National Forest</span> and the <span class="loc">North Coast</span> Redwoods District of the California State Parks System are in Eureka. As entrep√¥t for hundreds of lumber mills that once existed in the area, the city played a leading role in the historic West Coast lumber trade. The entire city is a state historic landmark, which has hundreds of significant Victorian homes, including the nationally-recognized <span class="loc">Carson Mansion</span>, and the city has retained its original 19th-century commercial core as a nationally recognized Old Town Historic District. Eureka is home to California's oldest zoo, the Sequoia Park Zoo.</p>
