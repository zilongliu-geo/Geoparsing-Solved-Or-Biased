  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Labuan</span> (/ləˈbuːən/) is a federal territory of <span class="loc">Malaysia</span> off the coast of <span class="loc">Borneo</span> in <span class="loc">East Malaysia</span>. It is made up of the homonymous <span class="loc">Labuan</span> Island and six smaller islands, and is located off the coast of the state of <span class="loc">Sabah</span>. <span class="loc">Labuan</span>'s capital is Victoria and is best known as an offshore financial centre offering international financial and business services via <span class="loc">Labuan</span> IBFC since <span class="date">1990</span> as well as being an offshore support hub for deepwater oil and gas activities in the region. It is also a tourist destination for people travelling through <span class="loc">Sabah</span>, nearby Bruneians and scuba divers. The name <span class="loc">Labuan</span> derives from the Malay word labuhan which means harbour. Since the 15th century, the north and west coast of <span class="loc">Borneo</span> including the island of <span class="loc">Labuan</span> was part of the Bruneian Empire. In the 18th century, <span class="loc">Labuan</span> attracted British interest. <span class="per">James Brooke</span> acquired the island for <span class="loc">Britain</span> in <span class="date">1846</span> through a treaty with the Sultan of <span class="loc">Brunei</span>, <span class="per">Omar Ali Saifuddin II</span> on <span class="date">18 December 1846</span>. A British naval officer, <span class="per">Rodney Mundy</span>, visited <span class="loc">Brunei</span> with his ship HMS Iris to keep the Sultan in line until the British Government made a final decision to take the island and he took Pengiran Mumin to witness the island's accession to the British <span class="org">Crown</span> on <span class="date">24 December 1846</span>. Some sources state that during the signing of the treaty, the Sultan had been threatened by a British navy warship ready to fire on the Sultan's palace if he refused to sign the treaty while another source says the island was ceded to <span class="loc">Britain</span> as a reward for assistance in combating pirates.</p><br><br>
