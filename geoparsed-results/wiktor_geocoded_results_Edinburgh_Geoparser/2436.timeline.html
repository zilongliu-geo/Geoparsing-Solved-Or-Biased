  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Orange County</span> is located in southern <span class="loc">Indiana</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of <span class="date">2010</span>, its population was 19,840, an increase of 2.8% from 19,306 in <span class="date">2000</span>. The county seat is <span class="loc">Paoli</span>. The county has four incorporated settlements with a total population of about 8,600, as well as several small unincorporated communities. It is divided into 10 townships which provide local services. One <span class="loc">U.S.</span> route and five <span class="loc">Indiana</span> state roads pass through or into the county. <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was formed from parts of <span class="loc">Knox County</span>, <span class="loc">Gibson County</span> and <span class="loc">Washington County</span> by an act approved on <span class="date">December 26, 1815</span>; it took effect on <span class="date">February 1, 1816</span>. The same year, the county seat was established in <span class="loc">Paoli</span>, which was named after Pasquale Paoli Ash, the 12-year-old son of the Governor, at the time, of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> . The first courthouse was a temporary log structure that was built for $25; a more permanent structure of stone was completed in <span class="date">1819</span> at a cost of $3,950.  In <span class="date">1847</span>, plans were made for a new larger courthouse, which was completed in <span class="date">1850</span> at a cost of $14,000. This building is the second oldest courthouse in the state that has been continuously used since its construction. Like the oldest in <span class="loc">Ohio County</span>, it is a Greek Revival building with two stories and a Doric portico supported by fluted columns; it has ornamental iron stairs and a clock tower. In <span class="date">1970</span>, the clock tower was damaged by fire.</p><br><br>
