In <span class="date">1796</span> <span class="per">Jean Pierre</span> <span class="loc">Chouteau</span>, a French trader from <span class="per">St. Louis</span>, established the first trading post in <span class="date">1796</span> at the junction of the Grand/<span class="loc">Neosho River</span> and <span class="loc">Saline Creek</span> for business with the <span class="loc">Osage</span>. Remembered <span class="date">today</span> as one of the first permanent "white" (European-American) settlements in present-day <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, at that time the area was part of the <span class="loc">Province of Louisiana</span>. The <span class="loc">United States</span> took possession of the land that included Salina with the Louisiana Purchase in <span class="date">1803</span>.</p><br><br>
