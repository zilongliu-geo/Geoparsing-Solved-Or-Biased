It was originally founded as La <span class="loc">Villa Rica</span> de Arévalo by a Spanish official who built his mansion along the coastal settlement in the 16th century. It was absorbed by <span class="loc">Iloílo City</span> during the 20th century along with the towns of <span class="loc">Mandurriao</span>, <span class="loc">La Paz</span>, <span class="loc">Molo</span> and the <span class="loc">city of Jaro</span>. Its church possesses the third oldest Santo Niño (Infant Jesus) figurines in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. <span class="per">Arevalo</span> is sometimes given the title "Flower Capital of <span class="loc">Iloilo</span>",where potted plants, flowers, bouquets, wreaths can be bought. <span class="per">Arevalo</span> is also famous for its firecrackers and fireworks. Its prominent attraction is the Villa Beach along the coast which boasts several resorts and an outdoor nightlife such as open air restaurants and bars. Established on <span class="date">1581</span> by Gobernador Ronquillo de Peñalosa as "La <span class="loc">Villa Rica</span> <span class="per">de Arevalo</span>", named after his hometown Arévalo, <span class="loc">Spain</span>, it is one of the first places in the Philippine archipelago to be named in Spanish. It became the capital of the settlement in the province on <span class="date">1582</span>. It was invaded by the British in <span class="date">1588</span> and followed by more raids by <span class="loc">Moros</span> in <span class="date">1600</span> and by the Dutch in <span class="date">1609</span>, <span class="date">1614</span> and <span class="date">1616</span>. The continuous raids forced the capital to be relocated near the mouth of <span class="loc">Iloilo River</span>, which is the current location of <span class="loc">Iloilo City</span> Proper. It was incorporated as a district of <span class="loc">Iloilo City</span> on <span class="date">July 16, 1937</span>.</p><br><br>
