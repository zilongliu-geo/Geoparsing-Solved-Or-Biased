<p><span class="loc">Angola</span> /æŋˈɡoʊlə/, officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Angola</span> (Portuguese: República de <span class="loc">Angola</span> pronounced: [ɐ̃ˈɡɔlɐ]; <span class="loc">Kikongo</span>, <span class="loc">Kimbundu</span> and Umbundu: Repubilika ya <span class="loc">Ngola</span>), is a country in Southern <span class="loc">Africa</span>. It is the seventh-largest country in <span class="loc">Africa</span>, and is bordered by <span class="loc">Namibia</span> to the south, the <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Zambia</span> to the east, and the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> to west. The exclave <span class="loc">province of Cabinda</span> has borders with the <span class="loc">Republic of the Congo</span> and the <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>. The capital and largest city is <span class="loc">Luanda</span>. Although its territory has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era, modern <span class="loc">Angola</span> originates in Portuguese colonization, which began with, and was for centuries limited to, coastal settlements and trading posts established from the 16th century onwards. In the 19th century, European settlers slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. As a Portuguese colony, <span class="loc">Angola</span> did not encompass its present borders until the early 20th century, following resistance by groups such as the <span class="loc">Cuamato</span>, the <span class="loc">Kwanyama</span> and the <span class="loc">Mbunda</span>. Independence was achieved in 1975 after the protracted liberation war. That same year, <span class="loc">Angola</span> descended into an intense civil war that lasted until 2002. It has since become a relatively stable unitary presidential republic.</p>
