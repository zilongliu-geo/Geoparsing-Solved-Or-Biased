  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Health authorities from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the government of <span class="loc">Angola</span> have revealed that bromide poisoning may be the source of a mystery illness first reported in <span class="date">early October</span>. The outbreak of over 400 reported cases of a neurological disorder was centred in the <span class="loc">Cacuaco district</span> of <span class="loc">Angola</span>'s capital city <span class="loc">Luanda</span>. A majority of the afflicted have been children under the age of 15. There have been no deaths attributed directly to the disorder. According to a statement in the state-run AngolaPress, symptoms have included "sleepiness, blear-eyedness, dizziness and difficulty to speak, walk and extreme tiredness." WHO described the drowsiness as being so severe that the patient would require "painful stimuli" to be awoken. Results from laboratory tests carried out in <span class="loc">London</span> and <span class="loc">Munich</span> indicated elevated levels of bromide present in the blood and kitchen salt samples examined. It is suspected that sodium chloride (table salt) may have been contaminated with sodium bromide, an agent used in pharmaceuticals and industry. However, authorities caution that more investigation is required to determine the source and cause of the illness. Consequently, further testing of blood, food and water has been initiated. On <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, WHO dispatched additional technical and support personnel to <span class="loc">Angola</span> to assist local health officials.</p><br><br>
