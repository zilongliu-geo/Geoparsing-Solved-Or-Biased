  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cairo</span> (generally pronounced /ˈkɛroʊ/ CARE-o by natives, and /ˈkeɪroʊ/ KAY-ro by others) is the southernmost city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, and is the county seat of <span class="loc">Alexander County</span>. <span class="loc">Cairo</span> is located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Rivers</span>. The rivers converge at Fort Defiance State Park, a Civil War fort that was commanded by General <span class="per">Ulysses S. Grant</span>. <span class="loc">Cairo</span> has the lowest elevation of any location within <span class="loc">Illinois</span> and is the only city in the state surrounded by levees. This part of <span class="loc">Illinois</span> is known as <span class="loc">Little Egypt</span>. Several blocks in the town comprise the <span class="loc">Cairo</span> Historic District, listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> (NRHP). The Old Customs House is also on the NRHP. The city is part of the <span class="loc">Cape Girardeau</span>−Jackson, <span class="loc">MO-IL Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population at the <span class="date">2010</span> census was 2,831, a significant decline from its peak population of 15,203 in <span class="date">1920</span>. The entire city was evacuated during the <span class="date">2011</span> <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River Floods, after the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> rose above the <span class="date">1937</span> flood levels, out of fear of a 15-foot wall of water inundating the city. The United States Army Corps of Engineers breached levees in the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> flood zone below <span class="loc">Cairo</span> in <span class="loc">Missouri</span> in order to save the areas above the breach along both the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> rivers.</p><br><br>
