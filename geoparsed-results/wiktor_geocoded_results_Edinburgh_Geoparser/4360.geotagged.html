<p><span class="loc">Kelso</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Bathurst</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, in the Bathurst Regional Council area. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> was the original European settlement in the area. In 1816, the initial settlement of <span class="loc">Bathurst</span> was established on the eastern banks of the <span class="loc">Macquarie River</span>, in current-day <span class="loc">Kelso</span>. The first ten farmers in <span class="loc">Kelso</span> were each given 50 acres (20 ha); five were newborn colonials and five were immigrants. Holy Trinity Church was the first inland church in <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It was built in 1835 to serve the <span class="loc">Anglican parish</span> of <span class="loc">Kelso</span>. It was the first Australian church consecrated by a bishop. The church has a close association with early settlement west of the Great Dividing Range. The church is surrounded by an historical cemetery, which contains many of the Kelso/<span class="loc">Bathurst district</span>'s pioneers. Opening in 1976 and formally known as Kelso High School, the Kelso High Campus makes up the Denison College of Secondary Education along with <span class="loc">Bathurst</span> High Campus. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> previously had a railway station on the Main Western line. It opened on 4 February 1875 and was closed on 6 April 1975. It is now served by coach services.</p>
