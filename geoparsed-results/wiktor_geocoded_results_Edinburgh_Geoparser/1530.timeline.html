  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Valencia</span> is a fourth income class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Bohol</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 27,586. In the <span class="date">2013</span> election, it had 15,377 registered voters. It is on the southern coast of <span class="loc">Bohol</span>, 42 kilometres (26 mi) from <span class="loc">Tagbilaran</span>. There are elementary schools in the poblacion and in the barrios. For their secondary education, students go to <span class="org">Valencia High School</span>, a public school. <span class="loc">Valencia</span> is the birthplace of former Executive Secretary <span class="per">Juan Pajo</span>. <span class="loc">Valencia</span> comprises 35 barangays. Its former name used to be <span class="loc">Panangatan</span>, which comes from the root word sang-at, meaning "to put up on an elevated place". This referred to the practice of fishermen from <span class="per">Dimiao</span> and <span class="per">Lila</span> who would put up (sang-at) their boats on the banks of the <span class="loc">Panangatan</span> River when taking shelter during the south-west monsoons. Here nipa palms grew along the river, preventing the boats from being washed away by the waves. <span class="loc">Panangatan</span> remained part of <span class="per">Dimiao</span> until <span class="date">1867</span>. <span class="date">That year</span> a Spanish priest was assigned to the place and it became a separate municipality. The priest gave it a new name, naming after his birthplace in <span class="loc">Spain</span>. In <span class="date">1879</span> <span class="loc">Valencia</span> had a population of 7,009.</p><br><br>
