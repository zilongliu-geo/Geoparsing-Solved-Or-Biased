<p>Jackson is a city located along Interstate 94 in the south central area of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, about 40 miles (64 km) west of Ann Arbor and 35 miles (56 km) south of <span class="loc">Lansing</span>. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 33,534. It is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Jackson Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which includes <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> and has a population of 160,248. It was founded in 1829 and named after President Andrew Jackson. On July 3, 1829, Horace Blackman, accompanied by Alexander Laverty, a land surveyor, and an Indian guide forded the <span class="loc">Grand River</span> and made camp for the night at what is now Trail and N. Jackson Street. They arrived in Jackson on a well-traveled Indian trail leading west from Ann Arbor. <span class="loc">Blackman</span> hired Laverty and Pewytum to guide him west. <span class="loc">Blackman</span> returned to Ann Arbor and then <span class="loc">Monroe</span> and registered his claim for 160 acres (65 ha) at two dollars an acre. <span class="loc">Blackman</span> returned to Jackson in August 1829, with his brother Russell. Together they cleared land and built a cabin on the corner of what would become <span class="loc">Ingham</span> and Trail streets. The town was first called Jacksonopolis. Later, it was renamed <span class="loc">Jacksonburgh</span>. Finally, in 1838 the town's name was changed to simply Jackson.</p>
