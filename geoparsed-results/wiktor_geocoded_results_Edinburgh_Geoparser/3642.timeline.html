  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rio Verde</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a master planned community. The population was 1,811 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The area surrounding the <span class="loc">Rio Verde</span> community, northeast of <span class="loc">Scottsdale</span>, was settled by small farmers in the 1880s, who grew hay and alfalfa to provide for the nearby Fort McDowell <span class="org">US Army</span> camp (<span class="date">1865</span>-<span class="date">1890</span>) (<span class="date">now</span> the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation). In the late 1890s, <span class="per">William W. Moore</span> acquired several of the small farm plots on the <span class="loc">Verde River</span>, combining them into what became the Box Bar Ranch. After his death in <span class="date">1929</span>, <span class="per">Moore</span>'s sons, Glen and <span class="per">Lin Moore</span>, operated the Box Bar as a partnership, under the name "<span class="org">Moore Bros Cattle Co.</span>", with grazing leases both east and west of the <span class="loc">Verde River</span>. <span class="per">Lin Moore</span> also ran the X2 Ranch, known as "<span class="per">Moore</span>'s Well", 12 miles (19 km) to the west, where he and his wife, <span class="per">Ada Lucille</span>, had homesteaded in <span class="date">the 1920s</span>. <span class="per">William Moore</span>'s father, Ransom <span class="per">B. Moore</span>, had emigrated to <span class="loc">Arizona</span> from <span class="loc">California</span> in <span class="date">1883</span> and ranched for <span class="date">many years</span> on the Reno Ranch, just west of the community of Punkin <span class="loc">Center</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. <span class="per">Ransom Moore</span>, founder of what is <span class="date">now</span> Banning, <span class="loc">California</span>, also served as <span class="loc">Gila County</span>'s delegate to the 16th <span class="org">Arizona Territorial Legislative Assembly</span> in <span class="date">1891</span>.</p><br><br>
