  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Aurora</span> (<span class="date">2011</span> population 53,203) is an affluent town in <span class="loc">York Region</span> in the <span class="org">Greater Toronto Area</span>, within the <span class="loc">Golden Horseshoe</span> of Southern <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. It is located north of the town of <span class="loc">Richmond Hill</span> and is partially situated on the Oak Ridges Moraine. In the <span class="loc">Canada</span> <span class="date">2011</span> Census, the municipal population of <span class="org">Aurora</span> was the 95th largest in <span class="loc">Canada</span>, compared to 97th for the <span class="date">2006</span> Census. Many <span class="org">Aurora</span> residents commute to <span class="loc">Toronto</span> and surrounding communities. Lieutenant-Governor <span class="per">John Graves Simcoe</span> gave the order for <span class="loc">Yonge</span> Street to be extended to <span class="loc">Holland</span> Landing in <span class="date">1793</span>, and the way was paved for the establishment of a community where <span class="org">Aurora</span> <span class="date">now</span> stands. In <span class="date">1795</span>, the first house in <span class="org">Aurora</span> was built at <span class="per">Yonge</span> <span class="per">St</span> and <span class="per">Catherine</span> Av. In <span class="date">1804</span>, <span class="per">Richard Machell</span> became the first merchant at the cross roads of <span class="per">Yonge</span> and <span class="per">Wellington</span> and the hamlet soon became known as <span class="per">Machell</span>'s Corners. <span class="per">Charles Doan</span> was another early businessman at <span class="per">Machell</span>'s Corners and became the first postmaster and later the first reeve. As postmaster, he was influential in renaming the village <span class="org">Aurora</span>. With the coming of the railway in <span class="date">1853</span>, <span class="org">Aurora</span> emerged as an important centre north of <span class="loc">Toronto</span>. The Fleury plough works was established soon after and <span class="org">Aurora</span> was on its way to becoming a flourishing industrial town.</p><br><br>
