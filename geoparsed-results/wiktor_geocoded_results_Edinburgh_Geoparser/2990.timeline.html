  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Acton</span> is a local government community, the lowest tier of local government, part of the <span class="loc">Wrexham County</span> Borough in <span class="loc">Wales</span>. It lies in the north-eastern part of the market town of <span class="loc">Wrexham</span>. The area is largely residential and at its centre, lies <span class="loc">Acton</span> Park, the location of the former <span class="loc">Acton Hall</span>. <span class="loc">Acton</span> was originally one of the townships of the <span class="loc">parish of Wrexham</span> (in <span class="date">1886</span>, the township was transferred to the new ecclesiastical <span class="loc">parish of Rhosddu</span>). Under the civil administration, the civil <span class="loc">parish of Acton</span>, based on the old township's boundaries, was part of the <span class="loc">Wrexham Rural</span> District, but was abolished in <span class="date">1935</span> and parts were transferred to the civil <span class="loc">parishes of Bieston and Wrexham Regis</span>. All the latter structures were abolished under the terms of the Local Government Act <span class="date">1972</span>. In <span class="date">1985</span>, a Boundary Commission review led to the creation of four new community areas within <span class="loc">Wrexham</span> itself, <span class="loc">Acton</span>, <span class="loc">Rhosddu</span>, <span class="loc">Offa</span>, and <span class="loc">Caia Park</span>, each of which would have their own community council. The community of <span class="loc">Acton</span> covers approximately 3.34 square kilometres (1.29 square miles) and comprises the electoral divisions (wards) of <span class="loc">Acton</span> (<span class="loc">Acton</span> Central &amp; <span class="loc">Acton</span> Park), <span class="loc">Borras</span> Park, Little <span class="loc">Acton</span>, <span class="per">Maesydre</span> and <span class="per">Rhosnesni</span>. The southernmost tip of the community area is on the corner of <span class="per">Chester Street</span> and <span class="per">Charles Street</span> in the town centre, and is bounded by <span class="per">Chester</span> Road to the west, Holt Road to the south-east and the Llanypwll link road (A5156) to the north-east. At the <span class="date">2001</span> census, it was the most populous community in the county borough with 12,960 people in 5,412 households.</p><br><br>
