  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Hotel project on, Tri-State vows. <span class="loc">CHARLESTON</span>, <span class="per">W.Va</span>. -- Officials at Tri-State <span class="org">Racetrack &amp; Gaming Center</span> say they intend to proceed with a $250 million expansion project at the <span class="loc">Kanawha County</span> track and casino despite bad economic conditions that have hit the gambling industry particularly hard. <span class="per">Dan Adkins</span>, vice president of <span class="org">Hartman &amp; Tyner Inc.</span>, which owns the facility in Nitro, said he met with Gov. <span class="per">Joe Manchin</span> on <span class="date">Thursday</span> to talk about the track's future and assure state officials that he intended to make good on promises to build a hotel and entertainment complex at the track. "I'm not coming with my hat off and my hand out," <span class="per">Adkins</span> said <span class="date">Friday</span>. He said he does not intend to ask state lawmakers to push back deadlines for a table-gaming referendum and the construction timetable at the track and casino. <span class="per">John Melton</span>, attorney for the West <span class="org">Virginia Lottery Commission</span>, said recently that the <span class="date">2007</span> law allowing the expansion of table games requires the hotel to be up and running at Tri-State by the <span class="date">August 2010</span> deadline, not merely under construction. If Tri-State's owners fail to complete the hotel in time, they face a $2.5 million annual penalty until the hotel is open. With ground unbroken, no architect yet announced for the project and time running out, state and county officials are beginning to wonder whether Tri-State will be able to make the deadline. "I think Tri-State has publicly committed to build a hotel, and will build it," said <span class="loc">Kanawha County</span> Commission President Kent Carper, who said he has watched the progress of Tri-State's plans closely. "If they don't, the penalty is pretty unpleasant for them. They said they'd build it, and they need to build it," <span class="per">Carper</span> said, but conceded that the hotel might not be finished in time to meet the deadline. "To me, it wouldn't be the end of the world if it were delayed <span class="date">a year</span>," he said. "I just want to see it built." When the Legislature passed the law allowing local voters to approve the expansion of gambling to include table games such as poker and blackjack, the law required a vote after another <span class="date">five years</span> so voters could decide if they wanted table gaming to continue. The law also required Tri-State to build a hotel. The state's other racetracks already have hotels at their facilities. <span class="loc">Kanawha County</span> voters approved table gaming at Tri-State Racetrack in <span class="date">August 2007</span>. <span class="per">Carper</span> said <span class="per">Adkins</span> has had considerable trouble finding financing for the proposed $250 million expansion at Tri-State. The project includes a hotel of at least 200 rooms, a conference center and entertainment complex. "You can't blame everything on Tri-State," <span class="per">Carper</span> said. "It's not their fault the economy is in the tank." The pain is being felt across the gambling industry. <span class="date">Last year</span>, Tropicana Entertainment LLC, which runs the Tropicana <span class="per">Resort</span> and <span class="per">Casino</span> in <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>, filed for bankruptcy. The company that runs <span class="per">Donald Trump</span>'s casino empire filed for bankruptcy in <span class="date">February</span>. <span class="org">Herbst Gambling Inc.</span>, which operates a casino in <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, two more in <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and 12 in <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, announced plans to file for bankruptcy <span class="date">last week</span>, according to the Des Moines Register newspaper. <span class="per">Carper</span> said he was told that <span class="per">Adkins</span> intended to ask state officials to push back the deadline on the table-gaming referendum to make it easier to secure financing for the project. With the referendum on table games looming, <span class="per">Carper</span> said, investors or banking officials probably will be reluctant to loan a lot of money on a project that voters might decide they don't want anymore. " [Extending the deadline] will assist them in getting financing," <span class="per">Carper</span> said. <span class="per">Adkins</span> acknowledges that times are hard and it has been tough to finance the expansion project, but he said he would not ask state officials to push back any deadlines for the track. "We don't file bankruptcy," <span class="per">Adkins</span> said. "We're going to proceed with what we said we're going to do, with our own money." <span class="per">Matt Turner</span>, spokesman for Gov. <span class="per">Manchin</span>, confirmed that <span class="per">Adkins</span> met with the governor <span class="date">Thursday</span> to discuss "<span class="date">the future</span> of the racetrack." He said <span class="per">Manchin</span> was "encouraged" by the conversation. <span class="per">Adkins</span> said he hoped to pick an architect for the expansion project on <span class="date">Friday</span>.</p><br><br>
