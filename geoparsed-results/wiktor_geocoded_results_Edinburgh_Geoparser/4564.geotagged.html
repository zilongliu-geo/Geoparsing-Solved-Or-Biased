<p>Bluff is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Juan County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 320 at the 2000 census. Bluff is located at 37°17′1″N 109°33′10″W (37.283696, -109.552871), in the scenic and very sparsely populated southeastern <span class="loc">Utah</span> canyonlands of the <span class="loc">Colorado Plateau</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 22.6 square miles (58.7 km²), of which, 22.1 square miles (57.2 km²) of it is land and 0.6 square miles (1.4 km²) of it (2.43%) is water. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Bluff has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated "BSk" on climate maps. Under the direction of John Taylor, Silas S. Smith and Danish settler Jens Nielson led about 230 Mormons on expedition to start a farming community in southeastern <span class="loc">Utah</span>. After forging about 200 miles (320 kilometers) of their own trail over difficult terrain, the settlers arrived on the site of Bluff in April 1880. (The trail followed went over and down the "Hole In the Rock", which now opens into one of the tributaries of <span class="loc">Lake Powell</span>.) The town was named for the bluffs near the town site. The town’s population had declined to seventy by 1930 but rebounded during a uranium prospecting boom in the 1950s. With the uranium decline in the 1970s Bluff again declined and now remains a small town with about 300 residents.</p>
