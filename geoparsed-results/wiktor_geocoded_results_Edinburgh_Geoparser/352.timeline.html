  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Barra</span>, traditionally known as <span class="loc">Niumi</span>, is a city in The <span class="loc">Gambia</span>, located in the <span class="loc">district of Lower Niumi</span>. The predominant languages of the city are <span class="per">Serer</span> and <span class="per">Wolof</span>. Although Mandinka-speaking Africans always referred to the state along the north bank of the <span class="loc">Gambia</span> River's estuary as <span class="loc">Niumi</span>, not everyone did. For <span class="date">a long time</span> it was called "Barra" in the creolized trade language of the river, and between the seventeenth and nineteenth <span class="date">centuries</span> British and French records use "Barra" or "Bar" more frequently than "Niumi". The <span class="loc">city of Barra</span> has an "<span class="per">Al Kali</span>" which is basically the village coordinator who keeps everything in order. The people of <span class="loc">Barra</span> go to the "<span class="per">Al Kali</span>", leader of the village, with any requests. The former "<span class="per">Al Kali</span>" of <span class="loc">Barra</span>, formally known as Kenbugul Faye, died in <span class="date">September 2014</span> due to natural causes. He was 92. Ebrima Kenbugul Faye was the <span class="per">Al Kali</span> of the city for over <span class="date">5 years</span> and has 28 children. His son continues to uphold the family name by taking the place of his father. In <span class="date">early 2015</span>, the <span class="loc">city of Barra</span> conducted elections for their new "<span class="per">Al Kali</span>" with two candidates. The other candidate was of the Senghore family and was defeated. Alhagi Faye is <span class="date">now</span> the <span class="per">Al Kali</span> of <span class="loc">Barra</span>.</p><br><br>
