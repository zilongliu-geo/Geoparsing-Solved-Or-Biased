<p>Hampton is a suburban area with an old village heart on the north bank of the <span class="loc">River Thames</span>, in the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Richmond upon Thames</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. The population is between 19,000 and 20,000, excluding the fluctuating ward encasing its near neighbour <span class="loc">Hampton Hill</span> which also has a high street. Hampton includes the park-facing main streets and mews buildings of <span class="loc">Hampton Court</span> which strictly denotes its central manor which became rebuilt and reconfigured as a Royal Palace and adopts its broad informal sense from a plain road sign 500m west erected after World War II to direct tourists. Hampton is served by two railway stations, excluding one north of <span class="loc">Hampton Hill</span>, including one immediately south of <span class="loc">Hampton</span> Court Bridge in <span class="loc">East Molesey</span>. It adjoins <span class="loc">Bushy Park</span> on two sides and is <span class="loc">west of Hampton Wick</span> and <span class="loc">Kingston upon Thames</span>. Long strips of public riverside are in <span class="loc">Hampton</span> and the <span class="loc">Hampton Heated Open Air Pool</span> is one of the few such swimming pools remaining in <span class="loc">Greater London</span>. The riverside, on the reach above <span class="loc">Molesey Lock</span>, has residential islands and grand or decorative buildings including Garrick's House and the Temple to Shakespeare; also on the river is the Astoria Houseboat recording studio. Hampton Ferry provides access across the <span class="loc">Thames</span> to the main park of <span class="loc">Molesey</span> and the <span class="loc">Thames Path National Trail</span>.</p>
