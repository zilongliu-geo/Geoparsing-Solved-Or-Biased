  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Libertad</span> (Liberty) is a municipality in the <span class="org">La Libertad Department</span> of <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>. It had a population of 35,997 inhabitants in <span class="date">2007</span> according to the official census of <span class="date">that year</span>. It is one of the main tourist attractions in the country. In <span class="date">1770</span> this area was referred to by <span class="per">Pedro Cortes</span>, the <span class="per">Archbishop of Guatemala</span> (<span class="date">1776</span>–<span class="date">1779</span>), as the "hacienda Tepeahua", one of the largest estates in the parish of <span class="loc">San Jacinto</span>. The region was known as Tepeahua, a name derived from a Nahuatl expression meaning "mountain of the oak trees", before <span class="org">the Congress of the Federal Republic</span> of Central <span class="loc">America</span> authorized the name "Puerto de <span class="loc">La Libertad</span>" (<span class="org">Port of Freedom</span>) on <span class="date">February 24, 1824</span>. The national assembly chartered commercial trade on the Pacific coast in <span class="date">1831</span>, and the first steamboat arrived at <span class="loc">La Libertad</span> on <span class="date">June 7, 1857</span>. <span class="loc">La Libertad</span> was incorporated as a village by an Executive decree of <span class="date">July 19, 1858</span>, which was approved by the Congress on <span class="date">February 11, 1859</span>. This was done to relieve the community's excessive dependence on the town of Huizúcar, located at a considerable distance and connected by bad roads.</p><br><br>
