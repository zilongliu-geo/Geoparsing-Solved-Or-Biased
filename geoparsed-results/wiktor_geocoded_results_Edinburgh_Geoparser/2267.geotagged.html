<p><span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 21,720. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Hamlin</span>. The county was created in 1867 and named for <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span>. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Charleston-Huntington-Ashland, WV-OH-KY Combined Statistical Area. The county is probably best known as the birthplace of Chuck Yeager. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> was created by an act of the <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> Legislature on February 23, 1867, from parts of <span class="loc">Boone</span>, <span class="loc">Cabell</span>, <span class="loc">Kanawha</span> and <span class="loc">Putnam</span> counties. By 1869, the county had returned much of its <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> territory and absorbed the northern portion of <span class="loc">Logan County</span> and a portion of <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>. In 1869, Harts Creek Township (later district) was created from this latter region. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is one of five counties created by <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> since the Civil War. <span class="loc">Hamlin</span>, seat of government for the county, was established in 1853. Jesse, John, David, William, and Moses McComas were the first Anglo settlers in what is now <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>. They cultivated 20 acres (81,000 m2) of corn, the first ever grown in the area near present-day <span class="loc">West Hamlin</span>, in 1799. Later that year, they returned to eastern Virginia to get their families. Their families were initially left behind because it was not known if there were any hostile Native Americans in the area, or if the soil would be suitable for cultivation. John Lucas, William Hinch, and John Johnson soon joined the McComases in the county. They built cabins in the county around 1800. About 1804, William Wirt <span class="loc">Brumfield</span> settled at the mouth of Big Ugly Creek.</p>
