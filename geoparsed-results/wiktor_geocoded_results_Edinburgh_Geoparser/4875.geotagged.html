<p><span class="loc">Ferndale</span> is a southeastern suburb of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Its local government area is the City of Canning. It is approximately 15 kilometres (9 mi) from Perth's central business district. The name <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> originated from developers who decided not to proceed with the City of Canning's choice of Shearnstead. In 1965, the name change was approved. The eastern section of <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> Crescent was once Menzies Road. Low scrub forest covered most of the suburb until developed in the late sixties and seventies. <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> is bounded by Metcalfe Road to the south-east, the <span class="loc">Canning River</span> to the north and north-west, and Bannister Creek to the south-west. Its main street is <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> Crescent, which runs like an inverted U-shape from <span class="loc">Metcalfe</span> Road - the eastern leg of the street serves as a "centre line" to divide south-west and north-east <span class="loc">Ferndale</span>. Prominent features of the suburb also include <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> Reserve, a large sports ground; and the small Ferndale Shopping Centre. The <span class="loc">Canning River</span> Regional Park, located in <span class="loc">Ferndale</span>'s north, is a popular route for cycling and walking as it is the parkland of the <span class="loc">Canning River</span>.</p>
