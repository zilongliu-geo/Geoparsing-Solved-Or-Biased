It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Henry County</span>. Clinton was founded in the 1840s.

On June 26, 2006, a building in the historic town square collapsed; on the second and third floors, an Elks Lodge (Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks) meeting was taking place. The leader, Tony Komer, who was on the third floor of the building preparing a speech, is the only one who died. Nine people were pulled from the rubble, while the rest left on their own power. In the "Olde Glory Days" parade, which occurred less than one week after the accident, Komer was memorialized, and Elk's Lodge members from many parts of Western <span class="loc">Missouri</span> marched to show their support for the <span class="loc">Clinton</span> Lodge. Clinton is located at 38°22′12″N 93°46′18″W (38.370067, -93.771689).
