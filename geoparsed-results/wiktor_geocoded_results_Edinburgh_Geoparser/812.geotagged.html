<p>Mesa (/ˈmeɪsə/ MAY-sə) is a city in <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span>, in the State of <span class="loc">Arizona</span> and is a suburb located about 20 miles (32 km) east of Phoenix. Mesa is the central city of the East Valley section of the <span class="loc">Phoenix Metropolitan</span> Area. It is bordered by <span class="loc">Tempe</span> on the west, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community on the north, Chandler and Gilbert on the south, and Apache Junction on the east. As of the 2010 Census Mesa became Arizona's center of population. Mesa is the third-largest city in <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, after Phoenix and Tucson, and the 38th-largest city in the <span class="loc">US</span>. The city is home to 439,041 people as of 2010 according to the Census Bureau. Mesa is home to numerous higher education facilities including Polytechnic campus of Arizona State University. The history of Mesa dates back at least 2,000 years to the arrival of the Hohokam people. The Hohokam, whose name means "All Used Up" or "The Departed Ones", built the original canal system. The canals were the largest and most sophisticated in the prehistoric <span class="loc">New World</span>. Some were up to 90 feet (27 m) wide and ten feet deep at their head gates, extending for as far as 16 miles (26 km) across the desert. By A.D. 1100 water could be delivered to an area over 110,000 acres (450 km2), transforming the <span class="loc">Sonoran Desert</span> into an agricultural oasis. By A.D. 1450, the Hohokam had constructed hundreds of miles of canals many of which are still in use today.</p>
