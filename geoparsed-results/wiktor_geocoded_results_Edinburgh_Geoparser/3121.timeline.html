  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Camden</span> is not a town in <span class="loc">Texas</span>. unincorporated community in east central <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located at the junction of Farm to Market Roads 942 and 62, eighty miles northwest of <span class="loc">Beaumont</span>. As of the <span class="date">year 2000</span>, the community had approximately 1,200 residents. The Corrigan-Camden Independent School District serves area students. <span class="loc">Camden</span> <span class="loc">Texas</span> was a company town begun by the <span class="per">W. T. Carter</span> &amp; <span class="org">Brother</span> lumber company in <span class="date">the early 1900s</span>. Virtually all the housing was built by the company and was rented by the company to its employees. After the sale of the company to Champion Paper in <span class="date">the late 1960s</span>, all the public buildings and housing except those owned by <span class="per">Carter</span> Heirs were sold and moved. The <span class="org">Camden School District</span> was merged into the <span class="org">Corrigan School District</span> with a new name of Corrigan-Camden School District. By <span class="date">the early 1970s</span> all that was left was a post office, Champion company offices and a few vacation homes owned by <span class="per">Carters</span> and <span class="per">DeWalch</span>'s. There is a theory that some early <span class="per">Carters</span> were familiar with <span class="loc">Camden</span> <span class="loc">Maine</span> and that is the origin of the name <span class="loc">Camden</span> <span class="loc">Texas</span>.</p><br><br>
