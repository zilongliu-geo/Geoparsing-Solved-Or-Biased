  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mansfield</span> (also called <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> Village, Dicksons Mills, <span class="loc">Dixons Mills</span>, <span class="loc">Dublin</span> or <span class="loc">New Dublin</span>) is an unincorporated community in Jackson Township, <span class="loc">Parke County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The village was originally named <span class="loc">New Dublin</span> by <span class="per">James Kelsey</span> in <span class="date">1820</span>, and within <span class="date">a couple of years</span> the village was called Dickn's Mills, and then Strain's Mills before it became known as <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> in <span class="date">the 1930s</span>. The village of <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> prospered and grew because of a roller mill that was built by <span class="per">James Kelsey</span> and <span class="per">Francis Dickson</span>, in <span class="date">1820</span>. As the milling industry became popular the village grew into a thriving town of more than 300 people. A sash mill and carding mill were added, and the little town grew with the addition of a general store, blacksmith, cooperage, and wagon maker. As the population expanded, a church and a school were organized. <span class="org">List of Registered Historic Places</span> in <span class="loc">Indiana</span> <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> Roller Mill Big Rocky Fork Covered Bridge <span class="loc">Mansfield Covered</span> Bridge <span class="loc">Parke County</span> Covered Bridges Pleasant Valley Cemetery <span class="loc">Parke County</span> Covered Bridge Festival Media related to <span class="loc">Mansfield</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span> at Wikimedia Commons</p><br><br>
