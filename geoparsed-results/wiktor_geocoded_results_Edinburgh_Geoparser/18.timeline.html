  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lima</span> (/ˈlaɪmə/, the name is a shibboleth) is a town in <span class="loc">Livingston County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">U.S</span>. The population was 4,305 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town of <span class="loc">Lima</span> is in the northeast part of the county, south of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. The village of <span class="loc">Lima</span> is located within the town. The town of <span class="loc">Lima</span> was organized in <span class="date">1789</span> (before <span class="loc">Livingston County</span> was established) as the "Town of <span class="loc">Charleston</span>," but was renamed "Lima" in <span class="date">1808</span> to reflect that many residents had come from <span class="loc">Old Lyme</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> and to avoid confusion with <span class="loc">Charleston</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. The Genesee Wesleyan Seminary (<span class="date">1830</span>) / <span class="org">Genesee College</span> (<span class="date">1849</span>) in Lima village was one of the first co-educational schools in the country when it first opened in <span class="date">1822</span>. Eventually, determined by a Methodist-Episcopal convention in <span class="date">1870</span>, the college was shut in favor of the newly developed <span class="org">Syracuse University</span> (<span class="date">1871</span>), over the protests of the residents of <span class="loc">Lima</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Lima</span> was 1,890 in <span class="date">1920</span>. The Ganoung Cobblestone Farmhouse, <span class="org">Godfrey House</span> and Barn Complex, Leech-Lloyd Farmhouse and Barn Complex, Leech-Parker Farmhouse, Markham Cobblestone Farmhouse and Barn Complex, Martin Farm Complex, Ogilvie Moses Farmhouse, Zebulon Moses Farm Complex, and Thomas Peck Farmhouse are listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>.</p><br><br>
