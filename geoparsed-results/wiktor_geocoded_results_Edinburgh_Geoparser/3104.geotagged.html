<p><span class="loc">Selma</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Bexar</span>, <span class="loc">Comal</span>, and <span class="loc">Guadalupe counties</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. It is part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 5,540 at the 2010 census, up from 788 at the 2000 census. The <span class="loc">Retama</span> Park horse racing track is located in <span class="loc">Selma</span>. The town was famous as a speed trap as referenced in the Steve Earle song "Guitar Town". <span class="loc">Selma</span> was settled in 1847 by immigrants from various countries. In 1849, the Harrison and Brown stagecoach stop was built in <span class="loc">Selma</span> to handle passengers and freight on the <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> to Austin stagecoach line. John Harrison and his wife Martha moved to <span class="loc">Selma</span> in 1852, and he became the first postmaster of the town when the post office opened in 1856. Harrison was also co-owner of the Harrison and McCulloch stage line, which ran a postal route through <span class="loc">Selma</span>. Harrison's house still stands by <span class="loc">Cibolo</span> Creek, where it was built and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. German and Polish immigrants constituted most of the next wave of immigrants that settled in the area. By 1885, the population was 145, and at the turn of the century, the population peaked at 600. The population began a quick decline, so much that by 1906 the post office was closed. Selma's population dropped to 100 in 1940. The city incorporated in 1964 and has seen tremendous growth along the Interstate 35 corridor since 2000.</p>
