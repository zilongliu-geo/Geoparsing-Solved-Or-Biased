<p>Windsor is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 5 km south-east of Melbourne's Central Business District. Its local government areas are the Cities of <span class="loc">Port Phillip</span> and Stonnington. At the 2011 census, Windsor had a population of 7,069. Windsor is bounded by Dandenong Road, <span class="loc">St Kilda</span> Road, <span class="loc">Williams</span> Road and High Street. It is often incorrectly referred to as <span class="loc">Prahran</span>, <span class="loc">Windsor</span>'s northern neighbour. In the past, Windsor was within the <span class="loc">City of Prahran</span>'s boundaries and many institutions still refer to this. Windsor was named after <span class="loc">Windsor</span>, <span class="loc">Berkshire</span>. Known at first as <span class="loc">Prahran</span> South, its name was changed to <span class="loc">Windsor</span> in 1891. A Windsor Post Office opened in 1856, but was renamed <span class="loc">St Kilda</span> in 1858. The Windsor Post Office in the area opened in 1886. Although Stonnington's smallest suburb, Windsor has its own bank, along with a growing number of independent clothing stores, restaurants, bars, lounges and caf√©s. Windsor contains a diverse mix of housing, including medium density apartments, Victorian terrace housing, hi-rise public housing tower and semi-detached cottages.</p>
