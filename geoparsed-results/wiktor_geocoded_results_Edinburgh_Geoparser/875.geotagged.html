<p>Rudnik [ˈrudnik] is a village in Gmina Hażlach, <span class="loc">Cieszyn County</span>, Silesian Voivodeship, southern <span class="loc">Poland</span>. It has a population of 453 (2008). The name of the village is derived from a name of a local stream <span class="loc">Rudnik</span>, mentioned as early as 1442 (do potoka jmenem Rudnika), which is a transformation of a word rudy, meaning rdzawy (rusty). It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. Up to recently it was stated that the village was first mentioned in 1566 as <span class="loc">Rudnik</span>, however another documents exists issued by Wenceslaus III Adam, Duke of Cieszyn on 5 November 1608 which retrospectively affirms another document from 1523 that mentioned the village among others obliged to consume ale produced only in Cieszyn. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of <span class="loc">Teschen</span>, a fee of the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Bohemia</span>, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of <span class="loc">Poland</span>. It was then annexed by <span class="loc">Nazi</span> <span class="loc">Germany</span> at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to <span class="loc">Poland</span>.</p>
