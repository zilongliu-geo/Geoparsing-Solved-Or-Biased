<p><span class="loc">Shrewsbury</span> was an unincorporated town in <span class="loc">Jefferson Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, along the <span class="loc">Mississippi River</span> and <span class="loc">Shrewsbury Road</span> about 1 mile upriver from the border of the city of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. The name came into use in the mid-19th century, and became less commonly used towards the end of the 20th century, when surrounding communities of unincorporated Jefferson grew together as a suburb of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. The area is now generally known as <span class="loc">Old Jefferson</span> and is part of the Greater New <span class="loc">Orleans Metropolitan</span> area. During the early 20th century, <span class="loc">Shrewsbury Road</span> was an official link in the Jefferson Highway (State Route 1, and later <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 61) and provided the main automobile route into <span class="loc">New Orleans</span> via Metairie Road. It faded in importance as new and more direct routes into the city were constructed, namely the extensions of Jefferson Highway (1928) and Airline Highway (1940) into <span class="loc">South Claiborne Avenue</span> and <span class="loc">Tulane Avenue</span>, respectively. The final blow came in June 1957 when the railroad crossing on <span class="loc">Shrewsbury Road</span> was closed following completion of the nearby Causeway Boulevard overpass, leaving the once prominent road discontinuous.</p>
