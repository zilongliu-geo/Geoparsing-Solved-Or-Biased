<p>Three Readington Township Boy Scouts become Eagles. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, the highest advancement rank in Scouting, a Boy Scout must fulfill requirements in the areas of leadership, service and outdoor skills. They must earn at least 21 merit badges, and must also demonstrate leadership skills by holding one or more positions of responsibility in the troop at each rank. Another step on the road to Eagle was to plan, develop and carry out a service project. Hyland, son of Susan and William Hyland, led a service project to build picnic tables and park benches in strategic locations along the Bouman-Stickney interpretive trail loop at the Farmstead Museum in Readington Township. Patrick worked with the Readington Township Open Space Committee to identify requirements, research design and construction options, estimate costs and prepare a project plan. The project was funded through grant money awarded to the township by the Federal Highway Administration. Patrick is a senior at Hunterdon Central Regional High School.</p>
