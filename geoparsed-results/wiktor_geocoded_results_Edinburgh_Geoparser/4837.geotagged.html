The first settlement was called <span class="loc">Arraial</span> do Carmo da Bagagem”. In 1882, it was elevated to the category of district and was called “<span class="loc">Nossa Senhora do Carmo</span> da Bagagem”. In 1892 it became a vila (city) and in 1900 the name was changed to <span class="loc">Monte Carmelo</span>, after the mountain near <span class="loc">Haifa</span>.</p>
