<p><span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">East Gippsland region</span> of Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located on the Princes Highway 18.9 km east from the <span class="loc">city of Bairnsdale</span> and 18.3 km west from the tourist resort and fishing port of <span class="loc">Lakes Entrance</span>. The town encompasses an area of approximately 5,617 hectares, 56 square kilometres or 13,879 acres. <span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> forms one of the 224 cities, towns, villages and localities included within the scope of the <span class="loc">East Gippsland Shire</span> directive. The local member for the <span class="loc">East Gippsland Region</span> is Tim Bull. At the 2006 census, <span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> had a population of 586. The original inhabitants of the land were the Indigenous Australians, in particular the Gunai people who inhabited the region as far east as the <span class="loc">Snowy River</span>. The township got its name from John Johnson, a man of Scandinavian origins, who purchased the nearby <span class="loc">Swan Reach</span> run in 1857 which also encompassed <span class="loc">Johnsonville</span> and surrounding areas. Johnson was a popular public figure of his time, serving three years as the member for <span class="loc">Gippsland</span> in the Legislative Assembly. He had previously owned <span class="loc">Mewburn</span> Park located near <span class="loc">Maffra</span>, which is incidentally linked to the famous <span class="loc">Tichborne</span> case. Arthur Orton had answered Johnson's advertisement early in 1855 calling for splitters, fence riders and stock-riders on his <span class="loc">Mewburn</span> Park station. Johnson's agents subsequently signed Aurthur up as a stockrider after he shipped out aboard Johnson's Eclipse from <span class="loc">Van Diemen's Land</span>.</p>
