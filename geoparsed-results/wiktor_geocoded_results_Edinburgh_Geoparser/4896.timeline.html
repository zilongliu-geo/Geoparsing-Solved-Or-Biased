Local lore has it that residents convinced the post-Civil War Reconstruction government that <span class="loc">Benton County</span> was to be named for <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senator <span class="per">Thomas Hart Benton</span>, but the name actually honored Confederate Brigadier General <span class="per">Samuel Benton</span> of nearby Holly Springs. <span class="loc">Benton County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Memphis</span>, <span class="loc">TN-MS-AR Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area.

It is the fifth-smallest county by area in <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. The headwaters of the <span class="loc">Wolf River</span> meander and braid their way north and west across northern <span class="loc">Benton County</span> from Baker's Pond, the river's source spring (highest origin of continuous flow) in the <span class="loc">Holly Springs National Forest</span> approximately one mile southwest of where <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 72 passes into <span class="loc">Tippah County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. The <span class="loc">Wolf River</span> passes into <span class="loc">Fayette County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> between <span class="loc">Michigan City</span> (on the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> side) and <span class="loc">La Grange</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>.</p><br><br>
