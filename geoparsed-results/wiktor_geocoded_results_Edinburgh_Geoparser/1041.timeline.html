  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Marion</span> is a suburb in the <span class="loc">City of Marion</span> in Adelaide around 10 km south-west of the CBD. Founded as a rural village in <span class="date">1838</span> on the banks of the <span class="loc">Sturt River</span>, <span class="loc">Marion</span> was found to have rich soil and the population expanded rapidly. <span class="per">Colonel William Light</span> laid out the plan for the village, as he had done with the <span class="loc">City of Adelaide</span> itself. <span class="loc">Marion</span> is bordered on the north by Oaklands Road, on the east by <span class="loc">Marion</span> Road, on the south by Sturt Road and on the west by a roughly straight line from <span class="loc">Finniss</span> Street in the south to The Parade. The township of <span class="loc">Marion</span> was laid out by <span class="per">William Light</span> and <span class="per">B. T. Finniss</span> in <span class="date">1838</span>, and was (mis)named for <span class="per">Marianne Fisher</span> (<span class="date">1827</span>–<span class="date">1927</span>), daughter of the Resident Commissioner, <span class="per">James Hurtle</span> Fisher. Vegetables, stone fruits, almonds and grapes were all produced in <span class="loc">Marion</span>. <span class="per">Richard Hamilton</span> started the first vineyard in <span class="date">1838</span> and his family continues its wine making tradition to <span class="date">this day</span>. By the late 19th century <span class="loc">Marion</span> was also home to a number of industries such as a mining and brick making. However, the population at this time was still very small – around 350 people.Gradually the Adelaide sprawl crept up to <span class="loc">Marion</span>, and by <span class="date">the 1950s</span> the suburb was well and truly enveloped.</p><br><br>
