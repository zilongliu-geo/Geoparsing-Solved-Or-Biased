<p><span class="loc">Murray County</span> is a county located in the southern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 13,488. This is a 6.9 percent increase from 12,623 at the 2000 census. The county seat is Sulphur. The county was named for William H. Murray, a member and president of the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention and later a Governor of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. The area now occupied by <span class="loc">Murray County</span> was part of the land granted to the Choctaw Nation by the Treaty of Dancing <span class="loc">Rabbit Creek</span> in 1820. The <span class="loc">Chickasaw</span> received part of the land under the Treaty of Doaksville in 1838. The area became part of the <span class="loc">Chickasaw</span> Nation in 1855. There was an extended conflict before the U. S. Civil War between the Plains Indians and the newly arrived Choctaws and Chickasaws. The <span class="loc">U. S</span>. Army built <span class="loc">Fort Towson</span> (1824); <span class="loc">Fort Washita</span> (1842) and Fort Arbuckle (1851) to protect the Chickasaws. After the conflict between the tribes was settled, various bands of outlaws moved in and continued to create law enforcement problems. Sulphur began developing in the 1880s around the springs for which it was named. The springs encouraged the building of bathhouses and spas. Several were established by the time that a post office was established in 1898. The Sulphur Springs Railway (acquired by the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway in 1907) arrived there in 1902, and the 1904 establishment of Platt National Park, with headquarters at Sulphur, spurred the expansion of services for health-seekers. Other visitors were drawn to the park and to nearby <span class="loc">Turner Falls</span>, making Sulphur one of the state's earliest recreational centers.</p>
