  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kirovsk</span> (Russian: Ки́ровск), known as <span class="loc">Khibinogorsk</span> (Хибиного́рск) until <span class="date">1934</span>, is a town in <span class="loc">Murmansk Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located at the spurs of the <span class="loc">Khibiny</span> Mountains on the shores of the Lake Bolshoy Vudyavr, 175 kilometers (109 mi) south of <span class="loc">Murmansk</span>. Population: 28,625 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census). A settlement which eventually became <span class="loc">Kirovsk</span> was founded in <span class="date">1929</span>, soon after an expedition led by <span class="per">Alexander Fersman</span> had discovered large deposits of apatite and nepheline in the <span class="loc">Khibiny</span> Massif in <span class="date">the 1920s</span>. By <span class="date">the end of 1930</span>, its population grew to ten thousand people, and a mining and chemical plant here was well under construction. Due to the rapid growth, the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee petitioned on <span class="date">January 18, 1931</span> to grant the settlement town status and to name it <span class="loc">Khibinogorsk</span>. The petition was approved by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee <span class="org">Resolution</span> on <span class="date">October 30, 1931</span> and the town was subordinated directly to the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee. On <span class="date">December 15, 1934</span>, the town was renamed <span class="loc">Kirovsk</span> after recently assassinated <span class="per">Sergey Kirov</span>, who had been in charge of planning the development of the deposits.</p><br><br>
