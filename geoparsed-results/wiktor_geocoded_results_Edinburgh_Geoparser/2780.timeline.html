  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">New Brighton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ramsey County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a suburb of the <span class="loc">Twin Cities</span>. The population was 21,456 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In the 18th century, Mdewakanton Dakota tribes lived in the vicinity of <span class="loc">New Brighton</span>'s marshy lakes, harvesting wild rice. The Dakota eventually settled a village near <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> at <span class="loc">Rice Creek</span> and a smaller encampment just east of Silver Lake Road on 3rd Street NW. Immigrants from <span class="loc">Britain</span> and <span class="loc">France</span> settled a small village in <span class="date">1858</span> which included a general store, school and mission church. As railroads were established in the area, millers in <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span> formed the Minneapolis Stockyards and Packing Company in <span class="date">1888</span>. The company supplied home, agriculture, and business needs. The venture included Minneapolis figures such as streetcar magnate <span class="per">Thomas Lowry</span>, flour millers <span class="per">John Sargent</span> <span class="loc">Pillsbury</span>, Senator <span class="per">William D. Washburn</span>, ex-Minneapolis <span class="per">Mayor W.H.</span> <span class="loc">Eustis</span>, and industrialist W.H. Dunwoody. As the village grew in prominence, it was incorporated on <span class="date">January 20, 1891</span>. The city was given the name <span class="loc">Brighton</span> after <span class="loc">Brighton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The founding population was primarily English-American. Each August, a city festival celebrates this heritage, called the Stockyard <span class="date">Days</span> and is held at <span class="per">Long Lake Park</span>.</p><br><br>
