  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Patricio</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Nueces</span> and <span class="loc">San Patricio</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The population was 318 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. According to the United States Census Bureau, <span class="loc">San Patricio</span>, located at 27°57′33″N 97°46′23″W (27.959196, -97.773134), has a total area of 3.9 square miles (10.0 km²), of which 3.8 square miles (9.9 km²) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km²) (1.03%) is water. The town was founded in <span class="date">1829</span> by empresarios <span class="per">James McGloin</span> and <span class="per">John McMullen</span>. They had received approval from the Mexican government to settle 200 Irish Catholic families on the land—the name meaning <span class="loc">Saint Patrick</span>, the patron saint of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. Empresario <span class="per">James Power</span> was involved as well. The Battle of <span class="loc">San Patricio</span> was fought near the town in <span class="date">1836</span> during the Texas Revolution. With the approval of the General Council, <span class="loc">Texas</span> revolutionaries <span class="per">James Grant</span>, <span class="per">Frank W. Johnson</span> and <span class="per">Robert C. Morris</span> collaborated on plans to lead an assault on the Mexican town of <span class="loc">Matamoros</span>. Recruiting some 300 men, several of who were native to <span class="loc">San Antonio</span>, they gathered provisions from the <span class="loc">Alamo</span> and <span class="loc">Presidio La Bahia</span> for their expedition. The men needed mounts for their long journey and divided into groups as they traveled toward the coast to capture wild horses.</p><br><br>
