  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Alberton</span> is a small town in <span class="per">Victoria</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located along the <span class="loc">South Gippsland Highway</span>, 6 kilometres south of <span class="loc">Yarram</span> and 216 kilometres east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. <span class="loc">Albert River</span> passes through the town. At the <span class="date">2006</span> census, <span class="loc">Alberton</span> had a population of 162. The township was surveyed in <span class="date">1842</span> and named after <span class="per">Prince Albert</span>, the husband of <span class="per">Queen Victoria</span>. Initially the township consisted of two settlements, one named <span class="loc">Alberton</span> and the other named <span class="per">Victoria</span>, which were separated by <span class="per">Victoria Street</span> (renamed Brewery Road in <span class="date">1847</span>). <span class="org">Alberton Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">10 January 1856</span>. An earlier Alberton office opened in <span class="date">1842</span> was renamed <span class="loc">Port Albert</span> some <span class="date">days</span> earlier. The town's population grew steadily. Stores, hotels, and churches were built, as well as the Police Magistrate and Court of Petty Sessions. By the 1880s the town's growth stagnated. The announcement of new railway line increased growth, with new houses and factories being built. Shire Offices were planned for the town, but in <span class="date">1897</span> the location was changed to nearby <span class="loc">Yarram</span>. This led to many businesses moving to <span class="loc">Yarram</span>, and by <span class="date">1921</span> the railway had been extended there.</p><br><br>
