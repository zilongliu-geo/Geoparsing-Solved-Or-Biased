<p>Belton is a village in the civil <span class="loc">parish of Belton and Manthorpe</span>, in the <span class="loc">South Kesteven district</span> of <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is situated on the A607 road, and 3 miles (5 km) north from the market town of <span class="loc">Grantham</span>. The Saxon meaning of Belton is "a bell-shaped hollow". The village is significant for the 1686 Grade I listed Belton House. The house is the property of the National Trust and is open to the public. A Belton church is recorded in the Domesday Book. The parish church of St Peter and <span class="loc">St Paul</span> is significant for its <span class="loc">Norman</span>, late Medieval, Georgian and Victorian alterations and additions. In May 1643 Parliamentary cavalry, under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, clashed with Royalist forces at the south of <span class="loc">Belton Park</span>, to the east of <span class="loc">Manthorpe</span>. The Belton church register records "May 1643, buried three unknown soldiers, slain in Belton fight". Belton comprises thirty-one predominantly stone-built houses, most standing within a defined Conservation Area, with a further twelve homes outlying the village centre. The village is part of the ecclesiastical <span class="loc">parish of Belton</span>. The church is dedicated to <span class="loc">Saints Peter</span> and Paul, and is part of the Loveden Deanery of the <span class="loc">Diocese of Lincoln</span>. The 2014 incumbent is Rev Stuart Hadley.</p>
