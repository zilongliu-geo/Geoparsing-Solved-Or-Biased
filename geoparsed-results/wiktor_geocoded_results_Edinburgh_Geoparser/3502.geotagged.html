<p>Clinton is a village in British Columbia, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, located approximately 40 km northwest of <span class="loc">Cache Creek</span> and 30 km south of 70 Mile House. It is considered by some to straddle the southern edge of the <span class="loc">Cariboo</span> country of British Columbia, although others consider Ashcroft-Cache Creek, <span class="loc">Lillooet</span>, <span class="loc">Savona</span>, <span class="loc">Kamloops</span> and even Lytton and Spences Bridge to be in the <span class="loc">Cariboo</span>. Clinton, however, does sit immediately below the southern edge of the <span class="loc">Cariboo</span> Plateau. Clinton has a number of attractions including horse-back riding, big game viewing, hiking, fishing and other outdoor activities. Every May, Clinton is home to the Annual Ball which features a rodeo and dance. This is one of British Columbia's oldest continual events having first been held in 1867 and was a highlight of the social calendar in the British Columbia Interior for many decades. The Clinton Museum, built in 1892, has a number of historical artifacts on display that date back to the gold rush and founding of the area. Originally known as 47 Mile House or 47 Mile, Clinton was named in 1863 upon completion of the <span class="loc">Cariboo</span> Wagon Road in the area for Henry Fiennes Pelham Clinton, the 5th Duke of Newcastle, who was Colonial Secretary from 1854-1854 and 1859-1864.</p>
