<p><span class="loc">Ona</span> is a small unincorporated community along <span class="loc">US</span> 60 (the old Midland Trail) in <span class="loc">Cabell County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. It is situated roughly half-way between the towns of <span class="loc">Barboursville</span> to the west and Milton to the east. <span class="loc">Ona</span> is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). As of the 2010 census, the MSA had a population of 287,702. New definitions from February 28, 2013 placed the population at 363,000. <span class="loc">Ona</span> is home to four notable places. The first is Cabell Midland High School, which is the consolidated regional secondary school for students living in the eastern half of <span class="loc">Cabell County</span>. This is a rather large high school of modern construction, with extensive athletic facilities. The student population varies from 1,500 to 2,000 students. A second landmark is the Ona Racetrack. This is a prime location for local stock-car racing competitions. The track has had its share of financial difficulties and has been closed several times in recent years. The last time NASCAR held a Cup level race on a Tuesday was Aug. 11, 1970, when Richard Petty won the <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> 300 in <span class="loc">Ona</span>.</p>
