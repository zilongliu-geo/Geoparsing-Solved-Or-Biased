<p>Briefs: <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span> teen stabs classmate over MySpace argument. Three <span class="loc">Eastland County</span> residents were charged with arson after fires burned more than 260 acres and five structures in <span class="loc">Eastland</span> and <span class="loc">Callahan</span> counties, according to the Texas Fire Service. Brian Freeman, 23, Christina Utley, 20, and Michael Thomas, 24, each face five charges of arson and one charge of organized criminal activity, the service said in a statement. — Alex Branch — Negative comments on MySpace apparently caused an argument Monday that ended with one 14-year-old girl stabbing another girl in the chest with a pair of scissors at Handley Middle School, police said. The victim, also 14, suffered "two small, shallow puncture wounds" that were not life-threatening, said Lt. Paul Henderson, a police spokesman. She was taken to Cook Children’s Medical Center. The argument between the girls escalated at the school, police said. One girl grabbed a pair of scissors and stabbed the other girl repeatedly in the chest. The suspect was taken to a juvenile detention facility. — Alex Branch</p>
