  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Baldwin</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Duval County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. When the majority of communities in <span class="loc">Duval County</span> consolidated with the <span class="loc">city of Jacksonville</span> in <span class="date">1968</span>, <span class="per">Baldwin</span>, along with <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span> Beach, Atlantic Beach, and <span class="loc">Neptune Beach</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, remained quasi-independent. Like the other towns, it maintains its own municipal government, but its residents vote in the <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span> mayoral election and vote for the <span class="loc">Jacksonville City</span> Council; unlike the others, <span class="per">Baldwin</span> no longer supports its own police force. The population was 1,425 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town was first settled under the name of <span class="per">Thigpen</span> in <span class="date">1846</span>. <span class="per">Mr. Thigpen</span> had opened a tavern to benefit the stagecoach line at the crossroads of what is <span class="date">today</span> <span class="per">Baldwin</span>. He supplied horses for the stage and shelter and food for the passengers. The first railroad was built in <span class="per">Thigpen</span> in <span class="date">1857</span> with a second crossing it in <span class="date">1859</span>. The name was changed to <span class="loc">Baldwin</span> in honor of <span class="per">Dr. Abel Seymour Baldwin</span>, the president of the <span class="loc">Florida</span>, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad, a railroad that ran from <span class="loc">Lake City</span> to <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span>. Further development in <span class="per">Baldwin</span> led to the establishment of a telegraphic line running from <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span> to <span class="loc">Baldwin</span>.</p><br><br>
