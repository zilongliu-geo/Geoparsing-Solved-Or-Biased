  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jordan</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, is a community located on the eastern edge of the Town of Lincoln, in the <span class="loc">Niagara Region</span>. <span class="loc">Jordan</span> is bordered by the <span class="loc">Twenty Mile Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Vineland</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span> to the north, St. Catharines to the east, and Pelham to the south. Lying roughly 100 km from <span class="loc">Toronto</span> and 65 km from Buffalo by road, <span class="loc">Jordan</span> is located along a major transportation corridor between <span class="loc">Canada</span> and the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In <span class="date">January 2014</span> <span class="loc">Jordan</span> was brought to international attention when Al-Qaeda-directed terrorists were arrested for plotting to derail a passenger train traveling from <span class="loc">Toronto</span> to New <span class="loc">York City</span> on a rail-bridge crossing the <span class="loc">Jordan</span> Harbour. <span class="loc">Jordan</span> is home to many wineries due to its climatically advantageous grape-growing conditions in the <span class="loc">Niagara Region</span>, and is one of the premier icewine-producing destinations in <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Also located in <span class="loc">Jordan</span> is the Ball's Falls Conservation Area, which is maintained by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority, and the home of the second-tallest waterfall in the <span class="loc">Niagara Region</span>. <span class="loc">Jordan</span>'s climate is humid continental (KÃ¶ppen borderline Dfa/Dfb) and can be considered a unique micro-climate because of the moderating influence of <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span>/<span class="loc">Lake Erie</span> and the sheltering effect of the <span class="loc">Niagara Escarpment</span>. The area is known in <span class="loc">Canada</span> for its orchards, vineyards, wineries and restaurants that feature local produce and wines. Fruit crops grown in <span class="loc">Jordan</span> include cherries, peaches, apples and pears, and during the <span class="date">summer</span> attract many tourists from all over <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, particularly <span class="loc">Toronto</span>.</p><br><br>
