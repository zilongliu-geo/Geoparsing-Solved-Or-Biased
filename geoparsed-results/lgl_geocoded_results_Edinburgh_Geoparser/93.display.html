<p>Ever-popular 'Mr Ice Cream' dies aged 72. CAMBRIDGE'S Mr Ice Cream, Antonio Savino, has died. Mr Savino, who was 72, was a familiar, cheerful face on the city's streets for 40 years, selling ice cream from his van on <span onClick="goto_name('Chesterton')" class="loc">Chesterton</span> Road, along the Backs, and at Cherry <span onClick="goto_name('Hinton Hall')" class="loc">Hinton Hall</span>. As he drove around, his van would chime the tune O Sole Mio, and his beaming smile will be remembered by thousands of people. He was born in the small village of <span onClick="goto_name('Flumeri')" class="loc">Flumeri</span> in southern <span onClick="goto_name('Italy')" class="loc">Italy</span> in 1936, and married the love of his life, Antonietta, in 1958. She had been living in <span onClick="goto_name('England')" class="loc">England</span> for four years, and the couple were both employed as domestics for a wealthy family at <span onClick="goto_name('Kentford')" class="loc">Kentford</span>, near Newmarket. Later they moved to Cambridge and Mr Savino got a job at the Fitzwilliam Museum, also working as a kitchen porter. Being a tailor by trade, he took in work making and repairing suits for the Cambridge Italian community. In 1967, having saved enough money, he bought his first ice cream van and became one of the first vendors in Cambridge. In the early days his round would cover much of north <span onClick="goto_name('Cambridge')" class="loc">Cambridge</span>, including <span onClick="goto_name('Arbury')" class="loc">Arbury</span> and <span onClick="goto_name('Chesterton')" class="loc">Chesterton</span>, then during the 1980s he was given a permit by the city council to have a fixed pitch at Garret Hostel Lane, along the Backs. A family spokeswoman said: "Locals and tourists will have lovely memories of his infectious warmth and charming personality. "He always seemed to have enough time to make his customers feel special, and a remarkable ability for remembering names as well as faces. "We would like to thank everyone who has sent kind messages and letters since his death in Addenbrooke's Hospital a few days ago." His funeral will take place on Wednesday at 10am at the Church of Our Lady and The English Martyrs in Hills Road.</p>
