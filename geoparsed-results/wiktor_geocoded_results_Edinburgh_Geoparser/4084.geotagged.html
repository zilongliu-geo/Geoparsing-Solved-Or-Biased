<p><span class="loc">Frankfort</span> is a small farming town situated on the banks of the <span class="loc">Wilge River</span> in the <span class="loc">Free State</span> province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. The town was laid out in 1869 on the farm <span class="loc">Roodepoort</span>, and named <span class="loc">Frankfurt</span> (after Frankfurt-am-Main in <span class="loc">Germany</span>) by Albert van Gordon. The town later received municipality status in 1896. <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> is now the capital town to <span class="loc">Villiers</span>, <span class="loc">Cornelia</span> and <span class="loc">Tweeling</span>, called the Mafube Municipality. The main street is 'Brand Street', named after the 4th president of the <span class="loc">Orange Free State</span>, Sir Johannes Brand. During 1883, he visited the town and laid the cornerstone of the Dutch Reformed Church. This church was burnt down by the British troops during the Anglo-Boer War. After the war it was rebuilt and inaugurated in 1918. This town has produced soccer stars like Paul Motaung (former Kaizer Chiefs defender) and Chris Motaung (former Swallows midfielder), Frederich Lombaard a former Cheetah and Springbok rugby player, and academics like Dr Mahlathini Tshabalala, who is now based in <span class="loc">Gauteng</span> and the renowned Motloung brothers Paul and Michael who are based in <span class="loc">Botshabelo</span> and <span class="loc">Bloemfontein</span> respectively.</p>
