<p>Quirino is a landlocked province in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> located in the <span class="loc">Cagayan</span> Valley region in <span class="loc">Luzon</span> and named after Elpidio Quirino, the sixth President of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. Its capital is <span class="loc">Cabarroguis</span>. The province borders Aurora to the southeast, <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span> to the west, and Isabela to the north. Quirino used to be part of the province of <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span>, until it was separated in 1966. Long before its formal creation as an independent province, Quirino was the forest region of the province of <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span>, inhabited by tribal groups known as the <span class="loc">Negritos</span>. They roamed the hinterlands and built their huts at the heart of the jungle. On June 18, 1966, Republic Act 4734 was enacted, constituting the municipalities of <span class="loc">Diffun</span>, <span class="loc">Saguday</span>, <span class="loc">Aglipay</span>, and <span class="loc">Maddela</span> (all of <span class="loc">Nueva Vizcaya</span> province) into a new sub-province to be known as "Quirino", named after the late Philippine president Elpidio Quirino. On June 21, 1969, Republic Act 5554 was enacted, amending RA 4734 and creating the municipality of <span class="loc">Cabarroguis</span> (now the provincial capital town), which was taken from portions of <span class="loc">Diffun</span>, <span class="loc">Saguday</span>, and <span class="loc">Aglipay</span>.</p>
