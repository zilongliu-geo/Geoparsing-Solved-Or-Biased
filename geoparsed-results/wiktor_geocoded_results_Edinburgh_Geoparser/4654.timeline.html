  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Baldwin</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 1,208 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Lake County</span>. The village is located on the boundary between Webber Township on the north and <span class="loc">Pleasant Plains</span> Township on the south, with the larger portion lying in <span class="loc">Pleasant Plains</span>. <span class="loc">Baldwin</span> is primarily a tourist town. As such, much of its economy is based around the <span class="date">summer</span> <span class="date">months</span>. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> sports many lakes and rivers, as well as the vast wilderness of the Manistee National Forest. Many come to <span class="loc">Baldwin</span> on vacation to camp, canoe, fish, or hunt. <span class="org">The Shrine of the Pines</span> is a noted tourist attraction. The nearby <span class="loc">Pere Marquette River</span> is one of <span class="loc">America</span>'s Blue Ribbon fisheries and sportfishing is a major contributor to the local economy. The nearby <span class="loc">Baldwin River</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Pere Marquette River</span>, is the site of the first planting of German Brown Trout in the <span class="loc">United States</span> on <span class="date">April 11, 1884</span>. The <span class="loc">North Lake</span> Correctional Facility is a private, for-profit, maximum security prison that was constructed in <span class="date">the late 1990s</span> by the <span class="org">Wackenhut Corrections Co.</span>, which has since become the <span class="org">GEO Group</span>. The prison was originally built to house Michiganâ€™s youth offenders. The GEO group expanded the prison from 500 to 1,700 beds in the late 2000s. In <span class="date">June 2015</span>, 280 high security inmates convicted of crimes in the state of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> arrived from out-of-state prisons to the <span class="loc">Baldwin</span> facility. Lake Country Republican Rep. <span class="per">Jon Bumstead</span> sponsored a bill in the Michigan Legislature to raise the <span class="loc">North Lake</span> facility to Michigan's highest security rating. The Michigan Senate voted 23-14 to remove the former restrictive provision, making it legal for the <span class="org">GEO Group</span> to house out-of-state prisoners of all security classifications in <span class="loc">Baldwin</span>. As <span class="loc">Lake County</span> has high poverty and unemployment rates, the employment possibilities at the private prison have been seen as a positive for the residents. County Commissioner <span class="per">Dan Sloan</span> stated that as many as 150 jobs would result from the influx of out-of-state prisoners to the facility.</p><br><br>
