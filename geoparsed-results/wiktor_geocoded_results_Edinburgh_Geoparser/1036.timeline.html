  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Dolo</span> is a town in southeastern <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>, within 30 kilometers of the Ethiopia-Somalia border. Located in the Liben Zone of the Somali Region, this town has a latitude and longitude of 04°10′N 42°04′E. The <span class="loc">Mena River</span> flows to the northeast. When a delegation from the UNDP visited the town in <span class="date">February 1994</span>, they reported that an elementary school was present, but not functioning because of a "lack of basic school materials and lack of budget for teachers salary". One of the earliest recorded mentions of <span class="loc">Dolo</span> was during Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis's campaign against the <span class="loc">Borana</span>, when he reached as far as <span class="loc">Dolo</span> in 1896-1897 and founded military garrisons in the region. <span class="loc">Dolo</span> was one of the markets on the trade route that stretched from <span class="loc">Bardera</span> through <span class="loc">Luuq</span> (in modern-day <span class="loc">Somalia</span>) to <span class="loc">Ginir</span>. Marshal <span class="per">Rodolfo Graziani</span> started his attack in the Second Italian-Abyssinian War on <span class="date">4 October 1935</span> and soon occupied <span class="loc">Dolo</span>. He began his major large attack northwards on <span class="date">10 January 1936</span>. In <span class="date">March 1941</span>, during World War II. the 1st <span class="org">Battalion of the Gold Coast Regiment</span> caught the 20th Brigade of the Italian 101st Colonial Division at <span class="loc">Dolo</span>; its commander, staff and 3,000 men surrendered after negligible resistance.</p><br><br>
