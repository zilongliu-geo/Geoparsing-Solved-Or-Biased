<p><span class="loc">Clarke County</span> is a county of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 25,833. The county seat is <span class="loc">Grove Hill</span>. The county was created by the legislature of the Mississippi Territory in 1812. It is named in honor of General John Clarke of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, who was later elected governor of that state. The county museum is housed in the Alston-Cobb House in <span class="loc">Grove Hill</span>. For thousands of years, this area was occupied along the rivers by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. At the time of European encounter, <span class="loc">Clarke County</span> was the traditional home of the <span class="loc">Choctaw</span> and the Creek people. They traded with the French, who had settlements in Mobile and <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. They also were reached by some English and Scots traders from the British colonies along the Atlantic Coast. After the Louisiana Purchase, they started to establish relations with the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In 1805, by the Treaty of <span class="loc">Mount Dexter</span>, the <span class="loc">Choctaw</span> conveyed large amounts of land in what is now southeastern <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> and southwestern <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, including much of the western portion of <span class="loc">Clarke County</span>, to the <span class="loc">United States</span> for settlement by European Americans.</p>
