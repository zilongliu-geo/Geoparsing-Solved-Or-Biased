  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a small city on the outskirts of Metro <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, in northeast <span class="loc">Oakland County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 12,711 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city has the following neighborhoods: <span class="loc">Stony Creek</span> is a neighborhood on the northeast end of the city on the border with <span class="loc">Rochester Hills</span>. The Bluffs is a neighborhood on the southeast corner of the city on the border with <span class="loc">Rochester Hills</span>. <span class="loc">Yates</span> is shared with Shelby Charter Township, <span class="loc">Macomb County</span> and <span class="loc">Rochester Hills</span>. The first settlers in what would become <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, the Graham family, built a log cabin in <span class="date">1817</span>. The cabin was located where the Quik <span class="per">Pik</span> and <span class="per">Penn</span> Station stores <span class="date">today</span> exist at the intersection of <span class="per">Main</span> and <span class="per">Second</span> Street. The city was named for <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, just like <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, as many early settlers to the area were formerly from the state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. The city became an industrial center with abundant water power from the <span class="loc">Clinton River</span> and <span class="loc">Paint Creek</span>. The interconnected waterways are no longer used for travel or local industry, but provide natural beauty, some fishing, and a healthy portion of the Clinton Watershed. Historically, past industries formerly located in <span class="loc">Rochester</span> included a refinery for sugar beets, a paper products company, and the Western Knitting Mills factory, which was later adapted and utilized during World War II for incendiary productionâ€”businesses that no longer exist in the area. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was served by two railroads as well as the <span class="org">Detroit United Railway</span>, an interurban to <span class="loc">Royal Oak</span> and <span class="loc">Detroit</span>.</p><br><br>
