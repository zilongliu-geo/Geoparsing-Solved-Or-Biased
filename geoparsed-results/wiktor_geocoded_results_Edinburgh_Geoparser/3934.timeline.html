  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Woodville</span> is a small town in the southern <span class="loc">North Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, 75 km north of <span class="loc">Masterton</span> and 25 km east of <span class="loc">Palmerston North</span>. In the <span class="date">2006</span> census 1,398 people are usually resident in <span class="loc">Woodville</span>, a decrease of 81 people, or 5.5%, since the <span class="date">2001</span> Census. It appears that <span class="loc">Woodville</span> was a traveller's rest spot in Maori history. It was also a place to rest for hunters as they walked from one side of the Manawatu Gorge to the other. The local iwi were <span class="loc">Rangitane</span>, and maintained strong and positive relations with other tribes for the most part. They arrived at Wharetiti from <span class="loc">Bare Island</span>, <span class="loc">Waimarama</span> and continued northwards to <span class="loc">Tongariro</span>. Local <span class="loc">Maori</span> would construct temporary housing when the <span class="loc">Titi</span> began to arrive and harvest the birds from their burrows, preserving them inside pouches made from bull kelp which they carried up from the coast. It is some <span class="date">years</span> since muttonbirds were last seen on this part of the <span class="loc">Ruahine</span> Mountains. One interesting local landmark is Whariti, one of the main peaks in the <span class="loc">Ruahine Ranges</span> near <span class="loc">Woodville</span>. The name appears to be a corruption of the original name Wharetiti (Whare – house, titi – muttonbird (the Sooty Shearwater)). According to an interview on Radio <span class="loc">Woodville</span> in <span class="date">2009</span>, the peak of 920 m (<span class="date">2950</span> ft) gained its name when migrating muttonbird nested on top of the ridges of the <span class="loc">Ruahine</span> mountain range.</p><br><br>
