<p><span class="loc">Douglas County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 132,403. The county seat is <span class="loc">Douglasville</span>. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> is included in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, <span class="loc">GA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Formed in 1870 during Reconstruction after the US Civil War, <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> was originally named by the reconstruction legislature after Frederick Douglass, the Civil War-era abolitionist. However, at the end of Reconstruction, the second "s" was quietly dropped and the designated honoree was changed to Stephen A. Douglas, an Illinois senator and the Democratic opponent of <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span> in the presidential election of 1860 as evidenced by a historical marker about the creation of <span class="loc">Douglas County</span>: "This county, created by Act of the Legislature October 1, 1870, was named for Stephen A. Douglas, the "Little Giant," a Vermonter who was Congressman from <span class="loc">Illinois</span> 1843 to '47, Senator from '47 to '61, and Democratic candidate for President in 1860 on the ticket with gov. <span class="loc">Herschel</span> V. Johnson, of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, for Vice President. Among the first County Officers were: sheriff T.H. Sellman, Clerk of Superior Court A.L. Gorman, Ordinary Wm. <span class="loc">Hindman</span>, Tax Receiver Jno. M. James, Tax Collector M.D. Watkins, Treasurer C.P. Bower, Surveyor John M. Hughey. The county was created from the part of <span class="loc">Campbell county</span> which was northwest of the <span class="loc">Chattahoochee River</span>. The remainder of Campbell became southwest <span class="loc">Fulton</span> at the beginning of 1932."</p>
