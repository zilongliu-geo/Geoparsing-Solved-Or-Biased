<p>Glasgow is a city in Chariton and Howard counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The population was 1,103 at the 2010 census. The <span class="loc">Howard County</span> portion of Glasgow is part of the <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. Glasgow was laid out and platted in 1836, partially from land acquired from former <span class="loc">Missouri</span> State Treasurer James Earickson It was named for James Glasgow, a local merchant. The Battle of Glasgow was fought on October 15, 1864, in and near Glasgow as part of Price's <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Expedition during the American Civil War. Although the battle resulted in a Confederate victory and the capture of significant war material, it had little long-term benefit as Price was ultimately defeated at <span class="loc">Westport</span> a week later, bringing his campaign in <span class="loc">Missouri</span> to an end. On January 20, 1891, an African American man, Olli Truxton, was killed by a white lynch mob in Glasgow. Glasgow is mentioned in the novel Boone's Lick by Larry McMurtry. The Cecil family stops journeys from Boone's Lick by wagon to meet a flatboat at Glasgow that will take them upriver.</p>
