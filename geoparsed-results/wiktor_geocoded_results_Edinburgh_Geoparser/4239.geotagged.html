<p><span class="loc">Buna</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Oro Province</span>, <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span>. It was the site in part, of the Battle of Buna-Gona during World War II, when it constituted a variety of native huts and a handful of houses with an airstrip. <span class="loc">Buna</span> was the trailhead to the Kokoda Track leading to <span class="loc">Kokoda</span>. <span class="loc">Buna</span> was the site of a handful of houses, a dozen or so native huts, and an airfield acting as a trailhead up the Kokoda Track to the foothills village of <span class="loc">Kokoda</span> (see Kokoda Track campaign). During World War II, Imperial Japanese troops invaded on 21–22 July 1942 and established it as a base (see Buna Airfield). Six months later, <span class="loc">Buna</span> was recaptured by the Australian and American armies during the Battle of Buna-Gona on 2 January 1943 during the <span class="loc">New Guinea</span> campaign in the South West Pacific Area. The Fifth Air Force established air bases there as the Allied counter-offensive against <span class="loc">Japan</span> picked up the pace and continued operations to isolate the major Japanese base at <span class="loc">Rabaul</span> and attack <span class="loc">Lae</span> and points west. For weeks at a time <span class="loc">General MacArthur</span> used <span class="loc">Buna</span> as an informal forward base. MacArthur's biographer William Manchester relates a story Lt. General George Kenney, commanding officer Allied air loved repeating of how he'd gone back to <span class="loc">Australia</span> for a week, and <span class="loc">MacArthur</span> had stolen his house, claiming it was cooler at night than his own. A week later the Monsoon winds shifted, making MacArthurs' old house now the cooler—and he never asked for Kenney to switch back.</p>
