  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Alan</span>, 79, strikes out in marathon. VETERAN swimmer <span class="per">Alan Wood</span> is planning to give himself a very special birthday present - the completion of a marathon. <span class="per">Alan</span>, 79, from <span class="loc">Barton</span>, is attempting to clock up 26 miles in the pool at Cambridge's <span class="loc">Chesterton</span> sports centre, swimming three miles a session over <span class="date">a number of weeks</span>. He aims to finish the last mile on his 80th birthday, in <span class="date">a few days</span>' time. He said: "I'm the leader of the Cambridge group of the Macular Disease Society, and I'm doing the swimming marathon to raise money for the society's work. "I'm trying to do three miles <span class="date">a week</span>, about 100 lengths a session, and I've managed to do 14 miles so far," <span class="per">Mr Wood</span> said. "I will be 80 in <span class="date">April</span>, and my plan is to do the last part of the swim on my birthday, as a way to celebrate." The Macular Disease Society was set up to help sufferers of macular degeneration. This is the collective term for more than 1,500 conditions which affect central vision by damage to the macula, a small area of the retina at the back of the eye. It is estimated there are more than 500,000 people with macular conditions in the <span class="loc">UK</span>. <span class="per">Mr Wood</span> said: "There's a constant need for funding for research to help people, and that's why I'm doing the swim. I don't know yet how much I'll raise, but I hope people will sponsor me. I have had a number of offers of sponsorship already. "I'm finding the swimming all right at the moment, and I'm confident I'll get over the finish line." If anyone wants to sponsor <span class="per">Mr Wood</span>'s effort, they can do so by ringing him on <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> (01223) 264970, or emailing afbwood@uwclub.net .</p><br><br>
