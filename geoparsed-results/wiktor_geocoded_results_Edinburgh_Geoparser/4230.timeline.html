  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bangor</span> (English /ˈbæŋɡər/; Welsh: [ˈbaŋɡɔr]) is a city in <span class="loc">Gwynedd</span> unitary authority, north west <span class="loc">Wales</span>, and one of the smallest cities in <span class="loc">Britain</span>. Historically in Caernarfonshire, it is a university city with a population of 18,808 at the <span class="date">2011</span> census, including around 10,000 students at <span class="org">Bangor University</span> and including Pentir community. It is one of only six places classed as a city in <span class="loc">Wales</span>, although it is only the 36th-largest urban area by population. According to the <span class="date">2001</span> census, 46.6% of the non-student resident population speak Welsh, which is low for <span class="loc">Gwynedd</span> but despite this, the language keeps a high profile in town. The origins of the city date back to the founding of a monastic establishment on the site of <span class="loc">Bangor</span> Cathedral by the Celtic saint Deiniol in the <span class="date">early 6th century AD</span>. <span class="loc">Bangor</span> itself is an old Welsh word for a wattled enclosure, such as the one that originally surrounded the cathedral site. The present cathedral is a somewhat more recent building and has been extensively modified throughout the <span class="date">centuries</span>. While the building itself is not the oldest, and certainly not the biggest, the bishopric of <span class="loc">Bangor</span> is one of the oldest in <span class="loc">Britain</span>. Another claim to fame is that <span class="loc">Bangor</span> allegedly has the longest High Street in <span class="loc">Wales</span> and the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. Friars School was founded as a free grammar school in <span class="date">1557</span>, and <span class="org">Bangor University</span> was founded in <span class="date">1884</span>.</p><br><br>
