  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Fleeing suspect arrested. A 36-year-old <span class="loc">Palestine</span> man who successfully eluded authorities following <span class="date">a weekend</span> traffic stop was arrested <span class="date">Wednesday</span> at an <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> residence. <span class="per">James Ernest Barnett</span>, 36, of <span class="loc">Palestine</span> was arrested without incident around <span class="date">9:30 a.m. Wednesday</span> at a residence on CR 367 off of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 79, approximately 2 miles east of <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, according to <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> <span class="per">Sheriff Greg Taylor</span>. The arrest was made after <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> Crimestoppers had received a tip from a private citizen concerning <span class="per">Barnett</span>’s whereabouts. <span class="per">Taylor</span> said he and about five other representatives of the <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> Sheriff’s Office “swooped in on” the house after receiving the tip. “He (<span class="per">Barnett</span>) didn’t have a chance to run,” <span class="per">Taylor</span> said. “We had him out of the house before he knew what happened.” Three other male subjects inside the residence were not arrested, the sheriff added. <span class="date">Late Sunday morning</span>, <span class="per">Barnett</span> led an <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> sheriff’s deputy on a high speed chase into <span class="loc">Freestone County</span> after he had been stopped in an “older model” <span class="org">Ford</span> Explorer for “a non-visible registration sticker” inside the <span class="loc">Palestine city</span> limits, according to <span class="per">Taylor</span>. After failing to provide proof of liability insurance, authorities have said <span class="per">Barnett</span> declined the officer’s request to step out of his vehicle and then sped off -- first leading the officer on several city streets before heading out of town in a westwardly direction on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 79. The driver took the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 84 turnoff towards <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> before turning onto FM 489 and then onto <span class="loc">Freestone County</span> Road 360, according to the sheriff. Wright ultimately lost control of his squad car on the county road, with the suspect continuing approximately 2 more miles before abandoning his vehicle and fleeing on foot, according to <span class="per">Taylor</span>. <span class="per">A Texas</span> <span class="org">Parks &amp; Wildlife Department</span> game warden who had joined the pursuit attempted to apprehend the suspect, but lost him in the woods, the sheriff stated. At the time of <span class="per">Barnett</span>’s arrest <span class="date">Wednesday morning</span>, <span class="per">Taylor</span> said a <span class="date">1996</span> <span class="org">Chevrolet</span> Z-71 pickup was parked in the driveway of the residence. The vehicle was reported stolen <span class="date">Sunday</span> in <span class="loc">Freestone County</span>, approximately 2 miles from where the suspect abandoned the <span class="org">Ford</span> Explorer, according to the sheriff. “Inside that truck in a cigarette package in the console was a small amount of methamphetamine that he claimed,” <span class="per">Taylor</span> said. <span class="per">Barnett</span> already had a “blue warrant” which reflects a parole violation, according to <span class="per">Taylor</span>. <span class="per">Barnett</span> was transported to the <span class="loc">Anderson County Jail</span> following his arrest and will be charged locally with evading arrest/detention with a motor vehicle and possession of a controlled substance less than 1 gram, the sheriff stated. The suspect also faces unauthorized use of a motor vehicle charges in <span class="loc">Freestone County</span> in relation to the stolen truck. --------- <span class="per">Paul Stone</span> may be contacted via e-mail at pstone@palestineherald.com</p><br><br>
