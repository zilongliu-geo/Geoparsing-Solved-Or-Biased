<p><span class="loc">Mali</span> (/ˈmɑːli/; French: [maˈli]), officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Mali</span> (French: République du <span class="loc">Mali</span>), is a landlocked country in <span class="loc">West Africa</span>. <span class="loc">Mali</span> is the eighth-largest country in <span class="loc">Africa</span>, with an area of just over 1,240,000 square kilometres (480,000 sq mi). The population of <span class="loc">Mali</span> is 14.5 million. Its capital is <span class="loc">Bamako</span>. <span class="loc">Mali</span> consists of eight regions and its borders on the north reach deep into the middle of the <span class="loc">Sahara Desert</span>, while the country's southern part, where the majority of inhabitants live, features the <span class="loc">Niger</span> and <span class="loc">Senegal</span> rivers. The country's economy centers on agriculture and fishing. Some of <span class="loc">Mali</span>'s prominent natural resources include gold, being the third largest producer of gold in the African continent, and salt. About half the population lives below the international poverty line of $1.25 (<span class="loc">U.S.</span>) a day. A majority of the population (55%) are non-denominational Muslims. Present-day <span class="loc">Mali</span> was once part of three West African empires that controlled trans-Saharan trade: the <span class="loc">Ghana</span> Empire, the <span class="loc">Mali</span> Empire (for which <span class="loc">Mali</span> is named), and the Songhai Empire. During its golden age, there was a flourishing of mathematics, astronomy, literature, and art. At its peak in 1300, the <span class="loc">Mali</span> Empire covered an area about twice the size of modern-day <span class="loc">France</span> and stretched to the west coast of <span class="loc">Africa</span>. In the late 19th century, during the Scramble for <span class="loc">Africa</span>, <span class="loc">France</span> seized control of <span class="loc">Mali</span>, making it a part of <span class="loc">French Sudan</span>. <span class="loc">French Sudan</span> (then known as the Sudanese Republic) joined with <span class="loc">Senegal</span> in 1959, achieving independence in 1960 as the <span class="loc">Mali</span> Federation. Shortly thereafter, following <span class="loc">Senegal</span>'s withdrawal from the federation, the Sudanese Republic declared itself the independent <span class="loc">Republic of Mali</span>. After a long period of one-party rule, a coup in 1991 led to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of <span class="loc">Mali</span> as a democratic, multi-party state.</p>
