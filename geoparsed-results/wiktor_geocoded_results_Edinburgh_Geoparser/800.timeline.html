Sari is the largest and most populous <span class="loc">city of Mazandaran</span>. The Mazandaran Sea provides a beautiful coastline in north of Sari; northeast of the city is <span class="loc">Neka</span>. <span class="loc">Qa</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">emshahr</span> (Formerly known as <span class="loc">Shahi</span>) is to its south-west, <span class="loc">Juybar</span> is to its north-west, and <span class="loc">Kiasar</span>, <span class="loc">Damghan</span>, and <span class="loc">Semnan</span> are cities located to the south.
