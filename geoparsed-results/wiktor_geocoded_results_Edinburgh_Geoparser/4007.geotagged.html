<p><span class="loc">Solon</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,053 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Solon</span> is a picturesque village containing historic architecture. The first known inhabitants were the Abenaki Indians, whom European settlers encountered in the early 1600s. There are petroglyphs that have been said to be 5,000 years old or more, but more than likely came about after 1620. General Benedict Arnold and his troops camped below <span class="loc">Caratunk Falls</span> on October 7, 1775 before carrying their boats around them on the way up the <span class="loc">Kennebec River</span> to the Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. Originally called T1 R2 EKR, the plantation would known as Spauldingtown after Thomas Spaulding, a grantee. It was settled in 1782 by William Hilton from <span class="loc">Wiscasset</span>, who purchased 500 acres (2.0 km2). On February 23, 1809 it was incorporated as <span class="loc">Solon</span>, named after <span class="loc">Solon</span>, a statesman and poet of Ancient <span class="loc">Greece</span>. Agriculture was the principal occupation of the inhabitants. The surface of the town is uneven, the underlying rock slate, but the sandy and occasionally gravelly loam produced good crops of hay and grain. Solon village was established at Fall Brook, its water power used to operate mills. By 1859, when the population was 1,419, there were two sawmills, a gristmill, a shovel handle factory, two fulling and two carding machines, and two blacksmiths. By 1886, the town's industries included a carriage manufacturer and a harness maker.</p>
