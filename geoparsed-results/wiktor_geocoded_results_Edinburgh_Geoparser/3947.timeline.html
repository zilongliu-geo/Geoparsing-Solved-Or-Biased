  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Picton</span> is a small town in the <span class="loc">Macarthur Region</span> of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, in the Wollondilly Shire. The town is located 80 kilometres south-west of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, close to <span class="per">Camden</span> and <span class="per">Campbelltown</span>. It is also the administrative centre of Wollondilly Shire. <span class="loc">Picton</span> was first explored by Europeans in <span class="date">1798</span> and remained beyond the limits of legal settlement until <span class="date">1821</span>. Following the discovery of good land in the interior and the settlement of <span class="loc">Bong Bong</span> and the <span class="loc">Goulburn</span> areas, <span class="per">Governor Macquarie</span> authorised the building of the new Great South Road between <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and the Southern Highlands in <span class="date">1819</span>. This opened up the <span class="loc">Picton</span> area to settlers, including <span class="per">Henry Colden</span> Antill, who established a 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) property in <span class="date">1822</span>. <span class="loc">Picton</span> developed when a new line of the Great South Road was cut over the Razorback Range from <span class="per">Camden</span>, and especially after the railway arrived in <span class="date">1863</span>. <span class="loc">Picton</span> is the only town in the Southern Hemisphere where you can pass through it twice when travelling by train. It was established as <span class="loc">Stonequarry</span> in <span class="date">1841</span> and was renamed <span class="loc">Picton</span> in <span class="date">1845</span>. It remained a stopping point on the Great South Road, later renamed the Hume Highway, until it was bypassed in <span class="date">December 1980</span>.</p><br><br>
