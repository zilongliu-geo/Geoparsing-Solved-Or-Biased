<p><span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is the seventh largest city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>. Located 15 miles (24 km) west of downtown <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span> in <span class="loc">Hennepin County</span>, the city is the third largest suburb of Minneapolisâ€“Saint Paul, which is the fifteenth largest metropolitan area in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, with about 3.46 million residents. The population was 70,576 at the 2010 Census. Once named for <span class="loc">Medicine Lake</span>, the city's name was chosen by <span class="loc">Hennepin County</span> Commissioners during the county's inception. Plymouth's history can be traced back to the pre-Columbian period around 1400 to 1500 AD. The original inhabitants were the Dakota. Their encampment was at the north end of <span class="loc">Medicine Lake</span>. The name <span class="loc">Medicine Lake</span> is derived from the Dakota word Mdewakanton, meaning "Lake of the Spirit." The Dakota named the lake after a warrior overturned his canoe and his body was never recovered. Antoine LeCounte, a guide and explorer, was the first settler to this area. He arrived in 1848, but did not settle until 1852. He carried mail from the <span class="loc">Red River</span> country to points south, trading goods to Native Americans for horses on the way. LeCounte built the first cabin at what is now East <span class="loc">Medicine Lake</span> Boulevard at 29th Avenue North.</p>
