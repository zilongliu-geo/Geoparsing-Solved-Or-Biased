<p>Jackson is a city and county seat of <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,299 at the 2010 census. Jackson was originally called <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, and under the latter name was laid out in 1856. A post office called Jackson has been in operation since 1858. It is speculated that early trappers and explorers were the first to enter the Jackson area. The first white settlers in Jackson were brothers â€“ William, George, and Charles Wood of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, by way of Mankato. In July 1856, they established a trading post and named the proposed town "Springfield" because there was a spring near where they built their cabin, a large one-room log building near the <span class="loc">Des Moines</span> River. Forty settlers followed in that summer of 1856. The greater number were of English and Scottish descent, from <span class="loc">Webster City</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. Over a dozen log cabins were built by that fall. The winter of 1856-1857 was one of the most severe that was ever experienced because of its bitter cold, deep snows, and violent storms. Food was scarce as all the white settlers had come too late to raise a crop or plant gardens. Consequently, all provisions had to be hauled from the nearest settlements of <span class="loc">Webster City</span> or Mankato.</p>
