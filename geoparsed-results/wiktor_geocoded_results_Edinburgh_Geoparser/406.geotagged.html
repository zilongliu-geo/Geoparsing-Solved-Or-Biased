<p><span class="loc">Salem</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Salem County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city's population was 5,146, reflecting a decrease of 711 (-12.1%) from the 5,857 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn declined by 1,026 (-14.9%) from the 6,883 counted in the 1990 Census, an overall drop of more than 25% over the two decades. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Salem County</span>, the state's most rural county. The name "Salem", in both the city and county, is derived from the Hebrew word shalom, meaning "peace". The town and colony of <span class="loc">Salem</span> was laid out in 1675 by John Fenwick and the community was given permission to choose officers in October 1693. It was incorporated on February 21, 1798, as part of the initial group of 104 townships established by the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature. On February 25, 1858, it was reincorporated as <span class="loc">Salem City</span>. <span class="loc">Salem</span> was founded by John Fenwick, a <span class="loc">Quaker</span>. Fenwick had been involved in a financial dispute with an Edward Billinge, another <span class="loc">Quaker</span>, who had received the undivided portion of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> territory that James Stuart, <span class="loc">Duke of York</span> had granted to Lord John Berkeley in 1664. Berkeley had sold his share to <span class="loc">Billinge</span> in 1675 for 1,000 pounds, but Billinge had become bankrupt and so had the property turned over to <span class="loc">Fenwick</span> to hold for Billinge and his assigns in trust. Billinge and Fenwick came to disagree over the property.</p>
