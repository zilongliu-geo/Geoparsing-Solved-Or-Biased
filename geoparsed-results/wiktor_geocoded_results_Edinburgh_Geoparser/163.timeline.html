  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Concordia</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Cloud County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located along the Republican River in the <span class="loc">Smoky Hills</span> region of the <span class="loc">Great Plains</span> in north-central <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 5,395. <span class="loc">Concordia</span> is home of the <span class="org">Cloud County Community College</span> and the <span class="org">Nazareth Convent and Academy</span>. <span class="loc">Concordia</span> holds the distinction of being elected the county seat before the town was created. The founder of the town, <span class="per">James M. Hagaman</span> had created a complete layout of the town on paper including streets, blocks, courthouse, and parks. The name "<span class="loc">Concordia</span>" was chosen because a member of the early group of promoters ("Cap" <span class="loc">Snyder</span>) had once lived in <span class="loc">Concordia</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. <span class="date">December 1869</span> was the first election for the county seat with <span class="loc">Concordia</span>, <span class="loc">Clyde</span> and the <span class="date">now</span> defunct town <span class="loc">Sibley</span>. Without a clear majority, a second election was held between <span class="loc">Concordia</span> and <span class="loc">Sibley</span> on <span class="date">January 4, 1870</span>. <span class="loc">Concordia</span> was declared the winner over <span class="loc">Sibley</span> 165 votes to 129. It was over <span class="date">a year later</span> when <span class="loc">Concordia</span> officially became a town when the Republican Land District Office opened on <span class="date">January 16, 1871</span>. The <span class="loc">Concordia</span> Land Office continued until <span class="date">February 28, 1889</span> when it was consolidated with the land office in <span class="loc">Topeka</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>.</p><br><br>
