  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Teton County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 708 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is the self-proclaimed "Malting <span class="org">Barley Capital</span> of the World" with 83,000 acres (336 km2) of irrigated cropland and 56,000 acres (227 km2) of non-irrigated cropland in production for the purpose of raising malt barley in the vicinity. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> began as a station on the <span class="loc">Milwaukee</span> and is between <span class="loc">Great Falls</span> and <span class="loc">Choteau</span> and near <span class="loc">Freezeout</span> Lake, (from Cheney's Names on the Face of <span class="loc">Montana</span>, Mountain Press Publishing Company) where as many as 300,000 snow geese and 10,000 tundra swans gather in <span class="date">March</span>. <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> serves as a trading center for the farmers of <span class="loc">Greenfield Bench</span>. Irrigation <span class="date">now</span> assures crops, but in earlier <span class="date">days</span> a dry <span class="date">summer</span> made the grass scarce and the name "Freeze-out Bench" was applied to the area. "<span class="loc">Greenfield Bench</span>" and <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> are <span class="date">now</span> descriptive of the hay and grain fields surrounding the town. (from Cheneyâ€™s Names on the Face of <span class="loc">Montana</span>, Mountain Press Publishing Company) Even though the federal government had opened this area of <span class="loc">Montana</span> to homesteading in <span class="date">1862</span>, not until 1909 did settlers really come into the <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> area when Congress liberalized this act allowing the settler 320 acres of free land instead of 160. It became apparent, however, that the small homesteads, 160 or 320 acres, made little sense in the vast and dry landscape of <span class="loc">Montana</span>. After the <span class="org">Bureau of Reclamation</span> conducted a survey that showed a dam could be built in the Sun River Canyon and water for irrigation in <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> area would be feasible were many more settlers attracted to <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>. The <span class="loc">Gibson</span> Dam was completed in <span class="date">1929</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, Greenfield Irrigation District delivers water from <span class="loc">Gibson</span> Dam to approximately 83,000 acres surrounding this community.</p><br><br>
