<p>Camden is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Ouachita County</span> in the southern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. Long an area of Native-American villages, the French also made a permanent settlement here because of its advantageous location above the <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> River. In 2000, Camden had a population of 13,154, but it lost 7.4 percent of its residents and recorded 12,183 in 2010. The municipality in 2010 was 56 percent African American. Camden is the principal city of the Camden Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> and <span class="loc">Calhoun</span> counties. Indigenous peoples of various cultures had lived along the rivers of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> for thousands of years and created complex societies. Mississippian culture peoples built massive earthwork mounds along the <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> River beginning about 1000 AD. In 1783, this area was part of New <span class="loc">France</span>. A French trader named <span class="loc">Fabre</span> settled on a bluff above the <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> River and called the settlement Ã‰core <span class="loc">Fabre</span> (Faber's Bluff). This was the first European permanent settlement of what would become Camden. He traded with the <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> and other American Indians who inhabited the area.</p>
