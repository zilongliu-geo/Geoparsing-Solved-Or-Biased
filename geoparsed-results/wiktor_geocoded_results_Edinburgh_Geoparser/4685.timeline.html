  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Alberton</span> is a metropolitan suburb in <span class="per">Adelaide</span>, <span class="loc">South Australia</span>, about 20 minutes drive from the city. <span class="org">Part of the City</span> of Port <span class="per">Adelaide Enfield</span>, it is bordered by the suburbs of Rosewater, <span class="loc">Queenstown</span>, <span class="loc">Cheltenham</span> and <span class="loc">Port Adelaide</span>. <span class="loc">Alberton</span>, like <span class="loc">Port Adelaide</span>, is rich in historical significance. On <span class="date">7 March 1839</span>, the South <span class="org">Australian Company</span> was granted private subdivision of preliminary section 423. Section 423 was sold as 'The Town of <span class="per">Albert</span>' and subsequently became '<span class="loc">Albert Town</span>' after <span class="per">Prince Albert</span>, <span class="per">Prince Consort</span> of <span class="per">Queen Victoria</span>. Eventually, 'Alberton' became commonly used and around <span class="date">the turn of the century</span> was officially adopted as the suburb's name. With demand for workers at the Port and homes for these workers needed, <span class="date">late in 1840</span> there were already 61 houses and 235 residents in <span class="loc">Alberton</span>. The layout of '<span class="loc">Albert Town</span>' originally had provisions for four public squares, two of which still exist. <span class="loc">St Georges</span>' Square became the site for the Anglican Church while <span class="per">St</span> Andrew's Square was later subdivided and became the site of the Trinity Uniting Church. <span class="per">St Patrick</span>'s <span class="org">Square and Company Square</span> are <span class="date">today</span> still used as public recreation areas (Couper-Smartt, <span class="date">2003</span>).</p><br><br>
