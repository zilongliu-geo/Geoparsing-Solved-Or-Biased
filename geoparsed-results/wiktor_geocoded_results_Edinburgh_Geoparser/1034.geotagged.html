<p><span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is a village in the central <span class="loc">west of New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 21 kilometres (13 mi) east of <span class="loc">Cowra</span>. It contains remains of a brief goldrush during the late 19th century which left behind a number of substantial buildings before the village relapsed into relative isolation. It includes a restored railway station, hotel and a memorial hall. At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> had a population of 812. The railway station was opened in 1888 on the <span class="loc">Blayney</span> - Demondrille line which connected the Main Western Line at <span class="loc">Blayney</span> and the Main Southern Line at Demondrille railway station. At one time there were several sidings near the station with grain silos, stock yards, loading bank, goods shed, hay stage, and loco platform. In the 1980s services were suspended between <span class="loc">Cowra</span> and <span class="loc">Blayney</span>. The section was re-opened by the Lachlan Valley Railway which runs heritage trains from <span class="loc">Cowra</span> to <span class="loc">Blayney</span>. The railway station is now an art gallery and private residence. Gold was discovered in 1868 at <span class="loc">Woods Flat</span>, a few kilometres south of <span class="loc">Woodstock</span>. A rush of 500 diggers took up the ground there, but after a short period only a few were left as surface gold was minimal and water supplies lacking. The goldfield had a long history but today almost nothing remains of the buildings at <span class="loc">Woods Flat</span>. The village of <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> was established in response to the building of the railway line north of <span class="loc">Woods Flat</span>, from <span class="loc">Blayney</span> to <span class="loc">Cowra</span> in 1880s. Initially known also as <span class="loc">Woods Flat</span>, the name of the village was changed to <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> in 1886.</p>
