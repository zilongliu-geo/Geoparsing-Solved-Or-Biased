  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Brooklyn (/ˈbrʊklᵻn/) is the most populous of New <span class="loc">York City</span>'s five boroughs, with a Census-estimated 2,621,793 people in <span class="date">2014</span>. It is geographically adjacent to the <span class="loc">borough of Queens</span> at the western end of <span class="loc">Long Island</span>. Since <span class="date">1896</span>, Brooklyn has had the same boundaries as <span class="loc">Kings County</span>, the most populous county in <span class="loc">New York</span> state and the second-most densely populated county in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, after the county of <span class="loc">New York</span> (which is concurrent with the <span class="loc">borough of Manhattan</span>). With a land area of 71 square miles (180 km2) and water area of 26 square miles (67 km2), <span class="loc">Kings County</span> is <span class="loc">New York</span> state's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area, though it is the second-largest among the city's five boroughs. <span class="date">Today</span>, if it were an independent city, Brooklyn would rank as the fourth most populous city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>, behind only the other <span class="loc">boroughs of New York</span> City combined, <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, and <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. Brooklyn was an independent incorporated city (and previously an authorized village and town within the provisions of the <span class="loc">New York</span> State Constitution), until <span class="date">January 1, 1898</span>, when, after a long political campaign and public relations battle during the 1890s, according to the new Municipal <span class="org">Charter</span> of "Greater <span class="loc">New York</span>," Brooklyn was consolidated with the other cities, boroughs and counties to form the modern "City of <span class="loc">New York</span>" surrounding the Upper New <span class="loc">York Bay</span> with five constituent boroughs. It continues, however, to maintain a distinct culture. Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are ethnic enclaves where particular ethnic and nationality groups and cultures predominate. Brooklyn's official motto is Eendraght Maeckt Maght, which translates from early modern Dutch to "Unity makes strength." The motto is displayed on the Borough seal and flag, which also feature a young robed woman bearing a bundle of bound rods known as a "fasces," a traditional emblem of Republicanism. Brooklyn's official colors are blue and gold.</p><br><br>
