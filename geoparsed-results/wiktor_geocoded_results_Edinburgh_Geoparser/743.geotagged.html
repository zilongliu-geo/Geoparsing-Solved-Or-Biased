<p><span class="loc">Windsor</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windsor County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As the "Birthplace of <span class="loc">Vermont</span>", the town is where the Constitution of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> was adopted in 1777, thus marking the founding of the <span class="loc">Vermont</span> Republicâ€”a sovereign state until 1791 when <span class="loc">Vermont</span> joined the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Over much of its history, <span class="loc">Windsor</span> was home to a variety of manufacturing enterprises. The population was 3,553 at the 2010 census. One of the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> grants, <span class="loc">Windsor</span> was chartered as a town on July 6, 1761, by colonial governor Benning Wentworth. It was first settled in August 1764 by Captain Steele Smith and his family from <span class="loc">Farmington</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. In 1777, the signers of the Constitution of the <span class="loc">Vermont</span> Republic met at Old Constitution House, a tavern at the time, to declare independence from the British Empire (the <span class="loc">Vermont</span> Republic would not become a state until 1791). In 1820, it was the state's largest town, a thriving center for trade and agriculture. In 1835, the first dam was built across <span class="loc">Mill Brook</span> to provide water power. Factories made guns, machinery, tinware, furniture and harnesses. The community is named for <span class="loc">Windsor</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>.</p>
