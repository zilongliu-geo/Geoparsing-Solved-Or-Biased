  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Geneva</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ontario</span> and <span class="loc">Seneca</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. It is located at the northern end of <span class="loc">Seneca Lake</span>; all land portions of the city are within <span class="loc">Ontario County</span>; the water portions are in <span class="loc">Seneca County</span>. The population was 13,261 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Some claim it is named after the city and canton of <span class="loc">Geneva</span> in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. Others believe the name came from the word "<span class="loc">Seneca</span>". The main settlement of the <span class="loc">Seneca</span> was spelled Zoneshio by early white settlers, and was described as being 2 miles north of <span class="loc">Seneca Lake</span>. The city lies within the Town of <span class="loc">Geneva</span>. The city identifies as the "Lake Trout Capital of the World." The area was long occupied by the <span class="loc">Seneca</span> tribe, who established a major village of Kanadaseaga here by <span class="date">1687</span>. The British helped fortify the village against the French of <span class="loc">Canada</span> during <span class="date">the Seven Years</span>' War (locally known as the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span>); later they added defensive fortifications against the Americans during the Revolutionary War. During the latter warfare, the punitive Sullivan Expedition of <span class="date">1779</span> mounted by rebel forces destroyed many of the dwellings, as well as the <span class="date">winter</span> stores of the people, and they abandoned the ruins. Following the war and cession of the land by the <span class="loc">Seneca</span>, European-Americans settled here about <span class="date">1793</span>. They developed a town encouraged by the <span class="org">Pulteney Association</span>, which owned the land and was selling plots.</p><br><br>
