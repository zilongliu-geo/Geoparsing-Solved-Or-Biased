  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ostrovo</span> (Serbian Cyrillic: Острово) is a village in the urban municipality of <span class="loc">Kostolac</span>, which is part of the <span class="loc">city of Požarevac</span>, <span class="loc">Serbia</span>. According to the <span class="date">2002</span> census, the village has a population of 685 people. "Ostrovo" means "island" in Serbian. This name originates from the fact that <span class="loc">Ostrovo</span> is located on former Danube island (see: <span class="loc">Ostrvo</span>, <span class="loc">Kostolac</span>) that historically was part of <span class="loc">Banat region</span>. In Serbian, the village is known as <span class="loc">Ostrovo</span> (Острово), in German as <span class="loc">Ostrova</span>, and in Hungarian as Temessziget. Village was formed during the Great Serb migration, led by Arsenije Čarnojević. Until <span class="date">1751</span>, <span class="loc">Ostrovo</span> was part of the Habsburg Banat of Temeswar and then part of the Habsburg Military Frontier. From <span class="date">1848</span> to <span class="date">1849</span>, it was part of Serbian <span class="loc">Vojvodina</span>, but in <span class="date">1849</span> it was again included into Military Frontier. After abolishment of the frontier, in <span class="date">1873</span>, <span class="loc">Ostrovo</span> was included into <span class="loc">Temes County</span> of the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Hungary</span> and Austria-Hungary. It was part of the Kovin municipality within the county. According to <span class="date">1910</span> census, ethnic Serbs were in absolute majority in <span class="loc">Ostrovo</span>. Other ethnic groups that lived in the village were Germans, Hungarians and Romanians.</p><br><br>
