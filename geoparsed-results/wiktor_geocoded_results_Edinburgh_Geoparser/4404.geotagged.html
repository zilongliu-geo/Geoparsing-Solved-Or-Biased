<p><span class="loc">Coldstream</span> (Scottish Gaelic: An Sruthan Fuar , Scots: Caustrim) is a town and civil parish in the Scottish Borders area of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It lies on the north bank of the <span class="loc">River Tweed</span> in <span class="loc">Berwickshire</span>, while <span class="loc">Northumberland</span> in <span class="loc">England</span> lies to the south bank, with Cornhill-on-Tweed the nearest village. A former burgh, <span class="loc">Coldstream</span> is the home of the Coldstream Guards, a regiment in the British Army, and is the location where Edward I of <span class="loc">England</span> invaded <span class="loc">Scotland</span> in 1296. At the 2001 census, the town had a population of 1,813, which was estimated to have risen to 2,050 by 2006. The parish, in 2001, had a population of 2,186. In February 1316 during the Wars of Scottish Independence, Sir James Douglas defeated a numerically superior force of Gascon soldiery led by Edmond de Caillou at the <span class="loc">Skaithmuir</span> to the north of the town. In the 18th and 19th centuries, <span class="loc">Coldstream</span> was a popular centre for runaway marriages, much like <span class="loc">Gretna Green</span>, as it lay on a major road (now the A697). Notable buildings in the town include the toll house where marriages were conducted, and The Hirsel, which is the family seat of the Earls of Home.</p>
