<p><span class="loc">Medellin</span> is a municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Cebu</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 50,047. In the 2013 election, it had 29,987 registered voters. The municipality of <span class="loc">Medellin</span> is one of the nine municipalities comprising the 4th Congressional District of <span class="loc">Cebu Province</span>. It is approximately 120 kilometres (75 mi) north from <span class="loc">Cebu City</span> via barangay <span class="loc">Curva</span>, or 113 kilometres (70 mi) via barangay Luy‑a. The town is bounded on the north by <span class="loc">Daanbantayan</span>; on the south by <span class="loc">San Remigio</span> and <span class="loc">Bogo</span>; on the east by the <span class="loc">Camotes Sea</span> and on the west by the Tañon Strait. Based on cadastral survey, the municipality of <span class="loc">Medellin</span> has a total land area of 73.82 km2 (28.5 sq mi). <span class="loc">Medellin</span> comprises 19 barangays: The name <span class="loc">Medellin</span> is of Spanish origin and refers to the village with the same name in the <span class="loc">Badajoz province</span> of <span class="loc">Extremadura</span> in <span class="loc">Spain</span>. <span class="loc">Medellin</span> became a municipality by royal decree of Queen Isabel II of <span class="loc">Spain</span> on September 9, 1881. <span class="loc">Medellin</span> was formerly part of <span class="loc">Daanbantayan</span>. As a town, it started with only 3 barangays, namely; <span class="loc">Kawit</span> and <span class="loc">Buenavista</span> on the west coast, and <span class="loc">Tindog</span> on the east coast. <span class="loc">Kawit</span>, being the biggest and most progressive barangay at that time, became the first seat of government. But because of its deep shore water, the area was prone to pirates. As a consequence, the seat of government was then transferred to <span class="loc">Buenavista</span> (<span class="loc">Daanlungsod</span>). However, in view of its shallow shore water, traders and merchants found it difficult to transport their wares to and from <span class="loc">Buenavista</span>. A distance away south of <span class="loc">Buenavista</span>, there was a place called <span class="loc">Tawagan</span> which was an ideal site for trade and commerce. When the seat of government was transferred to <span class="loc">Tawagan</span>, the new poblacion was then called <span class="loc">Medellin</span>.</p>
