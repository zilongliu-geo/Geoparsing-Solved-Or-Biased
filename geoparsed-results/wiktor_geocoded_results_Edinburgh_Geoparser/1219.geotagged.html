<p><span class="loc">Jamestown</span> is a city in <span class="loc">southern Chautauqua County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 31,146 at the 2010 census. Situated between <span class="loc">Lake Erie</span> to the northwest and the <span class="loc">Allegheny National Forest</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> is the largest population center in the county. Nearby <span class="loc">Chautauqua Lake</span> is a fresh water resource enjoyed by fishermen, boaters and naturalists. <span class="loc">Chautauqua Institution</span> is approximately 17 miles away, offering music, theater, educational classes and lectures for nine weeks during the summer. Notable people from the <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> area include comedienne Lucille Ball; Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson; naturalist Roger Tory Peterson; singer Natalie Merchant; and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Products developed in <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> include the crescent wrench and automatic voting machines. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was once called the "Furniture Capital of the World" where people visited from all over the country to attend furniture expositions at the Furniture Mart, a building that still stands in the city and currently houses offices for a variety of companies. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> is named after James Prendergast, an early <span class="loc">Chautauqua County</span> settler. His family purchased 3,500 acres (14 km2) in 1806, in the area now known as <span class="loc">Chautauqua County</span>. James Prendergast explored the area that is now <span class="loc">Jamestown</span>. Prendergast saw the area to be valuable, and so he purchased 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of land in the area in 1808. In the fall of 1809, Prendergast and an employee, John Blowers built a log cabin, which became the first building in <span class="loc">Jamestown</span>. Another log cabin as well as mills and a dam were built on the <span class="loc">Chadakoin River</span> later on. In 1855, Nightwatch was created for the purpose of looking out for fires.</p>
