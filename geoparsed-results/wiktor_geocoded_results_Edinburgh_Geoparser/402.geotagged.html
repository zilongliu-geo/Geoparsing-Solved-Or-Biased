<p><span class="loc">El Porvenir</span> (Spanish: "The Future") is a municipio (municipality) and township in the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Chiapas</span>. <span class="loc">El Porvenir</span> was given town status with the creation of the municipality on 13 January 1890. The city was formally known as <span class="loc">El Porvenir</span> de Velasco Suárez in honour of prominent neurologist Manuel Velasco Suárez, Governor of <span class="loc">Chiapas</span> during the period 1970 to 1976, but that nomenclature is now considered obsolete. The town (locality) of <span class="loc">El Porvenir</span> is located at an official elevation of 2,839 m (9,314 ft) above mean sea level in the <span class="loc">Sierra Madre</span> highlands of <span class="loc">Chiapas</span>, at 15°27′20″N 92°16′46″W, close to the Guatemalan border. It is the second-highest municipal seat in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, trailing only the seat of Emiliano Zapata Municipality, <span class="loc">Tlaxcala</span>. The municipality covers a total surface area of 121.70 km² and, in the 2010 census, reported a population of 13,201 inhabitants. Of this total, 1,436 lived in the municipal seat, its only urban locality. On August 27, 2001 President Vicente Fox attended a ceremony in <span class="loc">El Porvenir</span> in which the municipality was officially twinned with <span class="loc">San</span> Pedro Garza García, Nuevo León, thus symbolically uniting the country's industrial, developed north with its rural, underdeveloped south.</p>
