<p><span class="loc">Milford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Penobscot County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located across the <span class="loc">Penobscot River</span> from the city of <span class="loc">Old Town</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Milford</span> was 3,070 at the 2010 census. The town's slogan is the "Best little town by a dam site," referring to the <span class="loc">Milford</span> Dam abutting <span class="loc">Milford</span> on the <span class="loc">Penobscot River</span>, south of the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation. <span class="loc">Milford</span> was the site of a major 19th century water powered sawmill on the <span class="loc">Penobscot River</span>. Most of its lumber was shipped from nearby <span class="loc">Bangor</span>. The large Bodwell Water Power Co. sawmills (1889), owned by <span class="loc">Maine</span> Governor Joseph Robinson Bodwell, burned in 1891, almost taking the village with it. The present Bodwell Water Power Co. plant, also known as the <span class="loc">Milford</span> Plant of Bangor Hydro, was built in 1906 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was designed by <span class="loc">Wallace</span> C. Johnson, a civil engineer who also worked on hydro-power projects at <span class="loc">Niagara Falls</span>. The <span class="loc">Milford</span> Congregational Church, designed and built by Asa T. Wing, is also listed on the National Register.</p>
