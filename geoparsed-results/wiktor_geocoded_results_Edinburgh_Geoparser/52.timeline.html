  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Aurora</span> (/əˈrɔərə/, /əˈrɔːrə/) is a Home Rule Municipality in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, spanning <span class="loc">Arapahoe</span> and <span class="loc">Adams</span> counties, with the extreme southeastern portion of the city extending into <span class="loc">Douglas County</span>. <span class="per">Aurora</span> is one of the principal cities of the <span class="org">Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area (<span class="per">Metro Denver</span>). The city's population was 325,078 in the <span class="date">2010</span> census, which made it the third most populous city in the state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span> and the 54th most populous city in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The <span class="org">Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area had an estimated population of 2,645,209 on <span class="date">July 1, 2012</span> (the 21st most populous MSA in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>). However, <span class="per">Denver</span> and <span class="per">Aurora</span> combined make up less than half of the <span class="org">Denver Metro Area</span>'s population and <span class="per">Aurora</span> has approximately half the population of <span class="per">Denver</span>. The estimated population of <span class="org">Denver-Aurora, CO</span> Combined Statistical Area was 3,214,218 on <span class="date">July 1, 2012</span> (16th most populous CSA). <span class="per">Aurora</span> originated in the 1880s as the town of Fletcher, taking its name from <span class="per">Denver</span> businessman <span class="per">Donald Fletcher</span> who saw it as a real estate opportunity. He and his partners staked out four square miles east of <span class="loc">Denver</span>, but the town - and <span class="loc">Colorado</span> - struggled mightily after the Silver Crash of <span class="date">1893</span>. At that point Fletcher skipped town, leaving the community with a huge water debt. Inhabitants decided to rename the town <span class="per">Aurora</span> in <span class="date">1907</span>, after one of the subdivisions composing the town, and <span class="per">Aurora</span> slowly began to grow in <span class="per">Denver</span>'s shadow becoming the fastest-growing city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> during <span class="date">the late 1970s and early 1980s</span>. <span class="per">Aurora</span> is composed of hundreds of subdivisions thus carries the name of one of the original development plats from which it sprang.</p><br><br>
