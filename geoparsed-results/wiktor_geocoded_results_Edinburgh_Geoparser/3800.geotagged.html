<p><span class="loc">Colombo</span> (Sinhala: කොළඹ, pronounced [ˈkəlɐmbɞ]; <span class="loc">Tamil</span>: கொழும்பு) is the commercial capital and largest city of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>. According to the <span class="loc">Brookings Institution</span>, <span class="loc">Colombo</span> has a population of 5.6 million metropolitan area, and 752,993 in the City proper. It is the financial centre of the island and a popular tourist destination. It is located on the west coast of the island and adjacent to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, the legislative capital of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>. <span class="loc">Colombo</span> is often referred to as the capital since Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is within the urban area of, and a satellite city of, <span class="loc">Colombo</span>. It is also the administrative capital of <span class="loc">Western Province</span>, <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> and the district capital of <span class="loc">Colombo District</span>. <span class="loc">Colombo</span> is a busy and vibrant place with a mixture of modern life and colonial buildings and ruins. It was the legislative capital of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> until 1982. Due to its large harbour and its strategic position along the East-West sea trade routes, <span class="loc">Colombo</span> was known to ancient traders 2,000 years ago. It was made the capital of the island when <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> was ceded to the British Empire in 1815, and its status as capital was retained when the nation became independent in 1948. In 1978, when administrative functions were moved to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, <span class="loc">Colombo</span> was designated as the commercial capital of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>.</p>
