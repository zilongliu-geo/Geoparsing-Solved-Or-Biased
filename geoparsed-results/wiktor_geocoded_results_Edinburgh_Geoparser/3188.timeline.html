  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Madison</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 24,841 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The population is currently over 25,000. It is part of the <span class="loc">Jackson Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is currently the highest income city in the state. It is ranked the 2nd most livable city in <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> by AreaVibes.com. The <span class="loc">city of Madison</span>, named for <span class="per">James Madison</span>, the fourth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, developed along a bustling railroad track in antebellum <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. It began in <span class="date">1856</span> when the <span class="org">Illinois Central Railroad</span> opened <span class="loc">Madison</span> Station, the forerunner of the <span class="loc">city of Madison</span>. The nearby town of <span class="loc">Madisonville</span> was a settlement established along the stagecoach route on the Natchez Trace. It was the first county seat of <span class="loc">Madison County</span> in <span class="date">1828</span>, and had a race track, two banks, a wagon factory, and at least one hotel. Its residents gradually moved to the new railroad community, and old <span class="loc">Madisonville</span> became defunct. . Like many railroad towns in the South, <span class="loc">Madison</span> Station was heavily damaged by the <span class="org">Union Army during the Civil War</span>. Ten miles from the state capital of <span class="per">Jackson, Madison</span> Station was largely destroyed in <span class="date">1863</span> after the <span class="date">July 18</span>â€“22 siege of <span class="per">Jackson</span>. No battles were fought in <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, but Major General <span class="per">Stephen D. Lee</span> concentrated his command in <span class="loc">Madison</span> Station during the month of <span class="date">February 1864</span>. <span class="per">Stephen Lee</span> was later appointed as the first president of <span class="org">Mississippi State College</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="org">Mississippi State University</span>).</p><br><br>
