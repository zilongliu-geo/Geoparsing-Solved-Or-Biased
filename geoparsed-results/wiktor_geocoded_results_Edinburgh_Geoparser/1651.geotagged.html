<p><span class="loc">Maji</span> (also <span class="loc">Machi</span>) is a town in southern <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Boma</span> Plateau, lying in the Bench <span class="loc">Maji</span> Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region, and has a longitude and latitude of 6°12′N 35°35′E with an elevation variously given as 2104, 2258 and 2430 meters above sea level. The town is the administrative center for the Maji woreda. Postal service in <span class="loc">Maji</span> started at some time between 1923-1932. From the 1930s the town had a customs post and a telephone station. The town is served by Tume Airport (ICAO code HAMJ). <span class="loc">Maji</span> was founded around 1897 when <span class="loc">Ras</span> <span class="loc">Welde</span> <span class="loc">Giyorgis</span> stationed a garrison of Ethiopian soldiers near the lands of the ture, a personage <span class="loc">Garretson</span> describes as "the most powerful and respected religious figure in the area." <span class="loc">Garretson</span> explains how an administrative center for the region soon followed: "Built on a commanding hill were a fortified encampment of gibbi (the personal headquarters of the governor), a church and a market. All were carefully observed and guarded by the governor and his retinue of soldiers." Richard Pankhurst records that its governor, Dejazmach Taye, amazed by the growing trade at <span class="loc">Gambela</span> to the west of him, during the 1920s attempted to develop exports of coffee, rubber, hides and ivory through the port town.</p>
