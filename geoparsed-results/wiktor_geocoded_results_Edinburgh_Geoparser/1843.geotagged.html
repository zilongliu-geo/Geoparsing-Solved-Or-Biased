<p><span class="loc">Taoyuan</span> (Chinese: 桃園市; pinyin: Táoyuán Shì), is a special municipality in northwestern <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>, neighboring New <span class="loc">Taipei</span>, <span class="loc">Hsinchu County</span>, and <span class="loc">Yilan County</span>. <span class="loc">Taoyuan District</span> is the seat of the municipal government and that which, along with <span class="loc">Zhongli District</span>, forms a large metropolitan area, home to many industrial parks and tech company headquarters. <span class="loc">Taoyuan</span> developed from a satellite <span class="loc">city of Taipei</span> metropolitan area to be the fourth-largest metropolitan area, and fifth-largest populated city in <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>. Since commuting to the <span class="loc">Taipei</span> metropolitan area is easy, <span class="loc">Taoyuan</span> has seen the fastest population growth of all cities in <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>. "Taoyuan" means "peach garden," since the area used to have many peach blossom trees. <span class="loc">Taoyuan</span> is the native home to the Pingpu tribe of aborigines. It is also one of <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>'s important industrial regions. Taipei Taoyuan International Airport, which serves the capital, <span class="loc">Taipei</span> and the rest of northern <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>, is located in this city. The current <span class="loc">city of Taoyuan</span> achieved its current form in 2014 when the former <span class="loc">Taoyuan County</span> was elevated to special municipality status. At the same time, the original county-controlled <span class="loc">city of Taoyuan</span> became <span class="loc">Taoyuan District</span> within the new municipality.</p>
