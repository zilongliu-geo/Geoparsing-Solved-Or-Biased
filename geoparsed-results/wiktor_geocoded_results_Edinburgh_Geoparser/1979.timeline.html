  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Scioto County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies in far southern <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, just east of the mouth of the <span class="loc">Scioto River</span> at the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>, and across from <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The population was 20,226 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>'s European-American roots date to the 1790s, when the small town of Alexandria was founded west of <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>'s site. Alexandria was flooded numerous times by the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and the <span class="loc">Scioto</span> rivers, especially in a massive flood in <span class="date">January</span> and <span class="date">February 1937</span>. In <span class="date">1803</span>, <span class="per">Henry Massie</span> spotted a place to move the town away from the flood plains. He began to plot the new city by mapping the streets and distributing the land. <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> was founded in <span class="date">1803</span> and was established as a city in <span class="date">1815</span>. Alexandria soon disappeared. <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> quickly grew around an industrial base due to its location at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Scioto</span> rivers; early industrial growth included having meat packing and shipping facilities for <span class="per">Thomas Worthington</span>'s Chillicothe farm, located north of <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> on the <span class="loc">Scioto River</span>. <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> growth continued with the completion of the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Erie Canal</span>, which provided access to the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span>, opening up northern markets. The construction of the N&amp;W railyards and the B&amp;O junction at the city also stimulated growth, with railroads soon carrying more freight than the canal. By the end of the 19th century, <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> became one of the most important cities on the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> between <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span> and <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>.</p><br><br>
