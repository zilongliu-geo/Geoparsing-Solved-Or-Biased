<p>Kendall is an census-designated place and unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Miami-Dade County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the area had a total population of 75,371. While the US Census Bureau has defined the boundaries of Kendall, locals often include western communities, such as The Hammocks, <span class="loc">Country Walk</span>, The Crossings, <span class="loc">Kendale</span> Lakes, Kendall West, and <span class="loc">Three Lakes</span>, as subdivisions of Kendall. According to the census, Kendall and neighboring communities are home to over 11,000 Cuban Americans, one of the largest populations in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Kendall is served by the Miami Metrorail at <span class="loc">Dadeland</span> North and <span class="loc">Dadeland</span> South stations in its northeastern end. Both stations provide metro service from <span class="loc">Dadeland</span> to <span class="loc">Miami</span> commercial centers like <span class="loc">Coral Gables</span>, Downtown Miami, and Miami International Airport. <span class="loc">Dadeland</span> South station is a major transit depot in the area, connecting the southernmost suburbs of Homestead and <span class="loc">Florida City</span> to Metrorail via limited-stop bus rapid transit along the South Miami-Dade Busway. Much of what is now Kendall was purchased from the State of <span class="loc">Florida</span> in 1883 by the <span class="loc">Florida</span> Land and Mortgage Company. It was named for Henry John Broughton Kendall, a director of <span class="loc">Florida</span> Land and Mortgage who moved to the area in the 1900s to manage the company's land. As the land was not open to homesteading, development was slow well into the 20th century. A post office opened in 1914, and the first school opened in 1929. After the end of the land boom in 1926, some residents left. Two Seminole camps were in the Kendall area, and Seminoles continued to live there into the 1940s.</p>
