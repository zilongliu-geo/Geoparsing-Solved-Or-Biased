<p><span class="loc">Ireland</span> (/ˈaɪərlənd/; Irish: Éire [ˈeːɾʲə]; Ulster-Scots: Airlann [ˈɑːrlən]) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from <span class="loc">Great Britain</span> to its east by the <span class="loc">North Channel</span>, the <span class="loc">Irish Sea</span>, and St George's Channel. <span class="loc">Ireland</span> is the second-largest island of the <span class="loc">British Isles</span>, the third-largest in <span class="loc">Europe</span>, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. Politically, <span class="loc">Ireland</span> is divided between the <span class="loc">Republic of Ireland</span> (officially named <span class="loc">Ireland</span>), which covers five-sixths of the island, and <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>, which is part of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, in the northeast of the island. In 2011 the population of <span class="loc">Ireland</span> was about 6.4 million, ranking it the second-most populous island in <span class="loc">Europe</span> after <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>. Just under 4.6 million live in the <span class="loc">Republic of Ireland</span> and just over 1.8 million live in <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>. The island's geography comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. The island has lush vegetation, a product of its mild but changeable climate which avoids extremes in temperature. Thick woodlands covered the island until the Middle Ages. As of 2013, the amount of land that is wooded in <span class="loc">Ireland</span> is about 11% of the total, compared with a European average of 35%. There are 26 extant mammal species native to <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. The Irish climate is very moderated and classified as oceanic. As a result, winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area. However, summers are cooler than those in Continental <span class="loc">Europe</span>. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.</p>
