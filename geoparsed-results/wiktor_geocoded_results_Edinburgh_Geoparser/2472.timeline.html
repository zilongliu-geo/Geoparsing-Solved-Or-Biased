  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montenegro</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [monteˈneɣɾo]) is a municipality in the western part of the department of Quindío, <span class="loc">Colombia</span>. It is located 10 km west of the departmental capital <span class="loc">Armenia</span>. <span class="loc">Montenegro</span> (literally: <span class="loc">Black Mountain</span>) was named for the dark green color of the trees that originally covered the hill above the current-day site of the township, which was visible from other parts of the region as it rose above the surrounding guadua forests. Between <span class="date">1897</span> and <span class="date">1904</span>, <span class="loc">Montenegro</span> was officially known as Villa Quindío. The boundaries of <span class="loc">Montenegro</span> are principally formed by three rivers. To the north, the <span class="loc">Roble</span> River forms the limit with <span class="loc">Quimbaya</span>; to the east and south, the <span class="loc">Espejo</span> River forms the limit with <span class="loc">Armenia</span> and <span class="loc">La Tebaida</span>; and to the west <span class="loc">La Vieja</span> River is the limit with the neighboring department of <span class="per">Valle del Cauca</span>. There is also a short boundary with <span class="loc">Circasia</span> in the northeast of the municipality. In <span class="date">2005</span> it had an estimated population of 45,000, of which 36,400 live in the main urban zone. Located in the heart of <span class="loc">Colombia</span>'s coffee zone, <span class="loc">Montenegro</span> is also home to the National Coffee Park. Founded by the Colombian Coffee Federation, the park hosts numerous thematic attractions based on Colombian history and the country's thriving coffee culture. The rural landscape of <span class="loc">Montenegro</span> is typical of the coffee zone, and the hotel and posadas infrastructure has increased dramatically in the <span class="date">2000</span>-<span class="date">2005</span> period. It is an important tourism and convention destination for a relaxed vacation featuring nature-watching and cultural trips (related to the coffee-growing techniques).</p><br><br>
