  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Ashley is a village located in the southwest of <span class="loc">Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies on the eastern outskirts of <span class="loc">New Milton</span> in the <span class="loc">New Forest</span> district, and is two miles (3 km) inland from the sea. Its history dates back to the Domesday book of <span class="date">1086</span>, when two estates were recorded. In the 15th century much of Ashley merged with a neighbouring manor, and the estate became known as Ashley Arnewood. As a village, Ashley began to develop in the 19th century when a church and a school were built. Most of the current village was built in the 20th century, and <span class="date">today</span> Ashley is effectively a suburb of <span class="loc">New Milton</span>. Humans have lived in the Ashley area for <span class="date">thousands of years</span>. Two Palaeolithic hand axes were found in gravel excavated from the gravel pits at Ashley, and are <span class="date">now</span> in the Red House Museum in <span class="loc">Christchurch</span>. A third axe was found in <span class="date">1962</span>. The name Ashley means "ash wood/clearing". In the Domesday book of <span class="date">1086</span>, two estates, <span class="per">Esselie</span> and <span class="per">Esselei</span>, are recorded. The first was possessed by "Nigel the doctor" from <span class="per">Roger de Montgomerie</span>, 1st <span class="per">Earl of Shrewsbury</span>; before <span class="date">1066</span> it had been held by Saewulf. The other estate was in <span class="date">1086</span> held by the sons of <span class="per">Godric Malf</span>, who had himself held it from the king prior to <span class="date">1066</span>. Ashley was probably included in the grant of <span class="loc">Christchurch</span> made by <span class="per">Henry I</span> to <span class="per">Richard de Redvers</span>, because his successor <span class="per">Earl William</span> in about <span class="date">1200</span> granted an estate there in free marriage to Hawise the wife of <span class="per">William Avenel</span>. She gave it to her son Nicholas, on whose death it went to his son <span class="per">William Avenel</span>. He held it as the manor of Ashley, and when he died without children in <span class="date">1253</span> it passed to the <span class="org">Crown</span>. It was granted in <span class="date">the following year</span> to <span class="per">Thomas Waleran</span> in recognition of the good service rendered by him in <span class="loc">Gascony</span>, but in <span class="date">1263</span> it was again in the hands of the lord of <span class="loc">Christchurch</span>, because <span class="per">Baldwin de Redvers</span>, 7th <span class="per">Earl of Devon</span>, died in possession of it in <span class="date">that year</span>. At the beginning of the 14th century <span class="per">Reginald de Bettesthorne</span> had lands in Ashley worth 5 shillings yearly.</p><br><br>
