  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Heroica Nogales</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [eˈɾoika noˈɣales]), more commonly known as <span class="loc">Nogales</span>, is a city and the county seat of the Municipality of <span class="loc">Nogales</span>. It is located on the northern border of the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Sonora</span>. The city is abutted on its north by the <span class="loc">city of Nogales</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, across the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>-<span class="loc">Mexico</span> border. The independent <span class="loc">Nogales</span> Municipality, which included the town of <span class="loc">Nogales</span>, was established on <span class="date">July 11, 1884</span>. The <span class="loc">Nogales</span> Municipality covers an area of 1,675 km². <span class="loc">Nogales</span> was declared a city within the Municipality on <span class="date">January 1, 1920</span>. The international trade that existed between the two cities greatly propelled the economic development of <span class="loc">Nogales</span>, <span class="loc">Sonora</span>, and the greater <span class="loc">Northern Sonora region</span>, but that did not prevent significant problems from forming in the area after the outbreak of the <span class="date">1910</span> Mexican Revolution. On <span class="date">August 27, 1918</span>, when at about 4:10 pm, a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a Mexican civilian attempted to pass through the border, back to <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, without being interrogated at the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Customs house. After the initial shooting, reinforcements from both sides rushed to the border. On the Mexican side, the majority of the belligerents were angry civilians upset with the killings of Mexican border crossers by the <span class="org">U.S. Army</span> along the vaguely defined border between the two cities during <span class="date">the previous year</span> (the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Border Patrol did not exist until <span class="date">1924</span>). For the Americans, the reinforcements were the 10th Cavalry, off-duty 35th Regimental soldiers and milita. Hostilities quickly escalated and several soldiers were killed and others wounded on both sides. The mayor of <span class="loc">Nogales</span>, <span class="loc">Sonora</span>, Felix B. Peñaloza was killed when waving a white truce flag/handkerchief with his cane.</p><br><br>
