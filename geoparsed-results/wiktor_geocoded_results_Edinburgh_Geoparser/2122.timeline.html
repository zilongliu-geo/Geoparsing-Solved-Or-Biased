  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hopewell</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Covington County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. One of the oldest settlements in <span class="loc">Covington County</span>, one of Hopewell's earliest settlers was Thomas Ates, who bought land from the Choctaw Natives. Ben and <span class="per">Mary Duckworth</span> were also early settlers, and named the town after the Biblical account of Moses' and Abraham's definition of hope: "to trust, expect, await, and endure". Many emancipated slaves settled in <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> after the Civil War. The <span class="org">New Hopewell School</span> was constructed in <span class="date">1885</span>, and was located several miles north of the town, at the present site of the New Hopewell <span class="per">Church</span> and <span class="per">Cemetery</span>. The school operated until <span class="date">1950</span>. In <span class="date">1922</span>, <span class="loc">Covington County</span> authorities created the <span class="org">Hopewell Colored Separate School District</span> in response to petitions by black citizens for improved educational opportunities. <span class="date">Two years later</span>, Hopewell's black residents sued <span class="loc">Covington County</span> after they realized they were being "doubly taxed" by the county. The boundaries of the Colored district encompassed only black-owned properties, while the larger boundaries of the white school district–created over <span class="date">a decade</span> earlier–encompassed both white and black-owned properties. The citizens lost their lawsuit; the judge ruling that it was happenstance that all blacks but no whites lived in both school districts. Furthermore, any whites who bought property in the <span class="loc">Hopewell district</span> would also bear this double burden.</p><br><br>
