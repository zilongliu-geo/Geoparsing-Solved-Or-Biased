  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Kaine</span> signs legislation to allow ‘Choose Life’ license plates. Gov. <span class="per">Timothy M. Kaine</span> has signed legislation to permit "Choose Life" license plates. Virginia joins 23 other states that offer the plate -- some after lengthy court battles. <span class="per">Kaine</span>'s predecessor as governor, fellow Democrat Mark R. Warner, vetoed legislation to allow such a license plate in <span class="date">2003</span>. "I sign this legislation <span class="date">today</span> in keeping with the commonwealth's longtime practice of approving special plates with all manner of political and social messages," <span class="per">Kaine</span> said in a statement. "Furthermore, if Planned Parenthood -- an organization that is already a recipient of state budget funds -- or another similar organization ever chooses to seek a specialty license plate in Virginia, I believe the constitution would require the state to approve that plate to protect against any viewpoint discrimination." Sen. <span class="per">Ken Cuccinelli</span>, R-Fairfax, attached the proposal onto a bill that also adds plates honoring the Washington Capitals, the Blue Ridge Parkway and others to the 200 specialty plates the <span class="org">Department of Motor Vehicles</span> already offers. Under law, more than 350 people must sign up for a plate before DMV can produce it. <span class="per">Cuccinelli</span> said 450 people have prepaid for the plate. After the first 1,000 plates are sold, $15 of the $25 fee would go to crisis pregnancy centers.</p><br><br>
