<p><span class="loc">Sandur</span> (meaning sandy beach) is a village on the south coast of the island of <span class="loc">Sandoy</span> in the <span class="loc">Faroe Islands</span>. The Sandur hoard, dating to the end of the 11th century, attests to the long history of the village. In January 2010 the population stood at 558. The Municipality of <span class="loc">Sandur</span> consists of the village of <span class="loc">Sandur</span> only. It is the most populous place on the "<span class="loc">Sand Island</span>", and is situated on a peninsula between the lakes Gróthúsvatn in the northwest and <span class="loc">Sandsvatn</span> in the northeast, facing the inlets Grótvík and Sandsvágur in the south. <span class="loc">Sandur</span> is an old site of the thing where every year the local Várting was held. Excavations here have unearthed a stave church from the 11th century, where today there is a typical Faroese wooden church with grass roof. In 1988 the modern church suffered a devastating fire in which all of the church's silver melted. The fire turned out to be arson. In the following year the church was restored, just in time for its 150th anniversary. In 1863 while extending the churchyard a treasure of silver was found consisting of 98 coins from the 11th century, half of them of German origin. Furthermore in 1989 archaeologists discovered a pagan burial ground from the times of Viking occupation. The burial included the well-preserved skeleton of a woman from the <span class="loc">Faroe Islands</span> in a grave 150 cm long. The grave also included three beads of amber, a blue glass bead, and a knife.</p>
