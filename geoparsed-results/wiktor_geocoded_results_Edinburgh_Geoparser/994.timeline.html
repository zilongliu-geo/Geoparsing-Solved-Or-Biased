  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Linden is a city in southeastern <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="org">New York Metropolitan Area</span>, which is about 13 miles (21 km) southwest of Manhattan, and bordering <span class="loc">Staten Island</span>, a <span class="loc">borough of New York</span> City. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city's population was 40,499, reflecting an increase of 1,105 (+2.8%) from the 39,394 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 2,693 (+7.3%) from the 36,701 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. Linden was originally formed as a township on <span class="date">March 4, 1861</span> from portions of Elizabeth, <span class="org">Rahway and Union Township</span>. Portions of the township were taken to form <span class="loc">Cranford</span> (<span class="date">March 14, 1871</span>), Linden Borough (<span class="date">March 30, 1882</span>) and Roselle (<span class="date">December 20, 1894</span>). Linden was incorporated as a city by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on <span class="date">January 1, 1925</span>, replacing both Linden Township and Linden Borough, based on the results of a referendum held on <span class="date">November 8, 1923</span>. The city's name derives from linden trees brought from <span class="loc">Germany</span>.</p><br><br>
