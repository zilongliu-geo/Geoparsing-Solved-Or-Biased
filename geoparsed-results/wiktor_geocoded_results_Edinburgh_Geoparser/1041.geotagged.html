<p><span class="loc">Marion</span> is a suburb in the <span class="loc">City of Marion</span> in Adelaide around 10 km south-west of the CBD. Founded as a rural village in 1838 on the banks of the <span class="loc">Sturt River</span>, <span class="loc">Marion</span> was found to have rich soil and the population expanded rapidly. Colonel William Light laid out the plan for the village, as he had done with the <span class="loc">City of Adelaide</span> itself. <span class="loc">Marion</span> is bordered on the north by Oaklands Road, on the east by <span class="loc">Marion</span> Road, on the south by Sturt Road and on the west by a roughly straight line from <span class="loc">Finniss</span> Street in the south to The Parade. The township of <span class="loc">Marion</span> was laid out by William Light and B. T. Finniss in 1838, and was (mis)named for Marianne Fisher (1827–1927), daughter of the Resident Commissioner, James Hurtle Fisher. Vegetables, stone fruits, almonds and grapes were all produced in <span class="loc">Marion</span>. Richard Hamilton started the first vineyard in 1838 and his family continues its wine making tradition to this day. By the late 19th century <span class="loc">Marion</span> was also home to a number of industries such as a mining and brick making. However, the population at this time was still very small – around 350 people.Gradually the Adelaide sprawl crept up to <span class="loc">Marion</span>, and by the 1950s the suburb was well and truly enveloped.</p>
