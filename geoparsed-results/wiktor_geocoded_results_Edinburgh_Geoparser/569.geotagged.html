<p>Milton is an inner suburb of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, approximately 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the central business district. The suburb is a mixture of light industry, warehouses, commercial offices, retail and single and multiple occupancy residences. The main roads are Milton Road, which runs beside the main western rail line and Coronation Drive (formerly River Road), which runs along the <span class="loc">Brisbane River</span>. Settlement in the Milton area by Europeans began in the 1840s, with land mostly used for farming and grazing. The suburb's name was derived from the farm name "<span class="loc">Milton Farm</span>", used from the late 1840s by Ambrose Eldridge, chemist. Eldridge named the farm after John Milton, the English poet. Between 1900 and 1962, Milton was served by trams running along Milton Road from <span class="loc">Toowong</span> and <span class="loc">Rainworth</span>, with the latter branching off at Baroona Road. The services were withdrawn after the disastrous <span class="loc">Paddington</span> tram depot fire and replaced by buses. The suburb continues to be served by most western suburb bus routes operated by <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> Transport. Between 1927 and 1969, the <span class="loc">Brisbane City</span> Council's tramway workshops were located at Boomerang Street, a site formerly used as a nightsoil dump. Trams accessed the workshops from Milton Road, under the railway line. After the closure of the tram system on 13 April 1969, the workshops continued to be used to service the City Council's bus fleet, until the workshop complex was shifted to <span class="loc">Toowong</span> in 1979. The workshops were then demolished and the site used as a successful "Park and Ride" car park, where commuters could park their cars at the edge of the CBD and continue their journey by bus. However, in the late 1980s, a change in City Council policy saw the site sold for office development.</p>
