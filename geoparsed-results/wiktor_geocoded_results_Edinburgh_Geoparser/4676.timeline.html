  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Cortez is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Merced County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railroad 11.5 miles (19 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Atwater</span>, at an elevation of 141 feet (43 m). Founding Some of <span class="loc">California</span>'s early agricultural colonies owe their birth to the idealism of Abiko Kyutaro. Born in Niigata Prefecture <span class="loc">Japan</span> in <span class="date">1865</span>, he was raised by his grandfather in less than favorable economic conditions. At seventeen he moved to <span class="loc">Tokyo</span> with hopes jumping on a ship to <span class="loc">America</span>, but he ended up working there for <span class="date">a few years</span> instead. During this time he became devout Christian and then came to <span class="loc">America</span> as a student in <span class="date">1885</span>, like several other initial Japanese immigrants. <span class="date">A decade later</span>, <span class="loc">Abiko</span> became a somewhat of a successful businessman and began his personal mission to aid other fellow Japanese in settling in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In <span class="date">1899</span> his news paper entitled Nichibei Shimbun became the most prominent Japanese newspaper. The paper took on issues such as restrictions on Japanese immigration and education discrimination. Abikoâ€™s paper not only helped publicize issues important to Japanese Americans, but it also created ties among newly formed Japanese communities. As <span class="loc">Abiko</span> became a prominent leader in the Japanese American community, he formed three new colonies: <span class="loc">Yamato Colony</span> in <span class="loc">Livingston</span> in <span class="date">1907</span>, <span class="loc">Cressey</span> in <span class="date">1918</span>, and Cortez in <span class="date">1919</span>.</p><br><br>
