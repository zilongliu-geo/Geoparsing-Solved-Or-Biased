<p><span class="loc">San Juan Bautista</span> is the main town in the Juan Fernández Islands. Some sources say it was founded in 1877, while others give an earlier date of 1750. It is located on <span class="loc">Cumberland Bay</span> on the center of the northeast coast of <span class="loc">Robinson</span> <span class="loc">Crusoe Island</span>. Although the community maintains a rustic serenity dependent on the spiny lobster trade, residents employ a few vehicles, a satellite internet connection, and many television sets. As of the 2012 census, the town had a population of 800 in an area of 0.31 km2 (0.12 sq mi). There is a soccer pitch at the northern end of the village. The nearby school is called the Dresden School, after the German light cruiser SMS <span class="loc">Dresden</span> which was sunk here during World War I, as is the street it is situated on. The names of other generally unpaved streets in the village include Larraín Alcalde, Ignacio Carrera Pinto, El Sándalo, Vicente González, Teniente Cortés, and La Pólvora. Overlooking <span class="loc">San Juan Bautista</span> are <span class="loc">Las Cuevas</span> de los Patriotas (Patriots' Caves), where 42 Chilean creole independence activists lived during their exile by the Spanish authorities after the Battle of <span class="loc">Rancagua</span> in 1814. The exiles included prominent figures such as Juan Egaña and Manuel de Salas.</p>
