<p><span class="loc">Winchester</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Once a center of political influence and the county seat, little remains of the original community, which is today covered by forest. <span class="loc">Winchester</span> was one of the first significant communities in western <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. It was located about 1 mi (1.6 km) east of the <span class="loc">Chickasawhay River</span>, and south of "Three-Chopped Way", a pioneer road completed in 1807 connecting <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and the <span class="loc">Carolinas</span>, via <span class="loc">St. Stephens</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, with <span class="loc">Natchez</span> in eastern <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. The town "was situated on a beautiful level site, covered with large oak and other shade trees", and <span class="loc">Meadows Mill Creek</span> flowed through <span class="loc">Winchester</span>, "a beautiful and never-failing creek of the purest water". A military post—Patton's Fort—was erected at <span class="loc">Winchester</span> in 1813 during the Creek War. <span class="loc">Winchester</span> became "a place of considerable importance in the territorial period and in the days of early statehood". The town was named <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>'s first county seat, and was incorporated in 1818. <span class="loc">Winchester</span> flourished, and in 1822 a court house was built "of pine lumber of the best quality". A jail was built in the 1840s, with walls "three feet thick of heavy hewed pine".</p>
