<p>Amherst is a town in <span class="loc">Hillsborough County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 11,201 at the 2010 census. Amherst is home to <span class="loc">Ponemah Bog Wildlife Sanctuary</span>, <span class="loc">Hodgman State Forest</span>, the Joe English Reservation and <span class="loc">Baboosic Lake</span>. The town center village, where 613 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Amherst</span> census-designated place. The village is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Amherst Village Historic District. Like many <span class="loc">New England</span> towns, Amherst was the result of a land grant given to soldiers â€“ in this case, to soldiers in 1728 who had participated in King Philip's War. Settled about 1733, it was first called "Narragansett Number 3", and then later "Souhegan Number 3." In 1741, settlers formed the Congregational church and hired the first minister. Chartered on 18 January 1760 by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, the town was named for General Lord Amherst, who commanded British forces in <span class="loc">North America</span> during the French and Indian War. Lord Jeffrey Amherst is also infamous for initiating the practice of giving smallpox blankets to Native Americans in a genocidal effort "to Extirpate this Execrable Race" (as quoted from his letter to Colonel Henry Bouquet on July 16, 1763).</p>
