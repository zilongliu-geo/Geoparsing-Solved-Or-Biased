<p><span class="loc">Springfield</span> (until 1880 <span class="loc">Kowai</span> Pass) is a small town in the <span class="loc">Selwyn District</span> of <span class="loc">Canterbury</span>, in the <span class="loc">South Island</span>, of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. In 2001 it had a population of 219. At the foot of the <span class="loc">Southern Alps</span>, 65 kilometres (40 mi) west of <span class="loc">Christchurch</span>, it is the most westerly town of the central <span class="loc">Canterbury Plains</span>. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> has a long association with the Midland railway line. <span class="loc">Springfield</span> is situated in the foothills, less than an hour from the center of <span class="loc">Christchurch</span> on State Highway 73 (The Great Alpine Highway). The town has a Gothic Revival architecture church dedicated to <span class="loc">Saint Peter</span>, designed by the architect Cyril Mountfort. It was the birthplace of Rewi Alley, notable for his work in <span class="loc">China</span> in the mid 20th century. There is an extensive memorial dedicated to him, located in a small reserve off the main road. It includes a large stone carving and a number of panels giving details of his life. On 15 July 2007, a statue of a giant pink doughnut was erected to promote the upcoming movie, The Simpsons Movie. It was subsequently set alight and destroyed by an arsonist on 25 September 2009. A tyre painted pink was used as a substitute until it was replaced with a concrete version unveiled on 1 July 2012.</p>
