<p>Harrow is a town in the <span class="loc">Wimmera region</span> of western Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The town is located in the Shire of West Wimmera local government area, 391 kilometres north west of the state capital <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, overlooking the <span class="loc">Glenelg River</span> valley. At the 2011 census, Harrow and the surrounding area had a population of 315. The first European explorer of the area was Thomas Mitchell and a monument marks the spot where he crossed the <span class="loc">Glenelg River</span>. A town originally known as Upper Glenelg was established in the 1840s and is claimed to be the oldest inland town in Victoria. The Post Office opened on 1 March 1849 as Upper Glenelg (Harrow from 1854). At its peak, the town included a range of shops and services including two hotels. Harrow is the burial place of Unaarrimin - Johnny Mullagh, member of the Australian Aboriginal cricket team, the first Australian cricket team to tour <span class="loc">England</span>. He also represented the Victorian cricket team in first-class cricket. To tell the story of Unaarrimin, and the times in which he lived, Harrow has built The Johnny Mullagh / Harrow Discovery Centre. To enhance the cricket connection, the Centre now houses <span class="loc">Australia</span>'s largest Sir Donald Bradman exhibition.</p>
