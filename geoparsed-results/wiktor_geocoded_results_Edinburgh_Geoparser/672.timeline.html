The plat established 128 lots, reserving some for the construction of a courthouse, market house and place of public worship. They probably wanted to get the county seat moved from <span class="org">Madison</span>. <span class="per">McFarland</span> was a county judge and <span class="per">Hillis</span>, a popular local politician, later became lieutenant government of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. The <span class="org">Lancaster Post Office</span> operated from <span class="date">March 16, 1830</span> through <span class="date">August 30, 1839</span>. Service went to <span class="loc">Dupont</span>, then to <span class="per">Republican</span> and <span class="per">Franklin</span> Mills, before returning to <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> on <span class="date">August 19, 1841</span>. It closed on <span class="date">March 15, 1907</span>. Before the Civil War, the area was a center of anti-slavery activity. The Neal's Creek Anti-Slavery Baptist Church, founded in <span class="date">1846</span>, moved to <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> in <span class="date">1847</span>. It later became known as the <span class="org">College</span> Hill Baptist Church and disappeared by <span class="date">1879</span>. The <span class="org">Eleutherian College</span>, founded in <span class="date">1848</span>, was the second co-educational, integrated college to open in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It accepted black and white students until the Civil War when it stopped accepting blacks. It closed and in <span class="date">1874</span> then reopened as a private high school and normal school that same year. It operated until <span class="date">1888</span> when it was purchased by <span class="loc">Lancaster Township</span> and the stone college building was used as an elementary school until <span class="date">1937</span>.</p><br><br>
