<p>Galata was a neighbourhood opposite <span class="loc">Constantinople</span> (today's <span class="loc">Istanbul</span>, <span class="loc">Turkey</span>), located at the northern shore of the <span class="loc">Golden Horn</span>, the inlet which separates it from the historic peninsula of old <span class="loc">Constantinople</span>. The <span class="loc">Golden Horn</span> is crossed by several bridges, most notably the Galata Bridge. The medieval citadel of Galata was a colony of the Republic of <span class="loc">Genoa</span> between 1273 and 1453. The famous Galata Tower was built by the Genoese in 1348 at the northernmost and highest point of the citadel. At present, Galata is a quarter within the <span class="loc">borough of Beyoğlu</span> in <span class="loc">Istanbul</span>, and is known as Karaköy. There are several theories concerning the origin of the name Galata. The Greeks believe that the name comes either from galatas (meaning "milkman"), as the area was used by shepherds in the early medieval period, or from the word Galatai (meaning "Gauls"), as the Celtic tribe of Gauls were thought to have camped here during the Hellenistic period before settling into <span class="loc">Galatia</span> in central <span class="loc">Anatolia</span>. The inhabitants of <span class="loc">Galatia</span> are famous for the Epistle to the Galatians and the Dying Galatian statue.[Not Relevant?]</p>
