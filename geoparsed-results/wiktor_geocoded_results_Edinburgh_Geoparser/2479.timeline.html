  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Baltimore</span> (/ˈbæltᵻmɔːr/; Irish: <span class="org">Dún na</span> Séad) is a village in <span class="loc">western County Cork</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. It is the main village in the <span class="loc">parish of Rathbarry</span> and the Islands, the southernmost parish in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. It is the main ferry port to <span class="loc">Sherkin Island</span>, <span class="loc">Cape Clear Island</span> and the eastern side of Roaring <span class="loc">Water Bay</span> (Loch Trasna) and Carbery's Hundred Isles. Although the name <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> is an anglicisation of the Irish <span class="loc">Baile</span> an Tí Mhóir meaning "town of the big house", the Irish-language name for <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> is that of the O'Driscoll castle, <span class="org">Dún na</span> Séad or Dunashad ("fort of the jewels"). The recently restored castle is open to the public and overlooks the town. In ancient times, Dunashad was considered a sanctuary for druids and the place name is associated with Bealtaine. <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> has a subtropical maritime climate (Köppen climate classification:Cwb) that borders on humid subtropical climate. There are no significant thermal excursions between <span class="date">summer</span> and <span class="date">winter</span>. <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> enters history as a seat of one of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>'s most ancient dynasties, the once mighty Corcu Loígde, former Kings of <span class="per">Tara</span> and <span class="per">Kings</span> of <span class="loc">Munster</span>.</p><br><br>
