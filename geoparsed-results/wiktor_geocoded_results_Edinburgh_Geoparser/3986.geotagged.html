<p>Keith is a small farming town in the south-east of <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is approximately 225 km from Adelaide at the junction of the Dukes Highway and the Riddoch Highway. It is sometimes referred to as the 'lucerne capital of <span class="loc">Australia</span>' due to the high number of lucerne growers in the region. At the 2006 census, Keith had a population of 1,089. then in 2011 census, Keith had a population of 1,320. A large granite outcrop outside the town called <span class="loc">Mount Monster</span> was a basis for the area's name until it was surveyed in 1884 and officially proclaimed Keith in 1889. It is believed that the town is named after the home town of the Governor of <span class="loc">South Australia</span> at the time, Lord Kintore. His home in <span class="loc">Aberdeenshire</span> in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> was called <span class="loc">Keith Hall</span> and he was also known as Earl of Kintore. The Post Office opened around 1874 as <span class="loc">Mount Monster</span> and was renamed Keith in 1904. In 1905 the general store was opened, and in 1907 the education department rented rooms out of the local institute to use as the school. 1910 saw the opening of Keith Hotel and the town's provisional school became a public school in 1912.</p>
