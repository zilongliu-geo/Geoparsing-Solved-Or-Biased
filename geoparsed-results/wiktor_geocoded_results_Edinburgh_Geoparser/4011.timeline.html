  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Puerto Madero</span>, also known within the urban planning community as the <span class="loc">Puerto Madero</span> Waterfront, is a barrio (district) of the Argentine capital at <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> CBD, occupying a significant portion of the RÃ­o de la Plata riverbank and representing the latest architectural trends in the city of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>. From its inception, the city of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> had a problem accommodating large cargo ships, as per <span class="loc">Puerto</span> <span class="loc">La Boca</span>, because the shallow river did not allow for direct docking. Instead ships were moored away from the shore and passengers and merchandise were unloaded onto barges and ferries for transport to the pier. In <span class="date">1882</span> the national government contracted the local businessman <span class="per">Eduardo Madero</span> to take charge of the construction of a new port which would solve these problems. Construction began in <span class="date">1887</span> and was completed in <span class="date">1897</span>, although the installed fittings had been partially operative some <span class="date">years</span> before completion of the port. It was a costly project and an engineering landmark at the time but <span class="date">ten years</span> after its completion the appearance of larger cargo ships made <span class="loc">Puerto Madero</span> obsolete. The government had to then face the construction of a new port, this time contracting engineer <span class="per">Luis Huergo</span>, whose plans for a port of staggered docks which would open directly onto the river was among those rejected in the 1880s. His plans resulted in the "<span class="loc">Puerto Nuevo</span>" (New Port), still operating <span class="date">today</span>, whose first section opened in <span class="date">1911</span>.</p><br><br>
