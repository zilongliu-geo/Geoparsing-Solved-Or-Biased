  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Kingston is a small village and parish in the East of <span class="loc">England</span> region and the <span class="loc">county Cambridgeshire</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. Situated 7 miles to the west of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, the population at the time of the <span class="date">2001</span> census was 214. The ancient parish is 1,907 acres (772 ha) in size, at an altitude of between 80 and 250 feet. The land is largely agricultural, with <span class="loc">Kingston Wood</span> covering around 100 acres. The discovery of Bronze Age and Iron Age flint tools and pottery in the parish indicate that Kingston's location on a gravel spur above two streams has been occupied for millennia. Additional finds in the <span class="loc">Old Rectory</span> garden suggest there may also have been a Roman villa site here. The name Kingston, meaning "the king's manor", implies that the village was, prior to the <span class="per">Norman Conquest</span>, a royal vill. It remained in the possession of the crown at the time of the Domesday Book in <span class="date">1086</span>. The village thrived in medieval times, and was the third most-populous parish in Longstow hundred in <span class="date">1327</span>. In <span class="date">1306</span> the lord of the manor, <span class="per">Constantine Mortimer</span>, was granted the right to hold a weekly market on Tuesdays, as well as two annual fairs around the festivals of <span class="per">St Margaret</span> and <span class="loc">St Luke</span> (19–<span class="date">21 July</span> and 17–<span class="date">19 October</span>). The market and fairs lapsed at some point over <span class="date">the next few centuries</span> and the population fell sharply to leave Kingston as one of the smallest parishes by population. There are a number of late medieval houses remaining, and many others date from the 17th and 18th <span class="date">centuries</span>. There are 21 listed buildings and structures in the village.</p><br><br>
