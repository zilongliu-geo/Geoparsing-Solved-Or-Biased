<p><span class="loc">Granada</span> is a city in western <span class="loc">Nicaragua</span> and the capital of the Granada Department. With an estimated population of 123,697 (2012), it is <span class="loc">Nicaragua</span>'s sixth most populous city. <span class="loc">Granada</span> is historically one of <span class="loc">Nicaragua</span>'s most important cities, economically and politically. It has a rich colonial heritage, seen in its architecture and structure. <span class="loc">Granada</span> was founded in 1524 by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, ostensibly the first European city in mainland <span class="loc">America</span>. Unlike other cities that claim the same distinction, the <span class="loc">city of Granada</span> was not only the settlement of the conquest, but also a city registered in official records of the Crown of <span class="loc">Aragon</span>, and the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Castile</span> in <span class="loc">Spain</span>. <span class="loc">Granada</span> is also known as La Gran Sultana, in reflection of its Moorish and Andalusian appearance, unlike its sister <span class="loc">city of León</span> and historical rival, which displays Castilian trends. It was named by Hernández de Córdoba after the ancient Spanish <span class="loc">city of Granada</span>. This was done in honor of the defeat of the last Moorish stronghold, which had been Spanish <span class="loc">Granada</span>, by the Catholic King and Queen of Spain. <span class="loc">Granada</span>, <span class="loc">Nicaragua</span> was historically the sister capital in Central <span class="loc">America</span> to <span class="loc">Antigua</span>, <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>. During the colonial period, <span class="loc">Granada</span> maintained a flourishing level of commerce with ports on the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>, through Lake <span class="loc">Nicaragua</span> (a.k.a. Cocibolca) and the <span class="loc">San Juan River</span>.</p>
