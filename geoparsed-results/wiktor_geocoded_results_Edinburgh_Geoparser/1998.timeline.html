  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tuli</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">province of Matabeleland South</span>, <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>. It is located about 90 km west of <span class="loc">Beitbridge</span> on the eastern bank of the <span class="loc">Shashe</span> River. The village grew around Fort Tuli which was the first settlement built by the <span class="org">Pioneer</span> Column in <span class="date">July 1890</span> at the place known as <span class="loc">Selous</span> Camp and used by <span class="per">Frederick Selous</span> as a base for his hunting expeditions. The village is mainly a police post and associated housing. The village can be accessed from <span class="loc">Gwanda</span> town via <span class="loc">Guyu</span> and <span class="loc">Hwali</span>, or from <span class="loc">Beitbridge</span> via <span class="loc">Nottingham</span> and <span class="loc">Shashi Irrigation Scheme</span>, although the latter road is in very poor condition <span class="loc">Tuli</span> was the first point at which the pioneer column, and many subsequent expeditions entered into Matabeleland and onward north to <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Harare</span>), the capital of <span class="loc">Rhodesia</span> as the country was then known. <span class="loc">Tuli</span> was the first location north of the Limpopo/<span class="loc">Shashe</span> rivers where a 'European' style building was erected - the BSA Police Station was a wooden modular style Victorian building, brought from the <span class="loc">UK</span> and erected to house members of the BSA Police who monitored the river crossing just south of the building's location. Until this time a large Fort (Fort Tuli) had existed on the southern bank of the <span class="loc">Shashe</span> where oxen and horses were rested prior to undertaking the river crossing. In <span class="date">the 1970s</span> this building was re-located from its original site and erected at the site of the old, and <span class="date">now</span> obliterated, Fort Tuli. It was used to house artifacts and items if historic interest which were found by persons in the area of the old Fort.</p><br><br>
