<p><span class="loc">Cumberland</span> (/ˈkʌmbələnd/ KUM-bə-lənd; locally /ˈkʊmbələnd/ KUUM-bə-lənd) is a historic <span class="loc">county of North West England</span> that had an administrative function from the 12th century until 1974. It was bordered by <span class="loc">Northumberland</span> to the east, <span class="loc">County Durham</span> to the southeast, <span class="loc">Westmorland</span> and <span class="loc">Lancashire</span> to the south, and <span class="loc">Dumfriesshire</span> in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> to the north. It formed an administrative county from 1889 to 1974 (excluding <span class="loc">Carlisle</span> from 1914) and now forms part of <span class="loc">Cumbria</span>. The first record of the term "Cumberland" appears in 945, when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that the area was ceded to Malcolm I of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> by King Edmund of England. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 most of the future county remained part of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> although some villages in the ancient <span class="loc">district of Millom</span>, which were the possessions of the Earl of Northumbria, were included in the Yorkshire section with the <span class="loc">Furness region</span>. In 1092 King William <span class="loc">Rufus</span> of <span class="loc">England</span> invaded the <span class="loc">Carlisle district</span>, settling it with colonists. He created an Earldom of <span class="loc">Carlisle</span>, and granted the territory to Ranulf Meschyn. In 1133 <span class="loc">Carlisle</span> was made the see of a new diocese, identical with the area of the earldom. However, on the death of King Henry I in 1135, the area was regained by <span class="loc">Scotland</span>'s King David I. He was able to consolidate his power and made <span class="loc">Carlisle</span> one of his chief seats of government, while <span class="loc">England</span> descended into a lengthy civil war. In 1157 Henry II of <span class="loc">England</span> resumed possession of the area from Malcolm IV of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, and formed two new counties from the former earldom: <span class="loc">Westmorland</span> and "Carliol". The silver-mining area of <span class="loc">Alston</span>, previously associated with the Liberty of <span class="loc">Durham</span>, was also added to the new <span class="loc">county of Carliol</span> for financial reasons. By 1177 the <span class="loc">county of Carliol</span> was known as <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>. The border between <span class="loc">England</span> and <span class="loc">Scotland</span> was made permanent by the Treaty of <span class="loc">York</span> in 1237.</p>
