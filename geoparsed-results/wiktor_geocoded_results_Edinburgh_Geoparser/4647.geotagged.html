<p><span class="loc">Phalia</span> (Urdu تحصیل پھالیہ ) is a Tehsil of Mandi <span class="loc">Bahauddin District</span>, <span class="loc">Punjab</span>, <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Phalia</span> was calculated to be 25,914 in 2007 (21,025 in 1998). Alexander the Great and his army crossed the <span class="loc">Jhelum</span> in July 326 BC at the Battle of the <span class="loc">Hydaspes</span> River where he defeated the Indian king <span class="loc">Porus</span>. According to Arrian (Anabasis, 29), he built a city on the spot whence he started to cross the river <span class="loc">Hydaspes</span>, which he named Bukephala or Bucephala to honour his famous and loyal horse Bukephalus or Bucephalus. It is thought that ancient Bukephala was near the site of modern <span class="loc">Jhelum City</span> but that is wrong. <span class="loc">Phalia</span> was named after Bucephalus on the name of the Alexander's dead horse and presently a tehsil of Mandi <span class="loc">Bahauddin District</span>. The Alexander while forwarding from <span class="loc">Taxila</span> opted alternate way despite of using traditional route i.e. today's GT road and built two cities on opposite banks of the river Hydaspes en route between <span class="loc">Bhera</span> and <span class="loc">Mong</span>. In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in <span class="loc">Kabul</span> in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of <span class="loc">Punjab region</span>. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The <span class="loc">Punjab region</span> became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of <span class="loc">Punjab region</span>. Jalalpur Sharif is located on west of the river <span class="loc">Jhelum</span> whereas <span class="loc">Phalia</span> on eastern bank in Mandi <span class="loc">Bahauddin District</span> close to river <span class="loc">Jhelum</span> earlier known as <span class="loc">Hydaspes</span>. A semi hill or mound i.e. the historical sign of the ancient city and a shrine still available in mid of the Mohalla Ameer. In 2010, maximum of the area reshaped into commercial land and precious heritage could not be preserved.</p>
