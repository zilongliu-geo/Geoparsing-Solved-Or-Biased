<p>Eureka is a town in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,037 at the 2010 census. Eureka is located at 48°52′49″N 115°2′58″W (48.880265, -115.049325), approximately 66 miles (106 km) from Kalispell. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.01 square miles (2.62 km2), all of it land. The Town of Eureka is located on the Tobacco River in an area known as the Tobacco Valley in the <span class="loc">United States</span> and as the <span class="loc">Tobacco Plains</span> in British Columbia to the north (Eureka is about nine miles from the Canadian border). Eureka was founded in the early 1880s as settlers moved north from <span class="loc">Missoula</span> and south from <span class="loc">Canada</span> and was originally known as <span class="loc">Deweyville</span>. It was one of the last areas to be developed in <span class="loc">Montana</span> in frontier times, and logging was a major draw and source of income for decades. Eureka was once known as the "Christmas Tree Capital of the World," with evergreens shipped to many urban points for holiday sales. The Canadian fur-trapper and explorer David Thompson visited the area in the early 19th Century during his searches for a route to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. Early explorers, finding Indians there growing a native strain of tobacco, named it the <span class="loc">Tobacco Plains</span>. In the late 1970s, Eurekans began a "Tobacco Valley Rendezvous" every year in April to commemorate Thompson's visit.</p>
