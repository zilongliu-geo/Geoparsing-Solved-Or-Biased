  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Geneva</span> is a community, census-designated place, and an unincorporated area in <span class="loc">Seminole County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,940 at the <span class="date">2010</span> Census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Geneva</span> is the home of the Little-Big Econ State Forest, home of the big and little Econlockhatchee Rivers. John and <span class="per">William Bartram</span> first documented Geneva’s history in 1765-66. Since then, there have been several other documentations: Anthropologist <span class="per">Daniel Britton</span> in <span class="date">1850</span>, scientists of <span class="org">Harvard University</span> in <span class="date">1875</span> and by an Archeological Cultural Resources Study and an Architectural Resources Study. The Geneva Cemetery is located on a piece of land that was donated by Progar Debogory. <span class="loc">Debogory</span> was the head of one of the Russian families that settled in the Geneva area in the 1800s. There are currently 17 <span class="org">U.S. Civil War</span> soldiers buried in the Geneva Cemetery, 15 of these soldiers served in the confederacy and only 2 served in the union. There were originally 18 soldiers buried, however one soldier’s remains were removed by his family and placed in a different cemetery. Early schools in <span class="loc">Geneva</span> were originally located in the homes of local residents. The first formal school was built in <span class="date">1874</span> on land that was also donated by Progar Debogory. A new one-room school was built by <span class="date">1903</span> in replacement of the original schoolhouse. In <span class="date">1924</span>, a new building was built out of bricks and had 4 rooms to accommodate more students. In <span class="date">1941</span>, principal <span class="per">W.L. Seig</span> developed a unique 4-H program focused on the development of home economics and farming skills. This program was sponsored by <span class="org">Rollins College</span> and this accomplishment is acknowledged and praised in the "History of the <span class="loc">Seminole County</span> Public Schools". In <span class="date">1988</span>, an elementary school was built surrounding the old brick schoolhouse. The old schoolhouse was preserved for the community and in <span class="date">1995</span> it served as a family resource center. Finally in <span class="date">2008</span>, the building was dedicated to the community to serve as a rural heritage center.</p><br><br>
