  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Local health centers to land $198K in federal funds. <span class="loc">BUTLER COUNTY</span> â€” <span class="org">Butler County Community</span> health centers are expected to get about $198,000 of $8 million in federal funds to increase staff, hours and expand pediatric care. The money recently released by the <span class="org">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</span> to <span class="loc">Ohio</span> public health agencies was made available by the American <span class="per">Recovery</span> and <span class="per">Reinvestment</span> Act to Ohio community health centers. The funds are meant to help community health centers statewide expand programs at a time when an ever-growing number of Americans are uninsured, officials said. "It's very timely," said <span class="per">Don Reimer</span>, chief financial officer of the <span class="loc">Butler County</span> Community Health Consortium. "We saw an increase in patients in <span class="date">the fourth quarter</span> of <span class="date">2008</span> and continue to see an increase in uninsured patients along with a mix of new patients." <span class="per">Reimer</span> said county officials will use the additional funds to increase pediatric care, increase hours and staff at its facilities in <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> and <span class="loc">Middletown</span>. The <span class="loc">Butler County</span> Health Consortium is among 32 federally qualified health centers in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> that received funds, according to the <span class="org">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</span>. The health centers are required to use the funds over <span class="date">the next two years</span> to create or retain approximately 147 health center jobs by expanding operations hours, adding providers or expanding services, HHS officials said. The funds are the second set of health center grants provided through the Recovery Act and will provide care to an additional 51,039 patients in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> in <span class="date">the next two years</span>. On <span class="date">March 2</span>, <span class="per">President Obama</span> announced grants worth $155 million to 126 new health centers.</p><br><br>
