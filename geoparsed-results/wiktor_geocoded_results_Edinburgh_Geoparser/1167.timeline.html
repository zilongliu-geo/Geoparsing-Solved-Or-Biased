  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">La Capilla</span> is the name given to the southwestern part of the town of <span class="per">San Jerónimo</span> in the municipality of <span class="per">San Martín</span> de <span class="loc">Hidalgo</span>, <span class="loc">Jalisco</span>, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. It is bordered by the <span class="loc">Arroyo de la Calera</span> to the west, and <span class="loc">El Potrerito</span> to the east. Along with <span class="loc">El Potrerito</span>, <span class="loc">La Capilla</span> was the property of the Barbosa family during the mid-19th century. The name of la capilla, which means "the chapel", was given to the area because of the long adobe chapel that once stood there. The chapel was probably built during the early 19th century, considering that it may have been the first religious structure built in <span class="per">San Jerónimo</span>. The chapel was destroyed in the early 20th century to make way for an arable farmland. In the nearby creek <span class="loc">Arroyo de la Calera</span> are remains of a dam wall which also dates to the mid-19th century, and was probably used to recollect water for the cattle roaming in <span class="loc">El Potrerito</span>. Although no official population count has been attributed exclusively to the area, <span class="loc">La Capilla</span>'s population is composed of approximately 40 inhabitants.</p><br><br>
