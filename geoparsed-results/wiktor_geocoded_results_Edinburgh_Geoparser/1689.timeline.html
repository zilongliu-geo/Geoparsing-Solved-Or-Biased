  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Texas</span> /ˈtɛksəs/ (Spanish: <span class="loc">Texas</span> or <span class="loc">Tejas</span> [ˈtexas]) is the second most populous and second largest state by area of the 50 states in the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>. Geographically located in the south central part of the country, <span class="loc">Texas</span> shares borders with the other <span class="loc">U.S.</span> states of <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> to the northeast, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> to the north, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> to the west, and an international border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, <span class="loc">Coahuila</span>, Nuevo León and <span class="loc">Tamaulipas</span> to the southwest, along with the <span class="loc">Gulf of Mexico</span> to the southeast. Houston is the largest city in <span class="loc">Texas</span> and the fourth-largest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, while <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> is the second largest in the state and seventh largest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Dallas–Fort <span class="per">Worth</span> and <span class="per">Greater</span> Houston are the fourth and fifth largest <span class="loc">United States</span> metropolitan statistical areas, respectively. Other major cities include Austin (the state capital) and <span class="loc">El Paso</span>. <span class="loc">Texas</span> is nicknamed the <span class="loc">Lone Star</span> State to signify <span class="loc">Texas</span> as a former independent republic, and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The "<span class="loc">Lone Star</span>" can be found on the Texan state flag and on the Texan state seal. The origin of the state name, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, is from the word, "<span class="loc">Tejas</span>", which means 'friends' in the Caddo language.</p><br><br>
