At the <span class="date">2006</span> census, <span class="loc">Bellingham</span> and the surrounding area had a population of 264. The township is largely made up of shacks used during the <span class="date">summer</span> time. The permanent residence is about 25 people.

There is a camping ground, tennis court and small boat ramp within the central township, The Marine and Safety Board of <span class="loc">Tasmania</span> (MAST) recently announcing funding for a much-needed upgrade for the ramp. the nearby shoreline of the <span class="loc">Pipers River</span> can easily be accessed from the town, as well as large coastal beaches adjacent to <span class="loc">Bass Strait</span>.</p><br><br>
