  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kera</span> is a village in Bhuj Taluka of <span class="loc">Kutch district</span> of <span class="loc">Gujarat</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>. This historical town has several places of interest; the ruins of an old fort and Shiva temple, and the shrine of a Muslim saint <span class="loc">Ghulam Ali</span>. Southeast of <span class="loc">Kera</span>, a small village, on a pretty rising ground, has the well-wooded shrine of the saint <span class="loc">Ghulam Ali</span>. Within the enclosure are three chief buildings, a mausoleum, dargah with a tomb under a canopy, supported by twelve small Islamic styled columns. Against the pall lies the photograph of a Mughal saint, and below him <span class="per">Hassan</span> and <span class="per">Husain</span>, and in third frame Prophet Muhammad, the face left blank in part obedience to the orders of the Quran. In the middle of the quadrangle, in front of the mausoleum, stands a canopy, chhatra, with a flat roof and side balconies and a tombless mausoleum to <span class="loc">Dadi</span> <span class="loc">Ali Shah</span>. The doors have projecting shields between floral ornaments, like those found at Maiji Sahiba's tomb at <span class="loc">Junagadh</span> and on the palace at <span class="loc">Navanagar</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Jamnagar</span>) in <span class="loc">Kathiawar</span>. The windows are of pierced stone of very simple patterns.</p><br><br>
