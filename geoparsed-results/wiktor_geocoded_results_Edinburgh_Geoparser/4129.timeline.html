  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Buzuluk</span> (Russian: Бузулу́к) is a town in <span class="loc">Orenburg Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Samara</span>, <span class="loc">Buzuluk</span>, and <span class="loc">Domashka Rivers</span> 246 kilometers (153 mi) northwest of <span class="loc">Orenburg</span>.
