<p><span class="loc">Valencia</span> is a 2nd class component city in the <span class="loc">province of Bukidnon</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, the city has a population of 181,556 people. <span class="loc">Valencia</span> attained its city status after the ratification of Republic Act 8985 in January 12, 2001. The city is the most populous among all cities and municipalities, and the 6th largest in terms of area in the <span class="loc">province of Bukidnon</span>. It is also the most populous inland city/municipality in <span class="loc">Mindanao</span>. The territory that now comprises the <span class="loc">city of Valencia</span> were former thirteen Barangays of the <span class="loc">City of Malaybalay</span>, <span class="loc">Bukidnon</span>. The earliest inhabitants in the area presently comprising part of the <span class="loc">Poblacion</span> were Bukidnon natives who founded a settlement along the banks of <span class="loc">Pulangi River</span> and the confluence of the <span class="loc">Panglibatuhan</span> River. The pioneers were led by <span class="loc">Datu</span> Sebastian Manangkila together with the families of the Binalhays, Laugas, Dongogans, Gua-ans, Lanayans, and the Arenzos. The first site of the settlement was a sitio named “<span class="loc">Panglibatuhan</span>” because the area was thickly forested by tree species called by the natives as “Malibato trees”. In 1911, on-room barrio school was opened, and its first teacher was the late Leon Galorport. That school site is approximately the present location of the Poblacion Barangay High School. Galorport, who came from his hometown, <span class="loc">Valencia</span>, <span class="loc">Bohol</span> named the school “Valencia School”. When the sitio became a barrio of <span class="loc">Malaybalay</span>, the resident agreed to name it “<span class="loc">Valencia</span>”. Finally, when the southern portion of <span class="loc">Malaybalay</span> was separated as a new municipality, the petitioners agreed to name the municipality as “<span class="loc">Valencia</span>”. The barrio which was <span class="loc">Valencia</span> is now Barangay <span class="loc">Poblacion</span> and is the seat of the city government of <span class="loc">Valencia</span>.</p>
