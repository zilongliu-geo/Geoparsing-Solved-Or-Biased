<p><span class="loc">Atlanta</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Elmore County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was founded in 1864 during the Civil War as a gold and silver mining community and named by Southerners after a rumored Confederate victory over General Sherman in the Battle of <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, which turned to be wholly false, but the name stuck. Mining activity near <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> preceded its establishment as a mining community. The John Stanley party discovered gold on the nearby <span class="loc">Yuba</span> River on July 20, 1864, just two days prior to the battle back in <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. That November, John Simmons made the discovery of the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> lode which contained both gold and silver. <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> is at an elevation of 5,383 feet (1,641 m) above sea level surrounded by the <span class="loc">Boise National Forest</span>, located near the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the <span class="loc">Boise River</span>, approximately 2 miles (3 km) east of the mouth of the <span class="loc">Yuba</span> River. The <span class="loc">Sawtooth Mountains</span> are directly north, the Sawtooth Wilderness starts about a mile (1.6 km) north of <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, at the base of <span class="loc">Greylock Mountain</span>, which summits at 9,363 feet (2,854 m).</p>
