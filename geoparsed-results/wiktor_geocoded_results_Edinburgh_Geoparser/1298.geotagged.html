<p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 63,216. The county seat is <span class="loc">Fort Edward</span>. The county was named for the Revolutionary War general (and later President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>) <span class="loc">George Washington</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Glens Falls</span>, <span class="loc">NY</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Albany-Schenectady, NY Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">When counties</span> were established in <span class="loc">New York</span> State in 1683, the present <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was part of <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of <span class="loc">New York</span> State as well as all of the present state of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> and, in theory, extending westward to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of <span class="loc">Gloucester County</span>, both containing territory now in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. On March 12, 1772, what was left of <span class="loc">Albany County</span> was split into three parts, one remaining under the name <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. The other two were called <span class="loc">Tryon County</span> (later renamed <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>) and <span class="loc">Charlotte County</span>.</p>
