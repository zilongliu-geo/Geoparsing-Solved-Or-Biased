  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Summit is a city in <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. At the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city's population was 21,457, reflecting an increase of 326 (+1.5%) from the 21,131 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 1,374 (+7.0%) from the 19,757 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. Summit had the 16th-highest per capita income in the state as of the <span class="date">2000</span> Census. Originally incorporated as Summit Township by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on <span class="date">March 23, 1869</span>, from portions of <span class="loc">New Providence</span> Township (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Berkeley Heights</span>) and Springfield Township, Summit was reincorporated as a city on <span class="date">March 8, 1899</span>. Possible derivations of Summit's name include its location atop the <span class="loc">Second Watchung Mountain</span>; the Summit Lodge, the house to which jurist <span class="per">James Kent</span> moved in <span class="date">1837</span> and which stands <span class="date">today</span> at 50 <span class="per">Kent</span> Place Boulevard; and to a local sawmill owner who granted passage to the <span class="loc">Morris</span> and Essex Railroad for a route to "the summit of the <span class="loc">Short Hills</span>". The region in which Summit is located was purchased from Native Americans on <span class="date">October 28, 1664</span>. Summit's earliest European settlers came to the area around the <span class="date">year 1710</span>. The original name of Summit was "<span class="loc">Turkey Hill</span>" to distinguish it from the area then known as "<span class="loc">Turkey</span>" (<span class="loc">New Providence</span>'s original name until <span class="date">1759</span>). During the American Revolutionary War period, Summit was known as "<span class="loc">Beacon Hill</span>", because bonfire beacons were lit on an eastern ridge in Summit to warn the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> militiamen of approaching British troops.</p><br><br>
