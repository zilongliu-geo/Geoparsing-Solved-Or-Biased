  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Platte Co.</span> tops 32K for first time. Census data released <span class="date">today</span> show <span class="loc">Platte County</span> reaching an all-time population high of 32,072 as of <span class="date">July 1, 2008</span>, an increase of 1.6 percent since the <span class="date">2000</span> census. From <span class="date">2007</span> to <span class="date">2008</span>, the population increased by 272 people, nearly a percentage point gain at .86 percent. The increase places <span class="loc">Platte</span> as the state’s 10th most populous county. Overall in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, not even a third of the counties saw populations increase in <span class="date">2008</span>. The figures show 28 of Nebraska’s 93 counties gained in population from <span class="date">July 2007</span> to <span class="date">July 2008</span>. That’s one more than in <span class="date">the previous year</span>. All but one of the remaining counties lost population. <span class="loc">Sherman County</span>, which includes Loup City, held firm at 2,994. But an analysis from the <span class="org">University of Nebraska</span> at Omaha’s Center for Public Affairs Research shows changes overall were better than those seen in <span class="date">recent years</span>. Small <span class="per">Hitchcock</span> and <span class="per">Hayes</span> counties in southwest <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, for example, both gained population in the one-year period after <span class="date">several years</span> of losses. “Maybe it’s a one-year blip or something, but it’s definitely interesting to see that,” said UNO’s <span class="per">David Drozd</span>, a research associate. Dakota, <span class="loc">Otoe</span> and <span class="loc">Washington</span> counties, whose numbers typically go up, saw their populations fall. In <span class="date">December</span>, the Census bureau reported the state gained 13,959 residents over the one-year period. That’s the most <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> has seen in <span class="date">a dozen years</span>. <span class="per">Drozd</span> attributed the gain to people moving into <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> from states harder hit by the economic downturn, as well as a strong birth rate. Economic conditions also could have lured some people back to rural areas, including college students who returned to the farm, he said. “By and large, for rural areas, a lot of the commodity prices were relatively strong,” he said. Several counties are seeing population levels unseen in <span class="date">decades</span>. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>’s population (<span class="loc">North Platte</span>) of 35,582 is closer than ever to its all-time high set in <span class="date">1981</span>. It needs about 220 more people to top it. Some counties that marked losses in <span class="date">2008</span> saw their rates of decline slowing. <span class="loc">Madison County</span>, for example, lost just 20 people after losing hundreds after the closing of a <span class="org">Tyson Foods</span> plant in <span class="date">2006</span>. The combined population of Douglas, <span class="loc">Sarpy</span> and <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> counties continues to creep closer to the 1 million mark. They <span class="date">now</span> account for 52 percent of the state’s population, having more than 931,000 residents combined. In <span class="date">2000</span>, they controlled nearly 49 percent of the state’s population. With the <span class="date">2010</span> Census quickly approaching, the latest estimates confirm a timely change of course within Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District. The district that includes more than three-fourths of the state lost about 2,700 people annually in <span class="date">the first six years</span> of the decade. But in <span class="date">2008</span>, it gained about 150 people. <span class="per">Drozd</span> estimates its total population <span class="date">now</span> sits at 551,000. Every <span class="date">10 years</span> following the census, seats in the <span class="org">U.S. House of Representatives</span> must be redistributed fairly among the states. In <span class="date">2000</span>, Nebraska’s slow growth sparked concern that the state could lose a seat <span class="date">a decade</span> down the line. <span class="date">More than 70 years ago</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> had six congressional districts. The <span class="org">House</span> lost seats in <span class="date">1933</span>, <span class="date">1943</span> and <span class="date">1963</span>.</p><br><br>
