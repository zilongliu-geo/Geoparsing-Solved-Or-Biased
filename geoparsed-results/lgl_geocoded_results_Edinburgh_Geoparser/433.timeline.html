  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">N.Va</span>. murder suspect declared incompetent to stand trial. <span class="loc">MANASSAS</span> -- <span class="per">A Woodbridge</span> man charged in the abduction and death of an Alexandria woman has been declared incompetent to stand trial and is awaiting treatment at a state mental-health hospital. <span class="per">Keith Baskerville</span> -- the only survivor in the <span class="date">Sept. 13</span> event -- is charged with felony murder, abduction and carjacking charges in the death of 60-year-old <span class="per">Barbara Bosworth</span>. <span class="date">This month</span>, a judge in <span class="per">Prince William County Circuit Court</span> declared <span class="per">Baskerville</span> incompetent to stand trial and ordered him sent to <span class="org">Western State Hospital</span> for treatment. <span class="per">Baskerville</span> appeared in court <span class="date">Friday</span>, when a judge was scheduled to review his case. But his review was continued after attorneys and the judge said <span class="per">Baskerville</span> had not yet received the mental-health treatment ordered by the court. <span class="per">Baskerville</span> is <span class="date">now</span> due back in court <span class="date">April 24</span>, when a judge will review his competency. Police said <span class="per">Baskerville</span> and another man, 19-year-old Lutchman Chandler, abducted <span class="per">Bosworth</span> from <span class="loc">Springfield</span> Mall in <span class="date">September</span> and drove her to a PDQ Mart in <span class="per">Woodbridge</span>, where they tried to use her ATM card to withdraw money. The men then left the store with <span class="per">Bosworth</span> and crashed their car while fleeing the area. Chandler, who police said was driving the car at the time of the wreck, later died from his injuries. <span class="per">Judge Mary Grace O'Brien</span> of <span class="per">Prince William</span> Circuit <span class="per">Court</span> said <span class="per">Baskerville</span>'s mental-health treatment had been delayed because she ordered him sent to <span class="org">Western State Hospital</span>, though because of the nature of the crimes he is charged with, state laws require that he be sent to Central State Hospital. He had not been sent there before his court appearance <span class="date">Friday</span> because of a lack of bed space at the hospital, <span class="per">O'Brien</span> said. "I don't want this case to fall through the cracks," <span class="per">O'Brien</span> said before setting the <span class="date">April 24</span> court date.</p><br><br>
