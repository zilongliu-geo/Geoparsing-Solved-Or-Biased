  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Falmouth</span> is a Canadian village located along the <span class="loc">Avon River</span> in <span class="loc">Hants County</span> between <span class="loc">Mount Denson</span> and <span class="loc">Windsor</span>. <span class="loc">Falmouth</span> and area was known as Pisiquid by the Acadians. Having migrated from <span class="loc">Port Royal</span> (current day <span class="loc">Annapolis Royal</span>) (see also Habitation at Port-Royal, an earlier settlement several miles away that predates the French occupation of <span class="loc">Annapolis Royal</span>), the Acadians first settled the area in the early 1680s as the <span class="date">1686</span> census lists a number of families on well established farms utilizing productive dyked fields. During <span class="per">Queen Anne</span>'s War, in response to the French Raid on <span class="loc">Deerfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in the Raid on Pisiquid (<span class="date">1704</span>), <span class="per">Benjamin Church</span> burned the many villages of the two parishes (Ste. Famille and <span class="loc">Notre Dame</span> de l'Assumption) that made up the district to the ground and took prisoners to <span class="loc">Boston</span>. One of these prisoners was Acadian leader <span class="per">Noel Doiron</span>. As with the other <span class="loc">Acadian districts</span> of the <span class="loc">Bay of Fundy</span> region the Acadians of Piziquid were deported in the <span class="date">fall of 1755</span> (see Expulsion of the Acadians). By <span class="date">1760</span> the land left vacant by the deportation of the Acadians began to be resettled by New <span class="loc">England</span> Planters. Amongst these new settlers was a young <span class="per">Henry Alline</span>, who in the 1770s would start a Great Awakening religious revival. His New Lights ideas and followers quickly spread across the region and into northeastern <span class="loc">New England</span>.</p><br><br>
