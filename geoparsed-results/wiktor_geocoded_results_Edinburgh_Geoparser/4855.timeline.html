  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Haicheng</span> (Chinese: 海城; pinyin: Hǎichéng; literally: "Sea City") is a county-level city of central <span class="loc">Liaoning province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. It is located about 120 kilometres (75 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">Shenyang</span>, the provincial capital, and is under the administration of <span class="loc">Anshan City</span>, the seat of which lies 36 kilometres (22 mi) to the northeast. <span class="loc">Haicheng</span> has an area of 2,734 square kilometres (1,056 sq mi) and a population of 1,130,000. On <span class="date">4 February 1975</span>, an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter Scale hit the <span class="loc">city of Haicheng</span>, which at the time had approximately 1 million residents. However, seismologists sent out warnings about this earthquake <span class="date">a day earlier</span> and ordered evacuations. Because of this correct prediction, many lives were saved. This was the first successful earthquake prediction in history. Further aiding the prediction, cats and other animals are also said to have acted strangely in the <span class="date">days</span> leading up to the earthquake. There are some questions as to the validity and accuracy of these reports, which are discussed in detail in the Haicheng Earthquake Prediction link below.</p><br><br>
