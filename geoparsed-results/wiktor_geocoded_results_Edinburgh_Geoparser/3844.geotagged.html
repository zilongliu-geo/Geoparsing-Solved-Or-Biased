<p>Colton is a city in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Bernardino County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city is located in the Inland Empire region of the state and is approximately 57 miles east of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. The population of Colton is 52,154 according to the 2010 census, up from 47,662 at the 2000 census. Colton was until recently the site of Colton Crossing, one of the busiest at-grade railroad crossings in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The crossing was installed in 1882 by the <span class="loc">California</span> Southern Railroad to cross the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks while building northward from <span class="loc">San Diego</span>. As a result of railroad acquisitions and mergers, this became the point at which the Burlington Northern <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>'s "Southern Transcontinental Route" crossed the Union Pacific's "Sunset Route". As traffic on each line began to soar in the mid-1990s, fueled largely by the vast increase in imports passing through the ports of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and Long Beach, the primitive crossing became a serious bottleneck. On August 28, 2013, the at-grade crossing was officially replaced by a fly-over that raises the east–west UP tracks over the north–south BNSF tracks.</p>
