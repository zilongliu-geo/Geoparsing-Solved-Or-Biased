  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Madalena</span> (Portuguese pronunciation: [mɐðɐˈlenɐ]) is a municipality along the western coast of the island of <span class="loc">Pico</span>, in the Portuguese <span class="loc">Azores</span>. The population in <span class="date">2011</span> was 6,049, in an area of 147.12 km². The municipality is fronted by the stratovolcano <span class="loc">Pico</span> in the eastern frontier, and the <span class="per">Faial</span> Channel which divides <span class="loc">Pico</span> from the island of <span class="per">Faial</span> seven kilometers away. It is encircled almost entirely by the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> except in the east, where it is bordered by São João (<span class="loc">Lajes do Pico</span>) in the southeast, and <span class="per">Santo António</span> (São Roque do <span class="loc">Pico</span>) in the northeast. The settlement of the island of <span class="loc">Pico</span> occurred much later than most islands, partly due to greater interest shown in the other islands of the Central Group. For a time, only small herds, deposited by property-owners from <span class="per">Faial</span> and <span class="per">Terceira</span>, along with their caretakers (some of whom were slaves), were the only inhabitants of the island. It was not until the <span class="per">Infanta Beatriz</span> proceeded to reorganize island administration and promote a greater colonization of the islands of the Central Group (between <span class="date">1470</span> and <span class="date">1480</span>) that this changed. In <span class="date">1483</span>, <span class="loc">Faial</span> and <span class="loc">Pico</span> were integrated into one Captaincy, under the <span class="per">Flem Josse van Huerter</span>, and settlers were encouraged to colonize the island of <span class="loc">Pico</span>. But even still, the area of <span class="loc">Madalena</span>, with its rocky coastal plain, did not attract many new settlers and the community did not expand significantly until the municipality was created in <span class="date">1723</span>.</p><br><br>
