    French explorers had longstanding claims to the area which they acted to secure in an unambiguous fashion with a military-Amerindian expedition in 1749 that buried a succession of plaques claiming the territory as France's in response to the formation of the colonial Ohio Companyâ€”and the first of these was buried in Warren but ultimately control was transferred to the British after the French and Indian War.
