  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The Royal Free Hospital in <span class="loc">London</span> <span class="date">yesterday</span> said a nurse suffering with complications after <span class="loc">Ebola</span>, Pauline Cafferkey, is "critically ill" after her condition deteriorated. Cafferkey, 39, was readmitted to an isolation unit at the Royal Free on the <span class="date">night of October 8</span>â€“9 where she had spent time <span class="date">earlier in the year</span> after contracting <span class="loc">Ebola</span> in <span class="loc">Sierra Leone</span> whilst treating patients with the infection. Cafferkey visited an out of hours GP clinic on <span class="date">October 5</span> where her symptoms were not linked to <span class="loc">Ebola</span>, before deciding to go to the <span class="per">Queen Elizabeth</span> University Hospital in <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> on <span class="date">October 6</span> where she was treated at the hospital's infectious diseases unit. <span class="date">Two days later</span>, she was flown by plane to the Royal Free. She is the only person known to suffer with <span class="loc">Ebola</span> in this way for a second time, which can remain in the body after an initial recovery.</p><br><br>
