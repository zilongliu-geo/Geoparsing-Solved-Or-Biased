  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Queenstown</span> is a town in the West Coast region of the island of <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>. It is in a valley on the western slopes of <span class="loc">Mount Owen</span> on the West Coast Range. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="per">Queenstown</span> had a population of 1,975 people. <span class="per">Queenstown</span>'s history has long been tied to the mining industry. This mountainous area was first explored in <span class="date">1862</span>. It was long after that when alluvial gold was discovered at <span class="loc">Mount Lyell</span>, prompting the formation of the Mount <span class="org">Lyell Gold Mining Company</span> in <span class="date">1881</span>. In <span class="date">1892</span>, the mine began searching for copper. The final name of the <span class="loc">Mount Lyell</span> company was the Mount <span class="org">Lyell Mining and Railway Company</span>. <span class="org">Queenstown Post Office</span> opened on <span class="date">21 November 1896</span>. <span class="per">A Queenstown</span> South office opened in <span class="date">1949</span> and closed in <span class="date">1973</span>. In <span class="date">the 1900s</span>, <span class="per">Queenstown</span> was the centre of the <span class="loc">Mount Lyell</span> mining district and had numerous smelting works, brick-works, and sawmills. The area at the time was finely wooded. The population in <span class="date">1900</span> was 5051; the district, 10,451. The town was the base of the <span class="per">Queenstown</span> council up until amalgamation with other west coast councils in <span class="date">the 1990s</span>. The town in its heyday had a collection of hotels, churches and schools that have all significantly reduced since the demise of the <span class="loc">Mount Lyell</span> company.</p><br><br>
