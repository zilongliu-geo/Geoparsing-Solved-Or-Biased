<p><span class="loc">Johnstown</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Licking County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,632 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Johnstown</span> was the home of William A. Ashbrook, an American businessman, newspaper publisher, and Democratic politician from <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. His son, John Ashbrook, was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1956, and in 1960 won his father's old seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as the Republican candidate. In the 1972 presidential election, John Ashbrook ran against incumbent Richard Nixon in some state primaries as an alternative conservative candidate. The Village of <span class="loc">Johnstown</span> is part of a four thousand acre (16 kmÂ²) tract of land deeded to John Brown, a revolutionary soldier, by President Adams for military services in 1800. Brown sold the property in 1810 for $2.50 per acre to Dr. Oliver Bigelow. Dr. Bigelow laid out and incorporated the village of <span class="loc">Johnstown</span>, donating the streets, alleys and the town square. In 1926 a nearly complete skeleton of a mastodon was found by a farmer named James Bailey, and subsequently sold to the <span class="loc">Cleveland Museum of Natural History</span>.</p>
