<p>The <span class="loc">Kanara</span> or <span class="loc">Canara region</span>, which is also known as Coastal Karnataka, comprises three coastal <span class="loc">districts of Karnataka</span>, namely Uttara Kannada(North Canara), Udupi and Dakshina Kannada(South Canara). <span class="loc">Kanara</span> forms the southern part of the <span class="loc">Konkan coast</span>. The length of this region from north to south is around 300 kilometres (190 mi) and width varies from 30 to 110 kilometres (19 to 68 mi). The region is characterised by swaying palms and swift brooks running towards the <span class="loc">Arabian Sea</span>. According to legend, Parashurama, an avatar of Vishnu, retrieved <span class="loc">Kanara</span> from the sea by throwing his axe into the sea. The sea fell back to the place where his axe fell. Hence, the region is sometimes called Parshurama Kshetra. According to historian Severino da Silva the ancient names for this region are Kol Kannam (Tamil: no man's land) or Parashuram Srashti (creation of <span class="loc">Parashuram</span>). He and Stephen Fuchs say that the name Canara is the invention of Portuguese, Dutch and English people who visited the area for trade from the early 16th century onwards. The Bednore Dynasty, under whose rule this tract was at that time, was known to them as the Kannada Dynasty, i.e., the dynasty speaking the Kannada language. The letter 'd' being always pronounced like 'r' by the Europeans, the district was named by them <span class="loc">Kanara</span> (or Kannada). This name was retained by the British after their occupation of the district in 1799, and has remained ever since. However, they also say that this issue is controversial.</p>
