<p><span class="loc">Mansar</span> (Marathi: मानसर) is a census town in <span class="loc">Ramtek</span> tehsil of <span class="loc">Nagpur district</span> in the Indian state of <span class="loc">Maharashtra</span>. This town is located 5 km west of <span class="loc">Ramtek</span> and 45 km northeast of <span class="loc">Nagpur city</span>. <span class="loc">Mansar</span> is located at 21.4°N 79.25°E﻿ / 21.4; 79.25. It has an average elevation of 471 metres (1545 feet). In 1972, an image of a deity, later identified as Shiva Vamana was found from a hillock in <span class="loc">Mansar</span>, locally known as Hidimba Tekri. Important excavations were carried out at the ancient sites of <span class="loc">Mansar</span> since 1997-98, under the aegis of the Bodhisatva Nagarjun Smarak Samstha Va Anusandhan Kendra, <span class="loc">Nagpur</span> and under the directions of <span class="loc">Jagat</span> <span class="loc">Pati</span> <span class="loc">Joshi</span> and A. K. Sharma. So far 5 sites have been excavated in <span class="loc">Mansar</span>, which are designated as MNS 1, MNS 2, MNS 3, MNS 4 and MNS 5. These excavations have resulted in the discovery of various shrines (MNS 3, 4, 5) and a palace complex (MNS 2), identified as Pravarapura, the capital of the Vakataka king Pravarasena II (1st half of 5th century). Adjacent to this palace, on Hidimba Tekri (MNS 3), an extensive temple complex has been unearthed, identified as Pravareśvara. A 3 m tall lime model of a male human figure in crouching position was found underneath one of the terraces of MNS 3. Significant 5th-century sculptures of Hindu deities, artefacts and some coins have been discovered in the excavations.</p>
