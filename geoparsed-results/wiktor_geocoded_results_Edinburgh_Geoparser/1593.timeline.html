  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newton</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Harvey County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 19,132. <span class="loc">Newton</span> is located 25 miles (40 km) north of <span class="loc">Wichita</span>. The city of <span class="loc">North Newton</span> is located immediately north, existing as a separate political entity. For millennia, the land <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was inhabited by Native Americans. In <span class="date">1803</span>, most of modern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was secured by the <span class="loc">United States</span> as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In <span class="date">1854</span>, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in <span class="date">1861</span> <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In <span class="date">1872</span>, <span class="loc">Harvey County</span> was founded. In <span class="date">1871</span>, the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Railway extended a main line from Emporia westward to <span class="loc">Newton</span> by <span class="date">July 1871</span>. The town soon became an important railroad shipping point of Texas cattle. The city was founded in <span class="date">1871</span> and named after <span class="loc">Newton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, home of some of the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> stockholders. In <span class="date">August 1871</span>, there was a Gunfight at Hide Park, in which a total of eight men were killed. The incident began with an argument between two local lawmen, <span class="per">Billy Bailey</span> and <span class="per">Mike McCluskie</span>. Because of this incident, <span class="loc">Newton</span> became known as "bloody and lawlessâ€”the wickedest city in the west.".</p><br><br>
