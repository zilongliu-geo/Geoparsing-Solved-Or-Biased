Its economy is dependent primarily upon ranching. The closest attraction is the <span class="loc">Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge</span>. Between Alamo and the town of Rachel is the site of the Devonian Alamo Impact Breccia. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Alamo CDP has an area of 30.3 square miles (78.4 km2), all of it land.
