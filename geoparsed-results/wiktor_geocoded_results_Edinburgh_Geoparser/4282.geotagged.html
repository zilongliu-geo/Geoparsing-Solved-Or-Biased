<p>For the town in: <span class="loc">Butte County</span>; see <span class="loc">Bagdad</span>, <span class="loc">Butte County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> and the town in <span class="loc">Arizona</span>; see <span class="loc">Bagdad</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span> <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> is a ghost town in the <span class="loc">Mojave Desert</span>, in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Bernardino County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> is located along the historic <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66, <span class="loc">east of Barstow</span> and <span class="loc">Ludlow</span>, and west of <span class="loc">Amboy</span> and Needles. The town was founded in 1883 when the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway railway line between Barstow and Needles was built. At this time, <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> provided services to the Orange Blossom Mine several miles to the north, and to the War Eagle Mine several miles to the south. In addition, a dirt track extended south past the War Eagle Mine into the Dale Mining District in the <span class="loc">Pinto Mountains</span>. <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> was long a thriving town along the National Old Trails Road and the famous Route 66. It was bypassed by the opening of Interstate 40 to the north in 1973, and lost traveler's business and resident population. The remaining buildings were razed in 1991, leaving little trace of the town. <span class="loc">Bagdad</span> holds the record for the longest dry streak in <span class="loc">United States</span> history with 767 straight days without rain, from October 3, 1912 to November 8, 1914. It is to the south of the <span class="loc">Granite Mountains</span> and the <span class="loc">Mojave National Preserve</span>, and north of the <span class="loc">Bullion Mountains</span>.</p>
