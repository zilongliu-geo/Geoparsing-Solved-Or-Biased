<p><span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span> (simplified Chinese: 钟祥; traditional Chinese: 鐘祥; pinyin: Zhōngxiáng) is a county-level <span class="loc">city of Jingmen</span>, central <span class="loc">Hubei province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. The name <span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span> means "Blessed with propitious omen", and was given to the city by the Jiajing Emperor in the Ming dynasty. <span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span> is a well-known historical and cultural city in <span class="loc">China</span>. <span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span> is one of the cradles of Chu culture. It was the alternate capital of the Chu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period. Because the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567) of the Ming dynasty was born and had lived in the city before he succeeded to the throne, <span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span>, the place where the Chengtian Prefecture (fu) Government Office was located, became one of the three major prefectures directly under the central government. Once on the throne, the Jiajing Emperor controversially had his dead father Zhu Youyuan (1476–1519) retroactively styled as the Gongruixian Emperor; his mother became the Zhangsheng empress dowager. They were buried at a sumptuous mausoleum, knowns as the Xianling Tomb, a few kilometers northeast of <span class="loc">Zhongxiang</span>.</p>
