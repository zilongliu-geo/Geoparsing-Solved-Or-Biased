  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Chatsworth</span>, is a large suburb created in <span class="date">the 1960s</span> to house the predominantly <span class="loc">South</span> <span class="loc">Africa</span> Indian population. The suburb is situated in <span class="loc">South Durban</span> basin in <span class="loc">South Africa</span> and is roughly bordered by the <span class="loc">Umhlatuzana River</span> in the North and <span class="loc">Umlaas River</span> in the <span class="loc">South</span>. In <span class="date">the 1940s</span>, The Pegging Acts and the Ghetto Act were passed. These acts gave the government the right to remove and destroy shacks and small self-made shelters, with the putative intention of improving sanitary conditions. This led to the <span class="org">Group</span> Areas Act of <span class="date">June 1950</span>, which designated certain areas for the Whites and other areas for Indians, Coloureds and Africans. Indians were removed from areas such as <span class="loc">Mayville</span>, <span class="loc">Cato Manor</span>, the <span class="loc">Clairwood</span>, Magazine Barracks, Bluff, Riverside, Prospect Hall, <span class="per">Duikerfontein</span> and <span class="per">Sea</span> <span class="loc">Cow Lake</span>. The removed populace was moved into primarily the two large Indian suburbs of Phoenix, which is situated <span class="loc">North of Durban</span>, and <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> in the <span class="loc">South</span>. During the <span class="date">later 1940s and early 1950s</span>, there were advertisements in the papers of an exclusively Indian suburb, <span class="loc">Umhlatuzana</span>. Then in <span class="date">the early 1960s</span> <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> was planned, opening in <span class="date">1964</span> and consisting of eleven neighbourhood units. Modern day <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> is spread over seven municipal wards which all fall roughly in the <span class="loc">South Central</span> municipal area. <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> was deliberately built to act as buffer between white residential areas and the large African township of <span class="loc">Umlazi</span>.</p><br><br>
