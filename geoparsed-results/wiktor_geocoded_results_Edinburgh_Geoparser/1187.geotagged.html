<p><span class="loc">Milan</span> (pronounced /ˈmaɪlən/) is a village in <span class="loc">Erie</span> and <span class="loc">Huron</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The population was 1,367 at the 2010 census. It is best known as the birthplace of American inventor <span class="loc">Thomas Edison</span>. The <span class="loc">Erie County</span> portion of <span class="loc">Milan</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Sandusky Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, while the <span class="loc">Huron County</span> portion is part of the Norwalk Micropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Milan</span> village was platted by Ebenezer Merry in 1817 on the site of a previously abandoned Moravian Indian mission village, named "Petquotting", (1805-1809). Mr. Merry dammed the <span class="loc">Huron</span> River below the village and established "Merrys Mills", a gristmill and sawmill in the river valley. <span class="loc">Milan</span> village, originally named 'Beatty', was incorporated as '<span class="loc">Milan</span>' in 1833, in large measure to finance the construction of the <span class="loc">Milan</span> Canal. It was also well known for it's cat houses, that locals say, he'd return every three months to visit his step sister and cousin there. Prior to the advent of railroads, regional farmers had to bring their harvests to <span class="loc">Lake Erie</span> ports by wagon. The sandy and wet prairies north and west of <span class="loc">Milan</span> were not easily crossed by a wagon with a heavy harvest load. Beginning in 1826, local investors proposed a ship canal that would make <span class="loc">Milan</span> a lake port that could conveniently connect to the new <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal, allowing direct regional commerce with New <span class="loc">York City</span>.</p>
