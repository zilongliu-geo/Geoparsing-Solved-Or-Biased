<p><span class="loc">Chester</span> (/ˈtʃɛstər/ CHESS-tər) is a walled city in <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Lying on the <span class="loc">River Dee</span>, close to the border with <span class="loc">Wales</span>, it is the largest and most populous settlement of the unitary authority area of <span class="loc">Cheshire West</span> and <span class="loc">Chester</span>, which had a combined population of 328,100 according to the 2001 Census, increasing to 329,608 at the 2011 Census. <span class="loc">Chester</span> was granted city status in 1541. <span class="loc">Chester</span> was founded as a "castrum" or Roman fort with the name Deva Victrix, during the reign of the Emperor Vespasian in AD79. One of the three main army camps in the Roman <span class="loc">province of Britannia</span>, <span class="loc">Deva</span> later became a major civilian settlement. In 689, King Æthelred of Mercia founded the Minster Church of West Mercia, which later became <span class="loc">Chester</span>'s first cathedral, and the Saxons extended and strengthened the walls, much of which remain, to protect the city against the Danes. <span class="loc">Chester</span> was one of the last cities in <span class="loc">England</span> to fall to the <span class="loc">Normans</span>. William the Conqueror ordered the construction of a castle, to dominate the town and the nearby Welsh border.</p>
