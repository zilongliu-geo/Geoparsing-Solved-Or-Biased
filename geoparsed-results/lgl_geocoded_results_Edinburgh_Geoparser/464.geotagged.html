<p>Drug addicts guilty of harassment. A pair of drug addicts who preyed on a vulnerable <span class="loc">Hounslow</span> resident have admitted harassment. John Lambe, 23, and Matthew Evans, 25, both from <span class="loc">Hounslow</span>, appeared in court charged with theft and harassment after repeatedly taking money from the 58-year-old, who suffers from learning difficulties. He revealed he needed money after <span class="loc">Lambe</span> and <span class="loc">Evans</span> convinced him to hand over his benefit cheque. PC Doug Moore, of <span class="loc">Hounslow</span> safer neighbourhood team (SNT), issued the pair with a harassment warning notice to prevent them continuing their actions while he made further enquiries, and persuaded the victim to provide a statement. A month later the victim told police the pair had taken money from him and they were arrested. Lambe and Evans appeared at Feltham Magistratesâ€™ Court on November 18, where they pleaded not guilty and elected for trial at Crown Court. However, after the victim gave evidence at Kingston Crown Court, the men pleaded guilty. He is due to reappear at court on April 3.</p>
