<p><span class="loc">Truro</span> /ˈtrɜːroʊ/ is a town in <span class="loc">Barnstable County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, comprising two villages: <span class="loc">Truro</span> and <span class="loc">North Truro</span>. Located slightly more than 100 miles (160 km) by road from <span class="loc">Boston</span>, it is a summer vacation community just south of the northern tip of Cape Cod, in an area known as the "Outer Cape". English colonists named it after <span class="loc">Truro</span> in <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. The historic Wampanoag Native American people called the area <span class="loc">Pamet</span> or Payomet. Their language was part of the large Algonquian family. This name was adopted for the <span class="loc">Pamet River</span> and the harbor area around the town center known as the <span class="loc">Pamet</span> Roads. The population of <span class="loc">Truro</span> was 2,003 at the 2010 census. Over half of the land area of the town is part of the <span class="loc">Cape Cod National Seashore</span>, established in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, and administered by the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> National Park Service. Cape Cod was the territory of succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples for thousands of years before Europeans arrived. At the time of English colonization, the Wampanoag tribe was the dominant one on Cape Cod, numbering about 7,000 by early accounts. They used the cape and its waters for hunting, fishing and gathering shellfish. They also cultivated maize to supplement their diets and to store for winter eating.</p>
