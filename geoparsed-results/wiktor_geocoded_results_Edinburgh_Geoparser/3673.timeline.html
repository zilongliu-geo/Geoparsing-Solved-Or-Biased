  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hermosillo</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [eɾmoˈsiʎo]), formerly called <span class="per">Pitic</span> (as Santísima <span class="per">Trinidad del Pitic</span> and <span class="per">Presidio del Pitic</span>) is a city located centrally in the northwestern Mexican state of <span class="loc">Sonora</span>. It is the capital and largest city as well as the main economic center for the state and region. It contains almost all of the state's manufacturing and has seventy percent of its population. The major manufacturing sector is automobiles, which was begun in <span class="date">the 1980s</span>, when <span class="org">Ford</span> built the <span class="org">Hermosillo Stamping &amp; Assembly Plant</span>. <span class="org">Evidence</span> of the area's first inhabitants date back <span class="date">3,000 years</span>, much of which are from a site called the San Dieguito Complex, located in the El Pinacate Zone. <span class="org">Evidence</span> of agriculture dates back <span class="date">2,500 years</span>. In the pre-Hispanic era, this area was inhabited by the <span class="loc">Seri</span>, <span class="loc">Tepoca</span>, and <span class="loc">Pima</span> peoples. The first encounter between the Spanish and natives occurred in the middle of the 16th century, when explorers were sent here in search of gold, which did not exist. The first missionaries arrived in the state of <span class="loc">Sonora</span> around <span class="date">1614</span>, and Eusebio Francisco Kino arrived in <span class="date">1687</span>, founding a mission in nearby <span class="loc">Cucurpe</span>. What is <span class="date">now</span> the states of <span class="loc">Sonora</span> and <span class="loc">Sinaloa</span> was loosely organized as the <span class="loc">provinces of Sonora</span>, <span class="per">Ostimura</span> and <span class="per">Sinaloa</span>.</p><br><br>
