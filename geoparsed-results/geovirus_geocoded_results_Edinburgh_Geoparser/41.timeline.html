  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Health officials in the <span class="loc">Gaza Strip</span> confirmed the territory's first five cases of H1N1 swine flu earlier today. The territory's Health Ministry is working with the <span class="org">World Health Organisation</span> (WHO) to obtain the supplies needed to treat the potentially deadly virus. Neighbouring <span class="loc">Israel</span> has a blockade on <span class="loc">Gaza</span>, and <span class="loc">Egypt</span> restricts movement across its border with the territory as well. Health officials say that isolation likely kept the H1N1 virus from affecting <span class="loc">Gaza</span> sooner. Mahmoud Daher, a senior official for the WHO, said that <span class="loc">Gaza</span> has around 1,000 vaccine doses for the 8,000 medical workers in the territory. <span class="loc">West</span> Bank Health Ministry official Asad Ramlawi, however, commented that an additional one million doses would be delivered to the area at <span class="date">the end of the year</span>.</p><br><br>
