<p><span class="loc">Darlington</span> is a small city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Darlington County</span>, in the northeastern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. It is a center for tobacco farming. The population was 6,289 at the 2010 census, down from 6,720 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Florence Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Darlington</span>, theorized to be named for the Revolutionary War Colonel Darlington, is known for its Darlington Oak and Spanish moss. <span class="loc">Darlington County</span> was named thus by an Act in March 1785. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is best known for <span class="loc">Darlington Raceway</span>, a speedway that is home to the annual NASCAR Southern 500 race. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is also the site of the National Motorsports Press Association (NMPA) Hall of Fame. This area was settled in the mid-18th century by Welsh, Scotch-Irish, and English farmers, who grew cotton primarily. The settlement of what is now <span class="loc">Darlington County</span> began in earnest after 1736 and 1737 when the province of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> set aside a vast area of land for the Welsh Baptists of <span class="loc">Delaware</span>. This Welsh Tract bordered both sides of the <span class="loc">Pee Dee River</span>. Soon after the first settlers began to arrive they constituted the Welsh Neck Baptist Church. This church was first located on the north side of the <span class="loc">Pee Dee River</span>, opposite present-day Society Hill. For almost thirty years settlers concentrated on the banks and small tributaries of the <span class="loc">Pee Dee River</span>. Beginning in the 1760s and continuing into the 1770s other groups slowly made their way into present-day <span class="loc">Darlington</span> and were granted lands on the Lynches River, <span class="loc">Jeffries Creek</span>, and a host of other watercourses. These later settlers included descendants of French Huguenots, Scots-Irish, and the English.</p>
