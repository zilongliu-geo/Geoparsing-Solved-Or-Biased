  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Grafton</span> is the oldest city in <span class="loc">Jersey County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located near the confluence of the <span class="loc">Illinois</span> and <span class="loc">Mississippi Rivers</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census, the city had a total population of 674. Prior to the Great Flood of <span class="date">1993</span>, <span class="loc">Grafton</span> had enjoyed a stable population of nearly 1,000 residents. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> is a part of the Metro-East region and the St. <span class="loc">Louis Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Founded in <span class="date">1832</span> by <span class="per">James Mason</span>, <span class="loc">Grafton</span> is the oldest city in <span class="loc">Jersey County</span>. Described as having "a post office, one store, one tavern, and a number of families" in <span class="date">1834</span>, the area was being settled as early as <span class="date">1812</span> when a blockhouse was built at the confluence for protection. The city was named after <span class="per">Mason</span>'s birthplace of <span class="loc">Grafton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. <span class="loc">Grafton</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">May 16, 1907</span>. <span class="loc">Grafton</span>’s population reached its peak at approximately 10,000 in the 1850s with employment opportunities coming from the local stone quarries, boat building and commercial fishing. At one point, there were five quarries in or around <span class="loc">Grafton</span> that employed nearly 2,000 men. The local limestone was used to build the <span class="loc">Eads</span> Bridge in <span class="per">St. Louis</span>, government buildings in <span class="loc">Rock Island</span>, and the <span class="loc">Jersey County</span> Courthouse in <span class="loc">Jerseyville</span>. The Shafer’s Wharf Historic District was one of the largest commercial fishing centers along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River in the late 19th century. The Old Boatworks, located south of Main Street, once housed a paint house and a machine shop where paddle wheelers and later PT boats were built. <span class="date">Today</span>, the Old Boatworks building hosts many antique and craft stalls and is open on the fourth <span class="date">weekend</span> of each month from <span class="date">May</span> through <span class="date">October</span>.</p><br><br>
