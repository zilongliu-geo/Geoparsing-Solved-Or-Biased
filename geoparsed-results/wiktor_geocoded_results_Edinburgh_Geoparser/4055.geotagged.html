It is located 13 miles (21 km) east-southeast of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. It was an ancient parish in the <span class="loc">county of Kent</span>. As part of the suburban growth of <span class="loc">London</span> in the 20th century, <span class="loc">Bexley</span> increased in population, becoming a municipal borough in 1935 and has formed part of <span class="loc">Greater London</span> since 1965. <span class="loc">Bexley</span> was an ancient <span class="loc">parish of Kent</span>, in the <span class="loc">Diocese of Rochester</span>, and under the Local Government Act 1894 formed part of <span class="loc">Bexley Urban</span> District. The urban district gained further status in 1935 as a municipal borough. Kent County Council formed the second tier of local government during that time.

Bexley Municipal Borough, Erith Municipal Borough, <span class="loc">Crayford Urban</span> District Council and Chislehurst &amp; Sidcup Urban District Council were merged (less areas of <span class="loc">Chislehurst</span> and <span class="loc">Sidcup</span> that became part of the new <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Bromley</span>) into a new <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Bexley</span>.</p>
