  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Tala</span> (Greek: Τάλα) is a large suburban village 6 km <span class="loc">north of Paphos</span>, <span class="loc">Cyprus</span>. Many non-Cypriots (mostly British) have moved here permanently or have a <span class="date">summer</span> home in <span class="loc">Tala</span>. Ayios Neofytos Monastery is 1 km north. <span class="loc">Tala</span> is the ancestral village of the singer <span class="per">Cat Stevens</span>. His father, <span class="per">Stavros Georgiou</span>, was born here in <span class="date">1900</span>. In his book 'Historic <span class="loc">Cyprus</span>' (second edition <span class="date">1947</span>), Rupert Gunnis (at that time <span class="org">Inspector of Antiquities</span> on the island) wrote: The Church of <span class="loc">St. Catherine</span> is a large and well-built edifice in the Byzantine style, with a central dome. The narthex has been added later. <span class="date">A year ago</span> or so two completely unnecessary doors were pierced in the south wall. There are considerable remains of frescoes on the west wall, more especially of the Judgement, and also three heads of animals with water gushing from their mouths, representing the sources of three rivers, perhaps the <span class="loc">Jordan</span>, <span class="loc">Tigris</span>, and <span class="loc">Euphrates</span>. The Gospels and church plate are Russian. About a mile from the village are the ruins of a large church dedicated to <span class="loc">St. George</span>. Founders' tombs remain on the north and south walls, with traces of painting in their arches.</p><br><br>
