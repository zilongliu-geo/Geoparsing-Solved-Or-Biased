Clinton is the principal city of the Clinton Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is coterminous with <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>. Clinton was incorporated on January 26, 1857. Among the first settlers of European origin in the Clinton area was Elijah Buell, who built a log cabin on July 25, 1835 and established the town of <span class="loc">Lyons</span>, named after the French city of the same name. <span class="loc">Lyons</span> later merged with Clinton. Clinton was platted as the town of <span class="loc">New York</span> in 1836 by Joseph Bartlett. In March 1837, Noble and Sarah Gregory Perrin purchased 136 acres (0.55 km2) of land in what is now Clinton and raised their family in a cabin located approximately at the foot of the railroad bridge. Their oldest daughter, Valeria, married Dr. Augustus Lafayette Ankeny, who participated in the Blackhawk war and came to <span class="loc">Lyons</span> in April 1850.</p>
