  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> /ˈbiːkənzfiːld/ is a former gold mining town near the <span class="loc">Tamar River</span>, in the north-east of <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>.

At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> had a population of 1,199. The area around <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> was first explored by Europeans in <span class="date">1804</span> when <span class="per">William Paterson</span> led an expedition to <span class="loc">Port Dalrymple</span> and established a settlement at <span class="loc">York Town</span>. Settlement of <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> itself, then known as <span class="loc">Brandy Creek</span> did not occur until the 1850s. Limestone mining led to the discovery of gold in <span class="date">1869</span>. Gold mining began in <span class="date">1877</span> and the area's population boomed. <span class="loc">Brandy Creek</span> Post Office opened on <span class="date">1 December 1877</span> and was renamed <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> in <span class="date">1879</span>. The town was named <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> in <span class="date">1879</span> in honour of <span class="per">Benjamin Disraeli</span>, 1st <span class="per">Earl of Beaconsfield</span>, who was the Prime Minister of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> at the time. In <span class="date">1881</span>, the <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> newspaper was called the <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> Tickler. In <span class="date">1953</span>, <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> was the first town in <span class="loc">Australia</span> to fluoridate the water supply. Gold was first discovered in <span class="per">Beaconsfield</span> in <span class="date">1847</span>. When the gold rush hit Victoria and <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> in <span class="date">1851</span> and the Tasmanian Government offered a reward for the discovery of a payable goldfield. In <span class="date">1877</span> the cap of a payable gold reef was discovered on the eastern slope of Cabbage Tree Hill by brothers <span class="per">William</span> and <span class="per">David</span> Dally. This became known as the fabulous Tasmanian Reef. In <span class="date">October 1877</span> the <span class="org">Dally brothers</span> sold their claim on the <span class="loc">Tasmania</span> Reef to <span class="per">William D Grubb</span> &amp; <span class="per">William Hart</span> for 15,000 pounds, and <span class="date">1/10</span> share in any company formed.</p><br><br>
