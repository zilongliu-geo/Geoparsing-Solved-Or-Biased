<p>Blast Injures Three in <span class="loc">Abkhazia</span>. Two Abkhaz servicemen and one local resident were injured as a result of an explosion in the village of Achguara of the <span class="loc">Ochamchire district</span> on March 29, the Abkhaz news agency, Apsnipress, reported. The breakaway region’s law enforcement agencies said that a remote control explosive device went off and suggested that the Georgian special services could have been behind “the terrorist act.” Tbilisi has denied the allegation and the Georgian television stations reported that the blast was a result of infighting between the Abkhaz gangs. According to the Abkhaz law enforcement agencies the explosive was placed in the roof of a shop and it went off when the Abkhaz servicemen entered the shop. The third person injured in the blast was a shop owner. The explosive went off in a village of the <span class="loc">Ochamchire district</span>.</p>
