  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Berlin</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Camden County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 7,588, reflecting an increase of 1,439 (+23.4%) from the 6,149 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 477 (+8.4%) from the 5,672 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. <span class="loc">Berlin</span> was incorporated as a borough on <span class="date">March 29, 1927</span>, from portions of Berlin Township, based on the results of a referendum held on <span class="date">April 26, 1927</span>. What is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Berlin</span> was known in earlier times as "Longacoming." Local Native Americans used Lonaconing Trail to describe the travel route that ran through the area, connecting the <span class="loc">Jersey Shore</span> to the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River. Another tradition cites early European visitors who found a stream at the head of the <span class="loc">Great Egg Harbor River</span> and appreciated the respite as being "long a coming". Long-A-Coming became a stopping point for stagecoaches located at the halfway point between <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="loc">Atlantic City</span>. Upon the creation of <span class="loc">Camden County</span> in <span class="date">1844</span>, it was briefly named the county seat (while the area was still a part of Waterford Township), until <span class="date">1848</span> when the seat moved to the <span class="loc">city of Camden</span>. A rail line was laid in <span class="date">1853</span>. <span class="date">Three years later</span>, the Long-A-Coming railroad station was built. In <span class="date">February 1867</span>, the station was renamed "Magnolia". This caused confusion because there was a community called Magnolia nearby. <span class="date">Three months later</span>, the station's name changed to <span class="loc">Berlin</span>. The name "Berlin" may have been chosen as a reference to the <span class="loc">city of Berlin</span> in <span class="loc">Germany</span>, though the derivation is uncertain.</p><br><br>
