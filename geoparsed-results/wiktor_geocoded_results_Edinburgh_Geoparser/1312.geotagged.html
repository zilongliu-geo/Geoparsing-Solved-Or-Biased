<p>Mercedes (Spanish pronunciation: [merˈseðes]) is a city in <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> Province, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. It is located 100 km west from <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> and 30 km southwest of Luján. It is the administrative headquarters for the district (partido) of Mercedes as well as of the judicial district.

Mercedes has a population of 51,967 people (51,5% women, 48,5% men) as per the 2001 census [INDEC]. Mercedes was first established as a fortress against native indigenous attacks. Its original name was "<span class="loc">La Guardia</span> de Luján" and it was one of several fortress built in the borders of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> to protect this city and gather the people living in the county near. It became a town on 25 June 1752 when founded by José de Zárate during a military campaign known as "<span class="loc">La Valerosa</span>". In 1777 viceroy Pedro de Cevallos proposed moving the town, but actually it was moved to its present location by viceroy Juan José de Vértiz on 8 May 1779.
