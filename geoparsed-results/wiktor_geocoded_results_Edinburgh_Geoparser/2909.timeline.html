  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Berlin</span> /ˈbɜːrlᵻn/ is a city along the <span class="loc">Androscoggin</span> River in <span class="loc">Coos County</span> in <span class="loc">northern New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 10,051 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It includes the village of <span class="org">Cascade</span>. Located on the edge of the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span>, the city's boundaries extend into the White Mountain National Forest. <span class="loc">Berlin</span> is home to the <span class="org">Moffett House</span>, Northern Forest Heritage Park, the <span class="loc">Berlin</span> <span class="loc">Fish Hatchery</span>, and the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span> Community College, a member of the Community College System of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. <span class="loc">Berlin</span> is the principal city of the <span class="org">Berlin Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which includes all of <span class="loc">Coos County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> and <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. Because <span class="loc">Quebec</span> is less than 60 miles (100 km) away, <span class="loc">Berlin</span> has a large number of people of French Canadian descent in its population. Around 65% of its residents speak a variant of New <span class="loc">England</span> French, which is locally known as “<span class="loc">Berlin</span> French”. Around <span class="date">11,000 years ago</span>, small groups of Native Americans camped around the area of what is <span class="date">now</span> called <span class="loc">Berlin</span>. In later <span class="date">years</span>, the Eastern Abenaki tribes came to <span class="loc">Berlin</span> to mine rhyolite on Mt. Jasper.</p><br><br>
