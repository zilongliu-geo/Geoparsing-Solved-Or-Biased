<p>Lincoln /ˈlɪŋkən/ is the capital of the State of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> and the second-most populous city in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. Lincoln is also the county seat of <span class="loc">Lancaster County</span> Lincoln is located in the southeastern part of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> and is in the <span class="loc">Lincoln metropolitan</span> (statistical) area. Lincoln's population in 2014 was estimated at 272,996. Lincoln was founded as the village of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> on the wild salt flats of what was to become <span class="loc">Lancaster County</span>. A short time later, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> was renamed Lincoln and became Nebraska's capital. Sometimes referred to as the "<span class="loc">Star City</span>", many of Lincoln's primary employers fall within the service and manufacturing industries, including a growing high tech sector. The city is the home of the University of Nebraska, has an unemployment rate of 2.2% (December 2015, preliminary) and has the second tallest capitol building in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Prior to the expansion westward of settlers, the prairie was covered with buffalo grass. Plains Indians, descendants of indigenous peoples who occupied the area for thousands of years, lived in and hunted along <span class="loc">Salt Creek</span>. The <span class="loc">Pawnee</span>, which included four tribes, lived in villages along the <span class="loc">Platte River</span>. The Great Sioux Nation, including the Ihanktowan-Ihanktowana and the <span class="loc">Lakota</span> located to the north and west, used <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> as a hunting and skirmish ground, although they did not have any long-term settlements in the state. An occasional buffalo could still be seen in the plat of Lincoln in the 1860s.</p>
