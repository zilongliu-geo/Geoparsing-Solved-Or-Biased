<p><span class="loc">Longwood</span> is a settlement and a district of the British island of <span class="loc">Saint Helena</span> in the South Atlantic. In 2008 it had a population of 715, compared to a population of 960 in 1998. The area of the district is 33.4 km2. The large district (second only to <span class="loc">Blue Hill</span>) includes the settlement of Hutt's Gate, with its St Matthew's church. The district also contains the island's only existing golf course. The district contains <span class="loc">Prosperous Bay Plain</span>, which is where Saint Helena Airport is being constructed. There is a weather recording station in the <span class="loc">Longwood district</span>. Readings of temperature, air pressure and visibility are automatically read and communicated every 3 hours. On leaving the University of Oxford, in 1676, Edmond Halley visited <span class="loc">Saint Helena</span> and set up an observatory with a 24-foot-long (7.3 m) aerial telescope with the intention of studying stars from the Southern Hemisphere. The site of this telescope is near St Matthew's church in the district. The 680-meter-high hill there is named for him and is called Halley's Mount. Halley's Observatory was in use 1677â€“1678. Having returned to <span class="loc">England</span> in 1678, Halley published Catalogus Stellarum Australium in 1679, which included details of 341 southern stars. These additions to present-day star maps earned him comparison with Tycho Brahe. Halley subsequently was awarded with his Masters from Oxford and Fellowship of the <span class="loc">Royal Society</span>.</p>
