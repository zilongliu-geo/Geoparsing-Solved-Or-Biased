  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The governor of the south Sudanese Warab state, <span class="per">Anthony Bol</span> <span class="loc">Madut</span> told the <span class="org">Reuters</span> news agency that at least a thousand people in the state have died of Meningitis and another unidentified disease. He said that the unknown disease had symptoms similar to Yellow fever but the patients died quickly. The governor appealed for medical assistance to diagnose and help control the outbreak. The outbreak comes as hundreds of thousands of refugees return to southern <span class="loc">Sudan</span> after a peace deal ended conflict in the areas. The refugees are housed in crowded camps where the risk of infection is high. Hotspots in <span class="loc">south Sudan</span> and <span class="loc">Darfur</span> are experiencing a lull in the fighting that has allowed normal life to return to these areas. Meanwhile, the NGO <span class="org">SOS Children's Villages</span> <span class="loc">Sudan</span> reports that despite the ceasefire among the warring factions in <span class="loc">south Sudan</span> and <span class="loc">Darfur</span>, people are still worried that conflict may erupt once again. <span class="org">SOS</span> is also concerned about shortages in medicine and clean water in its facilities in these areas. <span class="org">SOS</span> emergency relief activities have restarted in <span class="loc">Abu Shok</span> refugee camp in Al-Fashir, <span class="loc">Darfur</span>, with most of the psychologists and social workers returning to work in the psycho-social centres, an <span class="org">SOS</span> release reports. Work with the patients and beneficiaries of the three centres it maintains has started once again, the release adds. The situation in <span class="org">SOS</span> Children's Village <span class="loc">Malakal</span> is also stable, but cholera is still spreading among the residents of the area, especially children. <span class="org">SOS Children's Villages</span> <span class="loc">Sudan</span> is providing emergency medical assistance in the form of medication for the children in the <span class="org">SOS</span> Children's Village, as well as those being treated in the local children's hospital. According to the <span class="org">SOS</span> release, most international organisations and NGOs have returned to work in both <span class="loc">Darfur</span> and <span class="loc">Malakal</span>, especially the World Food Programme and other <span class="org">UN</span> agencies. Several NGOs, however, have not resumed activities in the conflict areas. Airplanes are flying into <span class="loc">Darfur</span> and <span class="loc">Malakal</span>, but flights to <span class="loc">Darfur</span> are not as regular as before the conflict and there are no scheduled flights to the area of <span class="loc">Malakal</span>. Telephone communications are still unstable, and co-workers from <span class="org">SOS Children's Villages</span> <span class="loc">Sudan</span> in <span class="loc">Khartoum</span> are relying on satellite telephones to communicate with <span class="loc">Darfur</span> and <span class="loc">Malakal</span>. <span class="per">Mr. Ali Mahdi</span>, director of <span class="org">SOS</span> <span class="org">Children's Villages</span> <span class="loc">Sudan</span>, said that despite the relative quiet in both <span class="loc">Darfur</span> and <span class="loc">Malakal</span>, people are still worried and tense regarding the situation. Co-workers at the <span class="org">SOS Emergency Relief Centres</span> in <span class="loc">Darfur</span> and those in the <span class="org">SOS</span> Children's Village <span class="loc">Malakal</span> are afraid of conflict breaking out again in the areas. <span class="per">Mr. Mahdi</span> also said that the centres in <span class="loc">Darfur</span> and the <span class="org">SOS</span> Children's Village in <span class="loc">Malakal</span> are both suffering from shortages in clean water and medication, some of which are being sent from <span class="loc">Khartoum</span>. During a visit to <span class="loc">Darfur</span> on <span class="date">10 January</span>, <span class="per">Mr. Ali Mahdi</span> visited the town of <span class="loc">Nyala</span>, the capital of <span class="loc">South Darfur</span>, where there is a similar refugee problem as that in Al-Fashir. <span class="org">SOS Children's Villages</span> <span class="loc">Sudan</span> is <span class="date">now</span> considering starting an emergency relief programme similar to the one in <span class="loc">Abu Shok</span> refugee camp in Al-Fashir.</p><br><br>
