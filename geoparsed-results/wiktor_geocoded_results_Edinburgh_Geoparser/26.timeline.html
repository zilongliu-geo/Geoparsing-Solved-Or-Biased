  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bala</span> (Welsh: <span class="loc">Y Bala</span>) is a market town and community in <span class="loc">Gwynedd</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span>. Formerly an urban district, <span class="loc">Bala</span> lies within the historic <span class="loc">county of Merionethshire</span>. It lies at the north end of <span class="loc">Bala Lake</span> (Welsh: <span class="loc">Llyn Tegid</span>), 17 miles (27 km) north-east of <span class="loc">Dolgellau</span>, with a population taken in the <span class="date">2001</span> and 2011 census' of 1,980. It is little more than one wide street, Stryd Fawr (High Street, literally "Great Street"). The High Street and its shops can be quite busy in the <span class="date">summer</span> <span class="date">months</span> with many tourists. <span class="loc">Bala</span> is ranked 11th in the list of the highest percentages of Welsh language speakers in <span class="loc">Wales</span>. According to the (<span class="date">2011</span> census), 78.5% of Bala's population can speak Welsh fluently, with the highest percentage in the 5-9 age group, 95.7%. In the 18th century, the town was well known for the manufacture of flannel, stockings, gloves and hosiery. The Tower of <span class="loc">Bala</span> (Welsh: Tomen) (30 ft. (9 m) high by 50 ft (15 m) diameter) is a tumulus or "moat-hill", formerly thought to mark the site of a Roman camp. The large stone-built theological college, Coleg <span class="loc">Y Bala</span>, of the Calvinistic Methodists and the grammar school, which was founded in <span class="date">1712</span>, are the chief features, together with the statue of the Rev. <span class="per">Thomas Charles</span> (<span class="date">1755</span>â€“<span class="date">1814</span>), the theological writer, to whom was largely due the foundation of the <span class="org">British and Foreign Bible Society</span>. Other famous people from the <span class="loc">Bala</span> area include <span class="per">Michael D. Jones</span>, <span class="per">Christopher Timothy</span>, <span class="per">Owen Morgan Edwards</span>, born in <span class="loc">Llanuwchllyn</span>, and <span class="per">T.E. Ellis</span>, born in Cefnddwysarn.</p><br><br>
