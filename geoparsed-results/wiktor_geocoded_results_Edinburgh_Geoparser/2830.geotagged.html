It lies on the way between <span class="loc">Udupi</span> and <span class="loc">Mangalore</span> beside National Highway 66 (previously NH-17). A road from <span class="loc">Kaup</span> goes to interior places like Manchakal, Shirva. <span class="loc">Kaup</span> is a small village in <span class="loc">Karnataka State</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>, with a population 6500. It is 13 km south of <span class="loc">Udupi</span> ( a village is famous for its ancient Krishna Temple) and 40 km north of <span class="loc">Mangalore</span> ( a port). It is famous for its lighthouse and the three Mariamma temples and a fort built by Tippu Sultan. There is a beach on the shore of the <span class="loc">Arabian Sea</span> and a lighthouse. Many films have been shot at this location. <span class="loc">Kaup</span> has three Marigudi which attracts devotees from far away places. The sea is much more rougher and intimidating compared to the gentler Malpe beach in <span class="loc">Udupi</span>. It is about 15 km from <span class="loc">Manipal</span> and is a favorite hangout for students. The beach also sports a shack and a bar with seating in the open sky. Though the sea is mostly calm all year round, there have been isolated cases of drowning in this beach</p>
