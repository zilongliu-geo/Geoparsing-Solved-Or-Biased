  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Assad</span>: <span class="loc">Syria</span> still believes in peace with <span class="loc">Israel</span>. Syrian <span class="per">President Bashar Assad</span> told the weekly magazine the New Yorker that though it may take some time, <span class="loc">Syria</span> still believes in the power of serious dialogue to produce a lasting peace with <span class="loc">Israel</span>. In an interview via email <span class="date">several days</span> after <span class="loc">Israel</span> and Hamas declared unilateral cease-fires following <span class="loc">Israel</span>'s three-week offensive in the <span class="loc">Gaza Strip</span>, <span class="per">Assad</span> said that though <span class="loc">Israel</span> was "doing everything possible to undermine the prospects for peace," he was still very interested in closing a deal. "We have to wait a little while to see how things will evolve and how the situation changes," <span class="per">Assad</span> wrote as <span class="loc">Israel</span> voted in a new government headed by <span class="per">Benjamin Netanyau</span>. "We still believe that we need to conclude a serious dialogue to lead us to peace," he declared. In the interview, <span class="per">Assad</span> argued that <span class="loc">Israel</span> understands that the return of the <span class="loc">Golan Heights</span>, which <span class="loc">Israel</span> captured from <span class="loc">Syria</span> during the <span class="date">1967</span> Six-Day War, is not negotiable. "The Israelis know that we are not going to negotiate the line of <span class="date">1967</span>," <span class="per">Assad</span> wrote, but suggested that compromises were possible. "We only demarcate the line," he wrote. "We negotiate the relations, the water and everything else." ? You discuss everything after the peace and getting your land. Not before," <span class="per">Assad</span> stressed. "Hezbollah is in <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> and Hamas is in <span class="loc">Palestine</span>," <span class="per">Assad</span> continued. "If they want to solve the problem with Hezbollah they have to deal with <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>. For Hamas, they have to deal with <span class="loc">Gaza</span>. For <span class="loc">Iran</span>, it is not part of the peace process anyway. This peace is about peace between <span class="loc">Syria</span> and <span class="loc">Israel</span>." The Syrian president reiterated his stance that it was <span class="date">now</span>, more than ever, "essential that the <span class="loc">United States</span> play a prominent and active role in the peace process," explaining that <span class="loc">Syria</span> required direct contact with <span class="loc">U.S.</span> President <span class="per">Barack Obama</span> in order to advance the diplomatic process. <span class="per">Assad</span> also lauded the diplomatic efforts of former <span class="loc">U.S.</span> president <span class="per">Jimmy Carter</span>, saying that "<span class="per">Carter</span> is most knowledgeable about <span class="loc">the Middle East</span> and he does not try to dictate or give sermons. He sincerely is trying to think creatively and find solutions that are outside the box."</p><br><br>
