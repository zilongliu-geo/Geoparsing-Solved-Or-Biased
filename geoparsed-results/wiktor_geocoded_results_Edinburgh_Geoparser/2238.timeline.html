  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Arnold</span> is a market town, unparished area and suburb of the <span class="loc">city of Nottingham</span>, in the English ceremonial <span class="loc">county of Nottinghamshire</span>. It is to the north-east of Nottingham’s city boundary, and is in the local government <span class="loc">district of Gedling</span> Borough. Since <span class="date">1968</span> <span class="loc">Arnold</span> has had a market, and the town used to have numerous factories associated with the hosiery industry. Arnold’s town centre is the largest in <span class="loc">Gedling Borough</span> (whose headquarters are located in the town) and the most important in the northeastern part of the Greater Nottingham conurbation. At the time of the <span class="date">2011</span> Census, <span class="loc">Arnold</span> had a population of 37,768. Areas within <span class="loc">Arnold</span> include <span class="loc">Daybrook</span>, <span class="loc">Woodthorpe</span>, <span class="loc">Redhill</span> and Killisick. <span class="loc">Arnold</span> was referred to as ‘Ernehale’ in the Domesday Book of <span class="date">1068</span>; this former name meant ‘place frequented by eagles’ or ‘the valley of eagles’. ‘A History of Arnold’ (<span class="date">1913</span>) by <span class="per">Rev. Rupert W. King</span> and Rev. <span class="per">James Russell</span> explains the etymology of Arnold’s name thus: ‘Heron-hald’, meaning the corner of the forest where Herons (large birds) live. Which becomes over the <span class="date">centuries</span> since <span class="date">500 A.D.</span> by ‘lazy’ pronunciation, Eron-ald, thence Ern-old and Arn-old.</p><br><br>
