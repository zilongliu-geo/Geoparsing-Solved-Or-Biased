<p>Carmen is a second income class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Bohol</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 43,579. In the 2013 election, it had 29,228 registered voters. It comprises 29 barangays with an area of 248 square kilometres (96 sq mi). Carmen was originally part of the municipality of <span class="loc">Bilar</span> and called <span class="loc">Imbaya</span>, after the name of a stream in the settlement. During the Spanish time, it was inhabited by not more than fifty families. In 1868, the people of Carmen petitioned for its independence since its population grew to an unprecedented number. The town of Carmen was founded on March 1, 1869 by final order of Governor General Jose de la <span class="loc">Gandara</span> and renamed at the same time in honor of the Lady of <span class="loc">Carmel</span> of <span class="loc">Spain</span>. In 1874, the town of Carmen had its separate parish with Father Pedro Nolasco <span class="loc">San Juan</span> as the first parish priest. Due to the influence of Spanish culture and tradition, all barangays of Carmen have a patron saint as well as a Spanish name, who are celebrated in an annual barangay fiesta.</p>
