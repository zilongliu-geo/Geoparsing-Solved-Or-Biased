  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Angola</span> /æŋˈɡoʊlə/, officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Angola</span> (Portuguese: República de <span class="loc">Angola</span> pronounced: [ɐ̃ˈɡɔlɐ]; <span class="loc">Kikongo</span>, <span class="loc">Kimbundu</span> and Umbundu: Repubilika ya <span class="loc">Ngola</span>), is a country in Southern <span class="loc">Africa</span>. It is the seventh-largest country in <span class="loc">Africa</span>, and is bordered by <span class="loc">Namibia</span> to the south, the <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Zambia</span> to the east, and the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> to west. The exclave <span class="loc">province of Cabinda</span> has borders with the <span class="loc">Republic of the Congo</span> and the <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>. The capital and largest city is <span class="loc">Luanda</span>. Although its territory has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era, modern <span class="loc">Angola</span> originates in Portuguese colonization, which began with, and was for <span class="date">centuries</span> limited to, coastal settlements and trading posts established from the 16th century onwards. In the 19th century, European settlers slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. As a Portuguese colony, <span class="loc">Angola</span> did not encompass its present borders until the early 20th century, following resistance by groups such as the <span class="loc">Cuamato</span>, the <span class="loc">Kwanyama</span> and the <span class="loc">Mbunda</span>. Independence was achieved in <span class="date">1975</span> after the protracted liberation war. That same year, <span class="loc">Angola</span> descended into an intense civil war that lasted until <span class="date">2002</span>. It has since become a relatively stable unitary presidential republic.</p><br><br>
