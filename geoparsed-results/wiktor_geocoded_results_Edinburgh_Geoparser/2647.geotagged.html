<p>Douglas is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,471 at the 2010 census. It includes the sizable Douglas State Forest, managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). The name of Douglas was first given to the territory of the town in the year 1746. New Sherburn or "New Sherburn Grant" had previously been its designation, since its first occupancy by the English settlers which was as early as 1715. The original settlers came primarily from <span class="loc">Sherburn</span>, although many hailed from <span class="loc">Natick</span> as well. New Sherburn was removed from <span class="loc">Suffolk County</span> (or <span class="loc">Middlesex county</span>?) to <span class="loc">Worcester County</span> at its formation on April 2, 1731. The name Douglas was given in 1746, when Dr. William Douglas, an eminent physician of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, in consideration of the privilege of naming the township offered the inhabitants the sum of $500.00 as a fund for the establishment of free schools together with a tract of 30 acres (12 ha) of land with a dwelling house and barn thereon. Douglas's forests gave rise to a woodcutting industry and the Douglas axe company. A woolen manufacturing company, on the <span class="loc">Mumford River</span> in <span class="loc">East Douglas</span>, in recent times held by the Schuster family, has been prominent in the history of this community. General Lafayette, of <span class="loc">France</span>, stopped here during the Revolutionary War, to change horses, on his way to <span class="loc">Boston</span> to join General Washington. Lafayette was a hero of the American Revolution and the French Revolution.</p>
