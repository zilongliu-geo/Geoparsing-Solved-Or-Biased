ATLANTIC BEACH â€” Officials in a coastal <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> town have decided to host an annual biker rally, but they will impose new restrictions <span class="date">this year</span>. <span class="org">The Sun News of Myrtle Beach</span> reported that Atlantic Beach officials decided <span class="date">Saturday night</span> to host the 29th annual Bikefest, ending <span class="date">three weeks</span> of uncertainty. Officials said discussions with Myrtle Beach, <span class="loc">Horry County</span> and North Myrtle Beach about the Bikefest's future will continue. But for the <span class="date">Memorial Day</span> <span class="date">weekend</span>, vendor fees were raised an average of $500 each, to $1,000 for retail, $1,500 for food and $3,000 for alcohol. Property owners who want to allow vendors on their lots must pay the town a $200 permit fee, which is double the price of <span class="date">last year</span>'s fee.</p><br><br>
