  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Litchfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is named after <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, <span class="loc">Devon</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The population was 12,243 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> includes the villages of <span class="loc">Terryville</span> and <span class="loc">Pequabuck</span>. The community was incorporated in <span class="date">1795</span>, and became known nationally for the manufacture of clocks. The town was named after <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Northbury</span>, a section of Waterbury]) was originally used as a burying ground for <span class="loc">Waterbury</span>. History records show that it was founded by a group of people who believed they found a large deposit of lead. This fabled "lead mine" never actually existed (or is still yet to be discovered). The oldest home in the community is on Route 6, and dates to 1690-1700. In the 1790s, <span class="loc">George Washington</span> traveled through here, both to visit relatives and to stay away from the coastline. The <span class="per">Terry</span> family participated in a great deal of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>'s history. <span class="per">Eli Terry</span> became partners with <span class="per">Seth Thomas</span> (clockmaker) and <span class="per">Silas Hoadley</span> to manufacture clocks in the <span class="loc">Greystone</span> section of town. <span class="per">Eli</span> gave the factory to <span class="per">Hoadley</span> and <span class="per">Thomas</span>, and opened his own clock factory near Carter Road in <span class="org">Plymouth Center</span>, while <span class="per">Thomas</span> moved to <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> Hollow. <span class="per">Eli Terry</span>, Jr. (son of <span class="per">Eli Terry</span>) joined with another man who was interested in the cabinet and lock industry and they opened Eagle Lock Company. In the 1880s, the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> Hollow section of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> decided to split off and become their own town called <span class="loc">Thomaston</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, named after <span class="per">Seth Thomas</span> (clockmaker). The Eagle Lock Company closed in <span class="date">the 1970s</span> and later, in <span class="date">1975</span>, the entire abandoned site burned, leaving one building left undamaged. The rest of the buildings were torn down or had floors removed.</p><br><br>
