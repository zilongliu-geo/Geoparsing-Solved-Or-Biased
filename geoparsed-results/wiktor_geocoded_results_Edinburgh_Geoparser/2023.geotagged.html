<p>Burton is a small village in the unitary authority of <span class="loc">Cheshire West</span> and <span class="loc">Chester</span> and the ceremonial <span class="loc">county of Cheshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. In the 2001 Census, the village had a population of 50. Burton is part of the <span class="loc">Duddon</span> civil parish. The village is about 2 miles (3.2 km) south east of <span class="loc">Tarvin</span> and 3 miles (4.8 km) west of <span class="loc">Tarporley</span>. The village lies on Burton Road, with the villages of <span class="loc">Duddon</span> to the north and <span class="loc">Hoofield</span> to the south. The <span class="loc">River Gowy</span> passes approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) to the south west of Burton. The <span class="loc">Eddisbury Way</span> footpath passes through the village. The village is surrounded by undulating pasture and contains three dairy farms - <span class="loc">Burton Farm</span>, <span class="loc">Holly Farm</span> and <span class="loc">Home Farm</span>. The village is dominated by <span class="loc">Burton Hall</span>. Burton currently falls within the unitary authority of <span class="loc">Cheshire West</span> and <span class="loc">Chester</span> and within the <span class="loc">Westminster</span> constituency of Eddisbury. Until 1 April 2015, Burton was a civil parish. Although classified as a civil parish, it had neither a parish council nor a parish meeting, and, consequently, the duties that would normally be performed by these bodies were the responsibility of <span class="loc">Cheshire West</span> and <span class="loc">Chester</span> Council.</p>
