<p><span class="loc">Middleton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Hardeman County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The population was 602 at the 2000 census. It is located at the intersection of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> State Route 125 and <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> State Route 57. Its slogan is the "Crossroads of the South". It is believed that early settlers in <span class="loc">Middleton</span> came from Slab Town, a small settlement about three miles north. The town was originally called Jenkins-McCommons Crossing, after Jesse Jenksins and William Taylor McCommons. These two men came to the area from <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> in 1849 and donated the majority of land where <span class="loc">Middleton</span> is today. Following the expansion of the <span class="loc">Memphis</span> and Charleston Railroad and the construction of a railroad depot, <span class="loc">Middleton</span> was chartered in 1850. It was named after an official at the <span class="loc">Memphis</span> and Charleston Railroad. The town would suffer greatly during the Civil War. After the war, only one building, a small log structure that served as a store, was left standing. <span class="loc">Middleton</span> is located at 35°3′32″N 88°53′30″W (35.058798, -88.891728). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.9 square miles (4.9 km2), of which 1.8 square miles (4.7 km2) is land and 0.54% is water.</p>
