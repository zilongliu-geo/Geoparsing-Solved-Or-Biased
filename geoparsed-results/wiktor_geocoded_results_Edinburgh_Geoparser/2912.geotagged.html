<p><span class="loc">Berlin</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Camden County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 7,588, reflecting an increase of 1,439 (+23.4%) from the 6,149 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 477 (+8.4%) from the 5,672 counted in the 1990 Census. <span class="loc">Berlin</span> was incorporated as a borough on March 29, 1927, from portions of Berlin Township, based on the results of a referendum held on April 26, 1927. What is now <span class="loc">Berlin</span> was known in earlier times as "Longacoming." Local Native Americans used Lonaconing Trail to describe the travel route that ran through the area, connecting the <span class="loc">Jersey Shore</span> to the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River. Another tradition cites early European visitors who found a stream at the head of the <span class="loc">Great Egg Harbor River</span> and appreciated the respite as being "long a coming". Long-A-Coming became a stopping point for stagecoaches located at the halfway point between <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="loc">Atlantic City</span>. Upon the creation of <span class="loc">Camden County</span> in 1844, it was briefly named the county seat (while the area was still a part of Waterford Township), until 1848 when the seat moved to the <span class="loc">city of Camden</span>. A rail line was laid in 1853. Three years later, the Long-A-Coming railroad station was built. In February 1867, the station was renamed "Magnolia". This caused confusion because there was a community called Magnolia nearby. Three months later, the station's name changed to <span class="loc">Berlin</span>. The name "Berlin" may have been chosen as a reference to the <span class="loc">city of Berlin</span> in <span class="loc">Germany</span>, though the derivation is uncertain.</p>
