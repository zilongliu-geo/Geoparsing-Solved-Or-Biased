<p><span class="loc">Gol Gol</span> is a small town in the far western region of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> in the Wentworth Shire. It is situated on the banks of the <span class="loc">Murray River</span>, in the <span class="loc">Sunraysia region</span>. Increasingly, <span class="loc">Gol Gol</span> operates as a suburb of <span class="loc">Mildura</span>, being only 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from this regional centre. In the ten years to 2006 the population of <span class="loc">Gol Gol</span> increased from 619 to 663, an average annual increase of 0.71%. On 17 March 1836, the surveyor Thomas Livingston Mitchell set out on an expedition from <span class="loc">Boree</span> Station (west of Orange) with 25 men, 2 boats, a train of bullock carts and a herd of at least 100 cattle, which were to be used for food when wild animals were scarce. On his arrival at the site of the future village the local Aboriginals informed Mitchell that the area next to the <span class="loc">Murray River</span> was called <span class="loc">Gol Gol</span> (meaning meeting place). Mitchell generally used Aboriginal names when marking his maps as he felt that a map was more useful if settlers could ask the local inhabitants for help. When Mitchell returned to his base camp on the 4 June 1836 he passed on the name of <span class="loc">Gol Gol</span> to his superiors.</p>
