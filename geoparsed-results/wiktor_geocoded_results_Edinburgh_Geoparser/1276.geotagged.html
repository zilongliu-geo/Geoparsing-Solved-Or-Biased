<p><span class="loc">Avondale</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Auckland</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, located in the <span class="loc">Whau ward</span>, one of the thirteen administrative divisions for the Auckland Council. It is commonly considered to be part of <span class="loc">West Auckland</span>. It was originally called "<span class="loc">Te Whau</span>", which is the common name, of MƒÅori origin, for Entelea arborescens, a native tree. Its postcode is 1026. The first European settler in the area was John Sheddon Adam in 1843, but settlement did not occur in larger numbers until the late 1850s, with the completion of Great North Road. Expansion was rapid, with churches, stores and a public hall built by 1867. With a railway connection to the settlement in 1880, the rate of settlement increased further. <span class="loc">Te Whau</span> became <span class="loc">Avondale District</span> on 5 June 1882, although the old name survives in the <span class="loc">Whau River</span>, an estuarial arm of the <span class="loc">Waitemata Harbour</span>, which runs along the western edge of the suburb. A prominent community leader and Member of Parliament was John Bollard, who lived in <span class="loc">Avondale</span> from 1861 to 1915. Early industries included brickyards, tanneries, mills and pottery works. <span class="loc">Avondale</span> also had numerous market gardens, especially on the <span class="loc">Rosebank</span> Peninsula. It was here that the "Hayward" cultivar of the Chinese gooseberry, later known as the kiwifruit, was developed by Hayward Wright.</p>
