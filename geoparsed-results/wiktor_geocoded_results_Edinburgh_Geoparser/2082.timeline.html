  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Puerto Escondido</span> is a large natural harbor in the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Baja California Sur</span>. It is located in the <span class="loc">Loreto</span> Municipality 28 km south of <span class="loc">Loreto</span>, on Federal Highway 1 on the western shore of the <span class="loc">Gulf of California</span>. French architect and urban planner Fran√ßois Spoerry designed a neighborhood of <span class="loc">Puerto Escondido</span>. but it was abandoned after only 3 (<span class="date">now</span> abandoned) buildings were constructed. . The nearest community to <span class="loc">Puerto Escondido</span> is <span class="loc">Tripui</span>, a privately owned leasehold community, largely of ex-pat Americans and Canadians with a store, hotel and restaurant. It is about 1 kilometer from <span class="loc">Puerto Escondido</span>. The main harbor is about 1.8 km long and 1 km wide with a 30 meter wide entrance and 3 meter depth. It has been a popular anchorage with visiting sailors and is widely recognized as one of the best 'hurricane holes' in the <span class="loc">Sea of Cortez</span>. Adjacent to the main harbor is an abandoned marina project, "the Ellipse" and seaward of the Ellipse is a large, somewhat protected anchorage known as the "Waiting Room" to sailors and "Enfermario" to local Mexicans. The port is administered by API-BCS who charge for anchoring in the port. The inner harbor is leased to Fonatur who installed a small marina and moorings for rent. There is a small boatyard, grocery store and restaurant in the marina. A privately owned marina (Marina <span class="loc">Puerto Escondido</span>) was opened in the <span class="date">fall of 2013</span> as a prelude to private development of properties lining the canals and a proposed additional marina in the Ellipse.</p><br><br>
