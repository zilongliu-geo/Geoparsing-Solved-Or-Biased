The population was 3,411 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> statistical area. <span class="per">Richmond</span> is the departure point for state boat service to <span class="loc">Swan Island</span>, site of the <span class="org">Steve Powell Refuge and Wildlife Management Area</span>. The tract of land which comprises <span class="loc">Richmond</span> and <span class="loc">Gardiner</span> was purchased in <span class="date">1649</span> from the Abenaki Indians by <span class="per">Christopher Lawson</span>. In <span class="date">1719</span>, Fort <span class="loc">Richmond</span> (<span class="loc">Maine</span>) was built by <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> on the western bank of the <span class="loc">Kennebec River</span> at what is <span class="date">today</span> <span class="per">Richmond</span> village. Named for <span class="per">Ludovic Stewart</span>, 1st <span class="per">Duke of Richmond</span>, the fort included a blockhouse, trading post, chapel, officers' and soldiers' <span class="date">quarters</span>, all surrounded by a palisade.

Houses were burned and cattle slain, but the fort held. <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> and other settlements near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Kennebec</span> were destroyed. The defense was enlarged in <span class="date">1723</span> during <span class="org">Dummer's War</span>. On <span class="date">August 19, 1724</span>, a militia of 208 soldiers departed <span class="per">Fort Richmond</span> under command of captains <span class="per">Jeremiah Moulton</span> and <span class="per">Johnson Harmon</span>, traveled up the <span class="loc">Kennebec</span> in 17 whaleboats and sacked <span class="loc">Norridgewock</span>. <span class="per">Fort Richmond</span> would be rebuilt in <span class="date">1740</span>, attacked by another tribe in <span class="date">1750</span>, then dismantled in <span class="date">1755</span> when forts <span class="loc">Shirley</span> (also called <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>), <span class="per">Western</span> and <span class="per">Halifax</span> were built upriver.</p><br><br>
