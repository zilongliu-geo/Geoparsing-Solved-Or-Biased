  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Montgomery</span> is a city in <span class="per">Le</span> <span class="loc">Sueur County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, 45 miles south of <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span>. It was named after <span class="per">Richard Montgomery</span>, an Irish-American soldier who served as a major general in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. The population was 2,956 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Montgomery</span> as platted in <span class="date">1877</span> when the railroad was extended to that point. <span class="per">Montgomery</span> is a part of the Tri-City United School District, ISD #2905. The district includes a grades 9-12 high school in <span class="per">Montgomery</span>; K-8 campuses in <span class="per">Montgomery</span> and <span class="per">Le</span> Center; and a K-4 elementary school in <span class="loc">Lonsdale</span>. The district's sports teams, the Titans, are members of the <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> River Conference, and participate in baseball, softball, basketball, cross-country, hockey, tennis, track, American football, cheerleading, wrestling, golf and volleyball. The academic performance of students exiting Tri-City United High School has been subject to concern from the community. With a slim majority of students (52%) graduating without achieving proficiency in Mathematics, and a substantial number of students graduating without achieving proficiency in Reading (35%). Graduates from the Tri-City United School District rarely go on to attend elite higher education institutions. The Tri-City United School District hosts a significant minority of Hispanic students (13%), and spends a significant amount of funding of ESL (English as a Second Language) programs.</p><br><br>
