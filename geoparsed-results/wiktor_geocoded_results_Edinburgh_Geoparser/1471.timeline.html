  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Burlington County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and a suburb of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city's population was 9,920, reflecting an increase of 184 (+1.9%) from the 9,736 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn declined by 99 (-1.0%) from the 9,835 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> was first incorporated on <span class="date">October 24, 1693</span>, and was reincorporated by Royal charter on <span class="date">May 7, 1733</span>. After American independence, the city was incorporated by the State of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> on <span class="date">December 21, 1784</span>. On <span class="date">March 14, 1851</span>, the city was reincorporated and enlarged with portions of the surrounding township. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> was originally the county seat of <span class="loc">Burlington County</span> but in <span class="date">1796</span>, as the population had been increasing to the east away from the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River, the county seat was moved to Mount Holly Township, a more central location. The council of <span class="loc">West Jersey</span> Proprietors purchased roughly 30 miles (48 km) of riverfront land in <span class="date">1676</span> from the Lenape Native Americans. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> was founded on part of that land by English settlers (primarily Quakers) in <span class="date">1677</span>, and served as the capital of the province until <span class="date">1702</span>, when <span class="loc">West Jersey</span> and East Jersey were combined into a singe <span class="org">Crown</span> Colony.</p><br><br>
