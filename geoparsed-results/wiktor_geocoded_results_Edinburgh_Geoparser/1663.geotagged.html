<p><span class="loc">Baling</span> is a major town in the northern state of <span class="loc">Kedah</span> in <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. It is also the name of a district in which Baling town is situated. It is south of <span class="loc">Betong</span>, the southernmost town in <span class="loc">Thailand</span>. The name <span class="loc">Baling</span> can be traced to a series of events detailed in the story of Raja Bersiong (The Fanged King), a popular legend of <span class="loc">Kedah</span>, recorded in the Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa. Raja Bersiong was a ruthless vampire-like king with a taste for human blood who preyed on his subjects. His subjects finally rose against him and burned down the palace. When the fanged king fled his palace at the Old <span class="loc">Kedah</span> capital in Lembah Bujang, he fled to a place named <span class="loc">Merbau</span> and began removing his fangs by twisting them by hand. As a result of the twisting act, <span class="loc">Merbau</span> was renamed as <span class="loc">Merbau Pulas</span> where pulas in <span class="loc">Malay</span> means twisting. After the king had successfully removed both his fangs, he threw them away to a faraway place. The place where he stood when he threw his fangs is known as <span class="loc">Baling</span> which means throw and the place believed to be the site where the fangs landed was named Siong, which means fang in <span class="loc">Malay</span>, one of the villages in <span class="loc">Baling district</span>.</p>
