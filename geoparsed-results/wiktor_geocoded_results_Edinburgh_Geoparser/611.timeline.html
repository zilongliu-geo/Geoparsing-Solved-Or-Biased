  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mori</span> (森町, <span class="loc">Mori-machi</span>) is a town located in <span class="loc">Kayabe District</span>, <span class="loc">Oshima</span> Subprefecture, <span class="loc">Hokkaido</span>, <span class="loc">Japan</span>. The total area of the town is 368.27 square kilometres (142.19 sq mi). As of <span class="date">April 2012</span>, the town had a population of 17,635 and a population density of 48 persons per km². Mount Komagatake, an active volcano, is located to the east of <span class="loc">Mori</span>, and much of the town is part of Ōnuma Quasi-National Park. <span class="loc">Mori</span> is the home of ikameshi, a squid and rice dish invented in the mid-20th century. The name of the town originates from the word "Oniushi", meaning "a forested area" in the Ainu language. In the Japanese language the name of the town is written as 森, meaning forest. The suffix "町", denoting town status in <span class="loc">Japan</span>, is pronounced as -chō in every municipality of <span class="loc">Hokkaido</span> with the exception of <span class="loc">Mori</span>, where it is read as -machi. <span class="loc">Mori</span> sits on the eastern coast of the <span class="loc">Oshima</span> Peninsula and overlooks <span class="loc">Uchiura</span> Bay (30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter). The bay, also known as <span class="loc">Funka</span> Bay, is rich in squid and is the site of scallop aquaculture, both a mainstay of the town economy.</p><br><br>
