<p><span class="loc">Margate</span> is a residential suburb of the <span class="loc">Moreton Bay</span> Region in the east of the <span class="loc">Redcliffe</span> peninsula, approximately 26 kilometres (16 mi) north-northeast of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, the state capital of <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Margate</span> Beach, a 2 km redeveloped stretch spanning the length of the suburb, features a timber boardwalk, viewing shelters and seating, and barbecue facilities, with views to <span class="loc">Moreton Island</span> over sandy beaches and <span class="loc">Moreton Bay</span>. The redeveloped boardwalk was completed in 2002 in a bid to beautify the area. The boardwalk covers the original cement steps to <span class="loc">Margate</span> Beach which are still visible and in use further down the waterfront at <span class="loc">Suttons Beach</span>, <span class="loc">Redcliffe</span>. The <span class="loc">Margate</span> CBD underwent a $6M major redevelopment aimed at modernising the shopping precinct, making the area more attractive and comfortable, and a distinctive centre with a strong identity. It was completed in November 2007. <span class="loc">Margate</span>'s urban centre, known as <span class="loc">Margate</span> Village is home to a string of retail and commercial businesses including a local shopping centre which is anchored by a Woolworths &amp; Terry White Chemists. <span class="loc">Margate</span> Village provides the higher order retail and commercial role of a centre serving mainly <span class="loc">Redcliffe City</span> residents, in comparison to other urban villages in <span class="loc">Redcliffe City</span>. Currently, <span class="loc">Margate</span> has a building height restriction of six storeys in zoned areas along Duffield Road towards <span class="loc">Margate</span> Beach.</p>
