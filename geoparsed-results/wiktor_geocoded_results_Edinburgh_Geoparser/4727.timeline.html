  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Newmarket is a town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,936 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Some residents are students and employees at the nearby University of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> in <span class="loc">Durham</span>. The primary settlement in town, where 5,297 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is defined as the Newmarket census-designated place, or CDP, and is located at the junction of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> routes 108 and 152, adjacent to the <span class="loc">Lamprey River</span>. Incorporated in <span class="date">1727</span>, Newmarket is one of six towns granted by <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> in <span class="date">the last year</span> of the reign of <span class="per">King George I</span>. It started as a <span class="loc">parish of Exeter</span>, and was granted full town privileges by the legislature in <span class="date">1737</span>. It was probably named for Newmarket in <span class="loc">Suffolk</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The <span class="loc">Lamprey River</span>, running through the town, was named for <span class="per">John Lamprey</span>, an early settler. For a while, the town was called Lampreyville. Newmarket was a center of the <span class="loc">New England</span> shipping trade with the <span class="loc">West Indies</span>, including importation of sugar and African slaves. Beginning with the first cotton textile mill in <span class="date">1823</span>, the Newmarket Manufacturing Company dominated the mill town's waterfront and economy with seven textile mills harnessing water power at the falls. The company had cotton shipped up from the Deep South, so its production was adversely affected by the American Civil War. It built numerous support structures, including multi-family housing for workers. The company built dams upriver to create <span class="loc">Pawtuckaway</span> Pond in <span class="per">Nottingham</span> and <span class="per">Mendums</span> Pond in Barringtonâ€”during drought, the company could release a regulated flow of water from the dams into the <span class="per">Lamprey</span> to run the works. The company closed in <span class="date">1929</span>.</p><br><br>
