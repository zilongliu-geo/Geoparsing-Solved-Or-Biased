<p>Slight sigh of relief. <span class="loc">Ahli</span> can sleep a bit more comfortably after Petrojet beat <span class="loc">Ismaili</span> on Monday 1-0. The win stymied Ismaili's attempt to catch <span class="loc">Ahli</span>, the defending champions, who remain atop the leader board with 42 points after 21 games. Enppi and Petrojet are tied with 39 points and 22 games played. Ismaili drop to fourth on 38 points after 21 games. Observers say <span class="loc">Ahli</span> are lucky to still be in the lead after collecting just three points from their last four matches. <span class="loc">Ismaili</span>, who seeks to win their first league title since 2002, had blown the title race wide open with a 1-0 victory over a depleted Ahli side at Cairo Stadium. That was followed by a 0-0 draw in which 10-man <span class="loc">Ahli</span> failed to find their way through Police Union's tight defence. They also could not avenge their 1-0 defeat to Talaat Youssef's side in the first half of the season. Ahli's mercurial midfielder Mohamed Barakat was sent off in the second half for picking up two yellow cards, one for simulation in the penalty area and another for a clumsy tackle on a Police defender. Palestinian keeper Ramzi Saleh made his third successive start, replacing the error-prone Amir Abdul-Hamid and did admirably in keeping his net clean. Ahli coach Manuel Jose made two substitutions during the second half in a bid to improve his side's attack. Strikers Hani El-Egeizi and Ahmed <span class="loc">Belal</span> were introduced to play alongside Flavio but the pair, who do not play regularly, were obviously not fit. Jose's plans suffered another blow after Barakat received his marching orders six minutes past the hour mark for lunging at an opponent. The Portuguese tactician was forced to substitute Angolan hitman Flavio with right-back Ahmed Sedik. <span class="loc">Ahli</span> kept pushing forward despite their numerical disadvantage but failed to carve out any clear-cut chances. Police held firm to secure a share of the spoils with the defending champions. Police Union moved to ninth place on 27 points, seven clear of the relegation zone. <span class="loc">Ahli</span> assistant coach Hossam El-Badri refused to blame referee Gehad Greisha for his side's goalless draw. "I can't say that the referee cost us a win. He did not make any profound mistakes," El-Badri stated. "Our players played well but were unlucky in the first half and matters went from bad to worse when Barakat was sent off. "The competition will be fierce in the upcoming games, but I don't want Ahli supporters to be worried because we are determined to keep our title." Indeed, Ismaili's loss to Petrojet did go quite a ways to <span class="loc">Ahli</span> capturing their fifth straight league crown. Police assistant coach Mohamed Ibrahim lauded his team's defence that put Ahli strikers at bay throughout the match. "We were aware that <span class="loc">Ahli</span> will keep pushing forward during the whole game," Ibrahim said. "Credit our defenders for successfully marking <span class="loc">Ahli</span>. We succeeded in achieving our target of avoiding a defeat." Elsewhere, no sooner had <span class="loc">Zamalek</span> ended a six-game run without a win by beating Enppi 1-0 than they failed to build on their win by losing 2-1 to Haras Al-Hedoud and equal their worst record of nine Egyptian Premier League defeats in one season. Egyptian Cup winners Haras Al-Hedoud, who will play in next season's CAF Confederation Cup, moved into fourth place on 36 points as they continued their impressive form under manager Tarek El-Ashri. Al-Hedoud managed to break the deadlock after just five minutes. Ahmed Abdel-Ghani curled a superb free- kick over the wall and into the corner of the net past the hapless Abdel-Wahed Al-Sayed. Zamalek defender Amr El-Safti thought he had equalised shortly afterwards after Al-Hedoud keeper Mathurin Kameni spilled a tame cross into his path, but his goal was ruled offside. <span class="loc">Zamalek</span> still had better possession but rarely threatened Kameni as the efficient Al-Hedoud doubled their advantage on 27 minutes. Talented midfielder Abdel-Salam Nagah whipped in a pinpoint cross from the right and Abdel-Hamid Bassiouni rose above the static Amr Adel to head home. Sherif Ashraf, who came on as a second-half substitute, pulled one back with 13 minutes remaining but the hosts held onto their lead to claim all three points. Despite their defeat, <span class="loc">Zamalek</span> assistant coach Sami El-Sheshini was pleased with his side's performance. "We are gradually improving. We played a very good game tonight, especially in the second half," El-Sheshini told reporters after the match. "I just want Zamalek fans to be patient. The players produced promising displays and I'm sure the results will be better in the upcoming matches," El-Sheshini added. After the loss to Al-Hedoud, <span class="loc">Zamalek</span> lie ninth in the league table on 27 points, seven above the relegation zone. In other matches, Enppi remained in the title race with a 1-0 victory over Egypt Telecom, failing to end a 12-match winless streak in manager Hossam Hassan's debut. Al-Gaish produced an impressive display to beat <span class="loc">Ittihad</span> 4-1 on Saturday. The big win lifts Al-Gaish to eighth in the table with 29 points. <span class="loc">Ittihad</span> remain sixth, one point ahead of Farouk Gaafar's men. Ernest Papa Arku broke the deadlock for Gaish on 33 minutes, before a brace from Salah Amin (63, 81) and a 90th minute strike by Yassine Abdul-Aal sealed the win. Mohamed Ragab scored Ittihad's consolation in the 83rd minute. In <span class="loc">Port Said</span>, <span class="loc">Tersana</span> showed determination to remain in the first division by beating <span class="loc">Misri</span> 2-0. <span class="loc">Ismaili</span> were handed a 2-1 defeat at the hands of <span class="loc">Esperance</span> in the <span class="loc">Arab Champions</span> League (ACL) quarter-final first leg played in <span class="loc">Tunisia</span> last week. Mickael Eneramo broke the deadlock on 27 minutes before Oussama Darragi doubled <span class="loc">Esperance</span>'s lead in the second half while Mohab Said scored a vital away goal for <span class="loc">Ismaili</span> 12 minutes from time. The home side opened the scoreline when Abdel-Hamid <span class="loc">Sami</span> brought down Michael Eneramo in the box. The Nigerian successfully sent Mohamed Sobhi the wrong way. As the Egyptian club tried to push for an equaliser, they were exposed at the back and <span class="loc">Esperance</span> looked closer to adding a second. Early in the second half, Eneramo was once again allowed to go one on one with Sobhi but the 28-year-old net minder did well to keep the shot out. In the 73rd minute, Darragi added his team's second by capitalising on some poor defending from <span class="loc">Ismaili</span> to slot home past the helpless Sobhi. <span class="loc">Ismaili</span> were brought back to life when Abdullah Saied's cross found Said unguarded on the far post, the midfielder easily heading past Kasraoui. The two teams will clash again in the tie's second leg in a week's time in <span class="loc">Ismailia</span>.</p>
