<p>Liverpool is a suburb and major centre in the metropolitan area of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located in Greater Western <span class="loc">Sydney</span> 32 kilometres (20 mi) south-west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district. Liverpool is the administrative seat of the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Liverpool</span>. Liverpool is one of the oldest urban settlements in <span class="loc">Australia</span>, founded on 7 November 1810  as an agricultural centre by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. He named it after Robert Banks Jenkinson, Earl of Liverpool, who was then the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the British <span class="loc">city of Liverpool</span>, upon which some of the area's architecture is based. Liverpool is at the head of navigation of the <span class="loc">Georges River</span> and combined with the Great Southern Railway from <span class="loc">Sydney</span> to <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> reaching Liverpool in the late 1850s, Liverpool became a major agricultural and transportation centre as the land in the district was very productive. Until the 1950s, Liverpool was still a satellite town with an agricultural economy based on poultry farming and market gardening. However the tidal surge of urban sprawl which engulfed the rich flatlands west of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> known as the <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> Plain soon reached Liverpool, and it became an outer suburb of metropolitan <span class="loc">Sydney</span> with a strong working-class presence and manufacturing facilities. The Liverpool area also became renowned for its vast Housing Commission estates housing thousands of low-income families after the slum clearance and urban renewal programs in inner-city <span class="loc">Sydney</span> in the 1960s.</p>
