<p><span class="loc">Waha</span> is a Belgian village located in the <span class="loc">Province of Luxembourg</span> in <span class="loc">Wallonia</span>. In 1977 the village merged with Aye, Hargimon, <span class="loc">Humain</span>, Marche-en-Famenne, <span class="loc">Marloie</span>, On, Champlon and Roy to form the municipality of Marche-en-Famenne. The name "Waha" comes from the Celtic proper name "Wachart". The Latin name of the location was "Wachardi mansus", meaning "Wachart's dwelling". <span class="loc">Waha</span> in the 10th century belonged to the territory of count Immon. The first church was built only 100 meters from the present church and was dedicated to <span class="loc">Saint Martin</span> of Tours. In 1050 the present church of Saint Étienne was dedicated by the Liège bishop Theodwin (French: Théoduin). The collegiate chapter of Saint Étienne was dissolved during the time of the French First Republic. The church of Saint Étienne in <span class="loc">Waha</span> is one of the oldest Romanesque churches in <span class="loc">Belgium</span>. The nave of the church is only four arches long. The choir has a rectangular shape and is unvaulted. It is also lower than the nave ceiling, which is not uncommon in early Mosan architecture. The westwork tower is slightly younger than the rest of the church.</p>
