<p>The African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA), consisting of leaders of 26 African countries, are beginning a drive to eradicate malaria from the continent by distributing medication, insecticides, and bed nets. US$100 million worth of funds will be given out to battle the disease in endemic nations; the budget was announced yesterday at the World Economic Forum in <span class="loc">Dar es Salaam</span>, <span class="loc">Tanzania</span>. Ray Chambers, a special envoy for malaria with the United Nations, commented on the push, saying: "We believe that if we cover everybody in <span class="loc">Africa</span> with bed nets, insecticides and medication by the end of this year, we will have zero deaths or near zero deaths from malaria in <span class="loc">Africa</span> by 2015." A statement from Chambers said the funds will be provided by the <span class="loc">US</span> President's Malaria Initiative. The statement continued: "The new <span class="loc">US</span> funding comes as <span class="loc">ALMA</span> finalises a bulk purchase of long lasting insecticidal nets. This bulk purchase of 50 million long lasting insecticidal nets by twelve African nations will reduce costs and streamline procurement and distribution, accelerating the rate at which nets will begin reaching risk populations [...] African leaders, working together with friends of <span class="loc">ALMA</span>, are forging the African-led response needed to solve one of <span class="loc">Africa</span>â€™s most severe health challenges." Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, in comments to the World Economic Forum, said that the same strategy had lowered the incidence of malaria in <span class="loc">Zanzibar</span> from 40% to 1%. According to health experts, use of nets can lower the spread of malaria by 50%, and cut child deaths by a fifth. Malaria, a disease spread to humans through infected mosquitoes, costs <span class="loc">Africa</span> more than $40 billion annually in sick days and treatment, according to the Reuters news service.</p>
