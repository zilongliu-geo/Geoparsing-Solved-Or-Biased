  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Clarke County</span> is a county of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 25,833. The county seat is <span class="loc">Grove Hill</span>. The county was created by the legislature of the Mississippi Territory in <span class="date">1812</span>. It is named in honor of General <span class="per">John Clarke</span> of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, who was later elected governor of that state. The county museum is housed in the Alston-Cobb House in <span class="loc">Grove Hill</span>. For <span class="date">thousands of years</span>, this area was occupied along the rivers by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. At the time of European encounter, <span class="loc">Clarke County</span> was the traditional home of the <span class="loc">Choctaw</span> and the Creek people. They traded with the French, who had settlements in Mobile and <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. They also were reached by some English and Scots traders from the British colonies along the Atlantic Coast. After the Louisiana Purchase, they started to establish relations with the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In <span class="date">1805</span>, by the Treaty of <span class="loc">Mount Dexter</span>, the <span class="loc">Choctaw</span> conveyed large amounts of land in what is <span class="date">now</span> southeastern <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> and southwestern <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, including much of the western portion of <span class="loc">Clarke County</span>, to the <span class="loc">United States</span> for settlement by European Americans.</p><br><br>
