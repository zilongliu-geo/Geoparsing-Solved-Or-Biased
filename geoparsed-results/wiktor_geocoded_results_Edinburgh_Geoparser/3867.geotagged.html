<p><span class="loc">Greenville</span>, <span class="loc">NC</span> has no relation to <span class="loc">Greene County</span>, <span class="loc">NC</span>. For the neighboring county that <span class="loc">Greenville</span> is in, see <span class="loc">Pitt County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. <span class="loc">Greene County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 21,362. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Snow Hill</span>. <span class="loc">Greene County</span>, being a part of land grant by King Charles II of <span class="loc">England</span> in 1663, was first settled around 1710 by immigrants from <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, and parts of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. The original inhabitants of the area, the <span class="loc">Tuscarora</span> Indians, fought with these immigrants and on March 20â€“23, 1713, a fighting force of South Carolinians and Yemassce Indians, under Colonel Murice Moore, defeated the <span class="loc">Tuscarora</span>, under the leadership of Chief Hancock. This was the final major battle of the Tuscarora War at Fort Neoheroka near current day <span class="loc">Snow Hill</span>. In 1758, the area now recognized as <span class="loc">Greene</span> and <span class="loc">Lenoir Counties</span> was separated from <span class="loc">Johnston</span> and named <span class="loc">Dobbs</span> for the Royal Governor. The county was formed in 1791 from the northern part of <span class="loc">Dobbs County</span>. It was originally named <span class="loc">Glasgow County</span>, for James Glasgow, <span class="loc">North Carolina Secretary</span> of State from 1777 to 1798. In 1799, Glasgow's involvement in military land grant frauds forced him to resign and leave the state. <span class="loc">Glasgow County</span> was then renamed <span class="loc">Greene County</span> in honor of Nathanael Greene, one of General Washington's right-hand men.</p>
