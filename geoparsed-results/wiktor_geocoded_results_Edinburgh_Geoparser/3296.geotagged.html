<p><span class="loc">Jinhua</span> , is a prefecture-level city in central <span class="loc">Zhejiang province</span> in eastern <span class="loc">China</span>. It borders the provincial capital of <span class="loc">Hangzhou</span> to the northwest, <span class="loc">Quzhou</span> to the southwest, <span class="loc">Lishui</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Taizhou</span> to the east, and <span class="loc">Shaoxing</span> to the northeast. Its population was 5,361,572 at the 2010 census including 1,077,245 in the built-up area made of two urban districts (not including the satellite <span class="loc">city of Lanxi</span>, which has become essentially a suburban offshoot of <span class="loc">Jinhua</span>'s main urban area). The <span class="loc">cities of Dongyang and Yiwu</span> are under the jurisdiction of the prefecture-level <span class="loc">city of Jinhua</span> in the strict administrative sense, but are often regarded as separate entities; these two cities make up the contiguous <span class="loc">Yiwu-Dongyang metropolitan</span> region, with a built-up area of 2,038,413 inhabitants, which is bigger than that of the urban center of <span class="loc">Jinhua</span> itself. <span class="loc">Jinhua</span> is rich in red soil and forest resources. The <span class="loc">Jinhua</span> or <span class="loc">Wu River</span> flows through the <span class="loc">Lan</span> and <span class="loc">Fuchun</span> to the <span class="loc">Qiantang</span> River beside <span class="loc">Hangzhou</span>, which flows into <span class="loc">Hangzhou Bay</span> and the <span class="loc">East China Sea</span>. In mediaeval <span class="loc">China</span>, it formed part of the water network feeding supplies to the southern end of the <span class="loc">Grand Canal</span>. It is best known for its dry-cured <span class="loc">Jinhua</span> ham.</p>
