  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fullerton</span> is a city located in <span class="loc">northern Orange County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a total population of 135,161. <span class="loc">Fullerton</span> was founded in <span class="date">1887</span>. It secured the land on behalf of the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway. Historically it was a center of agriculture, notably groves of Valencia oranges and other citrus crops; petroleum extraction; transportation; and manufacturing. It is home to several higher educational institutions, notably <span class="loc">California</span> State University, <span class="loc">Fullerton</span> and <span class="loc">Fullerton</span> College. <span class="org">Evidence</span> of prehistoric animal habitation, such as saber-toothed cats and mammoths, is present in <span class="per">Ralph B. Clark</span> Regional Park in the northwest of the city. Europeans first passed through the area in <span class="date">1769</span> when <span class="per">Gaspar de Portolà</span> led a Spanish expedition north to <span class="loc">Monterey</span>. From the description recorded in the diary of Father <span class="per">Juan Crespi</span>, it seems likely that the party camped on <span class="date">July 29</span> near present-day <span class="loc">Laguna Lake</span>, in the <span class="loc">Sunny Hills</span> area. After establishment of <span class="loc">Mission San Gabriel Arcangel</span> in <span class="date">1771</span>, the local Tongva people were dubbed "Gabrieliños" by the Spanish. In <span class="date">1837</span>, the <span class="loc">Fullerton</span> area became part of Rancho San <span class="per">Juan</span> Cajón de <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span>, granted to <span class="per">Juan Pacifico Ontiveros</span>, a Spanish soldier.</p><br><br>
