  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>See also: <span class="per">Franklin</span> Township, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>; <span class="loc">Franklin Lakes</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> <span class="per">Franklin</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Sussex County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 5,045 reflecting a decline of 115 (-2.2%) from the 5,160 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 183 (+3.7%) from the 4,977 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. <span class="per">Franklin</span>, known as the "Fluorescent Mineral Capital of the World," is located over a rich ore body containing more than 150 minerals, many of them fluorescent and 25 of which are found nowhere else on earth. Settled in the 17th century, the village known as <span class="loc">Franklin Furnace</span> after <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>, developed near iron mines and iron smelting operations located along the <span class="loc">Wallkill River</span>. In the early 19th century, zinc deposits in the area began to be developed commercially. For most of the century many small companies mined zinc and iron in the <span class="per">Franklin</span> area. In <span class="date">1897</span> all zinc mining efforts merged into the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Zinc Company, which was a major controlling factor in the development of <span class="per">Franklin</span>. Immigrants from <span class="loc">Russia</span>, <span class="loc">Britain</span>, <span class="loc">Hungary</span> and <span class="loc">Poland</span> joined the work force at the mine. The population, 500 in <span class="date">1897</span>, had swelled to 3,000 by <span class="date">1913</span>. On <span class="date">March 18, 1913</span>, the <span class="loc">Borough of Franklin</span> was incorporated from portions of Hardyston Township, based on the results of a referendum held on <span class="date">April 23, 1913</span>.</p><br><br>
