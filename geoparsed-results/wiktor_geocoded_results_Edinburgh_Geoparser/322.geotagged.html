<p>Wellington is the name of a north <span class="loc">Nanaimo</span>, <span class="loc">British Columbia</span> neighbourhood, which was once the town of Wellington. The community was named for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Since amalgamation with <span class="loc">Nanaimo</span>, <span class="loc">Wellington District</span> is often referred to as "<span class="loc">North Nanaimo</span>" with the former townsites collectively keeping the neighbourhood name of "Wellington". Wellington is located in a shared portion of the traditional territories of the Sneneymuxw and Nanoose First Nations. Both nations are Coast Salish and use the Halkomelem language. WIth their heavy seaworthy canoes, both groups were highly mobile traders and many would have used Chinook Jargon as a trading language. Early photographs of Europeans standing for photo-ops in the distinctive Salish canoes on <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> show that the first nations and the Europeans coexisted in the Wellington area. Prior to 1869 a small number of settlers had established farms around Diver Lake, <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> and <span class="loc">Brannen</span> Lake. The neighbourhood had a saloon and was connected to <span class="loc">Nanaimo</span> by a trail. With extensive marshes and lakes, the area was frequented by <span class="loc">Nanaimo</span> residents for fishing and hunting. In 1869 Robert Dunsmuir discovered a thin surface seam coal on the roots of a fallen tree while visiting Diver Lake. Dunsmuir was a coal miner with a keen interest in operating his own mine and immediately investigated the coal seam. By 1871 Dunsmuir had discovered the Wellington coal seam which underlaid his initial discovery. Once Dunsmuir determined the Coal was of good quality and significant quantity, he established a company so that he could get a land grant for the area. This first grant covered most of what is today known as the Wellington Land District. Initially the town grew up along the crest of land which is now Jingle Pot Road.</p>
