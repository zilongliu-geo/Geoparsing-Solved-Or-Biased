<p><span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Lunenburg County</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, at the navigable limit of the LaHave River. It is the largest town in the <span class="loc">South Shore</span> region. While a good deal of the <span class="loc">South Shore</span>'s economy is reliant on tourism, <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> is a commercial and industrial centre that attracts far fewer visitors. One of the primary employers is a Michelin tire plant. The first European settlers of the town came from the nearby settlements of <span class="loc">Lunenburg</span>, Riverport and LaHave, constructing the first house in 1812 on the west bank of the river (although the first house in what is now the town was built before 1803). The town was named after the bridge built over the LaHave River. The commissioners for the construction of the first bridge were three brothers-in-law, George Heb, John Weil and John Vienot. The town was incorporated on February 13, 1899, shortly after suffering a fire which devastated the entire downtown area. For much of the 20th century, the town's economy depended on forestry and a large wood mill in the center of town, as well as the Nova Scotia Central Railway and later the <span class="loc">Halifax</span> and Southwestern Railway, for which the town acted as a central hub for the <span class="loc">South Shore</span> region. The Acadia Marine Engine Company was based in <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> and it made fishboat and coaster engines.</p>
