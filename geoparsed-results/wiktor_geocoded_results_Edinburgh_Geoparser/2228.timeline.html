  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Monroe</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Orange County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 39,912 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is named after President <span class="per">James Monroe</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 21.3 square miles (55.1 km²), of which, 20.1 square miles (52.0 km²) of it is land and 1.2 square miles (3.1 km²) of it (5.55%) is water. The town is located in the <span class="loc">Southern Region</span> of the county, bordered on the northwest by the Town of <span class="loc">Chester</span>, on the north by <span class="org">the Town of Blooming Grove</span>, on the east by the Town of <span class="loc">Woodbury</span>, on the south by <span class="org">the Town of Tuxedo</span>, and on the southwest by the Town of <span class="loc">Warwick</span>. NY-17 (future I-86) combined with <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 6 NY-17M passes through <span class="per">Monroe</span> village. The First Settlers to this land were American Indians from the Lenni-Lenape Indian nation. The Lenni-Lenape nation consisted of three tribes, "The Unulactus, the <span class="loc">Turkey</span> tribe, Minsis, the Wolf-Tribe, and the <span class="loc">Unamis</span>, the Turtle tribe" (Welcome to <span class="per">Monroe</span>). As white settlers started to move north the Lenni-Lenape nation was forced to move west, out of <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> and into <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, and later on into central <span class="loc">North America</span>, under the Treaty of Easton. The Treaty of Easton was a colonial agreement signed on <span class="date">October 1758</span>. The British colonial government of the <span class="loc">Province of Pennsylvania</span> and the Native American tribes in the Ohio Country signed this document stating they would be allies in the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span>.</p><br><br>
