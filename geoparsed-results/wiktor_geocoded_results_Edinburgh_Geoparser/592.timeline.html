  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">California</span> (/ˌkælᵻˈfɔːrnjə/ KAL-ə-FORN-yə, /ˌkælᵻˈfɔːrniə/ KAL-ə-FAWR-nee-ə) is the most populous state in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">California</span> contains the nation's most populous county, <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, and its seat, <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. "L.A." is the country's second largest city and is situated in Southern <span class="loc">California</span>. Geographically located in the western part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>, the state is bordered by the other <span class="loc">U.S.</span> states of <span class="loc">Oregon</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Nevada</span> to the east, and <span class="loc">Arizona</span> to the southeast. <span class="loc">California</span> shares an international border with the Mexican state of <span class="loc">Baja California</span> to the south and the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> is on the state's western coastline. The <span class="loc">city of Sacramento</span>, located in Northern <span class="loc">California</span>, has been the state capital since <span class="date">1854</span>. What is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">California</span> was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th <span class="date">centuries</span>. It was then claimed by the Spanish Empire as part of Alta <span class="loc">California</span> in the larger territory of New <span class="loc">Spain</span>. Alta <span class="loc">California</span> became a part of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> in <span class="date">1821</span> following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the <span class="loc">United States</span> in <span class="date">1848</span> after the Mexican–American War. The western portion of Alta <span class="loc">California</span> was organized as the State of <span class="loc">California</span>, which was admitted as the 31st state on <span class="date">September 9, 1850</span>. The <span class="loc">California</span> Gold Rush starting in <span class="date">1848</span> led to dramatic social and demographic change, with large-scale immigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom.</p><br><br>
