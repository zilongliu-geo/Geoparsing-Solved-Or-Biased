<p><span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Yamhill County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located about two miles west of <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> near <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 99W. The area is sometimes known as "St. Joe". <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> was named by Ben Holladay, who chose this location as the terminus of the westside line of his Oregon Central Railroad, in order to encourage competition between Lafayette and McMinnville. He probably named the station after <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, although another source says it was named to honor Holladay's brother Joseph. <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> post office operated from 1872 until 1878. Holladay had planned to extend the railway south of <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> down the <span class="loc">Willamette</span> Valley, but he ran out of money. Turntables were used to return the train to <span class="loc">Portland</span>. <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> was platted with 74 blocks that each contained ten lots, and at one time the town had 150 houses. There was a two-story hotel, and stagecoaches from McMinnville, Dayton, and Lafayette would meet the train, which brought passengers from the East Coast looking to buy acreage in the area from two companies that were formed to sell land there in about 1900. Henry Villard extended the railroad line from <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> south to <span class="loc">Corvallis</span> in 1878, and McMinnville became the more important railroad terminal.</p>
