  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Crawford County</span>, in southeastern <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the most populous city in <span class="loc">Crawford County</span> and in southeastern <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 20,233. On <span class="date">October 23, 1864</span>, a wagon train of refugees had come from <span class="loc">Fort Smith</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, and was escorted by troops from the 6th <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Cavalry under the command of Col. <span class="per">William Campbell</span>. These were local men from <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>, <span class="loc">Crawford</span>, and Bourbon Counties. Their enlistment was over, and they were on their way to Fort Leavenworth to be dismissed from service. They ran into the 1st Indian Brigade led by <span class="per">Maj. Andrew Jackson Piercy</span> near the current Pittsburg Waste Water Treatment Plant. They continued to the north when a small group of wagons broke away in an unsuccessful rush to safety. The Confederate troops caught up with them and burned the wagons. The death toll was three Union soldiers and 13 civilian men who had been with the wagon train. It was likely that one of the Confederates had also been killed. A granite marker memorial for the "Cow Creek Skirmish" was placed near the <span class="org">Crawford County Historical Museum</span> on <span class="date">October 30, 2011</span>.</p><br><br>
