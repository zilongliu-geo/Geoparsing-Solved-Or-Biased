  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>‘Rodent activity’ temporarily closes restaurant. Richmond’s <span class="per">Bo Kong</span> <span class="per">Vegetarian Restaurant</span> was shut down <span class="date">March 10</span> by the <span class="org">Vancouver Coastal Health Authority</span>, marking the city’s sixth restaurant closure of the year and its fifth for rodent infestation. The restaurant, at #80-8100 Ackroyd Rd., was ordered closed after an inspector found 19 violations. Among them were signs of “rodent activity” inside the walk-in cooler, on floors, shelves and on products, food stored with other decaying food, mould found on the cooler walls and holes present in the walls. The <span class="per">Bo Kong</span> <span class="per">Vegetarian Restaurant</span> re-opened <span class="date">a day later</span>, on <span class="date">March 11</span>, after an inspector found the conditions had improved sufficiently. Richmond's other closures for the year were at Yokohama Japanese <span class="per">Restaurant, Jo Jo</span>'s <span class="loc">Cafe</span>, Wing Kee Restaurant, Tomiyama Ent. Ltd. and <span class="per">Ginger</span> and <span class="per">Garlic</span> Malaysian <span class="per">Restaurant</span> and <span class="per">Grill</span>. They have all since reopened.</p><br><br>
