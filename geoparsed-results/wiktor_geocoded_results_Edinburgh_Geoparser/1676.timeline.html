  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Columbia County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">US</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of <span class="date">2013</span>, the population was 135,416. The legal county seat is <span class="loc">Appling</span>, but the location of <span class="loc">Columbia County</span>'s government and courts is <span class="loc">Evans</span>. <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Augusta-Richmond County</span>, <span class="loc">GA-SC Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, and is currently one of the fastest-growing counties in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located along the <span class="loc">Savannah River</span>. <span class="loc">Columbia County</span>, the 12th county formed in <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, was created by an act of the Legislature of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> on <span class="date">December 10, 1790</span> from <span class="loc">Richmond County</span>. This area along the <span class="loc">Savannah River</span> had been inhabited for <span class="date">thousands of years</span> by various cultures of indigenous peoples. The area had been home to the historic Muscogee-speaking Creek; <span class="loc">Yuchi</span>, people speaking a language isolate; and Iroquoian-speaking <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> for <span class="date">years</span> prior to European colonization. The <span class="loc">Yuchi</span> had moved south from <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> because of pressure from the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>, who continued to move into the <span class="loc">Piedmont</span> and soon dominated the Native American tribes. One of the oldest archaeological sites in the nation to contain pottery can be found on <span class="loc">Stallings</span> Island.</p><br><br>
