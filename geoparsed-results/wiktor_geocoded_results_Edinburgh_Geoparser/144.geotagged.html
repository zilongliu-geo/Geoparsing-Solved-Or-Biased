<p><span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> is a residential neighbourhood located near the centre of <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span>, <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is an older suburban subdivision, including mostly low-density, single detached dwellings. As of 2011, the area is home to 3,271 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a middle-income area, with an average family income of $67,170, an average dwelling value of $251,560 and a home ownership rate of 77.7%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $304,939. The <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> neighbourhood was within the city limits at the time of <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span>'s incorporation in 1906. The subdivision west of <span class="loc">Lorne Avenue</span> was marketed by three <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span> real estate men: W.H. Coy, A. <span class="loc">MacDougall</span> and F.E. Guppy. All three eventually had streets named after them; Coy Avenue is still in existence. In 1910 house lots in the area were being advertised for $275. <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> Park, developed in 1911-1912, was designed by U. Morell, a noted landscape architect from <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span>. According to a 1913 map of registered subdivisions, the riverbank portion of the current neighbourhood was originally named the Monroe Addition. The majority of residential construction was done before 1946, with a smaller amount up to 1960. After a few decades of very little construction, infill housing projects jumped starting after 1996.</p>
