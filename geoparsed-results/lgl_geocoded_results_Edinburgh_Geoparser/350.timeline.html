  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The boys of <span class="date">summer</span>. Editor's note: <span class="per">Linda Wuebben</span>, a correspondent for the Daily News, grew up as part of the <span class="per">Bernard Becker</span> family of baseball enthusiasts in <span class="loc">Cedar County</span>. This story reflects her love for baseball and its impact on her family. * * *It's the crack of the bat, the roar of the crowd. Baseball season is just around the corner. Springtime brings warm weather, new flowers and baseball. Only true baseball fans think this way and I can attest to being one of them. At a very young age, I already knew baseball was special and important to my family. Many times baseball was the talk around our dinner table and when the new Minnesota Twins baseball franchise first had its game broadcast on the radio in <span class="date">1960</span>, my dad listened almost religiously. Farm work could wait a few hours. As I grew older, the family baseball tales were imprinted on my brain. My dad played the game and remembered the greats like <span class="per">Babe Ruth</span> - idols for all the players who dreamed of glory while playing town team baseball. Baseball here in <span class="loc">Cedar County</span> goes back <span class="date">more than 100 years</span> and still has dedicated players and fans. It was a regular source of entertainment, and a source of bragging rights for <span class="date">years</span> to come. <span class="date">A few years ago</span>, I wrote a story about local <span class="loc">Cedar County</span> town baseball, "The Boys of <span class="date">Summer</span>" for the Daily News. Much to my surprise, I was subsequently contacted by <span class="per">Rick Baxter</span>, president of the <span class="org">Nebraska State Baseball Association</span>, who had read the article. From him, I learned about the Nebraska Baseball Hall of Fame and its Web site. <span class="date">A year ago</span>, I decided what a wonderful tribute it would be to my father's family to submit their names for consideration. <span class="date">Last fall</span>, I was notified - they were in. Just on <span class="date">Sunday</span>, we accepted a medal of honor for the <span class="per">Bernard Becker</span> family, and no one was probably prouder than my brother and I.I'm sure my dad and uncles were standing right there beside us. I could feel their baseball spirit gently whispering in our midst. "Let's play ball."</p><br><br>
