  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Benton County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. First established in <span class="date">1965</span> as a <span class="date">summer</span> resort town, the community evolved into a retirement community, and continues to change following incorporation in <span class="date">2006</span>. The city's struggle with incorporation began in <span class="date">1977</span> and periodically returned as the community grew rapidly. Following the change, municipal government replaced the Property Owners Association as primary government; entering a new era for <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span>. The community is located on the <span class="loc">Springfield</span> Plateau of the <span class="loc">Ozark</span> Mountains. Valleys, creeks, and steep rises characterize the city's topography. <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> is located north of <span class="loc">Bentonville</span> and Rogers and is the northernmost city in the <span class="loc">Northwest Arkansas metropolitan</span> statistical area. The city has been experiencing a population and building boom in <span class="date">recent years</span>, as indicated by a 60% growth in population between the <span class="date">2000</span> and 2010 censuses. The rapid growth of the Northwest <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> area, including <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span>, has expedited the need for a fully controlled access highway in the area. <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> is the northern terminus of Interstate 49 (I-49) in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span> Bypass, currently a two-lane freeway that is ultimately planned to route I-49 to the south and west of <span class="loc">Bella Vista</span>, is under construction.</p><br><br>
