<p><span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> is one of <span class="loc">Mexico City</span>'s major business districts, located in the west part of the city in the delegaciones (boroughs) of <span class="loc">Cuajimalpa</span> and Álvaro Obregón. Paseo de la Reforma and Constituyentes are the primary means of access to the district from the central part of the city. <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> consists mainly of highrise buildings surrounding a large shopping mall, which is currently the third largest mall in Latin <span class="loc">America</span> (Centro Comercial <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>). The district also includes a residential area and three college campuses, among other facilities. The current area of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> took its name from the nearby town of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>, the original Pueblo Hospital founded by <span class="loc">Vasco de Quiroga</span> in 1532. During the Spanish colonial era and the first century of independent <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, the then town of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> had an open landscape of sand mining activity, which was divided between the towns of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>, <span class="loc">Santa Lucia</span>, <span class="loc">San Mateo</span> and <span class="loc">San</span> Pedro Tlaltenango <span class="loc">Cuajimalpa</span>. <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> was also connected by the former royal road connecting <span class="loc">Tacubaya</span> to <span class="loc">Toluca</span>, This royal road was located on the present day avenue called <span class="loc">Cuajimalpa</span> Arteaga and Salazar in the <span class="loc">Sierra de las Cruces</span> and continued by the current route of the federal interstate highway connecting <span class="loc">Mexico City</span> to <span class="loc">Toluca</span>.</p>
