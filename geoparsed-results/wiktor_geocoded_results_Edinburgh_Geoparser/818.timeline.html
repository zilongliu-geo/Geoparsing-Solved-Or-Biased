  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, in the <span class="loc">Boston</span> metropolitan area. Situated directly north of the <span class="loc">city of Boston</span>, across the <span class="loc">Charles River</span>, it was named in honor of the <span class="org">University of Cambridge</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, an important center of the Puritan theology embraced by the town's founders. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> is home to two of the world's most prominent universities, <span class="org">Harvard University</span> and the <span class="org">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> has also been home to <span class="org">Radcliffe College</span>, once one of the leading colleges for women in the <span class="loc">United States</span> before it merged with <span class="loc">Harvard</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, the city's population was 105,162. As of <span class="date">July 2014</span>, it was the fifth most populous city in the state, behind <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">Worcester</span>, <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, and <span class="loc">Lowell</span>. <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> was one of the two seats of <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span> prior to the abolition of county government in <span class="date">1997</span>; <span class="loc">Lowell</span> was the other. The site for what would become <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> was chosen in <span class="date">December 1630</span>, because it was located safely upriver from <span class="loc">Boston</span> Harbor, which made it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships. <span class="per">Thomas Dudley</span>, his daughter <span class="per">Anne Bradstreet</span> and her husband <span class="per">Simon</span>, were among the first settlers of the town. The first houses were built in the <span class="date">spring of 1631</span>. The settlement was initially referred to as "the newe towne". Official <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> records show the name capitalized as Newe Towne by <span class="date">1632</span>, and a single word, <span class="loc">Newtowne</span>, by <span class="date">1638</span>. Located at the first convenient <span class="loc">Charles River</span> crossing west of <span class="loc">Boston</span>, Newe Towne was one of a number of towns (including <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">Dorchester</span>, <span class="loc">Watertown</span>, and <span class="loc">Weymouth</span>), founded by the 700 original Puritan colonists of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span> under governor <span class="per">John Winthrop</span>. The original village site is in the heart of <span class="date">today</span>'s Harvard Square. The marketplace where farmers brought in crops from surrounding towns to sell survives <span class="date">today</span> as the small park at the corner of <span class="per">John F. Kennedy</span> (J.F.K.) and <span class="per">Winthrop</span> Streets, then at the edge of a salt marsh, since filled. The town included a much larger area than the present city, with various outlying parts becoming independent towns over the <span class="date">years</span>: Newton (originally <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> Village, then <span class="loc">Newtown</span>) in <span class="date">1688</span>, <span class="loc">Lexington</span> (<span class="loc">Cambridge Farms</span>) in <span class="date">1712</span>, and both <span class="loc">West Cambridge</span> (originally <span class="loc">Menotomy</span>) and <span class="loc">Brighton</span> (<span class="loc">Little Cambridge</span>) in <span class="date">1807</span>. Part of <span class="loc">West Cambridge</span> joined the new town of <span class="loc">Belmont</span> in <span class="date">1859</span>, and the rest of <span class="loc">West Cambridge</span> was renamed <span class="loc">Arlington</span> in <span class="date">1867</span>; <span class="loc">Brighton</span> was annexed by <span class="loc">Boston</span> in <span class="date">1874</span>. In the late 19th century, various schemes for annexing <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> itself to the <span class="loc">city of Boston</span> were pursued and rejected.</p><br><br>
