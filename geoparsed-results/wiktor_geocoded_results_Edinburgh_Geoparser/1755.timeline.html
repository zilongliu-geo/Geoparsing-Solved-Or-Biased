  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Nelson (Sinixt: k'iya'lmup, Ktunaxa: ʔaqyamǂup) is a city located in the <span class="loc">Selkirk Mountains</span> on the extreme <span class="loc">West Arm</span> of <span class="loc">Kootenay Lake</span> in the Southern Interior of British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Known as "The <span class="loc">Queen City</span>", and acknowledged for its impressive collection of restored heritage buildings from its glory <span class="date">days</span> in a regional silver rush, Nelson is one of the three cities forming the commercial and population core of the <span class="loc">West Kootenay region</span>, the others being <span class="loc">Castlegar</span> and Trail. The city is the seat of <span class="org">the Regional District of Central</span> <span class="loc">Kootenay</span>. It is represented in the provincial legislature by the riding of Nelson-Creston, and in the Parliament of <span class="loc">Canada</span> by the riding of British <span class="org">Columbia</span> Southern Interior. The <span class="loc">West Kootenay region</span> of British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, where the <span class="loc">city of Nelson</span> is situated, is part of the traditional territories of the Sinixt (or Lakes) and Ktunaxa (Kutenai) peoples. Gold and silver were found in the area in <span class="date">1867</span>. Following the discovery of silver at nearby <span class="loc">Toad Mountain</span> in <span class="date">1886</span>, the town boomed quickly, leading to incorporation in <span class="date">1897</span>. Two railways were built to pass through Nelson. Due to its location near transportation corridors, Nelson grew to supply the local mining activity and soon became a transportation and distribution centre for the region.</p><br><br>
