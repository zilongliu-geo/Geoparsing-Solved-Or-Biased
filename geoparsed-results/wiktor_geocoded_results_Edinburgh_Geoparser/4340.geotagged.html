<p><span class="loc">Nanchong</span> (Chinese: 南充; pinyin: Nánchōng; Wade–Giles: Nan-ch'ung; Sichuanese: lan2cong1; ) is a prefecture-level city in the northeast of <span class="loc">Sichuan province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>, with an area of 12,479.96 square kilometres (4,818.54 sq mi), and at the 2010 census was home to 6,278,614 people whom 1,858,875 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of 3 urban districts. It is the second most populated <span class="loc">city of Sichuan</span> Province, only after <span class="loc">Chengdu</span>. The administrative center is <span class="loc">Shunqing District</span>. <span class="loc">Nanchong</span> was in the territory of the state of Ba before it was conquered by the Qin dynasty in 314 BC. The Qin set up a government at <span class="loc">Langzhong City</span>. <span class="loc">Anhan City</span> was established in <span class="loc">Shunqinq district</span> at the beginning of the Han Dynasty. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu of <span class="loc">Han</span> instituted the Anhan (simplified Chinese: 安汉; traditional Chinese: 安漢) County in this place. Anhan literally means "to establish or stabilize <span class="loc">Han</span>". In 8 AD, the name was changed to <span class="loc">Anxin</span> (安新) when Wang Mang seized the throne of the Han Dynasty, but it reverted to Anhan in 25 AD. It was again changed to Guozhou (果州, "fruit city") in 621 AD (Tang dynasty), and then to <span class="loc">Nanchong</span> in 742 AD. The nickname of <span class="loc">Nanchong</span> is <span class="loc">Guocheng</span> (果城), derived from Guozhou.</p>
