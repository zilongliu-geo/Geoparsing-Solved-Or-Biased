<p><span class="loc">Hillsboro</span> is the fifth-largest city in the State of <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and is the county seat of <span class="loc">Washington County</span>. Lying in the <span class="loc">Tualatin</span> Valley on the west side of the <span class="loc">Portland</span> metropolitan area, the city hosts many high-technology companies, such as Intel, that comprise what has become known as the Silicon Forest. At the 2010 Census, the city's population was 91,611. For thousands of years before the arrival of European-American settlers, the Atfalati tribe of the Kalapuya lived in the <span class="loc">Tualatin</span> Valley near the later site of <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span>. The climate, moderated by the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>, helped make the region suitable for fishing, hunting, food gathering, and agriculture. Settlers founded a community here in 1842, later named after David Hill, an Oregon politician. Transportation by riverboat on the <span class="loc">Tualatin River</span> was part of Hillsboro's settler economy. A railroad reached the area in the early 1870s and an interurban electric railway about four decades later. These railways, as well as highways, aided the slow growth of the city to about 2,000 people by 1910 and about 5,000 by 1950, before the arrival of high-tech companies in the 1980s.</p>
