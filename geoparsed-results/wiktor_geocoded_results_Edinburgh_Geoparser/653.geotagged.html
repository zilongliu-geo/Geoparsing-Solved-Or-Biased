<p>Arlington is a city in <span class="loc">northern Snohomish County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, bordered by the <span class="loc">city of Marysville</span> to the south. The population was 17,926 at the 2010 census. Arlington was platted by European Americans in 1900, and was named after Lord Henry Arlington, a member of Charles II of <span class="loc">England</span>'s cabinet. <span class="loc">Haller City</span> was a nearby town founded April 24, 1890, by Theodore Haller and his parents <span class="loc">Henrietta</span> and Granville O. Haller.  When Arlington was incorporated as a city in May 5, 1903, it included <span class="loc">Haller City</span>. The city is home to the <span class="loc">Stillaguamish</span> Valley <span class="loc">Pioneer Museum</span>. Prior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by Indigenous Americans, whose descendants identify as the Stillaquamish Tribe. According to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification system, Arlington has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb). From its founding, Arlington was dependent on timber harvesting and timber products. It was once dubbed the "Shingle Capital of the World" owing to the shingle mills, sawmills, and logging camps in the vicinity. Historically, Arlington was a railroad town with several different rail connections. It was located on the Northern Pacific(NP) mainline that stretched from the Canadian border through Sedro-Woolley to <span class="loc">Snohomish</span>. Arlington also had a branch line running east to <span class="loc">Darrington</span> that primarily carried timber products. Both of these lines were abandoned by NP's successor Burlington Northern in the 1980s due to declining industry. While it is not as rail dependent as it once was, Arlington still maintains a rail connection with BNSF Railways via a spur line. Remnants of Arlington's railroad history can still be seen with the various trestles and signal equipment still in place. <span class="loc">Snohomish County</span> is in the process of converting the abandoned rail right of way into bike/hike trails.</p>
