  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Paris PD: Gang initiation text is a rumor. A rumor spread across Northeast Texas through text messaging &#x97; warning people to stay away from Walmart because a gang initiation is supposedly going to take place involving the killing of three women in a Walmart parking lot &#x97; has no credibility, according to <span class="org">Paris Police Department</span> officials. “As far as we can tell, it sounds like a hoax,” said <span class="per">Matt Birch</span>, PPD crime prevention officer. “There’s no reason to stay away from Walmart.” <span class="org">The PPD</span> said in a release that some people in the community, mostly young people from what the police department has been able to establish, received the message and passed it on to others in the community. The text message does not specify a particular Walmart, so each community thinks it is the store in their community, the release stated. “We do not believe the text message is factual,” <span class="per">Birch</span> said. “They are getting hit all over the Metroplex with it. It’s a Northeast Texas thing, not just a Paris thing.” Also, <span class="per">Birch</span> said another reason to doubt the authenticity of the message is the fact that gang initiations are not usually publicized events. “Gangs aren’t going to advertise their initiations,” <span class="per">Birch</span> said. The police department was alerted to the text messages on <span class="date">Wednesday</span>. <span class="per">Birch</span> said law enforcement agencies in the DFW Metroplex area are investigating the source. The PPD then informed the Paris Walmart store and stepped up extra patrols as a precaution. “Although several Paris residents did receive the text message, at this time we have no reason to believe this is a valid threat to the Paris Walmart or to our local community,” the release stated. <span class="per">Birch</span> said city dispatch has been inundated with calls about the message. “We do not believe the text message is factual,” the release stated. “Please discount it if you receive questions regarding it.” Dallas media stations reported the same message as a hoax as early as <span class="date">Wednesday night</span>, and the message has also been reported as a hoax in other states across the country.</p><br><br>
