  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sund</span> is a municipality in <span class="loc">Hordaland county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. The municipality is located in the traditional <span class="loc">district of Midhordland</span>. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Skogsvåg. Other larger villages in <span class="loc">Sund</span> include <span class="loc">Klokkarvik</span>, <span class="loc">Tælavåg</span>, <span class="loc">Kausland</span>, and <span class="loc">Hammarsland</span>. <span class="loc">Sund</span> covers the southern third of the island of <span class="loc">Store Sotra</span>, west of the <span class="loc">city of Bergen</span>. It also includes many smaller, surrounding islands. The history of the municipality dates back to <span class="date">1838</span>, when <span class="loc">Sund</span> was first established as a formannskapsdistrikt, the precursor of the modern municipalities. <span class="loc">Sund</span> is a predominantly rural municipality, with no major settlements, the largest being <span class="loc">Hammarsland</span> with approximately 900 inhabitants (in <span class="date">2013</span>). Due to the proximity to the <span class="loc">city of Bergen</span>, a large proportion of the population commutes to the city to work. The <span class="loc">parish of Sund</span> was established as a formannskapsdistrikt (municipality) on <span class="date">1 January 1838</span>. On <span class="date">1 January 1886</span>, the southern island <span class="loc">district of Sund</span> (population: 2,396) was separated to form the new municipality of <span class="loc">Austevoll</span>. The municipal borders have not changed since that time.</p><br><br>
