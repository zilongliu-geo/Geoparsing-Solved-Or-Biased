<p><span class="loc">Perth</span> is a town in <span class="loc">northern Tasmania</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It lies 20 km south of <span class="loc">Launceston</span>, on the Midland Highway. The town has a population of 2,239 and is averaging a 1% increase per year (2001 census). <span class="loc">Perth</span> is part of the Northern Midlands Council. Federal Lyons MHR Eric Hutchinson also has an office in the town. At the 2006 census, <span class="loc">Perth</span> had a population of 2,239. It is the first major town out of <span class="loc">Launceston</span> on the route to <span class="loc">Hobart</span>, and also serves as a major junction for people bypassing <span class="loc">Launceston</span> on the route from <span class="loc">Hobart</span> to the northwest of the state. Like nearby <span class="loc">Longford</span>, <span class="loc">Perth</span> is a historic town with many buildings dating back to the early 19th century. In 1837, five years after the practice ceased in <span class="loc">England</span>, the body of John McKay was gibbetted near the spot where he murdered Joseph Wilson near <span class="loc">Perth</span>. There was great outcry, but the body was not removed until an acquaintance of Wilson passed the spot and horrified by the spectacle of McKay's rotting corpse, pleaded with the authorities to remove it.</p>
