  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Newton is a town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,603 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The sixth town to be granted from the Masonian land purchase of <span class="date">1746</span>, Newton was originally part of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>; later, part of <span class="loc">Amesbury</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>; then part of the <span class="loc">West Parish</span> of <span class="loc">Amesbury</span>; then part of New Town or <span class="loc">South Hampton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">South Hampton</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>). A number of the residents felt they were too far away from its church for their convenience, and the town was incorporated by Colonial Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span> as <span class="loc">Newtown</span> in <span class="date">1749</span>, simply because it was a new town. In <span class="date">1846</span>, the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> legislature voted to contract the name to Newton. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 10.1 square miles (26.2 km2), of which 9.9 sq mi (25.6 km2) is land and 0.2 sq mi (0.5 km2) is water, comprising 1.59% of the town. The highest point in Newton is the summit of Brandy <span class="loc">Brow Hill</span>, at 289 feet (88 m) above sea level, located directly upon the southern corner of the town.</p><br><br>
