  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">David</span> is an unincorporated community and coal town in <span class="loc">Floyd County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> along County Route 404. Located in the Appalachian Mountains, it lies approximately 100 miles (160 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>. The town was named for <span class="per">David L. Francis</span>, President of <span class="per">Princess Elkhorn Coal Company</span> which originally built and owned the town. It bears the postal ZIP code 41616. The <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census of <span class="date">2000</span> recorded a population of 435. Although it was formerly a company town, it was in many ways a model coal community with many amenities not typical of the region at the time including a swimming pool, central water and sewer, and cable TV service. The company also supported a children's choir which toured nationally. When Princess-Elkhorn sold the community in <span class="date">the late 1960s</span>, many of these amenities fell into disrepair and the housing stock deteriorated from over 100 units to slightly more than 30. The town rallied around a hepatitis outbreak and ended up purchasing the entire town from the investor who owned it. The mechanism for this purchase was the creation of the <span class="org">David Community Development Corporation</span>, which went on to secure funding for a new water and sewer system, a fire station, a new park and several dozen new homes.</p><br><br>
