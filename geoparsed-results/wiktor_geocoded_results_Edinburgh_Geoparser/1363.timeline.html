  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Concord</span> is a suburban industrial neighbourhood in the <span class="loc">City of Vaughan</span> in <span class="loc">York Region</span>, located <span class="loc">north of Toronto</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. According to the <span class="date">2001</span> Census, the neighbourhood has 8,255 residents (including the community of <span class="loc">Carrville</span>). It is accessed by two provincial highways: Highway 407 and Highway 400. <span class="org">Concord</span> is bordered by Steeles Avenue to the south, <span class="loc">Black Creek</span> to the west (roughly Highway 400), the Upper <span class="loc">West Don River</span> to the east (roughly <span class="loc">Dufferin</span> Street) and Rutherford Road to the north. Prior to <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, when Highway 400 was first opened, <span class="org">Concord</span> was an agricultural community, covered mostly by farmlands. Housing developments also began in <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, east of <span class="loc">Keele Street</span>, as well as construction of a CN railway by-pass of <span class="loc">Toronto</span> with a 4 km freight yard. <span class="date">This decade</span> also saw an industrial park added near <span class="per">Jane Street</span>. In <span class="date">the 1970s</span>, the industrialization of the northern part of the <span class="org">Greater Toronto Area</span> began. The area east of <span class="loc">Keele</span> consists of industrialized buildings and a plaza on Highway 7, with industrial buildup continuing into <span class="date">the 1980s</span>. A residential area, <span class="per">Glen Shields</span>, was built in <span class="date">the 1970s and 1980s</span> in the southeast, west of <span class="per">Dufferin</span>. <span class="date">1992</span> also saw the commencement of the construction of Highway 407, which opened in <span class="date">1997</span>, with three <span class="org">Concord</span> interchanges. Another residential section, <span class="loc">Dufferin</span> Hill, was built in the 2000s in the northeast, near <span class="per">Dufferin</span> and <span class="per">Rutherford</span>. In the early 2000s, construction of the <span class="per">Vaughan Mills</span> shopping mall began, being completed in <span class="date">2004</span>.</p><br><br>
