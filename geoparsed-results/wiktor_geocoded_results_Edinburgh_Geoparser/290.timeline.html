  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Sora (pronounced [ˈsoːɾa]; German: Zaier) is a village in the Municipality of <span class="loc">Medvode</span> in the Upper <span class="loc">Carniola region</span> of <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. It includes the hamlets of Farjevec (or Pri Farjevcu) and Komarnija. Sora is a clustered village at the foot of <span class="loc">Hom</span> Hill (718 m) on an alluvial fan above Ločnica Creek, where it exits a narrow valley in the hills to the southwest. The soil is loamy and fields lie below the village, extending toward the Sora River to the north. The surrounding hills are karstified and there is a large cave on <span class="loc">Kravjek</span> Hill. Sora was attested in written sources in <span class="date">1154</span> as Zower (and as Ceur in <span class="date">1161</span> and Zevra in <span class="date">1252</span>). The name is derived from the Sora River and comes from the archaic Slovene common noun sǫ̋vьra from the verb *sъ-vьrěti 'to pour out, boil over', referring to a flashy stream, and presumably turbulent confluences along the course of the river. In <span class="date">the past</span> the German name was Zaier. The remnants of a Roman building and graves have been found between Sora and neighboring <span class="loc">Rakovnik</span>, attesting to early settlement in the area. A regular school was established in Sora in <span class="date">1874</span>, and the school building was remodeled in <span class="date">1907</span>. A catchment basin for water was built below the church in <span class="date">1911</span> at the initiative of the writer <span class="per">Fran Saleški Finžgar</span>. Engagements in the area during the Second World War are commemorated by a stone commemorating a fallen female Partisan along the road to <span class="loc">Topol pri Medvodah</span> and a monument with the names of seven fallen Partisans next to the road along Ločnica Creek. After the Second World War, the local school was named after the communist people's hero Avgust Barle. This name was removed in <span class="date">1992</span>, when the school was renamed the Sora Branch School (Slovene: Podružnična šola Sora).</p><br><br>
