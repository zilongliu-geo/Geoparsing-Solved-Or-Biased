<p>The <span class="loc">city of Lawton</span> (Pawnee: Raaríhtaaruʾ) is the county seat of <span class="loc">Comanche County</span>, in the State of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. Located in southwestern <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, about 87 mi (140 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Oklahoma City</span>, it is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Lawton</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. According to the 2010 census, Lawton's population was 96,867, making it the fifth-largest city in the state. Built on former reservation lands of <span class="loc">Kiowa</span>, <span class="loc">Comanche</span>, and Apache Indians, Lawton was founded on August 6, 1901, and was named after Major General Henry Ware Lawton, a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient killed in action in the Philippine–American War. Lawton's landscape is typical of the <span class="loc">Great Plains</span>, with flat topography and gently rolling hills, while the area north of the city is marked by the <span class="loc">Wichita Mountains</span>. The city's proximity to Fort Sill Military Reservation gave Lawton economic and population stability throughout the 20th century. Although Lawton's economy is still largely dependent on Fort Sill, it has also grown to encompass manufacturing, higher education, health care, and retail. The city's government is run by a council-manager government consisting of a city manager and a city council headed by a mayor. Interstate 44 and three major <span class="loc">United States</span> highways serve the city, while Lawton-Fort Sill Regional Airport connects Lawton by air. Recreation can be found at the city's many parks, lakes, museums, and festivals. Notable residents of the city include many musical and literary artists, as well as several professional athletes.</p>
