  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Arcadia</span> is a town in and the parish seat of <span class="loc">Bienville Parish</span> in <span class="loc">north Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,919 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> has the highest elevation of any town in <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>. Arcadia's name commemorates the Ancient Greek region of <span class="loc">Arcadia</span>. In <span class="date">1934</span>, <span class="loc">Bonnie</span> and <span class="loc">Clyde</span> were sought throughout the Southeast for their robbing banks and associated crimes. They were killed near <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> by law-enforcement officers from <span class="loc">Bienville Parish</span> and <span class="loc">Dallas County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Their bodies were brought for embalming to the former <span class="org">Conger Funeral Home</span> in <span class="loc">Arcadia</span>. As word of the killing of the outlaws spread, large crowds of onlookers were drawn to the funeral home, which was also a furniture store. The owner's wife, <span class="per">Inez Conger</span>, grew so angry at the many gawkers standing on the store's tables and chairs to try to get a look at the bodies, that she began splashing formaldehyde around the store in an attempt to drive the crowds away. The bodies were sent to Dallas for separate funerals and interments. The ambush occurred southwest of <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> on Louisiana State Highway 154 between <span class="loc">Gibsland</span> and <span class="loc">Sailes</span>. <span class="loc">Gibsland</span> has been a destination for tourism associated with <span class="loc">Bonnie</span> and <span class="loc">Clyde</span>. L.J. "<span class="org">Boots</span>" <span class="per">Hinton</span>, son of posse member <span class="per">Ted Hinton</span>, operates the <span class="loc">Bonnie</span> and <span class="loc">Clyde Ambush</span> Museum.</p><br><br>
