<p><span class="loc">Salisbury</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,283 at the 2010 census. The community is a popular summer resort beach town situated on the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>, north of <span class="loc">Boston</span> on the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> border. Parts of town comprise the census-designated place of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>. This was once territory of the Pentucket tribe of Pennacook Indians. It was settled by the English in 1638 as <span class="loc">Colchester</span>, and incorporated in 1640 as <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, after <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> in <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The original roads at the center of the town formed a compact semicircle, which allowed the residents to quickly reach the garrison house in case of attack. Those roads still exist, though the shape today is triangular, being bounded by Elm Street, School Street and Bridge Road. One of the two greatest fears at the time was the Naumkeag tribe of Indians, thus the men of the town took turns standing watch against a surprise attack, especially at night. The Naumkeags, however, had been decimated by plague, and the threat was not what it once might have been. The second threat came from wolves, which were plentiful, and which killed the livestock and dug in the graveyard.</p>
