<p>Kingston /ˈkɪŋstən/ is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Ulster County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is 91 miles (146 km) north of New <span class="loc">York City</span> and 59 miles (95 km) south of <span class="loc">Albany</span>. It became <span class="loc">New York</span>'s first capital in 1777, and was burned by the British on October 13, 1777, after the Battles of <span class="loc">Saratoga</span>. In the 19th century, the city became an important transport hub after the discovery of natural cement in the region, and had both railroad and canal connections. Passenger rail service has since ceased, and many of the older buildings are part of three historic districts, such as the <span class="loc">Stockade District</span> uptown, the Midtown Neighborhood Broadway Corridor, and the Rondout-West Strand Historic District downtown. As early as 1614 the Dutch had set up a factorij (trading post) at <span class="loc">Ponckhockie</span>, at the junction of the <span class="loc">Rondout Creek</span> and the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>. The first recorded permanent settler in what would become the <span class="loc">city of Kingston</span>, was Thomas Chambers, who came from the area of Rensselaerswyck in 1653. The place was called <span class="loc">Esopus</span> after the local Esopus tribe. As more settlers arrived, tensions developed between the Esopua and the Dutch, in part due to the Dutch selling alcohol to the young Esopus men.</p>
