  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Dunkeld</span> (Scots: Dunkell, from Scottish Gaelic: Dùn Chailleann, "fort of the Caledonians") is a small town in <span class="loc">Perth</span> and <span class="loc">Kinross</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is about 15 miles north of <span class="loc">Perth</span> on the eastern side of what is <span class="date">now</span> the A9 road into the <span class="loc">Scottish Highlands</span>, and on the opposite (north) side of the <span class="loc">River Tay</span> from the village of <span class="per">Birnam</span>. <span class="per">Dunkeld</span> and <span class="per">Birnam</span> share a railway station, (<span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> and <span class="loc">Birnam</span> railway station) on the Highland Main Line. Population 1,170 (<span class="date">2004</span>). On the western side of the A9 is The Hermitage, a National Trust for <span class="loc">Scotland</span> site. <span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> Cathedral is on the north bank of the <span class="loc">River Tay</span>. The name Dùn Chailleann means Fort of the Caledonii or of the Caledonians. The 'fort' is presumably that on <span class="loc">King's Seat</span>, slightly north of the town (NO 009 440). Both these place-names imply an early importance for the area of the later town and bishop's seat, stretching back into the Iron Age. <span class="per">Dunkeld</span> (Duncalden and variants in early documents) is said to have been 'founded' or 'built' by Caustantín son of <span class="per">Fergus</span>, king of the Picts (d. 820). This founding likely referred to one of an ecclesiastical nature on a site already of secular importance. Probably originally constructed as a simple group of wattle huts, the monastery - or at least its church - was rebuilt in the 9th century by <span class="per">Kenneth I</span> of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> (reigned 843–858). Caustantín of the Picts brought <span class="loc">Scotland</span>'s share of the relics of <span class="loc">Columba</span> from <span class="loc">Iona</span> to <span class="loc">Dunkeld</span> at the same time others were taken to <span class="loc">Kells</span> in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, to protect them from <span class="loc">Viking</span> raids. <span class="per">Dunkeld</span> became the prime bishopric in eastern <span class="loc">Scotland</span> until supplanted in importance by <span class="loc">St Andrews</span> since the 10th century.</p><br><br>
