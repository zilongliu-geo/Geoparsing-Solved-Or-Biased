  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Bago</span> (formerly spelt <span class="loc">Pegu</span>; Burmese: ပဲခူးမြို့; MLCTS: pai: khu: mrui., IPA: [bəɡó mjo̰]; <span class="loc">Mon</span>: ဗဂေါ, [həkɜ̀]; Thai: พะโค, rtgs: Pha-kho), formerly known as Hanthawaddy (Burmese: ဟံသာဝတီ ; <span class="loc">Mon</span>: ဟံသာဝတဳ Hongsawatoi; Thai: หงสาวดี, rtgs: Hongsawadi; meaning "She Who Has Swans"), is a city and the capital of the <span class="loc">Bago Region</span> in <span class="loc">Burma</span>. It is located 50 miles (80 km) north-east of <span class="loc">Yangon</span>. The Gulf of <span class="loc">Martaban</span> was colonized by <span class="loc">Mon</span> people from the Thaton Kingdom, who established <span class="per">Bago</span>. In 825, the twin brothers <span class="per">Samala</span> and <span class="per">Vimala</span> founded <span class="loc">Pegu</span>. The earliest mention of <span class="per">Bago</span> in history is by the Arab geographer ibn Khordadbeh around <span class="date">850 AD</span>. At the time, the <span class="loc">Mon</span> capital had shifted to <span class="loc">Thaton</span>. The area came under rule of the Burmese from <span class="loc">Bagan</span> in <span class="date">1056</span>. After the collapse of <span class="loc">Bagan</span> to the Mongols in <span class="date">1287</span>, the <span class="loc">Mon</span> regained their independence. In Lower <span class="loc">Burma</span>, a <span class="loc">Mon</span> dynasty established itself first at Mottama and then at <span class="per">Bago</span>. During the reign of <span class="per">King Razadarit</span>, <span class="per">Bago</span> and <span class="per">Ava</span> Kingdom were engaged in <span class="date">the Forty Years</span>' War. The peaceful reign of Queen Shin Sawbu came to an end when she chose the Buddhist monk Dhammazedi (<span class="date">1472</span>–<span class="date">1492</span>) to succeed her. Under Dhammazedi, <span class="per">Bago</span> became a centre of commerce and Theravada Buddhism.</p><br><br>
