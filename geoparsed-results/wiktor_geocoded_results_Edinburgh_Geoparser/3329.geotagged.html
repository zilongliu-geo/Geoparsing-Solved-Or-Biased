The English also called the people the <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, after the river they named after one of their colonial leaders. <span class="loc">Milford</span> was founded in 1796 after the American Revolutionary War as a <span class="loc">United States</span> settlement on the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River by Judge John Biddis, one of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>'s first four circuit judges. He named the settlement after his ancestral home in <span class="loc">Wales</span>. <span class="loc">Milford</span> has a large number of historical significant buildings, many constructed in the nineteenth century and early twentieth centuries. Some are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, while numerous others are included in the <span class="loc">Milford</span> Historic District, also listed on the NRHP. Of the 655 buildings in the district, 400 of them have been deemed to be historically significant.
