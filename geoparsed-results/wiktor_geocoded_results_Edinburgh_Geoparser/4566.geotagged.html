<p>Bluff or The Bluff is a geographical area, containing seven suburbs, in <span class="loc">Durban</span>, eThekwini metropolitan municipality, <span class="loc">KwaZulu-Natal Province</span>, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. Within the area referred to as "The Bluff" lie the suburbs of <span class="loc">Brighton Beach</span>, <span class="loc">Grosvenor</span>, <span class="loc">King's Rest</span>, <span class="loc">Ocean View</span>, <span class="loc">Fynnland</span>, Treasure Beach and <span class="loc">Wentworth</span>. The name of the area is derived from the long bluff - two ancient sand dunes on which most of the suburbs lie. The Bluff is one of the main enclosing elements of <span class="loc">Durban Harbour</span> from the <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span>, and forms the southern quayside of the Port of <span class="loc">Durban</span>. The promonotory on which Bluff is situated is Durban's most prominent natural landmark. Accordingly, it probably served as an important visual reference for navigational approaches to <span class="loc">Durban Harbour</span>. Between 1907 and 1975, the exposed south-east side of The Bluff housed a whaling station. Since the mid-Nineteenth Century, the region has been purposed for navigational and military uses. This use has provided protection for much of the area's native vegetation. Today, the area is considered important in the ecological management of <span class="loc">Durban</span> and environs.</p>
