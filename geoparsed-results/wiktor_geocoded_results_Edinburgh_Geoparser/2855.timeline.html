  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Charleston</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">South Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> located 30 km south of <span class="loc">Westport</span>. It was founded as a goldmining town after a major goldrush in <span class="date">1867</span>, and is <span class="date">now</span> an adventure tourist village noted for its extensive limestone caves and caving experiences. Guided tours of the nearby Metro Cave / <span class="loc">Te Ananui</span> Cave are operated out of <span class="loc">Charleston</span> and travel up the <span class="loc">Nile River</span> valley. Charleston’s origins owe much to gold prospector <span class="per">William Fox</span>. He was born in <span class="loc">Ireland</span> in about <span class="date">1826</span> and as a young man became a sailor, then a gold prospector. He was on the Californian goldfields about <span class="date">1850</span>; then on the Victorian goldfields in <span class="loc">Australia</span>; and on the Tuapeka goldfield in <span class="loc">Otago</span> in <span class="date">1861</span>. In <span class="date">1862</span> <span class="per">Bill Fox</span>'s prospecting activities in the <span class="org">Arrow</span> district excited intense interest. In <span class="date">1864</span>, Fox travelled to the West Coast. He prospected widely for gold and first discovered it at <span class="loc">Fox Creek</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Arahura River</span> behind <span class="loc">Hokitika</span>, in <span class="date">January 1865</span>. According to local historian <span class="per">Les Wright</span>, in <span class="date">July 1866</span> Fox organised a prospecting voyage to what was later named <span class="loc">Fox River</span> but didn't find gold there. He led the party on 20 km north to where <span class="loc">Charleston</span> would later be, but although they found gold in the sand there, it was too fine to save. So Fox went south to Ōkārito to find out how the miners there were extracting it from fine sand.</p><br><br>
