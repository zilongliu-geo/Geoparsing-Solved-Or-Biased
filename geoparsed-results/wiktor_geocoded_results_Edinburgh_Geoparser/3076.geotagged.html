<p><span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The population was 28,205 at the 2010 census. The name "<span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>" may also refer to a wider area including the <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> CDP, <span class="loc">La Presa</span> and part of the neighborhood of <span class="loc">Casa de Oro</span> (which extends into <span class="loc">La Mesa</span>). There are claims that the Greater <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> area has over 100,000 residents [1] although this claims large areas that are actually unincorporated parts of <span class="loc">La Mesa</span> and <span class="loc">El Cajon</span>. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is served by the 91977 and 91978 ZIP codes. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is named for the natural spring located there. It was long the home of the Kumeyaay tribe, who called it Neti or <span class="loc">Meti</span>. Spanish conquerors drove off the natives and used the area for cattle, calling it El aguaje de <span class="loc">San Jorge</span> (St. George's Spring). In 1863 Judge Augustus S. Ensworth of San Diego filed a claim for a 160 acre (647,000 mÂ²) ranch that included the spring. The ranch, and the small adobe house he built there, were sold to Rufus King Porter and later to historian Hubert Howe Bancroft. The adobe is now a National Historic Landmark.</p>
