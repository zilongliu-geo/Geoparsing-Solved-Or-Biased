<p>Burton is a small village in the community of <span class="loc">Rossett</span> in the <span class="loc">county borough of Wrexham</span>, <span class="loc">Wales</span>. The hamlet of <span class="loc">Burton Green</span> is a separate settlement and is located a few miles from Burton. The village is predominantly rural in nature and comprises a mixture of working farms and prestige residential properties. There are no shops in Burton though the village is 2 miles from the village of <span class="loc">Rossett</span>, where there is a variety of shops, a post office, bank, chemist, off-licence, and plenty of pubs and restaurants. There is also a local farm shop in Burton, for fresh meat, poultry, eggs and other locally-grown produce. Firmly Welsh despite the proximity to the border with <span class="loc">England</span>, 7.7% of Burton residents are Welsh speakers. It is an ancient village that, before the coming of the North <span class="loc">Wales</span> Mineral Railway, was more important than <span class="loc">Rossett</span> itself. The village dates back to Saxon times and was settled by Angles from the Kingdom of Mercia. Today the village is little more than a backwater on the old road between <span class="loc">Rossett</span> and <span class="loc">Caergwrle</span>.</p>
