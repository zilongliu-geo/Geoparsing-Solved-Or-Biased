  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Gloria</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Maligaya</span>) is a third-class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Oriental Mindoro</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 42,012 people. The town was previously a barangay called <span class="loc">Maligaya</span>, the largest barangay during the administration of President <span class="per">Diosdado Macapagal</span>. Local politicians, led by former guerrilla chief <span class="per">Nicolas Jamilla</span>, Sr., battled for the conversion of <span class="loc">Maligaya</span> into a new town. They renamed it after the ten-year-old daughter of the President, <span class="per">Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</span>, who later on herself became the fourteenth President in <span class="date">2001</span>. <span class="per">Jamilla</span> became the first mayor of the town, which kept the old name "Maligaya" as the name of a barangay in the poblacion. <span class="per">Gloria</span> is divided into 27 barangays: nine (9) barangays are situated along the national highway; six (6) are coastal barangays; and twelve (12) interior barangays on the west side. <span class="per">Gloria</span> was once part of the municipality of <span class="loc">Pinamalayan</span>. In <span class="date">1915</span>, migrant families from <span class="loc">Marinduque</span> settled in Barrio Tambong, and in <span class="date">1930</span>, when a national road was built through <span class="loc">Pinamalayan</span>, they moved west and occupied the area along this road. <span class="loc">Tambong</span> was later divided into two barrios: the first retained the original name, while the second was called <span class="loc">Maligaya</span> (meaning "happy"), alluding to the settlers' happiness at the bountiful yield of their agricultural crops.</p><br><br>
