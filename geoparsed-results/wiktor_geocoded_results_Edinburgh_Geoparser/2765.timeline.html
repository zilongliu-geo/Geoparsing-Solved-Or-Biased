  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Gore is a town in south-western <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. Located south of <span class="loc">Metu</span> in the Illubabor Zone of the <span class="loc">Oromia Region</span>, this town has a latitude and longitude of 8°9′N 35°31′E and an elevation of 2085 meters. Gore is known for its honey. The map attached to <span class="per">C. W. Gwynn</span>'s account of his <span class="date">1908</span>/09 triangulation survey of southern <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span> shows that Gore had a telegraph station. During <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, experimental tea plantations were started around Gore in <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, and a number of them thrived. The Gummaro plantation near Gore, with 800 hectares, is the largest tea plantation in <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. Gore was founded in the nineteenth century, growing up around Ras Tessema Nadew's palace. The Russian explorer <span class="per">Alexander Bulatovich</span> stopped here <span class="date">21 November 1896</span>, expecting to meet Ras Tessema, who was away campaigning against the Mocha; Ras Tessema had not returned when <span class="per">Bulatovich</span> left on <span class="date">31 December</span>. With the growing prosperity of the port town of <span class="loc">Gambela</span>, and the growth of the <span class="loc">Baro River</span> route to <span class="loc">Sudan</span>, Gore likewise prospered, holding two market <span class="date">days</span> <span class="date">a week</span>. <span class="per">Richard Pankhurst</span> describes the pre-World War I community as having five foreign trading concerns -- "two Greek, one Syrian, one British and one German"—engaged in the export of coffee, wax, and to a lesser extent animal hides, and the import of cotton cloth, salt, and other manufactured goods. Civet cat oil was also a significant export at the time, <span class="per">Pankhurst</span> noting that Ras Tessema exported 42 kilos in <span class="date">1910</span>.</p><br><br>
