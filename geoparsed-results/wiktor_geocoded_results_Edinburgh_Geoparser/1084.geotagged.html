<p>Franklin is a city in <span class="loc">Howard County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located along the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. Part of a rural area, the population was 95 at the 2010 census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. As the eastern terminus of the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail, the community played a major role in the westward expansion of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town of Franklin was founded in 1816 and named for Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. William Becknell, known as the "Father of the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail" lived on a farm a few miles northwest of Franklin. There was a spring near Becknell's property, Boone Lick Spring. The spring and its saline water were sufficient to attract people from St. Louis and points east, who came to distill the water for its salt. They came so often that they created a trail, calling it the Boonslick Road. The <span class="loc">Boone</span> refers to Nathan and Daniel Morgan Boone, sons of <span class="loc">Daniel Boone</span>; the brothers first operated the saltlick business. In 1821, William Becknell put a notice in the "<span class="loc">Missouri</span> Intelligencer" stating he was creating a party to go "westward, for the purpose of trading for horses and mules and catching wild animals of every description." On September 1, 1821, his party crossed the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River at Arrow Rock and set out along what would become known in a few years the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail.</p>
