<p><span class="loc">Elgin</span> /ˈɛldʒᵻn/ is a city in Cook and Kane counties in the northern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. Located roughly 35 mi (56 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, it lies along the <span class="loc">Fox River</span>. As of 2013, the city had a total population of 110,145, making it the eighth-largest city in <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the Black Hawk Indian War of 1832 led to the expulsion of the Native Americans who had settlements and burial mounds in the area, and set the stage for the founding of <span class="loc">Elgin</span>. Thousands of militiamen and soldiers of Gen. Winfield Scott's army marched through the <span class="loc">Fox River</span> valley during the war, and accounts of the area's fertile soils and flowing springs soon filtered east. In <span class="loc">New York</span>, James T. Gifford and his brother Hezekiah Gifford heard tales of this area ripe for settlement, and travelled west. Looking for a site on the stagecoach route from <span class="loc">Chicago</span> to <span class="loc">Galena</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, they eventually settled on a spot where the <span class="loc">Fox River</span> could be bridged. In April 1835, they established the city, naming it after the Scottish tune "Elgin".</p>
