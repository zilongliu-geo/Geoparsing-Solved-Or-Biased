<p><span class="loc">Sur</span> (Arabic: صور‎) is a capital <span class="loc">city of Ash Sharqiyah</span> Region, northeastern <span class="loc">Oman</span>, on the coast of the <span class="loc">Gulf of Oman</span>. It is located at around 22°34′0″N 59°31′44″E, and is 93 miles (150 km) southeast of the Omani capital Muscat. Historically the city is known for being an important destination point for sailors. Today the sea still plays an important part of life in <span class="loc">Sur</span>. By the 6th century, <span class="loc">Sur</span> was an established centre for trade with <span class="loc">East Africa</span>. In the 16th century, it was under Portuguese rule but was liberated by the Omani imam Nasir ibn <span class="loc">Murshid</span> and underwent an economic revival, as a trade centre with <span class="loc">India</span> and <span class="loc">East Africa</span>. This continued until the mid-19th century, when the British outlawed the slave trade. The city was further ruined by the opening of the <span class="loc">Suez Canal</span>, which saw it lose trade with <span class="loc">India</span>. The main college in <span class="loc">Sur</span> is the Sur College of Applied Sciences. The college has over 4000 students and offers degrees in Business, Communication, Information Technology and Design. It is considered one of the better institutions of higher learning in <span class="loc">Oman</span>. The second college is Sur University College.</p>
