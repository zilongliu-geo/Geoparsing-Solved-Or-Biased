  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hampton</span> is a community located in the municipality of <span class="loc">Clarington</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It originally served as the township office headquarters for Darlington Township until <span class="date">1974</span> when it was annexed by The Town of <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Clarington</span>). <span class="loc">Hampton</span> was founded by <span class="per">Henry Elliot</span> in <span class="date">1840</span>, who opened the first mill here in the former Darlington Township. At first it was called "<span class="per">Elliot</span>'s Mill" and then by <span class="date">1848</span> just "Millsville". Other former names have included: "Hog's Hollow" and "Shantytown". With the opening of the post office the name "Hampton" was chosen, as it was an abbreviation of <span class="per">Henry Elliot</span>'s birthplace, Kirkhampton in <span class="loc">Cornwall</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Hampton</span> has two schools: <span class="org">Hampton Junior Public School</span> which goes from junior kindergarten to grade 3, and <span class="per">M. J. Hobbs</span> Senior Public School which covers grades 4-8. It has two convenience stores, one of which has an LCBO and The Beer Store located inside, two auto garages, one local pizza store, two coffee shops, and Paddy's Market (a new and used appliances store). <span class="loc">Hampton</span> is also home to the <span class="loc">Darlington</span> sports arena.</p><br><br>
