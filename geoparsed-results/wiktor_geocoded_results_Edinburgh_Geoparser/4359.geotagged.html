<p><span class="loc">Kelso</span> is a city in southwest <span class="loc">Washington State</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and is the county seat of <span class="loc">Cowlitz County</span>. At the 2010 census, the population was 11,925. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Longview</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which has a population of 102,410. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> shares its long western border with <span class="loc">Longview</span>. It is near Mount <span class="loc">St. Helens</span>. The earliest known inhabitants of <span class="loc">Kelso</span> were Native Americans from the Cowlitz tribe. The Cowlitz people were separated into the Upper (or Taidnapam) and Lower (or Mountain) Cowlitz tribes, who were members of the Sahaptin and Salish language families, respectively. In 1855, European explorers noted that there numbered over 6000 individuals of the Cowlitz Tribe. <span class="loc">Kelso</span> was founded by Peter W. Crawford, a Scottish surveyor, who, in 1847, took up the first donation land claim on the Lower <span class="loc">Cowlitz River</span>. Crawford platted a townsite which he named after his home town of <span class="loc">Kelso</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. The original plat was dated and filed in October 1884. It became incorporated in 1889. In its early days, <span class="loc">Kelso</span> obtained the nickname "<span class="loc">Little Chicago</span>" as it became famous for its large number of taverns and brothels that catered to local loggers. On weekends, trainloads of loggers would come into town from the surrounding region looking for women, liquor, gambling and fights. The FBI finally forced the mayor to shut them down in the 1950s with the last closing in the mid-1960s. The economy continues to be based largely on wood products.</p>
