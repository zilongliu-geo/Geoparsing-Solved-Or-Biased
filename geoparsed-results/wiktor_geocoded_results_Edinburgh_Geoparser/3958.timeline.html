  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Allegheny County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, along the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>, adjoining <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. The population was 8,370 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The borough was incorporated in <span class="date">1867</span>. It is located in the <span class="org">Northgate</span> School District. There is a public park and library, the <span class="org">Andrew Bayne Memorial Library</span>. The land on which the borough currently sits was once part of the Depreciation Lands reserved for Revolutionary War veterans. The first landowners in the area were <span class="per">James Robinson</span> and <span class="per">Hugh Henry Brackenridge</span>, purchasing parcels in <span class="date">1799</span> and <span class="date">1792</span> respectively. At the time of its organization as a borough, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> had exactly the minimum population for such a designation: 300 residents. Residents of the area tried unsuccessfully to obtain improvements from Ross Township, but officials were opposed to development along <span class="loc">Venango</span> Trail (<span class="date">today</span> Route 19). In response, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> was incorporated as a borough independent of Ross on <span class="date">September 7, 1867</span>. The name of the borough was chosen by J. J. East, a linguist and early resident of the borough, and means "beautiful view." <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is located at 40°29′38″N 80°3′13″W.</p><br><br>
