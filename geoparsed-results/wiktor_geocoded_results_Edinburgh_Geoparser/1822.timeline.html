  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Amherst</span> (<span class="date">2011</span> population 9,717; UA population 9,547) is a Canadian town in northwestern <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>. Located at the northeast end of the <span class="loc">Cumberland Basin</span>, an arm of the <span class="loc">Bay of Fundy</span>, <span class="loc">Amherst</span> is strategically situated on the eastern boundary of the Tantramar Marshes 3 kilometres east of the interprovincial border with <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span> and 65 kilometres east of the <span class="loc">city of Moncton</span>. It is also located 60 kilometres southwest of the <span class="loc">New Brunswick</span> abutment of the <span class="org">Confederation</span> Bridge to <span class="loc">Prince Edward Island</span> at Cape Jourimain. <span class="per">Amherst</span> is the shire town and largest population centre in <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>. According to <span class="per">Dr. Graham P. Hennessey</span>, "The Micmac name was Nemcheboogwek meaning "going up rising ground", in reference to the higher land to the east of the Tantramar Marshes. The Acadians who settled here as early as <span class="date">1672</span> called the village <span class="loc">Les Planches</span>. The village was later renamed <span class="per">Amherst</span> by <span class="per">Colonel Joseph Morse</span> in honour of <span class="per">Lord Amherst</span>, the commander-in-chief of the British Army in <span class="loc">North America</span> during <span class="date">the Seven Years</span>' War. The town was first settled in <span class="date">1764</span> by immigrants from <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span> following the expulsion of the Acadians, with the original settlement being located three kilometres southwest of the present town on the shore of the <span class="loc">Bay of Fundy</span>. These settlers were joined by United Empire Loyalists (Loyalists who fled the American colonies during the American Revolution). A mill was built on the current townsite, and the residents moved there to be closer to work.</p><br><br>
