<p>Davis is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span> and the most populous city in <span class="loc">Yolo County</span>. It had a population of 65,622 in 2010, not including the on-campus population of the University of California, Davis, which was 5,786. Davis is included in the <span class="loc">Sacramento–Arden-Arcade–Roseville Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Davis grew into a Southern Pacific Railroad depot built in 1868. It was then known as "Davisville", named after Jerome C. Davis, a prominent local farmer. However, the post office at <span class="loc">Davisville</span> shortened the town name simply to "Davis" in 1907. The name stuck, and the <span class="loc">city of Davis</span> was incorporated on March 28, 1917. From its inception as a farming community, Davis has been known for its contributions to agricultural policy along with veterinary care and animal husbandry. Following the passage of the University Farm Bill in 1905 by the California State Legislature, Governor George Pardee selected Davis out of 50 other sites as the future home to the University of California's <span class="loc">University Farm</span>, officially opening to students in 1908. The farm, later renamed the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture in 1922, was upgraded into the seventh UC general campus, the University of California, Davis, in 1959.</p>
