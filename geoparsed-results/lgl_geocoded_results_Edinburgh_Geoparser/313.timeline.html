  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Firefighters honored for heroism. As the roaring fire consumed the yacht, <span class="per">Nicholas DiGiacomo</span> gave one of the trapped passengers his air pack and mask, put himself at the mercy of the thick smoke and used his power saw to cut open an escape route in the yacht's hull. The Miami-Dade Fire Rescue firefighter saved both passengers at the Miami Beach Marina on <span class="date">March 31, 2008</span>. On <span class="date">Friday</span>, he received the Silver Medal of <span class="org">Valor</span>. More than 60 firefighters and police received awards for their acts of bravery in <span class="date">2008</span>, such as saving babies from burning buildings, snatching swimmers from rough seas and pulling people out of wrecked cars. CBS4 anchor <span class="per">Michael Williams</span> presented dozens of awards, including one to firefighter <span class="per">Anthony Oro</span>, who held onto a woman's hand for two hours on <span class="date">May 14</span> beneath the sweltering sun while fellow firefighters cut away at the car in which she was trapped. Another award was given to firefighter and diver Augustin Hondares, whose Fire Rescue unit responded <span class="date">April 20</span> when a child's parents were trapped under water in a car. Hondares drove to the canal, so he had no time to put on his scuba gear. He instead held his breath, dove into the cold, murky water and pulled out one passenger. He then dove back in, located the second passenger, and had <span class="per">Lt. Richard Rosell</span> pull the man out. Although both parents later died at the hospital, Hondares, <span class="per">Rosell</span> and others received awards for their heroic efforts. <span class="per">DiGiacomo</span> credited teamwork for helping firefighters save two people from the burning yacht. '' We couldn't fathom not getting them out,'' he said. Those thoughts ``can't even creep in.'' Fire Chief <span class="per">Herminio Lorenzo</span> said the firefighters earned their awards by taking their skills and sense of honor with them to all places, on and off the job. '' The individuals we honor <span class="date">today</span> are those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty . . . who went beyond logic and common sense -- to save somebody,'' he said.</p><br><br>
