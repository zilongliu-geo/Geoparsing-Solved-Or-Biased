<p><span class="loc">Chester</span> is a Canadian village located in and part of <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>'s Chester Municipal District in the southeastern part of <span class="loc">Lunenburg County</span>. <span class="loc">Chester</span> was officially founded in 1759 during the French and Indian War. It was the <span class="loc">Shoreham</span> grant, although French fishermen had already built a few houses on the site. The first permanent European-descended settlers were a group from <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> who came to the area in 1761. During the American Revolution, the village avoided a raid by American Privateers wherein the townswomen, young and old, garbed in cloaks with their red lining worn outwards (to resemble the uniforms of the British soldiers) marched around the blockhouse (now the Wisteria Cottage House) in the early morning of 30 June 1782 to successfully convince American Privateers lying offshore to find another place to pillage. The following day the privateers successfully executed the Raid on <span class="loc">Lunenburg</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> (1782). During the War of 1812, the American Privateer Young Teazer was trapped off the shores of <span class="loc">Chester</span> by the HMS <span class="loc">Hogue</span> (1811). To avoid capture, a crew member of the Young Teazer destroyed his own ship, killing most of the crew.</p>
