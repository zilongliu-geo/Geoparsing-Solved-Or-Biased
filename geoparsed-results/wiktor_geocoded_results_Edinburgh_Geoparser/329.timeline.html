  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Clifton</span> is both a suburb of <span class="loc">Bristol</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, and the name of one of the city's thirty-five council wards. The <span class="loc">Clifton ward</span> also includes the areas of <span class="per">Cliftonwood</span> and <span class="per">Hotwells</span>. Other parts of the suburb lie within the <span class="loc">ward of Clifton East</span>. Notable places in <span class="per">Clifton</span> include <span class="per">Clifton</span> Suspension Bridge, <span class="loc">Clifton</span> Cathedral, <span class="loc">Clifton</span> College, The <span class="org">Clifton Club</span>, <span class="org">Bristol Zoo</span>, <span class="loc">Goldney Hall</span> and <span class="loc">Clifton Down</span>. <span class="per">Clifton</span> is an inner suburb of the English port <span class="loc">city of Bristol</span>. <span class="per">Clifton</span> was recorded in the Domesday book as Clistone, the name of the village denoting a 'hillside settlement' and referring to its position on a steep hill. Until <span class="date">1898</span> <span class="per">Clifton St Andrew</span> was a separate civil parish within the Municipal Borough of <span class="loc">Bristol</span>. Various sub-districts of <span class="per">Clifton</span> exist, including Whiteladies Road, an important shopping district to the east, and <span class="loc">Clifton</span> Village, a smaller shopping area near the <span class="loc">Avon Gorge</span> to the west. Although the suburb has no formal boundaries, the name <span class="per">Clifton</span> is generally applied to the high ground stretching from Whiteladies Road in the east to the rim of the <span class="loc">Avon Gorge</span> in the west, and from <span class="loc">Clifton Down</span> and <span class="loc">Durdham Down</span> in the north to Cornwallis Crescent in the south. This area corresponds roughly with the city <span class="loc">wards of Clifton and Clifton East</span>, although the former also includes the river side suburb of <span class="per">Hotwells</span>.</p><br><br>
