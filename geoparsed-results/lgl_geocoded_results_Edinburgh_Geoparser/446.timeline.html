  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>DNR tickets out-of-state boaters avoiding Ind. tax. <span class="loc">HAMMOND</span>, Ind. (AP) &#x97; The <span class="org">Indiana Department of Natural Resources</span> is cracking down on out-of-state boaters who do not pay Indiana excise taxes. More than 300 people with boats moored in <span class="loc">Hammond</span> and <span class="loc">East Chicago</span> have been fined for failing to pay the tax. As many as 89 people could face fines of $500 and have their driver's licenses suspended for not acting on the tickets. Out-of-state residents can register their boats in their home state, but must pay Indiana excise taxes if they boat in <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. The recent crackdown was prompted in part by complaints by angry Indiana residents who pay the state's excise tax when they register their boats. ``These people felt they were being cheated,'' said DNR <span class="per">Lt. Jerry Shepherd</span>. At the large <span class="loc">Hammond</span> Marina, about 85 percent of boaters live outside of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. Port Authority Director Milan Kruszynski said ticketed boaters weren't happy, especially since they have to travel to <span class="org">Lowell Town Court</span> if they want to contest the ticket. Of the more than 300 boaters cited in <span class="loc">Hammond</span> and <span class="loc">East Chicago</span>, between 150 and 200 refused to comply, contested or did not respond to the notice, said <span class="org">DNR Public Information Officer Shawn Brown</span>. The <span class="org">Indiana General Assembly</span> passed a law in <span class="date">2006</span> to allow greater enforcement of the state's excise tax. The <span class="org">Indiana Department of Natural Resources</span> launched a public education campaign to convince out-of-state boaters that <span class="loc">Indiana</span> is serious about collecting the tax.</p><br><br>
