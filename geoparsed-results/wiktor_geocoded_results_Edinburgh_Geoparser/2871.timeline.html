  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Burbank</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cook County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 28,925 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is located at the southwest edge of the <span class="loc">city of Chicago</span>; the <span class="loc">Chicago city</span> limit – specifically that of the <span class="loc">Ashburn</span> neighborhood – is in common with Burbank's eastern city limit. Burbank shares a boundary with <span class="loc">Oak Lawn</span> to its south, <span class="loc">Bridgeview</span> to its west, and <span class="loc">Bedford Park</span> to its north; the <span class="loc">city of Hometown</span> is also adjacent to Burbank's southeast corner. <span class="loc">Burbank</span> is less than two miles south of <span class="loc">Chicago Midway International Airport</span>. The current mayor is <span class="per">Harry J. Klein</span>, who took office in <span class="date">1991</span>. In <span class="date">1850</span>, the area which would become the <span class="loc">city of Burbank</span>, then largely uninhabited and agrarian, became part of Lyons Township. Over the next hundred <span class="date">years</span> the area remained largely undeveloped, though several times large plans were laid out for the area, never to come to fruition. In the late 19th century a railroad investor named <span class="per">A. B. Stickney</span> planned a large railroad transfer center which included what became the northern part of <span class="loc">Burbank</span>, but his ideas were never realized due to an economic depression in <span class="date">1893</span>.</p><br><br>
