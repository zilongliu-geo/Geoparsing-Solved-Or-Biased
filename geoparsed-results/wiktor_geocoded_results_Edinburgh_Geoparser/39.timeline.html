  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Rosa</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Guadalupe County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,744 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It lies between <span class="per">Albuquerque</span> and <span class="per">Tucumcari</span>, situated on the <span class="loc">Pecos</span> River at the intersection of Interstate 40, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 54, and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 84. The city is located west of, but not within, the <span class="loc">Llano Estacado</span> or "staked plains" of eastern <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and west <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The first Euro-American settlement in the area was <span class="loc">Aqua</span> <span class="loc">Negra</span> <span class="loc">Chiquita</span>, "Little <span class="loc">Black Water</span>" in Spanish, in <span class="date">1865</span>. The name was changed in <span class="date">1890</span> to <span class="loc">Santa Rosa</span> (Spanish for "<span class="loc">Saint Rose</span>") referring to a chapel that <span class="per">Don Celso</span> <span class="loc">Baca</span> (the founder of the city) built and named after both his mother <span class="per">Rosa</span> and <span class="loc">Saint Rose</span> of <span class="loc">Lima</span>. The "Rosa" may also refer to the roses in the story of <span class="loc">Our Lady of Guadalupe</span> and is indicative of the Catholicism of the Spanish colonizers who settled in the area. <span class="loc">Santa Rosa</span> was connected by railroad to <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">El Paso</span>, and the world at large in <span class="date">the early 1900s</span>.</p><br><br>
