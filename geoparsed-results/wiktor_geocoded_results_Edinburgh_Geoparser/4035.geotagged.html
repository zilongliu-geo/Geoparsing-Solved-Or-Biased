<p>Brooklyn is a town to the north of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> 51 kilometres from the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district, in the local government area of <span class="loc">Hornsby Shire</span>. Despite sharing the name, this small <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> town has no relation to the <span class="loc">borough of Brooklyn</span> in New <span class="loc">York City</span>. Brooklyn is sometimes considered the northernmost suburb of the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area, as it is located on the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> side of the <span class="loc">Hawkesbury River</span>, and <span class="loc">Mooney</span> <span class="loc">Mooney</span> Bridge. It is part of <span class="loc">The County</span> of <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, in which <span class="loc">Sydney city</span> is located, but Brooklyn is rarely considered part of the city. Brooklyn occupies a narrow strip of tidal waterfront land aligned east â€“ west along the southern bank of the <span class="loc">Hawkesbury River</span>. Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park borders the suburb to the south and the F3 Sydney-Newcastle Freeway crosses the river just to the west. <span class="loc">Long Island</span> runs parallel with the suburb on the opposite side of Sandbrook Inlet and is joined to Brooklyn by the railway causeway. <span class="loc">Dangar Island</span> is sited to the north east. The general area was known as Peat's Ferry crossing for a long time until January 1884 when a plan of survey for the subdivision of land owned by Peter and William <span class="loc">Fagan</span> was registered with the suburb name of Brooklyn. A hotel of the same name followed later in the year. The town owes its existence and location to the main northern railway line with the railway arriving in Brooklyn in 1887 when the single track section north from <span class="loc">Hornsby</span> was completed.</p>
