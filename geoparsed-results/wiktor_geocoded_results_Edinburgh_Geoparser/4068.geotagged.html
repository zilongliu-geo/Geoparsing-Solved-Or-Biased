<p><span class="loc">Shrewsbury</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Shrewsbury</span> is an unusual <span class="loc">New England</span> town in that it was neither a mill town nor a farming village. Rather, it grew as a suburb to neighboring <span class="loc">Worcester</span> from the start, with visitors to <span class="loc">Lake Quinsigamond</span>. The population was 35,608 according to the 2010 <span class="loc">US</span> Census, in nearly 12,400 households. Incorporated in 1727, the town is governed now under the <span class="loc">New England</span> representative town meeting system, headed by the Town Manager and five-member elected Board of Selectmen whose duties include licensing, appointing various administrative positions, and calling a town meeting of citizens annually or whenever the need arises. The Town of <span class="loc">Shrewsbury</span>, named for <span class="loc">Shrewsbury</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, is a suburban community with an uneven and hilly terrain cut by a number of minor streams providing several small water power sites. Grants of land were made in what would eventually be the town beginning in 1664, with the 3,200-acre (13 km2) grant called <span class="loc">Haynes Farm</span> as the largest. Settlers came primarily from <span class="loc">Sudbury</span> and <span class="loc">Marlborough</span>, and the first permanent settler was Gersham Wheelock in 1720. As a town, <span class="loc">Shrewsbury</span> was first settled in 1722 and officially incorporated in 1727.</p>
