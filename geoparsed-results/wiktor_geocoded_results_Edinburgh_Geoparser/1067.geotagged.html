<p>Portland is a community located in Eastern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> within the township of <span class="loc">Rideau</span> Lakes in the United Counties of <span class="loc">Leeds</span> and <span class="loc">Grenville</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, north of <span class="loc">Kingston</span> and situated on the <span class="loc">Big Rideau Lake</span>. Portland was first settled in the early 19th century as one of the first settlements along the <span class="loc">Rideau</span> Waterway. The original seven houses in Portland, informally known as "The Landing", were a transfer point for passengers travelling from <span class="loc">Brockville</span> and continuing by barge to <span class="loc">Perth</span>. With the completion of the <span class="loc">Rideau</span> Canal Waterway in 1832, steamboats and barges carrying raw materials such as cordwood, maple syrup, potash, cheese, tanned hides and salt beef were a common sight. Portland became a thriving village of trade with <span class="loc">Kingston</span>, <span class="loc">Montreal</span> and <span class="loc">Ottawa</span>. The village of Portland took its name in 1843 from William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. By the 1860s, the settlement had expanded considerably to require five hotels and, by the early 20th century, cottages were springing up around the lake and the tourist trade had begun. Advances in rail and road travel and increasing tourism offset a decline in the role of agriculture in the economy of Portland. Tourism then began to lead the economy of Portland, and still does to this day. [1]</p>
