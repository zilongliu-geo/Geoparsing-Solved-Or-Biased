<p>Ani (Armenian: Անի; Greek: Ἄνιον, Ánion; Latin: Abnicum; Georgian: ანისი, Anisi; Turkish: Ani) is a ruined medieval Armenian city situated in the Turkish <span class="loc">province of Kars</span> near the border with <span class="loc">Armenia</span>. Between 961 and 1045, it was the capital of the Bagratid Armenian kingdom that covered much of present-day <span class="loc">Armenia</span> and eastern <span class="loc">Turkey</span>. Called the "City of 1001 Churches", Ani stood on various trade routes and its many religious buildings, palaces, and fortifications were amongst the most technically and artistically advanced structures in the world. At its height, the population of Ani probably was on the order of 100,000. Long ago renowned for its splendor and magnificence, Ani was sacked by the Mongols in 1236 and devastated in a 1319 earthquake, after which it was reduced to a village and gradually abandoned and largely forgotten by the seventeenth century. Ani is a widely recognized cultural, religious, and national heritage symbol for Armenians. According to Razmik Panossian, Ani is one of the most visible and ‘tangible’ symbols of past Armenian greatness and hence a source of pride.</p>
