<p><span class="loc">Inglewood</span> is a small town near Adelaide, <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is located in the Adelaide Hills Council local government area, and is adjacent to <span class="loc">Houghton</span>, <span class="loc">Paracombe</span> and the rural <span class="loc">districts of Upper Hermitage and Chain</span> Of Ponds. At the 2006 census, <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> had a population of 264. <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> was named after a town in <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Houghton</span> already existed along an earlier road, and its people banked on the new main line of road supporting their future. They were, to put it mildly, upset to discover that the new road would bypass <span class="loc">Houghton</span>, taking a course considered to be 'more advantageous' to travellers. Out of this came <span class="loc">Inglewood</span>, initially as an hotel constructed in 1858 at the hands of Firman Deacon, who could see advantage in the midst of <span class="loc">Houghton</span>'s adversity. When the hotel was close to completion, Deacon offered his builders five gallons of beer to provide a suitable name for it. Overnight the men, deliberated, finally agreeing on <span class="loc">Inglewood</span>, a name emanating from the north of <span class="loc">England</span>. By the time Deacon arrived the next day the name Inglewood Inn had been painted on a board opposite the bar. Some settlers, a store or two and the like came on the scene and that is as large as <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> grew. Today the historic inn is still its focal point, with one or two supporting businesses - a bakery, post office, hairdresser, alpaca stud, crash repairer, various orchards and more keeping the little community busy.</p>
