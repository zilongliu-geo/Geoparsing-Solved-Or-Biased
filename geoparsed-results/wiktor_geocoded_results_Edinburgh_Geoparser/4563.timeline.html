  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ayon</span> (Russian: Айон) is a rural locality (a selo) in <span class="loc">Chaunsky District</span> of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, situated on the northwestern shores of <span class="loc">Ayon</span> Island in the entrance to <span class="loc">Chaunskaya</span> Bay. It is the only populated place on the island Population: 252 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census);  Municipally, <span class="loc">Ayon</span> is subordinated to Chaunsky Municipal District and is incorporated as <span class="loc">Ayon Rural</span> Settlement. The first mention of <span class="loc">Aion</span> was in the writings of Isaya Ignatiev, who landed on the island and traded with the locals living there in <span class="date">1646</span> and in <span class="date">1761</span> <span class="loc">Ayon</span> was visited by the merchant Nikita Shalaurov. There were still indigenous settlers on the island when it was first visited by <span class="per">Ferdinand von Wrangel</span> in <span class="date">1821</span>, mainly <span class="loc">Chukchi</span> engaged in traditional reindeer husbandry. Early Russian visitors to the region including explorer Nikita Shalaurov called the island Zavadey (Russian: Завадей) and later: Sabodey (Russian: Сабодей) by <span class="per">Wrangel</span>, but the island and the village itself was called <span class="loc">Ayon</span> from <span class="date">1875</span> when the missionary Argentov overheard local <span class="loc">Chukchi</span> referring to the area as such, although other sources suggest the date was <span class="date">1857</span>. The name was initially translated as Marrow Island, although other sources contend that the name is derived from the Chukchi word meaning "brain", as the island's shape is somewhat like a brain. The local expert on Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages, Pyotr Inenlikey considers that the name derives from the Chukchi word <span class="loc">Ayo</span>, meaning revive and that the island is though of as a place of revival by the idegenous inhabitants. The abundant pastures present on the island (since it lies within Chukotka's Taiga zone) add weight to this theory, as well as the fact that although the island is covered in ice and snow during the <span class="date">winter</span>, in the <span class="date">summer</span>, this melts and the island provides a good pasture for reindeer herds as well as being the home to swarms of midges and gadflies.</p><br><br>
