  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Local volunteers join flood fighting effort in <span class="loc">Fargo</span>. Tastefully Simple and The Alexandria Blizzard coordinated an effort to bus 300 volunteers from the Alexandria area to the affected area <span class="date">Tuesday</span>. As the National Weather Service stuck to its prediction that the <span class="loc">Red River</span> will crest at 39 to 41 feet in Fargo-Moorhead on <span class="date">Friday</span>, the mounting stress of a potential record flood began to take its toll. â Fear is setting in,â said <span class="org">Salvation Army</span> <span class="per">Captain Adam Moore</span>. â Weâ re seeing that on the streets. â As of <span class="date">8:15 p.m. Monday</span>, the <span class="loc">Red River</span> level in <span class="loc">Fargo</span> was 27.58 feet. Weather service officials warned that a storm system moving into the <span class="loc">Red River</span> Valley from <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> overnight could drop up to an inch of rain over a widespread area before the rain turns to snow <span class="date">Wednesday</span>. Despite sporadic showers <span class="date">Monday</span>, <span class="loc">Fargo</span> Mayor <span class="per">Dennis Walaker</span> said the city â had <span class="date">a good day</span>. â <span class="loc">Fargo</span> tried to speed up the dike-building process by deploying a portable wall system thatâ s used to protect soldiers in <span class="loc">Iraq</span> and <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span> from bullets and grenades. <span class="per">Sharon Mueller</span> watched from near her home just off 40th Avenue South as a payloader filled a wall of the Hesco containers with sand. Under the road, large ice chunks floated down the swollen Drain 27. <span class="per">Mueller</span>, a retired bartender, said she couldnâ t believe how fast the rising water was running. She said that despite her husbandâ s complacency, she was worried about flooding. â Can you imagine what Noah must have felt like? â she said. Sandbagging hit high gear in the metro, as high schools let out students and colleges canceled classes to aid the effort. North Dakota Governor <span class="per">John Hoeven</span> said students would be forgiven for missed school <span class="date">days</span>. About 30 <span class="org">Concordia College</span> students stacked sandbags around Barb Grothâ s house in <span class="loc">Oakport</span> Township north of <span class="loc">Moorhead</span>, where several hundred volunteers pitched in. Groth, whose home flooded in <span class="date">1997</span> when the <span class="loc">Red River</span> crested at 39.57 feet, said she didnâ t think a repeat was possible. â I never thought it could happen again. Weâ re nervous,â she said. Minnesota Governor <span class="per">Tim Pawlenty</span> stopped in <span class="loc">Oakport</span> and <span class="loc">Moorhead</span>, urging state residents to join the flood fight. About 230 <span class="org">Minnesota National Guard</span> troops were helping with flood efforts, and he said he expects that number will eventually reach about 400. <span class="per">Hoeven</span> said the stateâ s National Guard committed 500 soldiers to the water war, with more available. <span class="loc">Fargo</span> raised its goal for daily sandbag output to 300,000 to try to fill 2 million bags by <span class="date">Thursday</span>. â If those neighborhoods hold, we are safe as a city,â said <span class="loc">Fargo City</span> Commissioner <span class="per">Tim Mahoney</span>. â If weâ re unable to do that, weâ re going to have a problem. â The city was prepared for a <span class="loc">Red River</span> crest of 38 feet. <span class="date">Now</span>, city officials want to get the dikes up to 42 feet, <span class="per">Mahoney</span> said. At 41 feet â we lose a lot of houses,â he said. â If weâ re going to get this thing done, itâ s going to have to be done in the next 24 to 48 hours in a massive way. â The Fargodome, where volunteers waited for bus rides to <span class="org">Sandbag Central</span>, the cityâ s utilities building, became its own sandbag-filling station with hundreds of shovel-wielding volunteers scooping sand dumped on the parking lot. Sandbaggers kept spirits up despite the gloomy weather and flood outlook. <span class="loc">Fargo</span> plans to give residents routes out of town <span class="date">Wednesday afternoon</span> or <span class="date">Thursday</span>, said <span class="per">Pat Zavoral</span>, <span class="loc">Fargo city</span> administrator. â There are some locations in south <span class="loc">Fargo</span> where if the water does break away from these [dikes], they wonâ t be able to use Interstate-29,â he said. <span class="org">Fargo Police</span> Chief <span class="per">Keith Ternes</span> urged residents to go to the cityâ s Web site and register for the Code Red alert system so they can be reached in an emergency. Residents with land lines are already registered in the system. Sandbagging efforts continued overnight. City officials hope they get 300 people an hour to help fill sandbags at the cityâ s utility operation center at <span class="date">2301</span> 8th <span class="loc">Ave</span>. N. and 1,000 people an hour at the Fargodome. <span class="per">Hoeven</span> asked for a presidential emergency declaration based on preparation efforts because of the costs. He said he thinks the state might get it <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
