<p><span class="loc">Santa Teresa</span> (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈsɐ̃tɐ teˈɾezɐ]) is the name of a neighborhood in the city of <span class="loc">Rio de Janeiro</span>, <span class="loc">Brazil</span>. It is located on top of the <span class="loc">Santa Teresa</span> hill, by the centre of <span class="loc">Rio</span>, and is famous for its winding, narrow streets which are a favourite spot for artists and tourists. The neighborhood originated around the <span class="loc">Santa Teresa</span> Convent, built in the 1750s on the Desterro hill. At the end of the 19th and early 20th century it was an upper class borough, as testified by its many opulent villas. <span class="loc">Santa Teresa</span> ceased being an upper-class neighbourhood long ago, but it has been revived as an fashionable otspot. It is home to several artists and art studios and galleries. The offer of restaurants and bars is also varied. One of <span class="loc">Santa Teresa</span>'s most illustrious inhabitants was Raymundo Ottoni de Castro Maia, an art collector who lived in his Chácara do Céu mansion in the neighborhood. The estate was turned into a museum (Museu da Chácara do Céu) and its exhibits include works by Matisse, Jean Metzinger, Eliseu Visconti, Di Cavalcanti, and Candido Portinari. It is located near the cultural center <span class="loc">Parque</span> das Ruínas. In 2006, some paintings were stolen, and haven't been recovered yet.</p>
