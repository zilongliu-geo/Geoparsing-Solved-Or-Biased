<p><span class="loc">Farmington</span> is a city in St. <span class="loc">Francois County</span> located 60 miles (97 km) south of St. Louis in the Lead Belt region in <span class="loc">Missouri</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 16,240. It is the county seat of St. <span class="loc">Francois County</span>. The Farmington Micropolitan Statistical Area includes St. <span class="loc">Francois County</span> and <span class="loc">Washington County</span> and has a population of 90,554 as of 2010. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> is a component of the St. Louis-St. Charles-Farmington, MO-IL Combined Statistical Area, also known as Greater St. Louis. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> was established in 1822 as Murphy's Settlement, named for William Murphy of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> who first visited the site in 1798. When St. <span class="loc">Francois County</span> was organized, the town was briefly called St. Francois <span class="loc">Court House</span> and later renamed to <span class="loc">Farmington</span>. A band of peaceful Onsaga-Osage Native Americans were slaughtered in 1801 and their lands captured by settlers in the infamous Battle of Red Grass Hill. Twelve pioneers were injured while 260 Native Americans were reportedly killed in battle, wounded, or executed shortly thereafter. A marker, bearing the site of the battle, was a prominent display until 1951 when it was stolen by vandals.</p>
