  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Espiritu Santo</span> is the largest island in the nation of <span class="loc">Vanuatu</span>, with an area of 3,955.5 km2 (1,527.2 sq mi) and a population of around 40,000 according to the <span class="date">2009</span> census. It belongs to the archipelago of the <span class="loc">New Hebrides</span> in the Pacific region of <span class="loc">Melanesia</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">Sanma Province</span> of <span class="loc">Vanuatu</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Luganville</span>, on <span class="loc">Espiritu Santo</span>'s southeast coast, is <span class="loc">Vanuatu</span>'s second-largest settlement and the provincial capital. Roads run north and west from <span class="loc">Luganville</span> but most of the island is far from the limited road network. <span class="loc">Vanuatu</span>'s highest peak is the <span class="date">1879</span> metre (6165 foot) Mount Tabwemasana in west-central <span class="loc">Espiritu Santo</span>. In <span class="date">1998</span>, <span class="loc">Santo</span> hosted the Melanesia Cup. A Spanish expedition led by Portuguese explorer <span class="per">Pedro Fernandes</span> de Queirós, established a settlement in <span class="date">1606</span> at <span class="loc">Big Bay</span> on the north side of the island. <span class="loc">Espiritu Santo</span> takes its name from Queirós, who named the entire island group La Austrialia [sic] del Espíritu Santo in acknowledgment of the Spanish king's descent from the royal House of <span class="loc">Austria</span>, and believing he had arrived in the Great Southern Continent, <span class="org">Terra</span> Australis. During the time of the British–French Condominium, <span class="loc">Hog Harbour</span>, on the northeast coast, was the site of the British district administration, while Segond, near <span class="loc">Luganville</span> was the French district administration.</p><br><br>
