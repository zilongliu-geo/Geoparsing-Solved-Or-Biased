  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Health officials in <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> say that Avian Bird Flu (H5N1) appears to be taking hold in the region - where the deadly virus has surfaced in local poultry. <span class="per">Hong Kong</span>'s Health Secretary said in a media conference on <span class="date">Friday</span> that positive tests for H5N1 in a bird brought into <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> from <span class="loc">China</span> indicates that the virus is endemic in the region. <span class="per">Dr York Chow</span> says new laws will be introduced to restrict movement of poultry. "It's not just <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span>, he said. "This virus will exist in neighboring areas, southern <span class="loc">China</span> as well as <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span>," <span class="per">Dr Chow</span> said. "Since different kinds of wild birds and chickens have this virus, we can be quite sure that this virus is endemic in our birds," he said. Health bureau spokeswoman <span class="per">Sally Kong</span> later clarified <span class="per">Dr Chow</span>'s comments, saying the Secretary meant that bird flu was endemic in <span class="loc">Asia</span> - but not in <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> specifically. Whilst Bird flu is considered endemic in <span class="loc">Vietnam</span>, <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>, <span class="loc">Laos</span>, <span class="loc">Cambodia</span> and <span class="loc">Thailand</span>, international standards require that countries be certified as 'endemic' by test results showing a cycle of disease recurrence in an area. <span class="per">Mrs Kong</span> said <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> does not meet such standards. <span class="per">York Chow</span> said the government intends to ban individual households from raising chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, turkeys and quails. The legislation to ban private ownership could be in place <span class="date">next week</span>. Current <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> legislation allows private poultry ownership of up to 20 birds. Under the law change, the current exemption will be removed. The unauthorised keeping of poultry will be an offence warranting fines of up to $100,000, however, those keeping commercial racing pigeons in new towns and villages may be exempt.</p><br><br>
