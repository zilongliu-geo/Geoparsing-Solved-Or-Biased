  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Union City</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Stone County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located about five miles south of Clever on <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Supplemental Routes M and K. <span class="loc">Union City</span> was a Union Army camp during the Civil War. A small train station was built there (it still stands, but the old railroad itself was removed and converted to a road, Route K, during the Get <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Out Of The Mud movement of <span class="date">the 1950s</span>). The community is part of the <span class="loc">Branson</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. The adjacent area to the east of <span class="loc">Union City</span> and south of <span class="loc">Possum Trot</span> is known as Union Ridge, and a church was built there in <span class="date">1896</span>. On the day of the church building dedication, several drunk, rowdy young men arrived at the outdoor dinner gathering. For reasons believed to involve a young lady, a knife fight broke out and a number of people were badly injured. As a result, area residents referred to the church as "the Bloody Ridge Baptist Church", a name that stuck for several generations. <span class="org">South of Union Ridge</span> and east of <span class="loc">Union City</span> is <span class="loc">Silver Lake</span>, an impoundment that was dammed in <span class="date">1865</span> by <span class="per">Davis Kimberling</span> for the purpose of powering a feed and flour mill. It is <span class="date">now</span> a recreational area.</p><br><br>
