<p><span class="loc">Hatta</span> (Arabic: حتا‎) was a Palestinian Arab village of 1,125 inhabitants that was depopulated after a July 17, 1948 assault by Israeli forces of the Givati Brigade during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The Jewish localities of <span class="loc">Revaha</span>, <span class="loc">Zavdiel</span> and <span class="loc">Aluma</span> are currently located on the former village's lands. The Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1228) referred to the village as Hattawa and said it was the home of the Islamic scholar ´Amru al-Hattawi. <span class="loc">Hatta</span>, like the rest of <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the tax registers of 1596 it appeared under the name of Hatta as-Sajara as being in the nahiya of <span class="loc">Gazza</span> in the liwa of <span class="loc">Gazza</span>. It had a population of 15 households, all Muslim. The inhabitants of the village paid taxes on wheat, barley, sesame, goats and/or beehives. The scholar Edward Robinson passed by the village in 1838, and described its houses as being made of adobe bricks. In 1863 the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, which he estimated it to have 600 inhabitants. He noticed that beside the well were four barrels of broken columns, three gray-white marble, and the fourth of bluish marble. The latter, placed horizontally at the orifice was deeply furrowed by the rope that animals or men had used to raise the water. In a oually dedicated to Neby Amran he noticed some stones with the same ancient look. Around the village were large plantations of tobacco, here and there also stood several groups of beautiful pine, olive and fig trees.</p>
