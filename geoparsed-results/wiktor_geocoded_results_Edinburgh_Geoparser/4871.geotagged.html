<p><span class="loc">Ferndale</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Humboldt County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Its population was 1,371 at the 2010 census, down from 1,382 at the 2000 census. The city contains dozens of well-preserved Victorian storefronts and homes. <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> is the northern gateway to <span class="loc">California</span>'s Lost Coast and the city, which is sited on the edge of a wide plain near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Eel River</span>, is also located near the extensive preserves of Coast Redwood forests. Before American settlement, <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> was a glade of giant ferns reaching more than six feet, surrounded by Alder, Willow, <span class="loc">Sitka</span> Spruce, Douglas fir, Coast Redwood, swampy land and windswept prairies. The area was populated by the southern <span class="loc">Wiyot</span> people, centered along the <span class="loc">Eel River</span> where they caught lamprey eels, salmon and sturgeon in iris leaf fish nets, collected shellfish along the river and at its mouth, while cultivating only a <span class="loc">California</span> species of tobacco until settlement by Willard Allard, Seth Louis Shaw and his brother Stephen W. Shawi established the town the summer of 1852. In August 1852, <span class="loc">Allard</span> and the <span class="loc">Shaw</span> brothers borrowed a canoe from the Wiyots in the <span class="loc">Table Bluff</span> area and rowed it across the Eel and up <span class="loc">Francis Creek</span> to arrive with their supplies to the approximate vicinity of Main and Shaw streets. In September 1852 they cleared a five-acre area of ferns and began building a cabin near the base of the Wildcat Road even though Allard was sick with the ague. By January 1853, twelve men were living in the <span class="loc">Shaws</span>' cabin including Seth Kinman, who provided the group with meat, and Joe Russ (1825-1886), whose later holdings included the Fern Cottage Historic District. About this time, Stephen Shaw painted the portrait of <span class="loc">Wiyot</span> elder Kiwelattah (or Ki-we-lah-tah) and kept a detailed journal of two years of trying to grow plants in cold coastal fog.</p>
