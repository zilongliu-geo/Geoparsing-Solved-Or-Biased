The population was 21,086 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is a part of the Minneapolis-St. <span class="loc">Paul metropolitan</span> area. Settlers began arriving in Empire Township, in which <span class="loc">Farmington</span> grew, in the early 1850s. The village of <span class="loc">Dakota City</span> began around the intersection of the <span class="loc">Minnesota Central</span>, <span class="loc">Hastings</span>, and Dakota railroads, and also the <span class="loc">Vermillion River</span>. The popular city train station in <span class="loc">Dakota City</span> was <span class="loc">Farmington</span> Station and non-residents began confusing the two names and identifying the town as <span class="loc">Farmington</span>. The town's name was then permanently changed from <span class="loc">Dakota City</span> to <span class="loc">Farmington</span>. The present name was given for the numerous farms near the original town site. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> received its village charter in <span class="date">1872</span> making <span class="loc">Farmington</span> the second oldest community in <span class="loc">Dakota County</span> after the county seat, <span class="loc">Hastings</span>. A notable event in <span class="loc">Farmington</span>'s history is the movement of the <span class="loc">Dakota County</span> Fair to <span class="loc">Farmington</span> in <span class="date">1869</span>. Another event, the Great Fire of <span class="loc">Farmington</span> on <span class="date">November 22, 1879</span>, destroyed several houses, stores, a hotel, and a grain elevator in the current downtown area. <span class="org">Farmington High School</span> graduated its first class in <span class="date">1884</span>. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> was one of the first communities in the <span class="loc">United States</span> to offer rural free mail delivery in <span class="date">1897</span>.</p><br><br>
