  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ilam</span> (pronounced "Eye-lam") is a village in the Staffordshire Peak District, lying on the <span class="loc">River Manifold</span>. The population of the civil parish as taken at the <span class="date">2011</span> census was 402. <span class="loc">Ilam</span> is best known as the location of the neo-Gothic <span class="loc">Ilam</span> Hall, a stately home built in the 1820s, and <span class="date">now</span> a youth hostel owned by the National Trust. It is set in large parklands that are open to visitors. <span class="loc">Ilam</span> is about 4 miles from <span class="loc">Ashbourne</span> at the entrance to the scenic Manifold Valley. <span class="loc">Ilam</span> is very picturesque, with its "Swiss chalet" style houses and matching school house. It also lies close to the popular <span class="loc">Dovedale</span> valley. While most of the buildings in the village are from <span class="date">the past two centuries</span>, <span class="loc">Ilam</span> dates from Saxon times or earlier. Recently the village has attracted praise for its commitment to eco- friendly policies. <span class="loc">Ilam</span> became the first community in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> to phase out incandescent light bulbs, cutting annual carbon emissions by 4 tonnes. The initiative was part of the <span class="org">Ilam Climate Change Project</span>, supported by the Marches Energy Agency.</p><br><br>
