<p><span class="loc">Guanting</span> (Chinese: 官亭; pinyin: Guāntíng) is a town in <span class="loc">eastern Qinghai province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. It is located in the southeast of <span class="loc">Minhe County</span> and, together with <span class="loc">Guanting</span>, <span class="loc">Zhongchuan</span>, <span class="loc">Xiakou</span>, <span class="loc">Gangou</span> and <span class="loc">Xin</span>'er townships, is referred to as the Guanting Area (官亭地区). It is the home to the most densely populated Tu Zu settlement in <span class="loc">China</span>, who refer to the area as "Sanchuan" (三川). The official Chinese name for the area is <span class="loc">Guanting</span> (官亭). Local legends accounted that the name came from the famous general, <span class="loc">Guan Yu</span> (关羽), who stopped by in the area on his way to look for his sworn brother, Liu Bei, the founder of the Shu Han Kingdom (221-263) in the southwest, after having left <span class="loc">Cao Cao</span> of the Cao Wei Kingdom (220-265) in <span class="loc">China</span> proper. The Chinese name "Guan" in <span class="loc">Guanting</span> came from the last name of <span class="loc">Guan Yu</span>, whereas "Ting" came from the Chinese character for "stop" (停) or "pavilion" (亭).</p>
