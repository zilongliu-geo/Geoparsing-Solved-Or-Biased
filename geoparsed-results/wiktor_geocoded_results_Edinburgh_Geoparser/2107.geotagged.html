<p><span class="loc">Salo</span> (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈsɑlo]) is a town and municipality of <span class="loc">Finland</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">province of Western Finland</span> and is part of the <span class="loc">Southwest Finland region</span>. The municipality has a population of 54,243 (June 30, 2015) and covers an area of 2,168.27 square kilometres (837.17 sq mi) of which 181.78 km2 (70.19 sq mi) is water. The population density is 27.31/km2 (70.7/sq mi). <span class="loc">Salo</span> is located between the capital <span class="loc">Helsinki</span> and the provincial capital <span class="loc">Turku</span>, making it a busy small city. The short distance from these bigger cities keeps the <span class="loc">Salo region</span> and its business life growing. Farming also plays a considerable part in the area. Today its main claim to notability is as a developing and manufacturing plant for Nokia, and can therefore be considered as the original home town of Nokia phones. Nokia also is one of biggest employers in this region. In Finnish salo means woodland, backwoods but also a wooded island. It is thought that <span class="loc">Salo</span> has meant the island that over thousand years ago existed to the south of the current town but is today a hill, not even very close to the sea.</p>
