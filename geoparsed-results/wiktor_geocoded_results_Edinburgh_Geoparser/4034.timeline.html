  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Brooklyn is a town in <span class="loc">Windham County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,173 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The town center village is listed by the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> as a census-designated place. The district of <span class="loc">East Brooklyn</span> is also listed as a separate census-designated place. Settled in the 17th century and incorporated as its own town in <span class="date">1786</span>, Brooklyn is <span class="date">now</span> one of the fastest growing towns in <span class="loc">Windham County</span>. It is home to the <span class="loc">Brooklyn Fair</span>, <span class="loc">America</span>'s oldest continuously operating agricultural fair, as well as the Brooklyn Correctional Institution, a state-run medium security prison. Brooklyn is the final resting place of Revolutionary War General <span class="per">Israel Putnam</span>. Though he was originally buried in an above ground tomb in Brooklyn's South Cemetery, his remains had to be moved due to excessive visitors. In <span class="date">1888</span>, a statue of <span class="per">Putnam</span> mounted on a horse was erected, and his sarcophagus placed in the foundation. The statue stands slightly south of the town green, in front of the post office. Brooklyn is also home of the Middle School Bobcats and Elementary School Bears.</p><br><br>
