  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Warren</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Warren County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located along the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> River. The population was 9,710 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Warren County</span>. It is home to the headquarters of the <span class="loc">Allegheny National Forest</span> and the <span class="per">Cornplanter</span> State Forest. It is also the headquarters for the Chief <span class="per">Cornplanter</span> Council, the oldest continuously chartered <span class="org">Boy Scouts of America Council</span>, and the catalog company <span class="loc">Blair</span>. <span class="per">Warren</span> is the principal city of the <span class="per">Warren</span>, <span class="org">PA Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="per">Warren</span> was initially inhabited by Native Americans of the Seneca nation. French explorers had longstanding claims to the area which they acted to secure in an unambiguous fashion with a military-Amerindian expedition in <span class="date">1749</span> that buried a succession of plaques claiming the territory as <span class="loc">France</span>'s in response to the formation of the colonial Ohio Company—and the first of these was buried in <span class="per">Warren</span> but ultimately control was transferred to the British after the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span>. After the Revolutionary War, General <span class="per">William Irvine</span> and <span class="per">Andrew Ellicott</span> were sent to the area to lay out a town in <span class="date">1795</span>. It was named after Major General <span class="per">Joseph Warren</span>. The first permanent structure in <span class="per">Warren</span>, a storehouse built by the Holland Land Company, was completed in <span class="date">1796</span>. <span class="per">Daniel McQuay</span> of <span class="loc">Ireland</span> was the first permanent inhabitant of European descent. Lumber was the main industry from <span class="date">1810</span>–<span class="date">1840</span>, as the abundance of wood and access to water made it profitable to float lumber down the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> River to <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>.</p><br><br>
