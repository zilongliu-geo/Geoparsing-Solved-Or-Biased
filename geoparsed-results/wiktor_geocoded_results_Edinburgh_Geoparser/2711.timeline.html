  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bowen</span> is a town on the eastern coast of <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Bowen</span> had a population of 10,260. <span class="loc">Bowen</span> is located on the north-east coast, in <span class="loc">North Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, at exactly twenty degrees south of the equator. The twentieth parallel crosses the main street. <span class="loc">Bowen</span> is halfway between <span class="loc">Townsville</span> and <span class="loc">Mackay</span>, and 1,130 kilometres (700 mi) by road from <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>. <span class="loc">Bowen</span> sits on a square peninsula, with the <span class="loc">Coral Sea</span> to the north, east, and south. To the south-east is <span class="loc">Port Denison</span>. On the western side, where the peninsula connects with the mainland, the <span class="loc">Don River</span>'s alluvial plain provides fertile soil that supports a prosperous farming industry. The town enjoys a diversified and prosperous economy based on agriculture, fishing, tourism, and mining. Its unusually dry climate for a tropical location, plus its fertile alluvial soil, makes it the ideal place to grow a wide variety of small crops, including tomatoes, rockmelons (i.e., cantaloupes), and capsicums (i.e., green peppers). Outside the alluvial plain, much of the Bowen area is used for beef cattle.</p><br><br>
