  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Elgin</span> /ˈɛldʒᵻn/ is a city in <span class="per">Cook</span> and <span class="per">Kane</span> counties in the northern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. Located roughly 35 mi (56 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, it lies along the <span class="loc">Fox River</span>. As of <span class="date">2013</span>, the city had a total population of 110,145, making it the eighth-largest city in <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The Indian Removal Act of <span class="date">1830</span> and the Black Hawk <span class="org">Indian War</span> of <span class="date">1832</span> led to the expulsion of the Native Americans who had settlements and burial mounds in the area, and set the stage for the founding of <span class="loc">Elgin</span>. Thousands of militiamen and soldiers of Gen. <span class="per">Winfield Scott</span>'s army marched through the <span class="loc">Fox River</span> valley during the war, and accounts of the area's fertile soils and flowing springs soon filtered east. In <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="per">James T. Gifford</span> and his brother <span class="per">Hezekiah Gifford</span> heard tales of this area ripe for settlement, and travelled west. Looking for a site on the stagecoach route from <span class="loc">Chicago</span> to <span class="loc">Galena</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, they eventually settled on a spot where the <span class="loc">Fox River</span> could be bridged. In <span class="date">April 1835</span>, they established the city, naming it after the Scottish tune "Elgin".</p><br><br>
