<p><span class="loc">Raleigh</span> is a town located northwest of <span class="loc">St. Anthony</span>. It had a population of 295 in 1956, declining to 248 by the 2006 census. <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> was originally named <span class="loc">Ha Ha Bay</span>, after the bay where it is located. However, in 1922, the Royal Navy cruiser HMS <span class="loc">Raleigh</span>, the flagship of the North Atlantic &amp; <span class="loc">West Indies</span> squadron, ran aground across the straits in <span class="loc">Labrador</span> and the town of <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> was renamed after the ship. <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> is located about 29 kilometres (18 mi) from <span class="loc">St. Anthony</span>. <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> has a harbour with Burnt Cape on one side to protect against the elements in the very harsh winters - which can see 12.3-metre (40 ft) snowbanks after a winter storm. Winter sports, particularly snowmobiling are a popular activity. With abundant fish in nearby rivers, the <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> area is popular for ice fishing. <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> had a population of 295 in 1956. In the mid-1980s the population grew to as much as 414 with more than 100 school age children. Locals were proud of their community and <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> dominated the local hockey league.</p>
