<p>Maran (Chinese: 马兰) is a district, parliamentary constituency and town in <span class="loc">Pahang</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span> which is surrounded by isolated forest and oil palm plantations. Previously Maran town was a municipality under the administration of the <span class="loc">district of Pekan</span>. In January 1981, Maran town, together with some areas in <span class="loc">Pekan</span> and <span class="loc">Temerloh</span> districts were combined to form the new <span class="loc">Maran district</span>. Maran, as with <span class="loc">Kuantan</span> and most of eastern <span class="loc">Pahang</span>, is not served by any rail line. rapidKuantan buses also do not cover Maran currently. Instead there are Cityliner buses that connect Maran to <span class="loc">Kuantan</span> and <span class="loc">Jerantut</span>. In contrast, going to Maran is much easier by car. The East Coast Expressway  has two exits serving Maran constituency: Exit 825 to Maran and Exit 827 to Sri Jaya. The old Kuala Lumpur-Kuantan federal road  runs through downtown Maran. Highway  connects Maran to <span class="loc">Jerantut</span>. Connection to <span class="loc">Pekan</span>, the royal capital of <span class="loc">Pahang</span> is also possible through a series of state-level roads and then highway . Maran is represented in the Malaysian Parliament by Y.B. Dato' Haji <span class="loc">Abdul Manan</span> bin <span class="loc">Ismail</span> of UMNO. Maran in turn is divided into three state seats in the Pahang State Legislative Assembly:</p>
