<p><span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 118,572. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Anniston</span>. Its name is in honor of John C. Calhoun, famous member of the <span class="loc">United States</span> Senate from <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Anniston-Oxford Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Benton County</span> was established on December 18, 1832, named for Thomas Hart Benton, a member of the <span class="loc">United States</span> Senate from <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, with its county seat at <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span>. Benton, a slave owner, was a political ally of John C. Calhoun, another slaveholder and a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> senator from <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. Through the 1820s-1840s, however, Benton's and Calhoun's political interests diverged, with Calhoun increasingly using secession as a weapon to maintain and expand slavery throughout the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Benton, on the other hand, was slowly coming to the conclusion that slavery was wrong and that preservation of the union was paramount. On January 29, 1858, Alabama supporters of slavery, objecting to Benton's change of heart, renamed <span class="loc">Benton County</span> as <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span>. The county seat was moved to <span class="loc">Anniston</span> after years of controversy and a State <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> ruling in June 1900. An F4 tornado struck here on Palm Sunday March 27, 1994. It destroyed Piedmont's Goshen United Methodist Church twelve minutes after the National Weather Service of <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> issued a tornado warning for northern <span class="loc">Calhoun</span>, southeastern <span class="loc">Etowah</span>, and southern <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>.</p>
