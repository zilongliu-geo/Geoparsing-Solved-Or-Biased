<p>Lamont visits Harwinton supporters. HARWINTON — Former Democratic Senate nominee Ned Lamont appeared at the Harwinton Senior Center Sunday to share his thoughts on President Obama’s first two months in office and the current state of Connecticut’s economy. Speaking to a crowd of around 35 people made up mostly of Harwinton Democratic Town Committee members, Lamont thanked the locals who, he said, supported him so vigorously during his failed but hotly contested Senate run against Joe Lieberman in 2006. “It’s great to see so many friends here,” he said. Notables among the crowd included Harwinton First Selectman Frank Chiaramonte, Litchfield Selectman Marsha Bernstein, Burlington Selectman Richard Miller and Stamford Mayor Dan Malloy.</p>
