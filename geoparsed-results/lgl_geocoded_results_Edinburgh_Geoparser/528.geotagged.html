<p>Lancaster and Lancashire councils offer business help. TWO councils are joining forces to offer financial help to new and existing small businesses in the <span class="loc">Lancaster district</span>. <span class="loc">Lancaster City</span> Council's rent grant scheme and Lancashire County Council's ‘Kickstart’ micro credit scheme both offer help to firms - and can be accessed as a single package. Rent grants can boost new and early stage businesses by offering up to £2,500 or 50 per cent of the first year’s basic rent on premises in the District. To qualify, businesses must have been trading for less than three years, employ no more than 10 full time staff and operate in sectors including manufacturing, new media, the environment, creative industries and community enterprises. Kickstart offers loans up to £5,000 funded by Lancashire County Council’s economic development company. To find out more, call 01524-582279.</p>
