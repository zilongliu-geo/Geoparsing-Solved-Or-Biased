<p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a small city located on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 67 near the intersection with Route D and E in <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span> along the St. <span class="loc">Francis River</span>. The population was 511 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was incorporated and founded as the county seat of <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> in 1819. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was named after Fort Greene <span class="loc">Ville</span> (now <span class="loc">Greenville</span>), <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, the site where General Anthony Wayne signed a treaty with the Native Americans after defeating them in the Battle of <span class="loc">Fallen Timbers</span> on August 20, 1794. This was the final battle of the Northwest Indian War. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> was named for this military hero and <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was named for the place he was most famous for. Incidentally, Fort Greene <span class="loc">Ville</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, was named after Nathaniel Greene, a friend of Wayne. In 1826, <span class="loc">Greenville</span> flooded. On August 10, 1832, the first post office opened. Confederate Brigadier General William J. Hardee and officers Patrick Cleburne, Thomas C. Hindman, and Basil W. Duke along with about 800 men were stationed close to <span class="loc">Greenville</span> near the outset of the Civil War until they began to retreat to <span class="loc">Randolph County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> on August 28, 1861. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was incorporated as a village on February 23, 1893. Several years later in 1941, the village was relocated two miles to the north after the construction of Lake Wappapello.</p>
