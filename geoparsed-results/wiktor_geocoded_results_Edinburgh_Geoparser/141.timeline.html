  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The Town of <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> is a Statutory Town in <span class="loc">Chaffee County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town population was <span class="date">2617</span> at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. The <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River Valley and the area of what would become <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1864</span> by settlers drawn to the area by the plentiful water which made the land suitable for agriculture. By <span class="date">1880</span>, the county seat had moved from Granite to <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span>, but by <span class="date">1928</span> <span class="loc">Salida</span> had a larger population so the county seat was moved once again. By <span class="date">1894</span>, <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> had electricity, telephone service, street lights, parks, cemeteries, and schools. Travelers, speculators, and miners traveling up the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Valley towards <span class="loc">Leadville</span> made <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> a popular stagecoach stop, and railroad depot following the 1890s. While certainly experiencing economic ups and downs, the valley's agricultural economy has made the area more resistant to the 'boom, bust' cycle of mining towns. <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> is located in central <span class="loc">Colorado</span> roughly midway between <span class="loc">Salida</span> and <span class="loc">Leadville</span> in the Upper <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> River Valley at an elevation of 7,965 feet (2,428 m). The area between <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> and <span class="loc">Salida</span> is often referred to as the <span class="loc">Denver</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>, <span class="loc">South Park</span> &amp; Pacific, and <span class="loc">Colorado</span> Midland railroads. Many of the existing buildings of <span class="loc">Buena Vista</span> date back to this era, and were built in the 1880s and 1890s.</p><br><br>
