  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">El Paso</span> is an unincorporated community in southwestern <span class="loc">White County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Its name is Spanish for "the pass", referring to a small gap in the hills on the community's northern edge. Once known as Peach <span class="loc">Orchard Gap</span> in its early settlement, the origin of <span class="loc">El Paso</span>'s Spanish name is unknown. The historic Southwest Trail, a path used by most travelers entering <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> early in the 1800s, entered <span class="loc">El Paso</span> on <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Highway 5 from <span class="loc">Floyd</span>, then headed to <span class="loc">Gibson</span> via <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> Highway 89, Tate's Mill Road and Batesville Pike Road. By the 1830s more than 80 percent of the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> territory's population had entered through the Southwest Trail. The route is also known as the <span class="loc">Old Military Road</span>. The center of <span class="loc">El Paso</span> is located at 35.13, -92.10. Much of the community is situated along <span class="loc">Bull Creek</span>, and along <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> State Highway 5 and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 64. Lacking exact boundaries, the community is located within the borders of <span class="loc">El Paso</span> Township, within <span class="loc">White County</span>. The closest city is <span class="loc">Vilonia</span>, approximately 7 miles to the west of <span class="loc">El Paso</span> via <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 64. <span class="loc">Beebe</span>, where <span class="loc">El Paso</span>'s children attend public schools, is about 13 miles to the east along this highway. Along <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> 5, <span class="loc">Cabot</span> is 15 miles to the south, and the unincorporated community of Romance is 8 miles north.</p><br><br>
