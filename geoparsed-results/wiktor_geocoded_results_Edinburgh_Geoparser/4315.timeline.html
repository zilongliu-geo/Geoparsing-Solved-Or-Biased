  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Prospect is a suburb to the north of the centre of Adelaide, the capital <span class="loc">city of South Australia</span>. Surrounding suburbs include <span class="loc">Kilburn</span>, <span class="loc">Fitzroy</span>, and Medindie. The suburb has boundaries of Main North Road to the East; <span class="per">Carter Street</span>, <span class="loc">Audley</span> <span class="per">Avenue</span> and <span class="per">Avenue</span> Road to the South; The Gawler railway line on the west and a line 400m north of <span class="org">Regency</span> Road (<span class="loc">Livingstone Avenue</span>, <span class="loc">Angwin Avenue</span> and <span class="loc">Henrietta Street</span>) on the north. The suburb features many Victorian era houses, and some stately 19th century mansions, although not as grand as those on <span class="loc">Fitzroy</span> Terrace. The suburb is very appealing to those who want to live near the city, but not in such busy suburbs as <span class="loc">North Adelaide</span> and in the CBD. The Prospect Road Fashion Food and Wine Affair is hosted annually by <span class="org">the City of Prospect</span>. This event allows local traders to showcase their goods and service in the wider community. This event is generally held on the 2nd <span class="date">Sunday</span> in <span class="date">November</span>. <span class="org">The City of Prospect</span> was named as such because it area was seen as a "beautiful prospect" by the gazeteer in <span class="date">1838</span>. In <span class="date">1944</span> the city council voted to adopt the same name for the suburb of Prospect.</p><br><br>
