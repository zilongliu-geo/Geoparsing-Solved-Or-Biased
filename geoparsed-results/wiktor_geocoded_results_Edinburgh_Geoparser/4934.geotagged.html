<p><span class="loc">Carter County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 47,557. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Ardmore</span>. The county was named for Captain Ben W. Carter, a <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> who lived among the <span class="loc">Chickasaw</span>. <span class="loc">Carter County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Ardmore</span>, <span class="loc">OK</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is also a part of the <span class="loc">Texoma region</span>. Prior to statehood, the present <span class="loc">Carter County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, was part of <span class="loc">Pickens County</span> in the <span class="loc">Chickasaw Nation</span> of Indian Territory. After the Civil War, the government of the <span class="loc">United States</span> forced the <span class="loc">Chickasaw</span> government to allow railroads built across its territory. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway (controlled by the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway, AT&amp;SF) built a line north from <span class="loc">Texas</span> to <span class="loc">Purcell</span>. In 1901-1903 the <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> and <span class="loc">Choctaw Railway</span> (acquired by the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway in 1907) built a line from <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> to <span class="loc">Ardmore</span>. Oil production spurred further railroad development. In 1913-14, the <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and Pacific Railway constructed a line from <span class="loc">Ardmore</span> west to <span class="loc">Ringling</span>. In 1916, the <span class="loc">Ringling</span> and Oil Fields Railway laid tracks north from <span class="loc">Ringling Junction</span> to <span class="loc">Healdton</span>. These last two rail lines were abandoned in 1976.</p>
