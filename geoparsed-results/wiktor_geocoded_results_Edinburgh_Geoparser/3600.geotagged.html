<p>George Town is a historical neighbourhood of <span class="loc">Fort Saint George</span> in Chennai (formerly Madras), <span class="loc">India</span>. Also known as Black Town during the colonial period, the settlement was formed after the English constructed the fort and was the first settlement of the <span class="loc">city of Madras</span>, begun soon after the completion of the fort. The name of this area 'Black Town' was renamed as George Town in 1911 in honour of King George V when he was crowned as the Emperor of <span class="loc">India</span>. The name is still in use officially unlike other names that have been changed in the recent times, thus being reminiscent of the colonial past. This is where the modern <span class="loc">city of Madras</span> began its expansion in the 1640s. In 1639, when Francis Day was looking for somewhere to build a fortified warehouse for the English <span class="loc">East India</span> Company, he soon acquired the land where, in 1640, he built the compound named Fort <span class="loc">St George</span>. Soon after it was built, a township began to grow up around it for the natives catering to the needs of the Europeans inside, and this became known as the Black Town. As the city grew, this area became the base for development and construction activities, meeting the needs of people for their livelihood and rulers' administrative comforts. With the construction of one of <span class="loc">India</span>'s major ports in the area, Madras became an important naval base for the British.</p>
