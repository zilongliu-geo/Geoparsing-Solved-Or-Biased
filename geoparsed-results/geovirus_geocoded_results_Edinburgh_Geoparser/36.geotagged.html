<p>The Turkish government has come under fire from officials in <span class="loc">Dogubayazit</span>, where three siblings died from the H5N1 strain of Bird Flu, for not sending enough resources and not responding quickly enough in the region. The mayor of <span class="loc">Dogubayazit</span>, Mukkades Kubilay, claims that the Turkish government sent only three doctors and that there were not enough workers to destroy poultry. The government has been accused of doing too little, too late. H5N1 was discovered in Turkish poultry in December, 2005. Agriculture Minister Mehdi Eker dismissed the claim, saying that culling of infected poultry began immediately following the discovery of H5N1 on December 15, 2005. Questions about whether the government acted aggressively enough early in the outbreak emerged as officials tried to contain the disease, which Eker said had been confirmed in 11 of <span class="loc">Turkey</span>'s 81 provinces and was suspected in 14 others. The number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 in <span class="loc">Turkey</span> is 18. Three of those have died from the virus.</p>
