<p><span class="loc">Bogo</span> (Filipino: Lungsod ng <span class="loc">Bogo</span>; <span class="loc">Cebuano</span>: Dakbayan sa <span class="loc">Bogo</span>;), officially the <span class="loc">City of Bogo</span>, established in 2007, is a sixth income class component city in the <span class="loc">province of Cebu</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 69,911. In the 2013 election, it had 45,468 registered voters. <span class="loc">Bogo</span> is located in the northeastern coast of <span class="loc">Cebu province</span>, on the principal island of Cebu. It is 101 kilometres (63 mi) from <span class="loc">Cebu City</span> and is accessible by land and sea. <span class="loc">Bogo</span> has an area of 103.5 square kilometres (40.0 sq mi), which constitutes 2.3% of the area of Cebu island and 2.1% of the total land area of <span class="loc">Cebu province</span>. The city marches with: <span class="loc">Medellin</span> to the north, <span class="loc">San Remigio</span> to the west, and <span class="loc">Tabogon</span> to the south; on the east it is bound by <span class="loc">Camotes Sea</span>. <span class="loc">Bogo</span> comprises 29 barangays: The year 1600 saw the founding of a real settlement which was subsequently transformed into a barangay with small huts made of cogon grass and bamboo, standing where the Bogo Central Extension now stands. While the barangay was then part of another community in the north (today's town of <span class="loc">Daanbantayan</span>), the natives enjoyed tacit freedom of self-rule although they continued to pay tributes and taxes to the chieftain of <span class="loc">Daanbantayan</span>. This barangay grew in prominence and for this reason, it was separated from <span class="loc">Daanbantayan</span>. In January 1850 the Bishop of Cebu, appointed Spanish friar Fr Jaime Micalot as the first parish priest of <span class="loc">Bogo</span> and decreed <span class="loc">Saint Vincent Ferrer</span> as the town's patron saint.</p>
