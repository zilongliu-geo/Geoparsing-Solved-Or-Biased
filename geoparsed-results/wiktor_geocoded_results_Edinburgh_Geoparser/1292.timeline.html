  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the northwest part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 203,065, making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The county seat is <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>'s 17th county, formed on <span class="date">October 17, 1828</span>, and named for <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, the first President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is part of the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, <span class="loc">AR-MO Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> began as part of the Cherokee Territory, following an <span class="date">1817</span> treaty. The area was next known as <span class="loc">Lovely County</span>, and <span class="date">one year later</span> <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was created after another Cherokee treaty. The court house was centrally located in the <span class="loc">city of Washington</span>, modern-day <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span> (renamed to avoid confusion with <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> in <span class="loc">South Arkansas</span>). The Lee Creek Valley in southern <span class="loc">Washington County</span> contained many of the county's early settlements, including Cane Hill and <span class="loc">Evansville</span>. <span class="org">Arkansas College</span> and Cane Hill College were both founded in <span class="loc">Washington County</span> within <span class="date">a day</span> of each other in <span class="date">1834</span>, with the <span class="org">University of Arkansas</span> being founded in <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span> in <span class="date">1871</span>. The county witnessed major battles during the American Civil War, including the Battle of <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span>, <span class="org">the Battle of Prairie Grove</span>, and <span class="org">the Battle of Cane Hill</span>. The county then was sparsely settled and many residents were pro-Union, since slaves were few, plantations almost nonexistent, and news came via <span class="loc">White River</span> travelers, not from the southern part of the state. <span class="per">A Butterfield</span> Overland Mail route was established through the county in <span class="date">1858</span>, causing more families to settle there.</p><br><br>
