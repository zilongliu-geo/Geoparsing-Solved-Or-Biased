<p><span class="loc">Melrose</span> is a city located in the Greater <span class="loc">Boston metropolitan</span> area in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Its population as per the 2010 United States Census is 26,983. It is a suburb located approximately seven miles north of <span class="loc">Boston</span> and is situated in the center of the triangle created by Interstates 93, 95 and <span class="loc">US</span> Route 1. The land that comprises <span class="loc">Melrose</span> was first explored in 1628 and was once part of <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> and then <span class="loc">Malden</span>. It became the Town of <span class="loc">Melrose</span> in 1850 and then the <span class="loc">City of Melrose</span> in 1900. <span class="loc">Melrose</span> was originally called "Ponde Fielde" for its abundance of ponds and streams or "Mystic Side" because of its location in a valley north of the <span class="loc">Mystic River</span>. The area was first explored by Richard and Ralph <span class="loc">Sprague</span> in 1628, and became part of <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> in 1633 along with a large area of land encompassing most of the surrounding communities. In 1649, the neighborhood of <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> known as <span class="loc">Malden</span> was incorporated as a separate town; the new town of <span class="loc">Malden</span> included most of present-day <span class="loc">Melrose</span> (then called <span class="loc">North Malden</span>) within its borders. <span class="loc">North Malden</span> largely remained a lightly populated farming community.</p>
