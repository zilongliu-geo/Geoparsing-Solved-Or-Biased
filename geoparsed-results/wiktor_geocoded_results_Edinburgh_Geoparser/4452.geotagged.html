<p><span class="loc">Entroncamento</span> (Portuguese pronunciation: [ẽtɾõkɐˈmẽtu]) is a Portuguese municipality in <span class="loc">district of Santarém</span> in the Médio Tejo Subregion (Middle <span class="loc">Tagus</span>) of the <span class="loc">Centro Region</span>. The population in 2011 was 20,206, in an area of 13.73 km². Situated in the Ribatejo, it benefits from its geo-strategic position along the <span class="loc">Tagus</span> Valley, with important accessibility to the motorways and railway-lines that historically proportioned its growth and expansion. <span class="loc">Entroncamento</span> originated in the middle of the 19th century, with the birth of the national railway network, as a simple train-stop, from two small railway construction camps: Casal das Vaginhas and Casal das <span class="loc">Gouveias</span>. The majority of the early rail workers/settlers were foreign, coming from different countries throughout <span class="loc">Europe</span>, but eventually workers from <span class="loc">Beira Baixa</span> and <span class="loc">Alentejo</span> moved to the region. Its toponimc name <span class="loc">Entroncamento</span> literally mean junction, owing to being the junction of the two railway lines that developed in 1864: the <span class="loc">Linha</span> do <span class="loc">Norte</span> (Northern Line) and the <span class="loc">Linha</span> do Leste (Eastern Line). Hinged between its links with the east and <span class="loc">Beira Baixa</span>, the station at <span class="loc">Entroncamento</span>, for many decades, was the obligatory stop that moved goods and people to the north and east. During this time, many celebrated travellers from <span class="loc">Europe</span> used the Eastern, dining in the station en route, such as the literary celebrates Hans Christian Andersen, Ramalho Ortigão, Eça de Queiroz, Alberto <span class="loc">Pimentel</span>, Luísa de <span class="loc">Freitas</span> Lomelino and Eduardo Meneres. Political leaders also became frequent visitors both before and after the 25 April Revolution, such as João Chagas, politician and journalist, who travelled to <span class="loc">Lisbon</span> in order to assume the direction of the new government, after the dictatorship of General Pimenta de <span class="loc">Castro</span>. For a long time, the two settlements were divided between two neighbouring municipalities, because the rail-line itself determined its boundary. To the west of the lines were the <span class="loc">parishes of Santiago</span> (in <span class="loc">Torres Novas</span>) and to the east the territory was part of the parish of <span class="loc">Nossa Senhora</span> da Assunção da <span class="loc">Atalaia</span> (municipality of <span class="loc">Vila Nova da Barquinha</span>). The small settlement continued to growing, owing to the development of rail transport and support structures, later the installation of military quarters (after 1916) determined the geographic accessibility, resulting in further influx of families.</p>
