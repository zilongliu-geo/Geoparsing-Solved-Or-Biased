<p><span class="loc">Rosario</span> is a first class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Batangas</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 105,561 people. <span class="loc">Rosario</span> is also considered as among the interior municipalities of the <span class="loc">Batangas Bay</span> Region comprising eleven municipalities and two cities whose catchment areas drain into the <span class="loc">Batangas Bay</span>. The town is also dubbed as "The Rice Granary of <span class="loc">Batangas</span>". Accounts show that the origin of <span class="loc">Rosario</span> was a Christian settlement along the coast of Lobo. The settlement became prey to the pirate raids during the <span class="loc">Moro</span> wars of the 18th century. The <span class="loc">Moro</span> or pirate raids forced the inhabitants of the settlement to the safety of the ravine and forest on the north-west bank of <span class="loc">Kansahayan</span> River (now the Municipality of <span class="loc">Taysan</span>). Here the settlement was relocated. However, at the height of the <span class="loc">Moro</span> Wars in the second half of the 18th century, the <span class="loc">Moro</span> vicious <span class="loc">Moro</span> raids did reach <span class="loc">Kansahayan</span>. In one of their forays the Parish Priest is said to be among those slain. The inhabitants decided to leave <span class="loc">Kansahayan</span>. They headed farther north holding a novena and praying the rosary in the process of their flight. On the 9th night of the novena, the fleeing inhabitants reached the river bank of Tubig ng <span class="loc">Bayan</span> (a river originating from <span class="loc">Lipa</span>) in now the town of <span class="loc">Padre Garcia</span>. Here they finally settled. Living in peace and prosperity, the grateful townâ€™s people erected a stone church south of the river bank in honor of their benefactress, the Lady of the Most <span class="loc">Holy Rosary Parish</span>. The town was named <span class="loc">Sto</span>. <span class="loc">Rosario</span>.</p>
