  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alameda was a city in <span class="loc">Bannock County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Alameda was established as a village in <span class="date">1924</span> at the consolidation of the villages of <span class="loc">Fairview</span> and <span class="loc">North Pocatello</span> which were platted on the northern boundary of the town of Pocatello in <span class="date">1911</span> and <span class="date">1914</span> respectively. New commercial and residential development in Alameda occurred in part as a result of its proximity to Pocatello and to a greater degree its location on the Yellowstone Highway (later designated <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 91), one of <span class="loc">Idaho</span>'s first designated highways. By <span class="date">1930</span> the village exceeded its predessor villages' <span class="date">1920</span> population by 144%. In just under <span class="date">40 years</span> of history, the village became <span class="loc">Idaho</span>'s 11th most populous City. It was consolidated with Pocatello in <span class="date">1962</span> with the support of its mayor, <span class="per">George V. Hansen</span>. Another nearby city, <span class="loc">Chubbuck</span>, opposed a similar merger and remained a separate municipality. Among its other businesses, Alameda had four pharmacies: Grand Central Pharmacy (300 block of Jefferson), Poleline Drug (Poleline Road), Alameda Pharmacy (375 <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span>) and Hiway Drug (320 <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span>).</p><br><br>
