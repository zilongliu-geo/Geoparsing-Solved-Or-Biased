  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recalled 380 million eggs and the number is expected to grow, after around 300 in <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, and <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> and 2,000 nationwide became infected with salmonella after eating eggs distributed by <span class="loc">Wright County</span> Eggs. The contaminated eggs were sold under the labels Lucerne, <span class="loc">Albertson</span>, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma's, Sunshine, <span class="loc">Hillandale</span>, Trafficanda, Farm Fresh, <span class="loc">Shoreland</span>, <span class="loc">Lund</span>, Dutch Farms, <span class="loc">Kemps</span>, <span class="loc">Bayview</span>, Mountain Dairy, <span class="per">NuLay</span> and <span class="per">Sun</span> Valley. Eggs have been sold in seventeen states. <span class="loc">Wright County</span> Egg's owner has been previously cited for breaking environmental laws. In response to the outbreak the FDA deployed an initial team of ten investigators to <span class="loc">Wright County</span> Egg in <span class="loc">Iowa</span> to inspect the farms and determine the source of the contamination. Although no official statement has been issued, it is believed animals including birds and rodents defecated where food for chickens is stored. The outbreak is believed to have started in <span class="date">early July</span>, around the time new federal regulations to prevent salmonella contamination of eggs took effect. According to the FDA, the symptoms of salmonella infection includes fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.</p><br><br>
