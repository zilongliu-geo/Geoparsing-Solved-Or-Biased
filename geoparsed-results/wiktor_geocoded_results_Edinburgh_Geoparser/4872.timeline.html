  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ferndale</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Whatcom County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 11,415 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. First settled in <span class="date">1872</span>, <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> was given its name because of the ferns that once grew around the original school house. <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> was originally called Jam because the town was located next to a log jam on the <span class="loc">Nooksack River</span>. The original schoolteacher decided it needed a more picturesque name. <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> was officially incorporated on <span class="date">March 19, 1907</span>. One colorful figure in Ferndale’s pioneer past is “Blanket Bill” <span class="loc">Jarman</span> (<span class="date">1820</span>-<span class="date">1912</span>) who was once ransomed for a stack of blankets (<span class="date">1848</span>?) and acquitted of homicide (<span class="date">1871</span>). He is buried in Ferndale’s Woodlawn Cemetery. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.69 square miles (17.33 km2), of which, 6.61 square miles (17.12 km2) is land and 0.08 square miles (0.21 km2) is water. Downtown Ferndale is located near the river, along with <span class="loc">Griffintown</span> and a largely industrial area east of the <span class="loc">Nooksack River</span>. Northwest of these areas are suburban developments.</p><br><br>
