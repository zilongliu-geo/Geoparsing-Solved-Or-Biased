<p><span class="loc">Arlington</span> is a former manor, village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">North Devon</span> <span class="loc">district of Devon</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. The parish includes the villages of <span class="loc">Arlington</span> and <span class="loc">Arlington Beccott</span>. The population of the parish is 98 (2001 census). <span class="loc">Arlington Court</span>, long owned by the <span class="loc">Chichester</span> family, lords of the manor since the 14th century, is now owned by the National Trust and home to the Trust's collection of over 50 historic horse-drawn carriages. Victoria Cross holder Sir Mark Walker resided in <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, dying there in 1902. The manor of "Alferdintone" (<span class="loc">Arlington</span>) was listed in the Exeter Domesday Book of 1086 as held by "Alvred de Ispania" (Alfred of <span class="loc">Spain</span>) as a tenant-in-chief of the king. The estate of <span class="loc">Twitchen</span>, now a farm within <span class="loc">Arlington parish</span>, was stated to have been added to the manor of <span class="loc">Arlington</span>. Alfred also held <span class="loc">Orway</span>, and held no other lands in <span class="loc">Devon</span>. It later was acquired by the de <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> family, lords of the manor of <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> in the <span class="loc">parish of Pilton</span>. For the descent of the lands of the de <span class="loc">Raleigh</span> family to the <span class="loc">Chichester</span> family see <span class="loc">Raleigh</span>.</p>
