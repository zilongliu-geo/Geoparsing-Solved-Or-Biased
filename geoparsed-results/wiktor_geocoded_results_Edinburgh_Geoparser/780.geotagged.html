<p>Riverside is an unincorporated community in northeastern <span class="loc">Clark County</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Virgin River</span> near <span class="loc">Bunkerville</span> and Mesquite; the town is accessible via <span class="loc">Nevada</span> State Route 170, which connects all three towns. Riverside is the site of the highway bridge over the river. Riverside is located on the route of the The Old Spanish Trail, that entered the <span class="loc">Virgin River</span> Valley after crossing the Beaver <span class="loc">Dam</span> Mountains, reaching the river at what is now <span class="loc">Littlefield</span> and passed down river past the site of Riverside to the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> where it turned west. After 1847, avoid quicksands and marshes along the <span class="loc">Virgin River</span> that bogged down wagons, the wagon road called the Mormon Road that followed the Old Spanish Trail in many places, passed through the site of Riverside where it turned north, away from the old route, climbing toward Virgin Hill where it turned west to ascend a steep narrow ridge to the top of <span class="loc">Mormon Mesa</span>. The road then crossed <span class="loc">Mormon Mesa</span> to the <span class="loc">Muddy River</span> crossing it opposite the mouth of <span class="loc">California Wash</span>, west of modern <span class="loc">Glendale</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span> and continued up that wash to <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> Springs.</p>
