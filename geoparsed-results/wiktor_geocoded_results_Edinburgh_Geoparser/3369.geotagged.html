<p>Sucre (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsukɾe]), also known historically as Charcas [ˈtʃarkas], <span class="loc">La Plata</span> [la ˈplata] and Chuquisaca [tʃikiˈsaka] (population 247,300 in 2006), is the constitutional capital of <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>, the capital of the Chuquisaca Department, and the 6th most populated city in <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>. Located in the south-central part of the country, Sucre lies at an elevation of 2,810 meters (9,214 feet). This relatively high altitude gives the city a cool temperate climate year-round. On November 30, 1538, Sucre was founded under the name Ciudad de la Plata de la <span class="loc">Nueva</span> <span class="loc">Toledo (City</span> of Silver of New <span class="loc">Toledo</span>) by Pedro Anzures, Marqués de <span class="loc">Campo Redondo</span>. In 1559, the Spanish King Philip II established the Audiencia de Charcas in <span class="loc">La Plata</span> with authority over an area which covers what is now <span class="loc">Paraguay</span>, southeastern <span class="loc">Peru</span>, <span class="loc">Northern Chile</span> and <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, and much of <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>. The Audiencia de Charcas was a subdivision of the Viceroyalty of <span class="loc">Peru</span> until 1776, when it was transferred to the newly created Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. In 1601 the Recoleta Monastery was founded by the Franciscans and in 1609 an archbishopric was founded in the city. In 1624 St Francis Xavier University of <span class="loc">Chuquisaca</span> was founded.</p>
