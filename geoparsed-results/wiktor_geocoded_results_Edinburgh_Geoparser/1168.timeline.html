  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Costa Rica</span> (/ˌkoʊstə ˈriːkə/; Spanish: [ˈkosta ˈrika]; literally meaning, "Rich Coast"), officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Costa Rica</span> (Spanish: República de <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span>), is a country in Central <span class="loc">America</span>, bordered by <span class="loc">Nicaragua</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Panama</span> to the southeast, the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> to the west, the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span> to the east, and <span class="loc">Ecuador</span> to the south of <span class="loc">Cocos Island</span>. It has a population of around 4.5 million, of whom nearly a quarter live in the metropolitan area of the capital and largest city, <span class="per">San José</span>. <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span> was sparsely inhabited by indigenous people before coming under Spanish rule in the 16th century. It remained a peripheral colony of the empire until independence as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire, followed by membership in the <span class="loc">United Provinces</span> of Central <span class="loc">America</span>, from which it formally declared sovereignty in <span class="date">1847</span>. Since then, <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span> has remained among the most stable, prosperous, and progressive nations in Latin <span class="loc">America</span>. Following a brief but bloody civil war, it permanently abolished its army in <span class="date">1949</span>, becoming the first of only a few sovereign nations without a standing army.</p><br><br>
