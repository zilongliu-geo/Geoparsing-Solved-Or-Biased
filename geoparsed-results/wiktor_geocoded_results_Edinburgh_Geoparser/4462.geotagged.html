<p><span class="loc">Jiexiu</span> (Chinese: 介休; pinyin: Jièxiū) is a county-level city of south-central <span class="loc">Shanxi province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. It is under the administration of <span class="loc">Jinzhong City</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Jiexiu</span> was established by <span class="loc">Chong</span>'er, Duke Wen of <span class="loc">Jin</span>, during the Spring and Autumn period to commemorate his retainer Jie Zitui, who had loyally followed him during his years of exile. Supposedly, he once even cut meat from his own thigh to provide <span class="loc">Chong</span>'er with soup. Once <span class="loc">Chong</span>'er was enthroned as duke, however, Jie considered his services no longer required and resigned. Although Duke Wen was generous in rewarding those who had helped him in his time of need, he long passed over Jie, who had moved into the forest with his mother. Duke Wen went to the forest in 636 BC but could not find them. He then ordered his men to set fire to the forest in order to force Jie out. When Jie and his mother were killed instead, the duke was overcome with remorse and ordered three days without fire to honor Jie's memory. The city erected over the former forest is called <span class="loc">Jiexiu</span>, meaning "Jie's rest".</p>
