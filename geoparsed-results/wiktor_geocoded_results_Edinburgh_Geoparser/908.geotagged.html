<p><span class="loc">Hampton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 14,976 at the 2010 census. Located beside the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>, <span class="loc">Hampton</span> is home to <span class="loc">Hampton</span> Beach, a summer tourist destination. The densely populated central settlement of the town, where 9,656 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the <span class="loc">Hampton</span> census-designated place (CDP) and is centered on the intersection of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 1 and NH 27. First called the Plantation of Winnacunnet, <span class="loc">Hampton</span> was one of four original <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> townships chartered by the General Court of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, which then held authority over the colony. "Winnacunnet" is an Algonquian Abenaki word meaning "pleasant pines" and is the name of the town's high school, serving students from <span class="loc">Hampton</span> and surrounding towns. In March 1635, Richard Dummer and John Spencer of the <span class="loc">Byfield</span> section in <span class="loc">Newbury</span>, came round in their shallop, came ashore at the landing and were much impressed by the location. Dummer, who was a member of the General Court, got that body to lay its claim to the section and plan a plantation here. The Massachusetts General Court of March 3, 1636 ordered that Dummer and Spencer be given power to "To presse men to build there a Bound house".</p>
