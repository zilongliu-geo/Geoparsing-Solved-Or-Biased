<p>Columbia is a town in <span class="loc">Houston County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Dothan</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. At the 2010 census the population was 740, down from 804 in 2000. Founded in 1820, Columbia served as a major trading center for communities throughout the <span class="loc">Wiregrass Region</span> of <span class="loc">Alabama</span> between 1822-1833, which coincided as its time as <span class="loc">Henry County</span> seat. <span class="loc">Henry County</span> which then comprised portions of present day Covington, Dale, <span class="loc">Barbour</span>, Coffee, <span class="loc">Crenshaw</span>, Bullock, <span class="loc">Geneva</span>, and <span class="loc">Houston counties</span>. It lost the county seat status to <span class="loc">Abbeville</span> in 1833. Bordering the State of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and the <span class="loc">Chattahoochee River</span>, Columbia was a major port-of-call for steamboats and was known to many as "Old Columbia". The town was incorporated on April 29, 1880 and was the center of education, culture, commerce, and trade. Columbia was the largest town in the area during the 19th century and remains one of the area's oldest continuously operating municipalities. Columbia received its first cotton textile mill in 1891 and its first electric plant in 1892. A branch of the <span class="loc">Henry County</span> Courthouse was located here from 1889 until <span class="loc">Columbia</span> became part of <span class="loc">Houston County</span> in 1903. Columbia got electric street lights in 1900 and its first electric utility company in 1914.</p>
