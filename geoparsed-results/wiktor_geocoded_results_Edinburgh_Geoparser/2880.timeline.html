  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wamba</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Haut-Uele District</span> of the <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>. It is the administrative center of the Wamba Territory. The area around <span class="loc">Wamba</span> consists of a rainforest-derived mosaic of dry, swamp, and secondary forest, with cultivated fields. Altitude is between 370 metres (1,210 ft) and 430 metres (1,410 ft). Annual rainfall is around 2,000 millimetres (79 in). Both <span class="loc">Wamba</span> and nearby <span class="loc">Mungbere</span> are inaccessible due to the very poor roads in the region. The Apostolic Vicariate of <span class="loc">Wamba</span> was established in <span class="date">1949</span> and was promoted to the <span class="loc">Diocese of Wamba</span> in <span class="date">1959</span>. During the Simba Rebellion, in <span class="date">December 1964</span> rebels held 250 white hostages in <span class="loc">Wamba</span>. Two mercenary rescue columns reached the town at <span class="date">the end of the year</span>. They found that 28 whites had been brutally killed, mostly Belgians, including the <span class="per">Bishop Monsignor Joseph-Pierre Albert Wittebols</span>. 121 whites were still alive, mainly Greeks who had provided cash and cooperated with the rebels in exchange for their lives. The town is home to a station of the <span class="org">Centre</span> de Recherche en Ecologie et <span class="loc">Forestiere</span>. Many of the people in these towns rely for their livelihoods on the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, a World Heritage Site. The reserve is home to the rare Okapi species, a relative of the giraffe. Efforts have been made to train the people in alternate ways to make a living and to educate them in the importance of conservation.</p><br><br>
