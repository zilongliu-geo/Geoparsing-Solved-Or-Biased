  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">House</span> passes bill taxing bonuses for AIG, others. <span class="loc">WASHINGTON</span> — Denouncing a “squandering of the people’s money,” lawmakers voted decisively <span class="date">Thursday</span> to impose a 90 percent tax on millions of dollars in employee bonuses paid by troubled insurance giant AIG and other bailed-out companies. The <span class="org">House</span> vote was 328-93. Similar legislation has been introduced in <span class="org">the Senate</span> and President <span class="per">Barack Obama</span> quickly signaled general support for the concept. “I look forward to receiving a final product that will serve as a strong signal to the executives who run these firms that such compensation will not be tolerated,” the president said in a statement. <span class="org">House</span> Speaker <span class="per">Nancy Pelosi</span>, D-Calif, told colleagues, “We want our money back <span class="date">now</span> for the taxpayers. It isn’t that complicated.” The outcome may not have been complicated. But the lopsided vote failed to reflect the contentious political battle that preceded it. Republicans took Democrats to task for rushing to tax AIG bonuses worth an estimated $165 million after the majority party stripped from <span class="date">last month</span>’s economic stimulus bill a provision that could have banned such payouts. “This political circus that’s going on here <span class="date">today</span> with this bill is not getting to the bottom of the questions of who knew what and when did they know it,” said <span class="org">House</span> Republican Leader <span class="per">John Boehner</span> of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. He voted “no,” but 85 fellow Republicans joined 243 Democrats in voting “yes.” It was opposed by six Democrats and 87 Republicans. The bill would impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses given to employees with family incomes above $250,000 at American International Group and other companies that have received at least $5 billion in government bailout money. It would apply to any such bonuses issued since <span class="date">Dec. 31</span>. The <span class="org">House</span> vote, after just 40 minutes of debate, showed how quickly Congress can act when the political will is there. It was only this <span class="date">past weekend</span> that the bailed-out insurance giant paid bonuses totaling $165 million to employees, including traders in the Financial Products unit that nearly brought about AIG’s collapse. AIG has received $182.5 billion in federal bailout money and is <span class="date">now</span> 80 percent government owned. Disclosure of the bonuses touched off a national firestorm that both the <span class="per">Obama</span> administration and Congress have scurried to contain. In a statement issued by the White <span class="org">House</span> <span class="date">late Thursday</span>, <span class="per">Obama</span> said the <span class="org">House</span> vote “rightly reflects the outrage that so many feel over the lavish bonuses that AIG provided its employees at the expense of the taxpayers who have kept this failed company afloat. ”“In the end, this is a symptom of a larger problem — a bubble-and-bust economy that valued reckless speculation over responsibility and hard work,” he said. “That is what we must ultimately repair to build a lasting and widespread prosperity.” Topic No. 1 raised by Republicans during the <span class="org">House</span> debate was the last-minute altering of a provision in <span class="per">Obama</span>’s $787 billion stimulus law to cap executive compensation for firms receiving government bailouts. The measure might have forestalled payment of the AIG bonuses. But Senate Banking Committee Chairman <span class="per">Chris Dodd</span>, a Connecticut Democrat and the author of the provision, says the administration insisted that he modify his proposal so that it would only apply to payments agreed to in <span class="date">the future</span>. That, critics claim, cleared the way for the AIG payouts. “The idea came from the administration,” <span class="per">Dodd</span> said ThursdayDodd said he was not aware of any AIG bonuses at the time the change was made. Treasury Secretary <span class="per">Timothy Geithner</span> confirmed such conversations with <span class="per">Dodd</span>. He said the administration was worried about possible legal challenges to the provision. “We expressed concern about this specific version,” <span class="per">Geithner</span> said in an interview with <span class="org">CNN</span>. “But we also worked with him to strengthen the overall bill.” The treasury secretary, who has been criticized for not learning of the AIG bonus payments sooner since he helped orchestrate the bailout <span class="date">last year</span> as president of the <span class="loc">New York</span> Fed, said anew in the interview that he was not informed of the bonuses until <span class="date">last week</span>. “And as soon as I heard about the full scale of these things, we moved very actively to explore every possible legal avenue to address this problem,” <span class="per">Geithner</span> said. A similar — but not as punitive — bill to recoup bonus payments with taxes was gaining support in <span class="org">the Senate</span>. It would impose a 35 percent excise tax on the companies paying the bonuses and a 35 percent tax on the employees receiving them. The taxes would apply to all companies receiving government bailout money, but they are clearly geared toward AIG. “This is not just another case of runaway corporate greed and arrogance, ripping off shareholders by excesses lavished around the executive suite,” said Rep. <span class="per">Earl Pomeroy</span>, D-N.D. “These bonuses represent a squandering of the people’s money. ... Starting right here, right <span class="date">now</span>, we are saying no more.” <span class="org">The Senate</span> measure is sponsored by Sen. <span class="per">Max Baucus</span> of Montana, the chairman of <span class="org">the Senate</span> Finance Committee, and the panel’s senior Republican, <span class="per">Chuck Grassley</span> of <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. It was expected to be brought to <span class="org">the Senate</span> floor <span class="date">next week</span>. Meanwhile, <span class="loc">New York</span>’s attorney general, <span class="per">Andrew Cuomo</span>, said AIG has given him the list of employees who received a total of $165 million in retention bonuses. <span class="per">Cuomo</span> said he won’t release any employees’ names until his office has answered any security concerns raised by the AIG employees. He also said he will work with AIG in the coming <span class="date">days</span> to determine which workers have decided to return the payments. <span class="per">Cuomo</span> had sought the names from AIG chief executive <span class="per">Edward Liddy</span> through a subpoena. The deadline was <span class="date">Thursday</span>. About 400 AIG employees and future employees received bonuses, but not all of them earned over the $250,000 family income threshold specified by the <span class="org">House</span> bill. <span class="per">Obama</span> administration special envoy <span class="per">Richard Holbooke</span> was on AIG’s board of directors in <span class="date">early 2008</span>, when the insurance company committed to the bonuses, and during the previous <span class="date">years</span> of aggressive investment strategies that brought the firm to brink of collapse. White <span class="org">House</span> spokesman <span class="per">Tommy Vietor</span> said <span class="date">Thursday</span>: “<span class="per">Mr. Holbrooke</span> had nothing to do with and knew nothing about the bonuses.” While the <span class="org">House</span> legislation calls for a 90 percent tax, Rep. <span class="per">Charles Rangel</span>, D-N.Y., chairman of the tax-writing <span class="org">House</span> Ways and Means Committee, said he expected local and state governments to take the remaining 10 percent of the bonuses. <span class="per">Rangel</span> said the bill would apply to mortgage giants <span class="per">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="per">Freddie Mac</span>, among others, while excluding community banks and other smaller companies that have received less bailout money. “The American people demand protection and that’s what we’re doing <span class="date">today</span>,” he told the <span class="org">House</span>.</p><br><br>
