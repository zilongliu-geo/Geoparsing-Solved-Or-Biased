  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greenwich</span> is a Canadian rural community located in <span class="loc">eastern Kings County</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>. It was previously known as <span class="loc">Noggins</span> Corner, as travelers could procure a noggin of rum at a local public house. The community is bordered to the south by the <span class="loc">Wolfville</span> Ridge, immediately west of the town of <span class="per">Wolfville</span> and east of the village of <span class="per">New Minas</span>. It is also bordered on the north by the south bank of the <span class="loc">Cornwallis River</span>, opposite the village of <span class="loc">Port Williams</span>. In <span class="date">1910</span> the present church opened in <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> as a Methodist meeting house. In <span class="date">1925</span> it became part of the <span class="per">United Church</span> of <span class="loc">Canada</span> and is <span class="date">now</span> part of the pastoral charge of <span class="loc">St Andrews</span>, <span class="loc">Wolfville</span>. The community has hosted <span class="org">Horton High School</span> in two different locations since <span class="date">1959</span>. <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> has a population of approximately 300 people. Water, sewer, hydrant, streetlights, bus transit and sidewalk services make this hamlet a desirable rural residential area within easy access of both New <span class="per">Minas</span> and <span class="per">Wolfville</span>. <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> is also served by a volunteer fire department. <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> has been primarily agricultural in nature since being first settled by families including the <span class="per">Bishop</span> and <span class="per">Forsyth</span> families, who settled here in <span class="date">1760</span> as New <span class="loc">England</span> Planters; both of these families still farm in <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> <span class="date">today</span>. Five farm markets in this small community make it the destination of choice for in-season produce in <span class="loc">Kings County</span>. Hennigar's, one of the oldest farm markets in the province, opened in <span class="date">1921</span>. <span class="loc">Noggins</span> Corner Farm Market is on the site of Timothy and <span class="per">William Bishop</span>'s farm and is run by members of the Bishop family.</p><br><br>
