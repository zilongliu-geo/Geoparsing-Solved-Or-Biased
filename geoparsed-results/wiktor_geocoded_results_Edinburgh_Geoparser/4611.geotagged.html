<p><span class="loc">Douglas County</span> is the seventh-most populous of the 64 counties of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 285,465. The county seat is <span class="loc">Castle Rock</span>. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> is part of the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is located midway between Colorado's two largest cities, <span class="loc">Denver</span> and <span class="loc">Colorado Springs</span>. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> has the highest median household income of any <span class="loc">Colorado county</span> or statistical equivalent. It is ranked ninth nationally in that category, and has the highest of any county or equivalent not in the northeastern <span class="loc">US</span>. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> is lightly wooded, mostly with ponderosa pine, with broken terrain characterized by mesas, foothills and small streams. <span class="loc">Cherry Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Plum Creek</span> rise in <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> and flow north toward <span class="loc">Denver</span> and into the <span class="loc">South Platte River</span>. Both were subject to flash flooding in the past, <span class="loc">Plum Creek</span> being partially responsible for the <span class="loc">Denver</span> flood of 1965. <span class="loc">Cherry Creek</span> is now dammed. Most residents commute to workplaces elsewhere in the metropolitan area outside of the county. Suburban development is displacing the ranching economy of the county.</p>
