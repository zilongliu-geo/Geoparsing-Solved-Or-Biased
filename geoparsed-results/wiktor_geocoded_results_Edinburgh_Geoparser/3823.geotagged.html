<p><span class="loc">Luzhou</span> (simplified Chinese: 泸州; traditional Chinese: 瀘州; pinyin: Lúzhōu; Sichuanese Pinyin: Nu2zou1; Luzhou dialect: [nu˨˩tsəu˥]), formerly transliterated as <span class="loc">Lu-chou</span> or <span class="loc">Luchow</span>, is a prefecture-level city located in the southeast of <span class="loc">Sichuan Province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>. The city, named Jiangyang until the Southern and Northern Dynasties, is known as the "wine city". Situated at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Tuo River</span> and the <span class="loc">Yangtze River</span>, <span class="loc">Luzhou</span> is not only an important port on the Yangtze river, but also the largest port in both size and output in <span class="loc">Sichuan province</span> since <span class="loc">Chongqing</span> seceded from <span class="loc">Sichuan province</span> in 1997. At the 2010 census its population was 4,218,427 inhabitants whom 919,832 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of Jiangyang and Longmatan districts, as <span class="loc">Naxi district</span> isn't conurbated yet. <span class="loc">Luzhou</span>, which borders <span class="loc">Yunnan</span>, <span class="loc">Guizhou</span> and <span class="loc">Chongqing</span>, is the only geographic junction of the four provinces, and was therefore the logical place for a port in ancient <span class="loc">China</span>. After the PRC was founded in 1949, <span class="loc">Luzhou</span> became the capital of <span class="loc">southern Sichuan province</span>. In 1983, <span class="loc">Luzhou</span> was approved as a prefecture-level city administratively.</p>
