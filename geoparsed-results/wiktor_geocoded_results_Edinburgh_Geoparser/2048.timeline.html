  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hobart</span> is a city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Kiowa County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was named for <span class="per">Garret Hobart</span>, the twenty-fourth Vice President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,756 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, a decline of 6.0 percent from 3,997 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is served by <span class="org">Hobart Regional Airport</span>. It also has 2 museums: the <span class="per">General Tommy</span> Franks Museum and the <span class="org">Kiowa County Museum</span>. The present town of <span class="per">Hobart</span> began almost overnight on <span class="date">August 6, 1901</span>, when lots on the former Kiowa-Apache-Comanche Reservation in southern <span class="loc">Oklahoma Territory</span> were put up for sale. It quickly became the residence of 2936 people, mostly living in tents. Initially, the town was nicknamed <span class="loc">Ragtown</span>. Wooden structures replaced tents as fast as possible. By <span class="date">1903</span>, <span class="per">Hobart</span> had electric lights, an ice plant, and some large wholesale businesses. It also had a wooden courthouse. It developed into a town whose economy was based on the production of cotton. At statehood in <span class="date">November 1907</span>, <span class="per">Hobart</span> had a population of <span class="date">2936</span>. <span class="per">Hobart</span>'s population declined to <span class="date">2936</span> in <span class="date">1920</span>, but resumed growing for <span class="date">several years</span> afterward. In <span class="date">1930</span>, the population was 4982. In <span class="date">1950</span>, it reached a peak of 5380. Thereafter, the town population went into a long-term decline that has continued to the present. In the <span class="date">1950</span> water supply in the area was improved with a series of reservoirs; the town is connected by aqueduct to <span class="loc">Lake Hobart</span> several kilometres to the north.</p><br><br>
