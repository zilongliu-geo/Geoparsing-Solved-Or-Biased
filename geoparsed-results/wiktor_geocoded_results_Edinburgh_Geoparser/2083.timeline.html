  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Boya</span> is a locality on the Darling Scarp, in the Shire of <span class="loc">Mundaring</span>, Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>. On the south side of <span class="loc">Greenmount</span> Hill, and just west of <span class="loc">Darlington</span>. The name of <span class="loc">Boya</span> was not a local Aboriginal word, but was imposed by government officials in the early twentieth century. It was crucial as a site of quarries. The Mountain Quarry and the Government Quarry were both important blue stone quarries in their time. The harbour and moles at <span class="loc">Fremantle</span> were built using stone from the Government quarry. The Government Quarry (on the south eastern part of the locality) was variously named during its time of operation as <span class="per">Mr O'Connor</span>'s quarry, the Fremantle Harbour Works <span class="loc">Darlington</span> Quarry, the Public Works Quarry, the Government Quarry, and, currently, as Hudman Road Quarry. Being at the edge of the <span class="loc">Greenmount</span> National Park and the Hudman Road Quarry, <span class="loc">Boya</span> has been subject to serious threatening bushfires spreading from these locations in <span class="date">recent years</span>. In the history of the early Eastern Railway, which passed through <span class="loc">Boya</span>, <span class="loc">Boya</span> was the location of '<span class="loc">Cape Horn</span>' a notorious curve at the 22 miles mark, where runaway trains derailed a number of times.</p><br><br>
