  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Milford</span> is a borough located in <span class="loc">western Hunterdon County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the borough's population was 1,233, reflecting an increase of 38 (+3.2%) from the 1,195 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn declined by 78 (-6.1%) from the 1,273 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. <span class="loc">Milford</span> was incorporated as a borough by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on <span class="date">April 15, 1911</span>, from portions of Holland Township, based on the results of a referendum held on <span class="date">May 8, 1911</span>. The borough's incorporation was confirmed on <span class="date">March 13, 1925</span>. The borough is located on the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River in the western portion of <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>, known as the <span class="loc">Hunterdon</span> Plateau. The Borough dates to the mid-18th century when a grist mill was established here. After the mill was destroyed by fire in <span class="date">1769</span>, the settlement became known as <span class="loc">Burnt Mills</span>. The area was renamed as "Lowreytown" after <span class="per">Thomas Lowrey</span> purchased land in the area in <span class="date">1796</span>. The community became commonly known as "Millford" or "Millsford" by the beginning of the 19th century, but by <span class="date">1844</span> the name had lost a letter or two. It was incorporated in <span class="date">1911</span> but the official incorporation was not registered until <span class="date">1925</span>.</p><br><br>
