<p><span class="loc">Bergen</span> is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the <span class="loc">Birkenfeld district</span> in Rhineland-Palatinate, <span class="loc">Germany</span>. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of <span class="loc">Herrstein</span>, whose seat is in the like-named municipality. In 926, <span class="loc">Bergen</span> had its first documentary mention. To the southwest once lay the now vanished village of <span class="loc">Staufenberg</span>. After the Second World War, the village still had more than sixty businesses that were active in agriculture. Nowadays there are only seven, most of which are run as sidelines. Until 1969, <span class="loc">Bergen</span> still had its own primary school; after it closed that year, schoolchildren were transferred to the nearby town of <span class="loc">Kirn</span> in <span class="loc">Bad Kreuznach</span> district. In 1995, the Verbandsgemeinde of <span class="loc">Herrstein</span> opened a two-group kindergarten with an intake capacity of 50 three- to six-year-olds. This is meant to serve not only <span class="loc">Bergen</span>, but also the neighbouring municipalities of <span class="loc">Berschweiler</span>, <span class="loc">Griebelschied</span> and <span class="loc">Sonnschied</span>. Bergen’s mayor is Gerhard Friedt. The municipality’s arms might be described thus: Per bend sable a mount of three per bend argent and Or a lion rampant gules armed and langued azure.</p>
