  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mandera</span> (Somali: <span class="loc">Mandheera</span>) is the capital of <span class="loc">Mandera County</span> in the former <span class="loc">North Eastern Province</span> of <span class="loc">Kenya</span>. It is situated at around 3°55′N 41°50′E, near the borders with <span class="loc">Somalia</span> and <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>. <span class="loc">Mandera</span> is the capital of the <span class="loc">Mandera District</span>. As a whole, it used to constitute one district, which was divided into three smaller constituencies; namely, <span class="loc">Mandera East</span>, <span class="loc">Mandera Central</span> and <span class="loc">Mandera West</span>. However, Kenyan President <span class="per">Mwai Kibaki</span> in <span class="date">2007</span> ordered the creation of two more districts: <span class="loc">Mandera Central</span> <span class="loc">Mandera West</span> Lafey, <span class="loc">Mandera</span> north and <span class="loc">Banisa</span>. This brought the total number of local districts to six. The town occupies an area of 26,744 km². As with the other areas of the <span class="loc">North Eastern Province</span>, <span class="loc">Mandera</span> is predominantly inhabited by ethnic Somalis. The main Somali clans in the town are the Murule, <span class="loc">Gurreh</span>, <span class="loc">Degodia</span> and other Hawiye. <span class="loc">Mandera</span>'s climate is categorized as arid under the Köppen climate classification. Temperatures tend to be hot throughout the year. Daily temperatures are typically above 30 °C (86 °F), while at night, they can fall to 20 °C (68 °F). Precipitation is extremely low, with the area receiving a very minimal amount of rain. Droughts are not unusual, often resulting in significant loss of livestock in rural areas where pastoralism is common.</p><br><br>
