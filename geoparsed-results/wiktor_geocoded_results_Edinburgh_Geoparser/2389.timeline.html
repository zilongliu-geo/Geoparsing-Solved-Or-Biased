  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Greenville</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Hillsborough County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,105 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is located at the junction of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> routes 31, 45, and 123. Once a part of <span class="per">Mason</span> called <span class="per">Mason</span> Village, <span class="per">Greenville</span> is one of the state's newest and smallest towns, incorporated in <span class="date">1872</span>. It is located at the <span class="loc">High Falls</span> on the <span class="loc">Souhegan River</span>, whose plentiful water power provided the mill town with the state's first industries, making cotton and woolen goods. Because of the falls, <span class="per">Greenville</span> was always a manufacturing center. The <span class="org">Columbian Manufacturing Company</span> was established in <span class="date">1826</span> to make textiles in both <span class="loc">Greenville</span> and <span class="loc">New Ipswich</span>. The Columbian is long gone, but its fine brick buildings still dominate the village, kept company by <span class="per">Queen Anne</span> style houses on side streets. The mills are <span class="date">now</span> used for other businesses and storage, and one has been converted into housing for the elderly. <span class="per">Greenville</span> once had a <span class="loc">Boston</span> &amp; Maine Railroad trestle. Before it was dismantled for safety reasons, local residents turned out one sunny afternoon to watch <span class="per">Bronson Potter</span>, <span class="per">Mason</span> resident and inventor, fly a private airplane underneath the span on a wager. The railroad depot, which still stands, was once an important landmark that put the tiny towns of <span class="per">Mason</span> and <span class="per">Greenville</span> "on the map." It has since been turned into a Chinese restaurant and lounge.</p><br><br>
