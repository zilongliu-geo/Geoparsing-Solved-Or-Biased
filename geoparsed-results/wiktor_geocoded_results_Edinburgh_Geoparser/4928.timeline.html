  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Antioch</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">Antioch</span> Township of <span class="loc">Lake County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 14,430 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the suburb of <span class="loc">Chicago</span> that is farthest from the city. Due north of <span class="loc">Antioch</span> is <span class="loc">Kenosha County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, meaning that is not <span class="loc">Chicago</span> suburban, and the suburbs south of <span class="loc">Antioch</span> are suburbs of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. The Pottawatomi Indian Tribe, semi-nomadic hunters who lived in wigwams, inhabited <span class="loc">Antioch</span> when white men began to arrive. They fought with the British in the War of <span class="date">1812</span> and then with the American settlers in the <span class="org">Blackhawk War</span> of <span class="date">1832</span>. It was in <span class="date">1832</span> that the American Indians began to leave the area, although arrowheads and other remnants of their history can still be found <span class="date">today</span> if one knows where to look. The winding Highway 173 was once an Indian trail and Highway 83 was the <span class="loc">Muquonago</span> Trail. The first permanent white settlement in <span class="loc">Antioch</span> was the <span class="per">Gage Brothers</span>' cabin on <span class="loc">Sequoit Creek</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Fox River</span>. In <span class="date">1839</span>, Hiram Buttrick built a sawmill along the creek, making <span class="loc">Antioch</span> a center of commerce. A replica of the mill has been built a few hundred feet downstream from where it once stood.</p><br><br>
