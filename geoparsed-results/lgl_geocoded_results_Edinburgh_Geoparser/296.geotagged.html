<p>L.A. police disappointed with release of Olson. Sara Jane Olson is seen in a Tuesday, March 17, 2009 photo released by the California Department of Corrections and taken in <span class="loc">Chowchilla</span>, <span class="loc">Calif</span>. Olson, the 1970s radical who assumed a new identity as a Minnesota housewife while spending a quarter century as a fugitive, was released from prison Tuesday, just after midnight from the Central California Women's Facility in <span class="loc">Chowchilla</span>. "We are extremely disappointed with Gov. Schwarzenegger's decision to let Kathleen Soliah, a convicted terrorist, serve parole in the state of her choice," Weber said. "We believe the governor should have used his discretion in this matter to ensure Olsen stay under the watch of California authorities as she finished out her sentence." "It was a California mother of four she was convicted of murdering. It was <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> police officers she attempted to blow up," he said. "We continue to believe that the community she targeted with her crimes retains the right to ensure she complies with the terms of her parole."</p>
