<p>Dalton is a village in <span class="loc">Chariton County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 17 at the 2010 census. Dalton is located at 39°23′50″N 92°59′28″W (39.397130, -92.991248). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.18 square miles (0.47 km2), all of it land. Lewis and Clark made camp at what would later be known as the Cut-Off on June 12, 1804, and it was here that the expedition met with Pierre Dorion, a man who had reportedly been with the <span class="loc">Sioux</span> for 20 years and was thought to have some influence upon them. The Lewis and Clark journal entry describes the Dalton Cut-Off as connected to the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River by a creek. More than sixty years after the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the area—after the end of the Civil War—the village of Dalton was born when the railroad created a need for it. The village was named for William Dalton who had donated the 40 acres (160,000 m2) and a railroad depot was built for the St. Louis &amp; Pacific line. [note: William Dalton was believed to be the grandfather of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>'s sitting governor at the time the village was named, but the contributor has not yet found sources to support that claim.]</p>
