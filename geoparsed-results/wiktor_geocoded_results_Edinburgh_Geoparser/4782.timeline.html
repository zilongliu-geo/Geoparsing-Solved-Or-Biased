It is a tourist destination set on the western bank of the estuary of the <span class="loc">River Dart</span>, which is a long narrow tidal ria that runs inland as far as <span class="loc">Totnes</span>. It lies within the <span class="loc">South Devon Area</span> of Outstanding Natural Beauty and South Hams District, and had a population of 5,512 in <span class="date">2001</span>, reducing to 5,064 at the <span class="date">2011</span> census There are two electoral wards in the <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> area (Townstal &amp; <span class="loc">Kingswear</span>). Their combined population at the above census was 6,822. <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> was of strategic importance as a deep-water port for sailing vessels. The port was used as the sailing point for the Crusades of <span class="date">1147</span> and <span class="date">1190</span>, and <span class="loc">Warfleet</span> Creek, close to <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> Castle is supposed by some to be named for the vast fleets which assembled there. <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span> was a home of the Royal Navy from the reign of <span class="per">Edward III</span> and was twice surprised and sacked during the Hundred <span class="date">Years</span>' War, after which the mouth of the estuary was closed every night with a great chain.

Originally <span class="loc">Dartmouth</span>'s only wharf was Bayard's Cove, a relatively small area protected by a fort at the southern end of the town.</p><br><br>
