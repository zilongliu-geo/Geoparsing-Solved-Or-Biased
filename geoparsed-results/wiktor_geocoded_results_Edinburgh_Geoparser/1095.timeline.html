  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">San Juan Bautista</span> is the main town in the Juan Fernández Islands. Some sources say it was founded in <span class="date">1877</span>, while others give an earlier date of <span class="date">1750</span>. It is located on <span class="loc">Cumberland Bay</span> on the center of the northeast coast of <span class="loc">Robinson</span> <span class="loc">Crusoe Island</span>. Although the community maintains a rustic serenity dependent on the spiny lobster trade, residents employ a few vehicles, a satellite internet connection, and many television sets. As of the <span class="date">2012</span> census, the town had a population of 800 in an area of 0.31 km2 (0.12 sq mi). There is a soccer pitch at the northern end of the village. The nearby school is called the <span class="org">Dresden School</span>, after the German light cruiser SMS <span class="loc">Dresden</span> which was sunk here during World War I, as is the street it is situated on. The names of other generally unpaved streets in the village include Larraín Alcalde, <span class="per">Ignacio Carrera Pinto</span>, El Sándalo, <span class="per">Vicente González</span>, Teniente Cortés, and La Pólvora. Overlooking <span class="loc">San Juan Bautista</span> are <span class="loc">Las Cuevas</span> de los Patriotas (Patriots' Caves), where 42 Chilean creole independence activists lived during their exile by the Spanish authorities after the Battle of <span class="loc">Rancagua</span> in <span class="date">1814</span>. The exiles included prominent figures such as Juan Egaña and <span class="per">Manuel de Salas</span>.</p><br><br>
