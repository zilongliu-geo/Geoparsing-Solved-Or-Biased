  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Police catch murder suspect after hours-long hunt. The events that culminated in his arrest began about <span class="date">10:30 a.m. Monday</span>, when he shot a man near <span class="loc">Grand Avenue</span> and West 11th Street in <span class="loc">San Pedro</span>, according to police. The victim, whose name was being withheld pending notification of relatives, later died at a hospital. SWAT officers soon surrounded the home and tried to persuade the gunman to surrender. Several people who had been inside the home surrendered to police by 7 p.m. and were detained, but the assailant fled, leading officers to conduct a perimeter search in the neighborhood, police said.</p><br><br>
