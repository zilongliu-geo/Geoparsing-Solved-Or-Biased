<p><span class="loc">El Salvador</span> (/ɛl ˈsælvədɔːr/; Spanish: [el salβaˈðor]), officially the <span class="loc">Republic of El Salvador</span> (Spanish: República de <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>, literally "Republic of The Savior"), is the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central <span class="loc">America</span>. <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>'s capital and largest city is <span class="loc">San Salvador</span>. As of 2015, <span class="loc">El Salvador</span> had a population of approximately 6.38 million, making it the most densely populated country in the region. Its population consists largely of Mestizos of European and Indigenous American descent. <span class="loc">El Salvador</span> was for centuries inhabited by several Mesoamerican nations, especially the Cuzcatlecs, as well as the <span class="loc">Lenca</span> and Maya. In the early 16th century, the Spanish Empire conquered the territory, incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New <span class="loc">Spain</span>. In 1821, the country achieved independence from <span class="loc">Spain</span> as part of the First Mexican Empire, only to further secede as part of the Federal Republic of Central <span class="loc">America</span> in 1823. Upon the republic's dissolution in 1841, <span class="loc">El Salvador</span> became sovereign until forming a short-lived union with <span class="loc">Honduras</span> and <span class="loc">Nicaragua</span> called the Greater Republic of Central <span class="loc">America</span>, which lasted from 1895 to 1898.</p>
