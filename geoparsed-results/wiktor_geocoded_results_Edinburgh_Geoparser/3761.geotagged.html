<p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 26,499. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Mount Sterling</span>. With regard to the sale of alcohol, it is classified as a moist countyâ€”a county in which alcohol sales are prohibited (a dry county), but containing a "wet" city where package alcohol sales are allowed, in this case <span class="loc">Mount Sterling</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Mount Sterling</span>, <span class="loc">KY</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Lexington-Fayette-Richmond-Frankfort, KY Combined Statistical Area. In 1793 Shoe Boots (Tarsekayahke) led <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> and <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> warriors in a raid on Morgan's Station, in what was known as the last Indian raid in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. Some settlers were killed and two adolescent girls, including Clarinda Allington, were taken captive and the party returned to <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> territory. Believing he had saved Clarinda's life, Shoe Boots later married her, and they had three children together. He was a wealthy, successful leader. Several years later, <span class="loc">Clarinda</span> gained a visit back to her family in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> with her children and decided to stay. They could not support her, but the state voted a 3-year pension for her.</p>
