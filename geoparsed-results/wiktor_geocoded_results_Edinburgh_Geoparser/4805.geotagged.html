<p><span class="loc">Middleton</span> is a largely residential suburb of <span class="loc">Leeds</span> in <span class="loc">West Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> and historically a village in the <span class="loc">West Riding</span> of <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span>. It is situated on a hill 4 miles (6 km) south of <span class="loc">Leeds</span> city centre and 165 miles (266 km) north north-west of <span class="loc">London</span>. In 2001 the population of the <span class="loc">Middleton Park</span> <span class="loc">ward of Leeds</span> City Council was 27,487, reducing to 26,228 at the 2011 Census. <span class="loc">Middleton</span> was occupied before the Norman Conquest and recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. It developed as a manorial estate and its owners began to exploit the coal seams that outcropped within its boundaries. At the start of the Industrial Revolution a wooden wagonway was built to link the coal pits to <span class="loc">Leeds</span>. The colliery agent, John Blenkinsop designed an iron railway and its first steam-powered locomotive which was built by Matthew Murray in <span class="loc">Holbeck</span>. The coal mines on which the local economy was based lasted until 1967 and the railway is a preserved and run by a trust after operating for 200 years. <span class="loc">Middleton Park</span>, a remnant of the manorial estate, contains a large area of ancient woodland and parts of it, where coal was mined, are designated a scheduled ancient monument. It was the location of <span class="loc">Middleton Hall</span> and <span class="loc">Middleton Lodge</span>, homes to the local gentry.</p>
