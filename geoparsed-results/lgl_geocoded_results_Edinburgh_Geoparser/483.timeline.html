  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Russian-American Crew Blasts Off to Space Station. BAIKONUR, <span class="loc">Kazakhstan</span> — <span class="per">A Soyuz</span> capsule carrying a Russian-American crew and <span class="loc">U.S</span> billionaire space tourist <span class="per">Charles Simonyi</span> blasted off for the international space station <span class="date">Thursday</span>. The Russian rocket lifted off on schedule from the Baikonur cosmodrome facility in a roar of fire and soared into the cold, overcast skies over northern <span class="loc">Kazakhstan</span>’s barren steppes. <span class="per">Simonyi</span>, a software designer paying $35 million for his second trip on the <span class="loc">Soyuz</span>, joined Russian cosmonaut <span class="per">Gennady Padalka</span> and <span class="per">American</span> astronaut <span class="per">Michael Barratt</span> in the cramped capsule, where they will sit for <span class="date">nearly two days</span> before hooking up with the station, orbiting some 350 kilometers above the Earth. Minutes after blast-off, TV cameras from inside the <span class="loc">Soyuz</span> showed <span class="per">Padalka</span> and <span class="per">Barratt</span> waving for the camera and giving the thumbs-up OK sign. At viewing stands a few hundred meters away, scores of officials, reporters and relatives watched the launch, including <span class="per">Simonyi</span>’s 28-year-old Swedish socialite wife <span class="per">Lisa Persdotter</span>, who wept and clutched at the coat of a relative. “I’m very, very happy. It was very, very smooth,” she said afterward. Also watching was <span class="per">Paul Allen</span>, a co-founder of software giant <span class="org">Microsoft Corp.</span>, where <span class="per">Simonyi</span> worked for <span class="date">many years</span>. “It’s fantastic to see a launch, but when it’s one of your friends, it’s just something so special,” he said. Asked if he would be interested in going to space sometime, <span class="per">Allen</span> said he would consider it; not on the Russian capsules or <span class="loc">U.S.</span> shuttles, but on one of his own crafts. In <span class="date">2004</span>, <span class="per">Allen</span> used his <span class="org">Microsoft</span> fortunes to bankroll SpaceShipOne, which in <span class="date">2004</span> became the first private, manned craft to reach space. While <span class="per">Barratt</span> and <span class="per">Padalka</span> will join the current station’s permanent crew, <span class="per">Simonyi</span> will return to Earth <span class="date">13 days later</span> — a trip that will make him the first two-time space tourist and, for the foreseeable future, the last.</p><br><br>
