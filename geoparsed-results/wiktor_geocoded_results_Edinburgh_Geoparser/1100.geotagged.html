<p><span class="loc">Kamo</span> (加茂市, <span class="loc">Kamo-shi</span>) is a city located in Niigata Prefecture, <span class="loc">Japan</span>, roughly halfway between the two larger <span class="loc">cities of Nagaoka and Niigata</span>. The city was founded on March 10, 1954. As of 2003, the city has an estimated population of 32,422 and a population density of 242.55 persons per km². The total area is 133.67 km². <span class="loc">Kamo</span> is a popular place for small tour groups, especially for children in elementary school. It is advertised as a "traditional town" and sometimes referred to as the Little Kyoto of the <span class="loc">Hokuetsu region</span>. This is because it shares certain structural features with <span class="loc">Kyoto</span>, being surrounded on three sides by mountains and intersected by a river. <span class="loc">Kamo</span>'s most famous attraction is <span class="loc">Kamoyama</span> Park, which is home to the Omi Jinja (Shrine) and many other sights, including a petting area for small squirrels which the town has regularly imported. The <span class="loc">Kamo</span> River is also the site of many city events, including the Obon Festival in August and the Snow Camelia Festival in April. The snow camelia is a symbol of <span class="loc">Kamo</span> and can be seen growing in many locations around the city.</p>
