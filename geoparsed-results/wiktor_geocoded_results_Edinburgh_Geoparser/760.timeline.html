  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Eureka</span> (Hupa: do'-wi-lotl-ding' <span class="loc">Karuk</span>: uuth) is the principal city and county seat of <span class="loc">Humboldt County</span> in the Redwood Empire region of <span class="loc">California</span>. The city is located on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 101 on the shores of <span class="loc">Humboldt Bay</span>, 270 miles (430 km) north of <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and 100 miles (160 km) south of the Oregon border. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population of the city was 27,191, and the population of Greater Eureka was 45,034. <span class="org">Eureka</span> is the largest coastal city between <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="loc">Portland</span>, and the westernmost city of more than 25,000 residents in the 48 contiguous states. It is the regional center for government, health care, trade, and the arts on the <span class="loc">North Coast</span> north of the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> Bay Area. Greater Eureka, one of California's major commercial fishing ports, is the location of the largest deep-water port between <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and <span class="loc">Coos Bay</span>, a stretch of about 500 miles (800 km). The headquarters of both the <span class="loc">Six Rivers National Forest</span> and the <span class="loc">North Coast</span> Redwoods District of the California State Parks System are in <span class="org">Eureka</span>. As entrep√¥t for hundreds of lumber mills that once existed in the area, the city played a leading role in the historic West Coast lumber trade. The entire city is a state historic landmark, which has hundreds of significant Victorian homes, including the nationally-recognized <span class="loc">Carson Mansion</span>, and the city has retained its original 19th-century commercial core as a nationally recognized Old Town Historic District. <span class="org">Eureka</span> is home to California's oldest zoo, the Sequoia Park Zoo.</p><br><br>
