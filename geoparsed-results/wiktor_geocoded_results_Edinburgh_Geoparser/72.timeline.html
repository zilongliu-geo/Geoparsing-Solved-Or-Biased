  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Miguel</span> is in the northwest region of Greater <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, 30 km from the City of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>. <span class="loc">San Miguel</span> is the county seat of <span class="per">San</span> <span class="per">Miguel Partido</span>, and has been a part of Greater <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> since the early 2000s. The number of inhabitants was 157,532 according to the <span class="date">2001</span> census. Part of a vast estancia estate owned by General Ángel <span class="loc">Pacheco</span>, <span class="loc">San Miguel</span> was founded as <span class="per">San José</span> del Pilar by a French Argentine agronomist, <span class="per">Adolfo Sourdeaux</span>, on <span class="date">May 18, 1864</span>. Part of Pilar <span class="per">Partido</span> initially, the town was renamed <span class="loc">San Miguel</span> after the former district was subdivided shortly afterward. <span class="per">A Buenos</span> Aires-Pacific Railway line was built along the town in <span class="date">1870</span>, and its first schools were opened at that time as part of <span class="per">President Domingo Sarmiento</span>'s program for education in <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. The town was designated as county seat for the newly created <span class="per">General Sarmiento Partido</span> in <span class="date">1889</span>, and was in turn made the county seat for <span class="per">San</span> <span class="per">Miguel Partido</span> when the former was subdivided in <span class="date">1994</span>. <span class="loc">San Miguel</span>'s transition from a rural community to that of a suburban bedroom community with high-rise buildings has caused it to lose its village character and strained its infrastructure. The largely service-oriented economy is complemented by industries such as the IPH steel cable facility.</p><br><br>
