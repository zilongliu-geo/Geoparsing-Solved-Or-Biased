  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Shiling</span> (simplified Chinese: 狮岭镇; traditional Chinese: 狮嶺鎮; pinyin: Shīlǐng Zhèn) is a town on the outskirts of <span class="loc">Guangzhou</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>. Its name means "Lion Ridge", so called because of the local mountain ridge that is shaped like a lion. Shiling Town has long consisted of small farms abutting the mountains from which it gets its name. In <span class="date">the 1970s</span> the government began centrally planned industrialization of <span class="loc">Shiling</span> as a leatherworking town. It is <span class="date">now</span> the largest center for the leatherworking industry in <span class="loc">China</span>. In addition, its forested mountains and ancient temple make it a tourist destination. Recently, <span class="loc">Shiling</span> has seen suburban real-estate redevelopment of some of its land in Western style, with widely space houses, as opposed to the traditional Chinese closely clustered farming communities. Shiling Town (狮岭镇)is located in <span class="loc">Huadu District</span>, a suburban <span class="loc">district of Guangzhou</span>. The G107 (Guang-Qing Highway), traveling northeast out of <span class="loc">Guangzhou</span>, is the major road passing through <span class="loc">Shiling</span>. <span class="loc">Shiling</span> is 34 km from downtown <span class="loc">Guangzhou</span>. The Beijing-Guangzhou railway also passes through <span class="loc">Shiling</span>. <span class="loc">Shiling</span> was founded as a hamlet (圩) in the Qing dynasty some time during the reign of the <span class="per">Qianlong Emperor</span> (<span class="date">1736</span>—<span class="date">1795</span>).</p><br><br>
