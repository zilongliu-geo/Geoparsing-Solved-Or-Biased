<p>Gloucester /ˈɡlɒstər/ is a city on <span class="loc">Cape Ann</span> in <span class="loc">Essex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>' <span class="loc">North Shore</span>. The population was 28,789 at the 2010 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census. An important center of the fishing industry and a popular summer destination, <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> consists of an urban core on the north side of the harbor and the outlying neighborhoods of <span class="loc">Annisquam</span>, <span class="loc">Bay View</span>, <span class="loc">Lanesville</span>, <span class="loc">Folly Cove</span>, Magnolia, <span class="loc">Riverdale</span>, <span class="loc">East Gloucester</span>, and <span class="loc">West Gloucester</span>. The boundaries of <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> originally included the town of <span class="loc">Rockport</span>, in an area dubbed "<span class="loc">Sandy Bay</span>". That village separated formally on February 27, 1840. In 1873, <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> was reincorporated as a city. <span class="loc">Gloucester</span> was founded at <span class="loc">Cape Ann</span> by an expedition called the "Dorchester Company" of men from <span class="loc">Dorchester</span> (in the <span class="loc">county of Dorset</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>) chartered by James I in 1623. It was one of the first English settlements in what would become the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span>, and predates both <span class="loc">Salem</span> in 1626 and <span class="loc">Boston</span> in 1630. The first company of pioneers made landing at Half Moon Beach and settled nearby, setting up fishing stages in a field in what is now Stage Fort Park. This settlement's existence is proclaimed today by a memorial tablet, affixed to a 50-foot (15 m) boulder in that park.</p>
