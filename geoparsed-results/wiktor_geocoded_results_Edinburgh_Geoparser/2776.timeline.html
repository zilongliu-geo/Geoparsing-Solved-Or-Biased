  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jamaica</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windham County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 946 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> includes the villages of <span class="loc">East Jamaica</span> and <span class="loc">Rawsonville</span>. Its ZIP code is 05343. The town is home to <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> State Park, noted for scenic camping spots and various swimming holes, including <span class="loc">Hamilton Falls</span>. The nearest large town is <span class="loc">Brattleboro</span>. In the colonial period, what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Vermont</span> was disputed territory, with land claims from both <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. The original grants for this area, issued by the Royal Governor of <span class="loc">New York</span> in <span class="date">1767</span> and <span class="date">1772</span>, were for two towns. But in <span class="date">1777</span>, the Republic of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> was established. Ignoring the previous grants, it gave charter on <span class="date">November 7, 1780</span> for “a tract of vacant land within this state which has not heretofore been granted.” The charter goes on to say “that the same be and is hereby Incorporated into a Township by the name of <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>”—its name from the Natick word for beaver and not the Caribbean island. The grant encompassed forty-two square miles, at an altitude ranging from 688 feet (210 m) above sea level along the <span class="loc">West River</span> to 2,542 feet (775 m) on The <span class="org">Pinnacle</span>. On the charter were listed sixty-seven grantees, many of whose surnames can be found among residents <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
