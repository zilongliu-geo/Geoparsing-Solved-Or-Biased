<p><span class="loc">Beaumont</span> (pronounced locally as bee-mont) is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">City of Carlisle</span> <span class="loc">district of Cumbria</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The village lies four miles north-west of <span class="loc">Carlisle</span> on the banks of the <span class="loc">River Eden</span>. The civil <span class="loc">parish of Beaumont</span> includes the surrounding villages of <span class="loc">Kirkandrews-on-Eden</span>, <span class="loc">Grinsdale</span> and <span class="loc">Monkhill</span>. The parish is bordered by the <span class="loc">River Eden</span> to the north and east, and by the parishes of <span class="loc">Burgh by Sands</span> to the west and <span class="loc">Orton</span> to the south. The village has very limited facilities; although it has a pub, The Drover's Rest, there is no school, post office or shop. Beaumont's name, as suggested by the French translation 'beautiful mount', comes from its high setting. The manor was anciently in the <span class="loc">Bruns</span>, Lords of <span class="loc">Bowness</span>, who were patrons also of the church: before the year 1380 it became the property of the Dacres, and was annexed to the Barony of Burgh, belonging to the Earl of Lonsdale. The church is in the diocese and deanery of <span class="loc">Carlisle</span>. This small rectory was augmented by Queen Anne's Bounty in 1772.</p>
