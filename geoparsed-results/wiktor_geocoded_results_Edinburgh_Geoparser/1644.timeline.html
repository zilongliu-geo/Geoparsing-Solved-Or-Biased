  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ostrovnoye</span> (Russian: Островно́е) is a rural locality (a selo) in <span class="loc">Bilibinsky District</span> of <span class="loc">Chukotka</span> Autonomous Okrug, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the banks of the <span class="loc">Maly Anyuy</span> River about 40 kilometers (25 mi) upstream from <span class="loc">Anyuysk</span> and about 179 kilometers (111 mi) from the administrative center of the district, <span class="loc">Bilibino</span> and 690 kilometers (430 mi) from Anadyr. Population: 379 (<span class="date">2010</span> est.), of which 317 were indigenous peoples. Population: 384 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census);  Municipally, <span class="loc">Ostrovnoye</span> is subordinated to Bilibinsky Municipal District and is incorporated as <span class="loc">Ostrovnoye Rural</span> Settlement. <span class="loc">Ostrovnoye</span> is a historical locality in the region, as it was the site of an ostrog built as Russians began to explore and lay claim to the region, and was the site of trade fairs between Russians and natives. The ruins of the <span class="loc">Ostrog</span> are still visible not far from the village. Since the beginning of the 18th century Russian explorers began active exploration of <span class="loc">Kolyma</span> and <span class="loc">Chukotka</span>, and the settlements they established were essentially fortresses, among them Anyuysky <span class="loc">Ostrog</span>, where the Anyuysk Fair was held, the largest in Chutkotka. The <span class="loc">Ostrog</span> was situated on an island in the Lesser Anyuy. However, because of constant spring flooding of the river the fair was repeatedly postponed until <span class="date">1848</span> after a flood, which destroyed most of the island and the <span class="loc">Ostrog</span> itself, the settlement was moved to the left bank, 10 km downstream. However, the locals traditionally called this fortress "Island" and so that was the name that was assigned to the modern village, standing on the site of the former <span class="loc">Ostrog</span>.</p><br><br>
