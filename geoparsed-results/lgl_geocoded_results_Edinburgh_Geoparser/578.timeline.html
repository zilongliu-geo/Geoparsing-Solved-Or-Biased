  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">More rural</span> residents self-employed. <span class="loc">OMAHA</span> -- A University of Nebraska sociologist says the state’s waning rural population is changing the way people do business. <span class="per">Randy Cantrell</span>, with the university’s Rural Initiative, said in most rural counties, between 18 percent and 30 percent or more of jobs are <span class="date">now</span> due to self-employment. And, that accounts for virtually all job growth in rural areas. He believes the popularity of self-employment is on the rise in rural <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. <span class="per">Cantrell</span> hasn’t been able to put his finger on such details through his research, namely an annual rural poll that surveys rural residents on well-being, policy and work issues. But he has a theory: The rural poll is asking the wrong question. In <span class="date">the past</span>, people have been asked if they have a business. <span class="per">Cantrell</span> realizes that may be leaving out those who still get a paycheck from their employers, but technically are private contractors. He used the example of inbound telemarketers, who he thinks can rightfully assert they have a business. As rural areas continue to see their population numbers fall, <span class="per">Cantrell</span> said he expects that to put pressure on employers to shift away from the traditional way of doing business and rely on private contractors. “There’s still a demand for service but not enough to support a business of several employees,” he said. <span class="per">Cantrell</span> details the phenomenon and other observations about Nebraska’s economic and demographic changes in a new report based on <span class="date">2007</span> census data and other federal statistics. Census data released <span class="date">this week</span> shows the state’s three largest counties ” Douglas, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> and <span class="loc">Sarpy</span> ” grew by 14,240 people collectively in <span class="date">2008</span>. The remaining 90 counties declined by 281. <span class="per">Cantrell</span> said he plans to revise his report with the newly released information. The rural poll will take another shot at the “business” question <span class="date">this year</span>, which is on its way to 7,000 Nebraska households. The survey is conducted by the <span class="org">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</span>’s Center for Applied Rural Innovation in cooperation with the Rural Initiative and UNL’s Department of Agricultural Economics. <span class="per">Cantrell</span>’s study also notes the continued decline of those under age 20 living in rural areas. All but seven counties in the state declined in this population group during <span class="date">this decade</span>, he said in the report. <span class="loc">Cherry County</span>, for example, saw a 20 percent drop in people under age 20 between <span class="date">2000</span> and <span class="date">2007</span>. He attributes the changes to people leaving the state ” likely for economic reasons ” and a decline in birth rates.</p><br><br>
