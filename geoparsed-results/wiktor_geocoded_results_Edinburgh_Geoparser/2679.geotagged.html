<p>Harvey is a south suburb of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, located in <span class="loc">Cook County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 25,282 at the 2010 census. The city suffers from high levels of poverty (33.2%) and unemployment (22.0%). It also suffers from high levels of crime. Harvey is bordered by <span class="loc">Dixmoor</span> and <span class="loc">Riverdale</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Dolton</span>, <span class="loc">Phoenix</span>, and <span class="loc">South Holland</span> to the east, <span class="loc">East Hazel Crest</span> to the south, and <span class="loc">Hazel Crest</span>, <span class="loc">Markham</span> and <span class="loc">Posen</span> to the west. Harvey was founded in 1891 by Christian leader Turlington W. Harvey, a close associate of Dwight Moody, the founder of the Moody Bible Institute in <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. Harvey was originally intended as a model town for Christian values and was one of the Temperance Towns; it was closely modeled after the company town of <span class="loc">Pullman</span>, which eventually was annexed into the <span class="loc">city of Chicago</span>. The city saw its greatest growth during the 1950s, but by the 1990s it was losing population and its economy was in decline. In the 2000s and 2010s, Mayor Eric Kellogg attempted to boost Harvey's economy with little success. Kellogg offered developers millions of dollars in incentives to revive the long vacant Dixie Square Mall. In another plan to redevelop the Chicago Park Hotel, a developer was given $10 million from the city but then abandoned the project, leaving behind a gutted building.</p>
