  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Naples</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Collier County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of <span class="date">2015</span>, the city's population was about 20,600. <span class="loc">Naples</span> is a principal city of the Naples-Marco Island, <span class="loc">Florida Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which had a population of about 322,000 at the <span class="date">2015</span> census. <span class="loc">Naples</span> is one of the wealthiest cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, with the sixth highest per capita income in <span class="loc">America</span>, and the second highest proportion of millionaires per capita in the <span class="loc">US</span>. Real estate is among the most expensive in the country, with houses for sale in excess of $40 million. The <span class="loc">city of Naples</span> was founded during the late 1880s by former Confederate general and <span class="loc">Kentucky U.S.</span> Senator <span class="per">John Stuart Williams</span> and his partner, Louisville businessman <span class="per">Walter N. Haldeman</span>, the publisher of the Louisville Courier-Journal. Throughout the 1870s and <span class="date">'80s</span>, magazine and newspaper stories telling of the area's mild climate and abundant fish and game likened it to the sunny Italian peninsula. The name <span class="loc">Naples</span> caught on when promoters described the bay as "surpassing the bay in <span class="loc">Naples</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>". Major development was anticipated after the railroad reached <span class="loc">Naples</span> on <span class="date">January 7, 1927</span>, and the <span class="loc">Tamiami</span> Trail linking <span class="loc">Naples</span> to <span class="loc">Miami</span> was completed in <span class="date">1928</span>, but did not begin until after the Great Depression and World War II. During the war the <span class="org">U.S. Army Air Forces</span> built a small air field and used it for training purposes; it is <span class="date">now</span> the <span class="loc">Naples</span> Municipal Airport.</p><br><br>
