<p><span class="loc">Monte Grande</span> is a city which forms part of the urban agglomeration of Greater <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>. It is the administrative seat of Esteban Echeverría <span class="loc">Partido</span> in <span class="loc">Buenos</span> <span class="loc">Aires Province</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. It was founded on April 3, 1889, by a company named Sociedad Coni, Sansisena y Cía., and currently has an area of 22.57 km² and a population of 109,644 inhabitants (2001 census [INDEC]). Named for the Pago de <span class="loc">Monte Grande</span> founded by a Spanish Empire Conquistador, the town initially grew around tala and ombú forests, to which vineyards and peach trees were later added. The Sociedad Coni, <span class="loc">Sansinena</span> y Cía., prominent Avellaneda-area saladero operators, purchased the land from the Fair family in 1889; Governor Máximo Paz signed a bill establishing <span class="loc">Monte Grande</span> on April 3 of that year. Among <span class="loc">Monte Grande</span>'s first significant businesses were kiln opened by <span class="loc">Coni</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Sansinena</span>, and the <span class="loc">Bon</span> Marché market. Esteban Echeverría <span class="loc">Partido</span> was established in 1913, with <span class="loc">Monte Grande</span> as its county seat. A number of meat packing plants operated here during much of the 20th century, though these eventually closed. A Coca Cola bottling plant and the Sofía Santamarina Hospital thus became two of the largest employers in the city, which became a bedroom community with a services-oriented economy.</p>
