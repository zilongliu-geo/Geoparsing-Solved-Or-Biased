<p><span class="loc">Melrose</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Alachua</span>, <span class="loc">Bradford</span>, <span class="loc">Clay</span>, and <span class="loc">Putnam</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Florida</span>. It lies on State Road 26 approximately 30 km (19 mi) east of <span class="loc">Gainesville</span> and approximately 80 km (50 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span>. <span class="loc">Melrose</span> was settled in the second half of the 19th century at the crossing of the Bellamy Road (now State Road 26) and the Starke-Orange Springs Road (now State Road 21), near the Eliam Church and Shakerag race course, and about one mile from the older settlement of Banana. The new town was named <span class="loc">Melrose</span> after <span class="loc">Melrose Abbey</span> in <span class="loc">Melrose</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It was reported that the ladies of the town did not want it to be known as Shakerag. The town of <span class="loc">Melrose</span> included part of the Shakerag race course, but there was no settlement at the Shakerag race course before <span class="loc">Melrose</span> was settled, and Tolles states that "[t]o say <span class="loc">Melrose</span> used to be called <span class="loc">Shake Rag</span> is poetic license." In the late 1800s, the citrus industry thrived in the area. Local growers would bring their yearly harvest to <span class="loc">Melrose</span>, where it was loaded onto steam ships in lake <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>. The ships would then steam from lake <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> to <span class="loc">Lake Alto</span>, and then <span class="loc">Lake Alto</span> to the town of <span class="loc">Waldo</span> using man made canals. The citrus was then transported by rail across the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In 1894, however, two devastating freezes hit the <span class="loc">Melrose</span> area and destroyed local groves. Growers then relocated to warmer areas in the central and southern parts of <span class="loc">Florida</span>.</p>
