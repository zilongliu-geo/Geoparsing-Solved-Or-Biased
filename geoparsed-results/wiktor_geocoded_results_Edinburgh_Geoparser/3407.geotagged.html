<p><span class="loc">Douma</span> is a Lebanese village located at an altitude of 1150 m. It is 80 km from <span class="loc">Beirut</span>, 30 km from <span class="loc">Jbeil</span> and 43 km from <span class="loc">Tripoli</span>. <span class="loc">Douma</span> is a part of <span class="loc">Batroun District</span> and is known for its special location in a valley surrounded by mountains. Almost all its houses are made of red brick. It enjoys a unique temperate climate praised by physicians as the ultimate place of medical refuge. Its ground is rich and welcomes all sorts of plants especially and has an abundance olive trees, grapevines and apple trees. <span class="loc">Douma</span> witnessed different civilizations including ancient <span class="loc">Greece</span>, ancient <span class="loc">Rome</span> and <span class="loc">Turkey</span>. However, the Ottoman Empire left the largest impact on Douma's inhabitants. In the town square sits a 4th-century A.D. sarcophagus, bearing a Greek inscription recording that this was the burial place of <span class="loc">Castor</span>, who died in 317 A.D. Emir Youssef Shehab in the early 1800s brought Christians to the town, in hope of getting better crop and thus better taxes. Since then the village has become a Christian village, with most of its believers members of the Greek Orthodox Church.</p>
