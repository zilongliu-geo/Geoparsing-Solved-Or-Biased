  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gladstone</span> /ˈɡlædstən/ is a city in the <span class="loc">Gladstone Region</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is approximately 550 kilometres (340 mi) by road north of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> and 100 kilometres (62 mi) south-east of <span class="loc">Rockhampton</span>. Situated between the <span class="per">Calliope</span> and <span class="per">Boyne</span> Rivers, <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> is home to <span class="loc">Queensland</span>'s largest multi-commodity shipping port. The city's population at the <span class="date">2011</span> Census was 31,778 of whom 4.1 percent are of <span class="per">Aboriginal</span> and <span class="per">Torres</span> Strait Islander origin. The <span class="loc">City of Gladstone</span> contains a land area of 128 square kilometres (49 sq mi). In addition to the mainland area, the Local Authority Area contains fourteen islands. The <span class="org">Gladstone Regional Council</span>, formed in <span class="date">2008</span>, amalgamates multiple previous local government areas. Prior to European settlement, the <span class="loc">Gladstone region</span> was home of the <span class="loc">Toolooa</span> (or <span class="loc">Tulua</span>), <span class="per">Meerooni</span> and <span class="per">Baiali</span> (or Byellee) Aboriginal tribes. In <span class="date">May 1770</span>, the HM Bark Endeavour, under the command of <span class="per">James Cook</span>, sailed by the entrance to <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> Harbour under the cover of darkness. <span class="per">Matthew Flinders</span>, during his <span class="date">1801</span>–<span class="date">1803</span> circumnavigation of <span class="loc">Australia</span>, became the first recorded European to sight the harbour in <span class="date">August 1802</span>. He named the harbour <span class="loc">Port Curtis</span>, after Admiral <span class="per">Roger Curtis</span>, a man who was of assistance to Flinders <span class="date">years</span> earlier at the <span class="loc">Cape of Good Hope</span>. <span class="per">John Oxley</span> conducted further exploration of the harbour and surrounding countryside in <span class="date">November 1823</span>. <span class="per">Oxley</span> was dismissive of the region, noting the harbour was difficult to enter, the countryside was too dry, and the timber useless for construction purposes.</p><br><br>
