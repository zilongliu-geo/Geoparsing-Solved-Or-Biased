The history of <span class="loc">Novotroitsk</span> goes to the beginning of the 20th century with a small farm in the wilderness. Near it, were the farms Akkermanovsky, Beloshapochny, and the village of <span class="loc">Khabarnoye</span>. Several families of peasants/immigrants from <span class="loc">Ukraine</span> settled near Silnova and named their settlement <span class="loc">Novotroitsk</span>. The 1930s, large industrial buildings were created. Before <span class="loc">Novotroitsk</span> was founded, the villagers heard news of the construction of factories in <span class="loc">Orsk</span>, and the finding of minerals. Fersman, a well-known academician, spoke in his writings of the fabulous and wealthy <span class="loc">Orsk region</span>, and called Orsk-Khalilovsk area a "true gem of the <span class="loc">Urals</span>." In the fall of 1929, geologist I. L. Rudnitsky opened the Khalilovsky field hematites. Khalilovsk ore was rare in its composition: it contains chromium, nickel, titanium, and manganese. Industrial tests confirmed its quality. In June 1931, the Government adopted a decision to start construction on the Khalilovsk ores and Karaganda coal, both to be big metallurgical plants. The construction schedule which was set to start building the <span class="loc">Khalilovo</span> metallurgical plant was scheduled for 1936. During this period, in the village of <span class="loc">Novotroitsk</span>, the first construction builders arrived. In 1935, construction was suspended and only in the spring of 1939 in the Resolution XVIII of Congress it had specifically determined: "... To begin construction of new metallurgical plants (at Khalilovsk Bakalskoye and ores).</p>
