<p>Kingston is a town in <span class="loc">Piute County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 142 at the 2000 census. This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the KÃ¶ppen Climate Classification system, Kingston has a humid continental climate, abbreviated "Dfb" on climate maps. Kingston is named for Thomas Rice King, who moved from <span class="loc">Fillmore</span> to <span class="loc">Piute County</span> with his five sons and their families specifically to find a place where they could establish a United Order. In the 1870s Brigham Young was encouraging communal living in United Order communities. The King families' United Order functioned from 1876 to 1883. Kingston became an incorporated town in 1935. The members of the United Order built the village of Kingston on ten acres of land east of <span class="loc">Circleville</span>. "The town consisted of a central community building for school, dances, church and other meetings. A blacksmith shop, milk house, bakery, tailor shop, post office, carpenter shop and store surrounded the meetinghouse. Homes built in like style formed a fort around a ten-acre block. These first log houses had dirt floors and roofs. A communal kitchen and dining hall about seventy feet long stood in the center, with a large vegetable garden close by."</p>
