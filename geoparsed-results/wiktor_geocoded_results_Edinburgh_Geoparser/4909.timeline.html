  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 5,089, making it the third-least populous county in <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Hardin</span>. <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> is located at the tip of the peninsula formed by the confluence of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> and <span class="loc">Illinois</span> rivers and is almost completely surrounded by water. Often referred to as 'The Island,' <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> is sparsely populated; it has just five municipalities, all of them classified as villages. <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> is part of the Metro-East portion of the St. Louis, <span class="loc">MO-IL Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The territory was originally settled by indigenous people who occupied the resource-rich river valleys near waterways. The remains of their occupation have provided some of the most valuable archaeological information in the country. The county's archaeological record chronicles <span class="date">more than 10,000 years</span> of continuous human settlement by Native Americans. <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> was settled by European Americans during the 19th century, and officially organized in <span class="date">1825</span>. It was named for Vice President <span class="per">John C. Calhoun</span>. The southern side of the county, covered in thick forest, was untouched until the population began to expand in the late 1840s with the arrival of German immigrants. Land was cleared for farming, exporting lumber, and constructing spacious log barns, typically 200 square feet (19 m2) in size, which were a "trademark of successful German farmers."</p><br><br>
