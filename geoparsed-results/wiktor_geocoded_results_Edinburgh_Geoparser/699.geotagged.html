<p><span class="loc">Stratford</span> is a town on the <span class="loc">Avon River</span> in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 232 kilometres (144 mi) east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> on the Princes Highway in Shire of Wellington. At the 2006 census, <span class="loc">Stratford</span> had a population of 1950. The town services the local regional community and travellers on the Princes Highway. Stratford's principal industries are dairying, sheep, cattle and horse breeding and vegetable crops. The town has numerous coffee shops and cafes, a cellar door for a local winery, Design Gallery, model railway shop, a pub, parks and playgrounds for car travellers to break their journey. The origin of the town's name is unclear. Many believe it derives from <span class="loc">Stratford-upon-Avon</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>, William Shakespeare's birthplace, a view which is lent credence by the fact that it is located by the river <span class="loc">Avon</span>. Locals have embraced the connection with Shakespeare and a Shakespeare on the River Festival has been a successful annual event since 1989, incorporating works of Shakespeare and modern Australian plays. In 1998 the town formally became a member of the Stratford Sister Cities program to promote friendship and cultural exchange between participating countries.</p>
