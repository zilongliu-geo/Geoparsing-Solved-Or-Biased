  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Almagro</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [alˈmaɣɾo]) is a mostly middle-class barrio (neighbourhood) of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. The neighbourhood is delimited by <span class="loc">La Plata</span> avenue and Río de Janeiro street to the west, Independencia avenue to the south, Sánchez de <span class="loc">Bustamante</span>, Sánchez de <span class="loc">Loria</span> and <span class="loc">Gallo</span> streets to the east, and Córdoba/Estado de <span class="loc">Israel</span> avenues to the north. <span class="loc">Almagro</span> features strong commercial activity along its avenues, and has a high population density due to the many high-rise buildings erected along the railway line. The sectional government of the 6th circuit, which includes <span class="loc">Almagro</span> and <span class="loc">Boedo</span>, is located on Díaz Vélez avenue opposite Centenario park. In the 18th century, what is <span class="date">now</span> the western part of <span class="loc">Almagro</span> belonged to Portuguese merchant <span class="per">Carlos de los Santos</span> <span class="per">Valente</span> and then to his estate. The eastern and northern sections were in the possession of Spaniard <span class="per">Juan María</span> de <span class="loc">Almagro</span> y de la <span class="loc">Torre</span>, a barrister. The Argentine revolutionary government confiscated <span class="loc">Almagro</span>'s lands, only to return them to him in <span class="date">1820</span>. Both <span class="per">Santos Valente</span> and <span class="per">Almagro</span> managed agricultural establishments, and did not favor any kind of urban development.</p><br><br>
