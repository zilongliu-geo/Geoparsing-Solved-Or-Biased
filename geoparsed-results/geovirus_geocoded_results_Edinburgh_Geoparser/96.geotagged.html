<p>The World Health Organization's Beijing spokesman has said that the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span> has withheld vital information regarding H5N1 outbreaks, a type of bird flu that is infecting animals throughout <span class="loc">Asia</span>. The animals most affected by the disease are those among waterfowl and poultry, however in recents months it has infected humans and has also been discovered in tigers as well as swine. The Nation magazine quotes WHO officials as saying that the strain has the potential of causing a human pandemic (global epidemic) resulting in tens of millions of deaths. The first appearance of this type of flu was in <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> during 1997. As of July 21, 2005, one hundred and nine cases of human infection have been confirmed resulting in fifty five deaths outside of <span class="loc">China</span> reports the Centers for Disease Control. <span class="loc">China</span> has reported no deaths in the recent outbreaks, leading to speculation of a cover up. The Economist says eleven countries across <span class="loc">Asia</span> have been affected, and more than one hundred and twenty million birds have died from infection or been culled. Although this week a case was found in <span class="loc">Russia</span> making it the first European country with an infection and twelfth in the world. Usually these flu viruses are carried worldwide by wild bird populations in their intestines and are non-lethal. However this variant has mutated into the most lethal strain of influenza ever recorded says Mike Davis, author of The Monster at Our Door: The Global Threat of Avian Flu. Such occurrences are natural and have happened in the past as in the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. The current virus is morphing into a type that is spread among humans with the first human-to-human cases found in <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> during 2005. When avian influenza subtypes adapt for this mode of transmission the effect is deadly for humans as the immune system has no natural immunities for it and the production of appropriate antibodies to fight the infection takes some time. Further complicating the effort to combat H5N1, it was reported in the Washington Post that the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span> has been administering the medication Amantadine to poultry in violation of international livestock regulations that state it is for human use only since the late-1990s (all the time officially denying any cases of bird flu among its poultry); the result has been that the virus is now largely immune to the medication and is significantly deadlier. World Health Organization officials had been preparing to use the drug to fight a future pandemic and now it has been rendered useless.</p>
