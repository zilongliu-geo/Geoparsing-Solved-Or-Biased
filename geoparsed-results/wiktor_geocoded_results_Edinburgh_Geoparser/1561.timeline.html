  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Henderson</span> is a home rule-class city along the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> in <span class="loc">Henderson County</span> in western <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 28,757 at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Evansville Metropolitan</span> Area, locally known as the "Kentuckiana" or the "Tri-State Area". Notable residents have included the ornithologist, naturalist, and painter <span class="per">John James Audubon</span> and blues legend W.C. Handy. For <span class="date">more than 100 years</span> the city has been home to the Southern <span class="loc">Cherokee Nation</span>. The city was named after Col. <span class="per">Richard Henderson</span>, an eighteenth-century pioneer and land speculator, by his associates Gen. <span class="per">Samuel Hopkins</span> and <span class="per">Thomas Allin</span>. The county, of which <span class="per">Henderson</span> is the seat, also shares this namesake. <span class="per">Henderson</span> has its roots in a small, block-wide strip of land high above the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>, the site of the present <span class="loc">Audubon</span> <span class="loc">Mill Park</span> directly south of the city's riverfront boat dock. A village on this site was called <span class="loc">Red Banks</span> by the local <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> on account of its reddish clay soil. By the early 1790s, <span class="loc">Red Banks</span> had a tavern and several European-American families along with the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>. On <span class="date">Nov. 16, 1792</span>, resident <span class="per">Robert Simpson</span> wrote to Col. <span class="per">Alexander D. Orr</span> in <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, requesting help to appoint a magistrate for <span class="loc">Red Banks</span> to deal with some of its 30 families he felt were of dubious (criminal) character. During this period, the <span class="loc">Red Banks</span> settlement had gained notoriety as a frontier haven for westward moving, outlaws and their families. One such family was that of <span class="per">Squire Samuel Mason</span>. By that time, excluding the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>, the free male inhabitants of <span class="loc">Red Bank</span> totaled 62.</p><br><br>
