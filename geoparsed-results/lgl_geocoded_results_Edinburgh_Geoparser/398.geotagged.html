<p>Hit-and-run defendant makes court appearance. A young woman accused of driving the vehicle that killed Terry A. Corbin in a hit-and-run accident made her first court appearance Thursday morning. Ashley L. Evans, 26, of <span class="loc">Paris</span>, was in the custody of the <span class="loc">Edgar County</span> Sheriff’s Department for an appearance before Judge David W. Lewis. The purpose of the hearing was to advise Evans of the charge against her, explain her trial rights as a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> citizen and to address the issue of legal counsel. Evans is charged with a single Class 1 felony of leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident that resulted in death and failing to report the accident to law enforcement. Lewis advised Evans that a penitentiary sentence of between four and 15 years is possible upon conviction. Probation is another sentencing option. While awaiting her turn before the bench, Evans often sat with her face in her hands. She spoke softly during the hearing and said little except to answer questions from the court, although she did say she will try to hire defense counsel. She was remanded back to custody on a $50,000 bond. Also appearing was Guy C. Harminson, 26, of <span class="loc">Paris</span>. Harminson is charged with a Class 4 felony of obstruction of justice, alleging he provided investigators with false information about the accident in order to prevent Evans’ arrest. Evans and Harminson share a rural Paris address. Harminson said he cannot afford legal counsel and public defender L. Kaye DeSelms was assigned to the case. He was remanded to custody on a $15,000 bond. Corbin died Dec. 6, 2008, at Carle Foundation Hospital in <span class="loc">Urbana</span>, approximately nine-hours after Paris emergency personnel found him lying in the southbound lane of state Route 1 at the Marshall Street cutoff.</p>
