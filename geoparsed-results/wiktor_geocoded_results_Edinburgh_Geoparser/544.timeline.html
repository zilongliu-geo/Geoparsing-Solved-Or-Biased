  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hastings</span> (/ˈheɪstɪŋz/; Māori: <span class="loc">Heretaunga</span>) is a <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> city and is one of the two major urban areas in <span class="loc">Hawke's Bay</span>, on the east coast of the <span class="loc">North Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Hastings</span> is about 68,200 as of the <span class="date">June 2015</span> estimate. <span class="loc">Hastings</span> is about 18 kilometres inland of the coastal <span class="loc">city of Napier</span>. These two neighbouring cities are often called "The Bay Cities" or "The <span class="loc">Twin Cities</span>". The combined population of the <span class="loc">Napier-Hastings urban</span> area is 129,700 people, which makes it the sixth-largest urban area in <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, closely following <span class="loc">Tauranga</span> (130,800). The city is the administrative centre of the <span class="loc">Hastings District</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Hastings</span> and its outlying suburbs of <span class="loc">Flaxmere</span> and <span class="loc">Havelock North</span> are the principal settlements in the <span class="loc">Hastings District</span>. These main centres are surrounded by thirty-eight rural settlements, including <span class="loc">Clive</span> and <span class="loc">Haumoana</span>. <span class="loc">Hastings District</span> covers an area of 5,229 square kilometres (2,019 sq mi) and has 1.7 % of the population of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, ranking it fourteenth in size out of the seventy-four territorial authorities. Since the merger of the surrounding and satellite settlements, <span class="loc">Hastings</span> has grown to become the one of the largest urban areas in <span class="loc">Hawke's Bay</span>.</p><br><br>
