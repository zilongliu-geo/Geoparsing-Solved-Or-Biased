<p>Aurora is a city in <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,508 at the 2010 census. The <span class="loc">Honey Creek</span> area, near Aurora, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> was originally settled by pioneers from <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, including James D. Hillhouse, E. B. Hillhouse, Reverend A. A. Young, James Barrow and James Gibson. They were later instrumental in founding Aurora. Their descendants include actor Brad Pitt and novelist and national security analyst Raelynn Hillhouse. Aurora was laid out in 1870. It was reportedly named after Aurora, the Roman goddess of dawn. Galena ore was discovered in 1885 while digging a well on the farm of Thomas D. Liles in November, 1885, marking the beginning of Aurora as a mining town. Mining of surface outcrops began in 1886. Large scale commercial mining began shortly afterwards as the mines grew deeper and zinc and galena were discovered. The zinc from the Aurora mines was of exceptional purity and high grade. By 1893 12,651 tons of zinc ore were mined and shipped from Aurora. The mines attracted prospectors and minors. Aurora's population peaked at 10,000 around 1900.</p>
