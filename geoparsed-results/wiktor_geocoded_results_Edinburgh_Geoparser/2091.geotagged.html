<p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 741,096. It is the most populous county in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> and is more than twice as large as the second most populous, Fayette. The county was formed in 1780 and named for future President Thomas Jefferson, who was Governor of Virginia at the time. In 2003, its government merged with that of its largest city and county seat, <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, forming a new entity, the Louisville/<span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> Metro Government (official long form) or Louisville Metro (official short form). The new government generally avoids any self-reference including the name "<span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>" and has even renamed the <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> Courthouse as "Metro Hall". <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is the anchor of the <span class="loc">Louisville-Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">KY-IN Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was organized in 1780 and one of the first three counties formed out of the original <span class="loc">Kentucky County</span>, which was still part of Virginia at the time (the other two being Fayette and Lincoln). The county is named for Thomas Jefferson, who was governor of Virginia at the time.</p>
