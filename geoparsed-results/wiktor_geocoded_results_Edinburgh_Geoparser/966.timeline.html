  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Columbus</span> is a 5th-class city in <span class="loc">Hickman County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 170 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, a decline from 229 in <span class="date">2000</span>. <span class="loc">Columbus</span> is the oldest town in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>'s Jackson Purchase. It was first settled on the Mississippi floodplain in <span class="date">1804</span> and known as <span class="loc">Iron Banks</span> after the site's French name les rivages de fer. The long-held local rumor that President <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span> planned to remove the American capital to the site has absolutely no basis in fact. The name of the town was changed to <span class="loc">Columbus</span> (in honor of the Italian explorer) in <span class="date">1820</span>, the year the town received its first post office and its formal establishment by the state assembly. It was the original county seat of <span class="loc">Hickman</span> before the transfer of the court to Clinton. It was formally incorporated in <span class="date">1860</span>, just ahead of its seizure by Confederate forces (including the <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> "Shreveport Rebels") during the American Civil War <span class="date">the next year</span>. The Columbus-Belmont State Park commemorates the Confederate general <span class="per">Leonidas Polk</span>'s attempt to maintain a large anchor chain across the entire <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> at <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, then the northernmost spur on the <span class="per">Mobile</span> and <span class="per">Ohio</span> Railroad, as well as the <span class="org">Union</span> response, <span class="per">General Ulysses</span> S Grant's victory at <span class="loc">Belmont</span> on the Missouri shore. The engagement was Grant's first direct combat during the war.</p><br><br>
