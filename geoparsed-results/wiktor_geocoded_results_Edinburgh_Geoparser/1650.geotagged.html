<p>The <span class="loc">Central Province</span> (Sinhalese: මධ්‍යම පළාත Madhyama Palata, <span class="loc">Tamil</span>: மத்திய மாகாணம் Malaiyakam Maakaanam) is one of the nine provinces of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>, the first level administrative division of the country. (The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> established provincial councils.) The <span class="loc">Central Province</span> is primarily in the central mountainous terrain of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>. It is the 6th largest province by area and is home to 2.5 million people. It is bordered by <span class="loc">North Central Province</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Uva Province</span> to the east, <span class="loc">North Western Province</span> to the west and <span class="loc">Sabaragamuwa Province</span> to the south and west. The province's capital is <span class="loc">Kandy</span>. The <span class="loc">cities of Matale</span> and <span class="loc">Nuwara Eliya</span> are in the <span class="loc">Central Province</span>. The province is famous for its production <span class="loc">Ceylon</span> tea, planted by the British in the 1860s after a devastating disease killed all the coffee plantations in the province. The <span class="loc">Central Province</span> attracts many tourists, with hill station towns such as <span class="loc">Gampola</span>, <span class="loc">Hatton</span> and <span class="loc">Nuwara Eliya</span>.</p>
