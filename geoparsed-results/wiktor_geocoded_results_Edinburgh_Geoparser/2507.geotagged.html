<p><span class="loc">Taylor County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 20,689. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Medford</span>. The earliest recorded event in <span class="loc">Taylor county</span> probably occurred in 1661, when <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> was part of New <span class="loc">France</span>. A band of Huron Indians from eastern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> had fled the <span class="loc">Iroquois</span> and taken refuge near the headwaters of the <span class="loc">Black River</span>, probably around Lake Chelsea in the northeast part of the county. Father Ren√© Menard, a French Jesuit priest who had travelled up the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> as far as <span class="loc">Keweenaw Bay</span> in upper <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, heard that these Hurons were starving. He decided to try to reach them to baptize them, despite his own weak health and scant supplies. In mid-summer he and a French fur trader set out, following rivers and streams in birchbark canoes down into <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. Finally, a day's journey from the Huron camp, Father Menard separated from his travelling companion at a rapids to carry some supplies. He was never seen again. The place where he disappeared is believed to be the dells of the <span class="loc">Big Rib River</span>, below <span class="loc">Goodrich</span> in the southeast corner of <span class="loc">Taylor county</span>.</p>
