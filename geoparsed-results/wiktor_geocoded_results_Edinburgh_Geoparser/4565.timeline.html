  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Bluff is both a town and a locality in the Central Highlands Region, in Central Queensland, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, Bluff had a population of 370. The town is located on the Capricorn Highway, 804 kilometres (500 mi) north west of the state capital, <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>. Bluff's location between some of Queensland's largest coal mines and the port of <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> has led to it becoming a major interchange station for large coal trains, some up to two kilometres long. Based on artefacts found on the nearby Blackdown Tableland National Park, Aboriginal people lived in this area for <span class="date">thousands of years</span>. The first European settlement occurred in the district in the 1860s as early pastoralists moved to the area. The district was originally called <span class="loc">Duckworth</span> or <span class="loc">Duckworth Creek</span>, but in <span class="date">1877</span> the name was changed to Bluff to match the name of the railway station. The Bluff name was derived from a local hill known as Arthur's Bluff. <span class="org">Duckworth Post Office</span> opened by <span class="date">September 1906</span> (a receiving office had been open from <span class="date">late 1905</span>) and was renamed Bluff in <span class="date">1907</span>.</p><br><br>
