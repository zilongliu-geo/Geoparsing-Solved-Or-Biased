It is the main village in the <span class="loc">parish of Rathbarry</span> and the Islands, the southernmost parish in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. It is the main ferry port to <span class="loc">Sherkin Island</span>, <span class="loc">Cape Clear Island</span> and the eastern side of Roaring <span class="loc">Water Bay</span> (Loch Trasna) and Carbery's Hundred Isles. Although the name <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> is an anglicisation of the Irish <span class="loc">Baile</span> an Tí Mhóir meaning "town of the big house", the Irish-language name for <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> is that of the O'Driscoll castle, Dún na Séad or Dunashad ("fort of the jewels"). The recently restored castle is open to the public and overlooks the town. In ancient times, Dunashad was considered a sanctuary for druids and the place name is associated with Bealtaine. <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> has a subtropical maritime climate (Köppen climate classification:Cwb) that borders on humid subtropical climate. There are no significant thermal excursions between summer and winter. <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> enters history as a seat of one of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>'s most ancient dynasties, the once mighty Corcu Loígde, former Kings of Tara and Kings of <span class="loc">Munster</span>.</p>
