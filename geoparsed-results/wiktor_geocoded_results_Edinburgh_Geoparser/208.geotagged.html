<p><span class="loc">Valle de Guadalupe</span> (Valley of Guadalupe), or <span class="loc">Francisco Zarco</span> is a village located in the <span class="loc">Ensenada Municipality</span>, <span class="loc">Baja California</span>, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, 20 km (14 mi) north of the <span class="loc">city of Ensenada</span>. The census of 2010 reported a population of 2,664 inhabitants. The community was founded in 1834 by Dominican missionary Félix Caballero as Misión de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe del Norte, making it the last mission established in the Californias. Caballero had to abandon the mission in 1840, under attacks from the indigenous peoples. From 1905-1910, a mixture of Spiritual Christian faiths from <span class="loc">South Russia</span>, mostly Pryguny, settled in 4 farming colonies near <span class="loc">Ensenada</span>, <span class="loc">Baja</span> <span class="loc">California</span> <span class="loc">Norte</span> Territory, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. Guadalupe was the main colony of about 20+ square miles purchased in 1905. Most owned or rented land communally. Not all were ethnic Russians, and were of various faiths. They also rented as much as 50 square miles from about 10 nearby ranches. A few other immigrants from <span class="loc">Russia</span> lived in <span class="loc">Ensenada city</span>. Most moved to <span class="loc">California</span> during WWII to join more prosperous relatives and work in the war industries. Most of those who remain, intermarried and live in <span class="loc">Ensenada</span> and <span class="loc">Tijuana</span>.</p>
