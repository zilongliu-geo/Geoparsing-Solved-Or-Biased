  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Frankfort</span> is a town on the <span class="loc">Penobscot River</span> estuary in <span class="loc">Waldo County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,124 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> is the oldest town on the <span class="loc">Penobscot River</span>, first settled in the 1760s by Massachusetts soldiers from nearby Fort Pownall. With the end of the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span>, the <span class="loc">Penobscot</span> Valley became part of <span class="loc">New England</span>, and more specifically <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, leading to the first cautious encroachments by English-speaking settlers on the lands of the <span class="loc">Penobscot</span> Indians. This process, which would begin in <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>, would end with the founding of <span class="loc">Bangor</span>, Brewer, <span class="loc">Orono</span>, <span class="loc">Old Town</span> and other inland settlements, and the eventual restriction of the <span class="loc">Penobscot</span> people to their major village at "Indian <span class="loc">Old Town</span>", or the present <span class="loc">Penobscot</span> Indian Reservation. <span class="date">Today</span>'s <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> is just a small portion of the original town, which contained the present-day towns of <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>, <span class="loc">Winterport</span>, <span class="loc">Stockton Springs</span>, and Prospect. Ft. <span class="loc">Pownall</span> was thus in <span class="loc">Frankfort</span>, and the town's major village was what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Winterport</span>. <span class="loc">Frankfort</span> was a logical place for settlement not only because <span class="loc">Verona Island</span> commanded the approach up the river, but because the river above the town froze during the <span class="date">winter</span>, making this the last ice-free port as one ascended â€” hence the name "<span class="loc">Winterport</span>".</p><br><br>
