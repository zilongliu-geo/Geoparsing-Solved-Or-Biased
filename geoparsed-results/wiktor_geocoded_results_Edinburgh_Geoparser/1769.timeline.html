  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Geneva</span> is an unincorporated community in the northwestern part of <span class="loc">Allen County</span>, located in southeast <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, in the central <span class="loc">United States</span>. Although official populations are not compiled for unincorporated places, the population of the surrounding Geneva Township was 172 in the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The town of <span class="loc">Geneva</span> was founded by free-state men in the <span class="date">summer of 1857</span>. A colony was formed in <span class="loc">New York</span> under the leadership of Ephraim Fisk, and another in <span class="loc">Michigan</span> under the leadership of <span class="per">Merritt Moore</span>. These united, forming the <span class="org">Union</span> Settlement Association, among the prominent members in which were <span class="per">Dr. B.L.G. Stone, G.L.</span> <span class="per">Wait, S.T.</span> <span class="loc">Jones</span>, <span class="per">Rev. G.S. Northrup, I.A.</span> <span class="loc">Holman, P.P.</span> <span class="loc">Phillips, E.J.</span> <span class="per">Brinkerhoff, J.H.</span> <span class="loc">Spicer, A.P.</span> <span class="loc">Sain, H.R.</span> <span class="per">Somers, Frank</span> <span class="per">Ureidenberg, J.C.</span> <span class="loc">Redfield</span>, and J.M. Mattoon. The colony selected the northwestern part of <span class="loc">Allen County</span> for a location, and started out with great expectations. There were about 300 families engaged to settle at once. It was decided to locate and lay out a town comprising not less than 640 acres (2.6 km2) of land. The site was chosen on account of the fertile prairie land around, as well as the heavy timber so close along the banks of the streams. It was decided to at once begin the building of a large structure and to found a non-sectarian college and academy.</p><br><br>
