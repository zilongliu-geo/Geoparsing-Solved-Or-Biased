  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Remedios</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈmeðjos]), also known as <span class="loc">San Juan de los Remedios</span>, is a city and municipality located 3 miles (4.8 km) from the northern coast of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, in the center of the island. It is the oldest Spanish settlement in the former <span class="loc">Las Villas</span> province. It is <span class="date">now</span> part of the province of <span class="loc">Villa Clara</span>. It was declared a City by <span class="per">Isabella II</span> of <span class="loc">Spain</span>, when the Island was still a colony. <span class="loc">Remedios</span> is the Cradle of the Parrandas, possibly the Caribbean's largest and oldest traditional festivity. Its patrons are <span class="loc">San Juan Bautista</span> and the <span class="org">Virgin</span> of the Buenviaje. <span class="loc">Remedios</span> is located about 4 hours away by bus from <span class="loc">Havana</span>, around 50 minutes from <span class="loc">Santa Clara</span> and there is less than an hour from there to beach resorts in the <span class="per">Santa María</span> - <span class="loc">Las Brujas</span> cays both situated north of the province. The municipality limits to the north with <span class="loc">Caibarien</span>, to the south with <span class="loc">Camajuani</span> and <span class="loc">Placetas</span>, and to the east with <span class="loc">Yaguajay</span> ( <span class="loc">Sancti Spiritus</span>) It is recognized as the eighth oldest city in <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, but its real date of foundation has been obscured over time, and it may be the second Spanish settlement on the island. Historians place the foundation date sometime between <span class="date">1513</span> and <span class="date">1524</span> by Spanish nobleman <span class="per">Vasco Porcallo de Figueroa</span>, originally founded by him on the <span class="date">13th of April 1514</span>. Documents reflect that this settlement was only preceded by <span class="loc">Baracoa</span> (<span class="date">1511</span>) and (Bayamo)(<span class="date">1512</span>). Considering these facts some believe it was actually founded before <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> (<span class="date">1514</span>). Rumor has it that <span class="per">Vasco</span>, in order to avoid tax payments to the crown, maintained the village hidden from the knowledge of the <span class="per">King of Spain</span> as long as he could, but the village grew quickly, and at some point it had to be recognized. Through his wife, the daughter of the <span class="loc">Cacique</span> of Sabaneque, <span class="per">Vasco</span> received a huge land grant as a personal fief from Gobernor <span class="per">Diego Velazquez</span> as stipulated by Spanish law, therefore it had no municipal entity to govern the town. Upon <span class="per">Vasco</span>'s death in <span class="loc">Puerto Principe</span> in <span class="date">1550</span> the town obtained its charter.</p><br><br>
