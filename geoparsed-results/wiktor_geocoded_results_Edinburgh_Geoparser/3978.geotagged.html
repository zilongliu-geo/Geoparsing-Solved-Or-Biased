<p>Brewster /ˈbruːstər/ is a town in <span class="loc">Barnstable County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="loc">Barnstable County</span> being coextensive with Cape Cod. The population of Brewster was 9,820 at the 2010 census. Brewster is twinned with the town of <span class="loc">Budleigh Salterton</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. Brewster was first settled in 1656 as a northeastern parish of the town of <span class="loc">Harwich</span>. The town separated from <span class="loc">Harwich</span> as the northern, more wealthy parish in 1693, and was officially incorporated as its own town in 1803 when the less wealthy citizens of <span class="loc">Harwich</span> were upset that the town's institutions were all on Brewster's main street (now Route 6A), including the town hall and churches. Brewster was named in honor of Elder William Brewster, the first religious leader of the Pilgrims at <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span>. The town's history grew around <span class="loc">Stony Brook</span>, where the first water-powered grist and woolen mill in the country was founded in the late 17th century. There were many rich sea captains in the town, who built many of the mansions and stately homes which now constitute the town's inns and bed-and-breakfasts. Most notable of these are the <span class="loc">Crosby</span> Mansion on <span class="loc">Crosby</span> Lane by <span class="loc">Crosby</span> Beach, which is currently undergoing renovations to allow for more weddings and other functions, and the Captain Freeman Inn on Breakwater Road.</p>
