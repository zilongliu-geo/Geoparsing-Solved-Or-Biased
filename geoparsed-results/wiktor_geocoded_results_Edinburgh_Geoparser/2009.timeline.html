  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Jalalabad /dʒəˈlæləˌbæd/ (Pashto/Persian: جلال آباد Jalālābād), formerly called Adina Pur (Pushto:آدينه پور) as documented by the 7th century Hsüan-tsang, is a city in eastern <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>. Located at the junction of the <span class="loc">Kabul River</span> and <span class="loc">Kunar River</span> near the Laghman valley, <span class="loc">Jalalabad</span> is the capital of <span class="loc">Nangarhar province</span>. It is linked by approximately 155 kilometres (95 mi) of highway with <span class="loc">Kabul</span> to the west. <span class="loc">Jalalabad</span> is the second-largest city in eastern <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span> as well as the centre of its social and business activity because of its border to <span class="loc">Pakistan</span> which is the main source of products to all of <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>. Major industries include papermaking, as well as agricultural products including oranges, rice and sugarcane. <span class="loc">Jalalabad</span> is one of the leading trading centres with neighbouring <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Jalalabad</span> has a population of 356,274 (in <span class="date">2015</span>). it has 6 districts and a total land area of 12,796 Hectares. The total number of dwellings in this city are 39,586. The Jalalabad territory fell to the <span class="per">Maurya</span> Empire (322–185 BCE), which was led by <span class="per">Chandragupta Maurya</span>. The Mauryas introduced Jainism, <span class="per">Hinduism</span> and <span class="per">Buddhism</span> to the region, and were planning to capture more areas of Central <span class="loc">Asia</span> until they faced local Greco-Bactrian forces. Seleucus is said to have agreed a peace treaty with <span class="per">Chandragupta</span> by giving control of the territory south of the <span class="loc">Hindu Kush</span> to the Mauryas upon intermarriage and receipt of 500 elephants.</p><br><br>
