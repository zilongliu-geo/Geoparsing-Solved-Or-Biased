<p>Broken road sign will be replaced in four months. A road sign in <span class="loc">East Oxford</span> which was damaged a year ago is set to be replaced. People living in Divinity Road, first noticed the letters to their street sign had been removed in March last year. <span class="loc">Oxford City</span> Council has said it did not realise the letters were missing and pledged to install a new cast-iron or aluminium replacement in four months’ time. A temporary sign will be put up in a couple of weeks. Elizabeth Mills, 57, of Divinity Road, said: “It’s unsightly and it’s dangerous. If you are looking for Divinity Road and you don’t know where you are going, you are dithering about trying to see if it’s the road.” Father-of-one Simon Collcutt, 57, who lives nearest to the missing sign, said: “This is a boisterous area and anything that isn’t really nailed down solid will be smashed in no time.”</p>
