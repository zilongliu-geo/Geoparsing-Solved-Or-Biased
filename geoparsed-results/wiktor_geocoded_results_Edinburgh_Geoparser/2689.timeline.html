  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Winchester</span> is a small suburban town located in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, eight miles north of downtown <span class="loc">Boston</span>. It is an affluent bedroom community for professionals who work in the greater Boston area. The population was 21,374 at the <span class="date">2010</span> United States Census. The land on which <span class="loc">Winchester</span> <span class="date">now</span> sits was purchased from Native Americans by representatives of the settlement of <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> in <span class="date">1639</span>, and the area was first settled by Europeans in <span class="date">1640</span>. In the early <span class="date">years</span> of the settlement, the area was known informally as Waterfield, a reference to its many ponds and to the river which bisected the central village. In its second century, the area was referred to as Black Horse Village, after the busy tavern and hostelry in its center. Until the middle of the 19th century, parts of <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, <span class="loc">Medford</span>, <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, and <span class="loc">Woburn</span> comprised what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Winchester</span>. The movement toward incorporation of what, by this time, was called <span class="loc">South Woburn</span> was likely precipitated by the rise of the <span class="org">Whig Party</span> in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> (History of <span class="loc">Winchester</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> by H. S. <span class="per">Chapman</span> and <span class="per">Bruce</span> W. Stone, <span class="date">1936</span>, <span class="date">1975</span>).</p><br><br>
