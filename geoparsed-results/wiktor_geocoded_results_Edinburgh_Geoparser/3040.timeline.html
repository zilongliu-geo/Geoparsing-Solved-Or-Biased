  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Vallecito</span> ("Little Valley" in Spanish; formerly, <span class="loc">Murphy's Old Diggings</span>, <span class="loc">Valacito</span>, <span class="loc">Vallicita</span>, <span class="loc">Vallicito</span>) is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Calaveras County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 442 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 427 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The town is registered as <span class="loc">California</span> Historical Landmark #273. Nearby is Moaning Cavern, the largest cave chamber in <span class="loc">California</span>, which the Miwok Indians used as a burial ground. <span class="loc">Vallecito</span> was one of <span class="loc">California</span>'s important early-day mining towns. Gold was discovered here by the <span class="org">Murphy brothers</span> in <span class="date">1849</span>, and it was originally called "Murphys Diggings," which became "Murphys Old Diggings" when they moved on to greener pastures at "Murphys <span class="loc">New Diggings</span>" (which became the town of Murphys). The town was revitalized in <span class="date">1852</span> when extremely rich deposits of gold were discovered running practically through the center of town. A post office was established in <span class="date">1854</span>, which is still in use <span class="date">today</span>. The Vallecito Bell, cast at Troy, <span class="loc">New York</span> in <span class="date">1853</span>, was brought around <span class="loc">Cape Horn</span>. It was purchased from the ship with funds contributed by early-day residents and brought to <span class="loc">Vallecito</span> to be erected in a large oak tree in <span class="date">1854</span>. It was used to call the people together until <span class="date">February 16, 1939</span>, when a severe wind blew the old tree down.</p><br><br>
