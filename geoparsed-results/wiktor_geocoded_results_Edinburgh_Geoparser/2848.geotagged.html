<p><span class="loc">Charleston</span> is the oldest and second-largest city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, the county seat of <span class="loc">Charleston County</span>, and the principal city in the <span class="loc">Charleston–North Charleston–Summerville Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The city lies just south of the geographical midpoint of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>'s coastline and is located on <span class="loc">Charleston</span> Harbor, an inlet of the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> formed by the confluence of the <span class="loc">Ashley</span> and Cooper Rivers, or, as is locally expressed, "where the Cooper and Ashley Rivers come together to form the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>." Founded in 1670 as Charles Town in honor of King Charles II of <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">Charleston</span> adopted its present name in 1783. It moved to its present location on <span class="loc">Oyster Point</span> in 1680 from a location on the west bank of the <span class="loc">Ashley River</span> known as <span class="loc">Albemarle Point</span>. By 1690, Charles Town was the fifth-largest city in <span class="loc">North America</span>, and it remained among the 10 largest cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span> through the 1840 census. With a 2010 census population of 120,083  (and a 2014 estimate of 130,113), current trends put <span class="loc">Charleston</span> as the fastest-growing municipality in <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>. The population of the <span class="loc">Charleston</span> metropolitan area, comprising <span class="loc">Berkeley</span>, <span class="loc">Charleston</span>, and <span class="loc">Dorchester Counties</span>, was counted by the 2014 estimate at 727,689 – the third-largest in the state – and the 78th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p>
