<p><span class="loc">Newport</span>, historically known as Ballyveaghan (Irish: Baile Uí Fhiacháin) - for many years the town was also known as Newport-Pratt - is a small picturesque town in the barony of Burrishoole, <span class="loc">County Mayo</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span> with a population of 590 in 2006. It is located on the west coast of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, along the shore of <span class="loc">Clew Bay</span>, north of <span class="loc">Westport</span>. The N59 road passes through the town. The county town of <span class="loc">Castlebar</span> is approx 18 km east of <span class="loc">Newport</span>. The Black <span class="loc">Oak River</span> flows through the centre of the town and there are pleasant walking paths along its grassy banks. <span class="loc">Newport</span> was established in the early 18th century by the Medlycott family. James Moore, working for the Medlycott Estate, designed the quay at <span class="loc">Newport</span> in a formal layout. The Medlycott family's land agent was a Captain Pratt. Pratt introduced linen manufacturing to the town under the management of immigrant Quakers who relocated to Co. <span class="loc">Mayo</span> from <span class="loc">Ulster</span>. It would appear that, although the immigrant Quakers consequently found living conditions in <span class="loc">Mayo</span> too difficult, the linen industry picked up in the mid-18th century and for the next forty years or so the town prospered around the industry, but in the early 19th century it again fell into decline as it was superseded as a port by the town of <span class="loc">Westport</span> seven miles to the south. At the end of the 18th century, the Medlycott Estate was taken over by the O'Donel family who built Newport House, now a hotel, overlooking the harbour.</p>
