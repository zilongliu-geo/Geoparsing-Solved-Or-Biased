  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Cumberland</span> is the northeasternmost town in <span class="loc">Providence County</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, first settled in <span class="date">1635</span> and incorporated in <span class="date">1746</span>. The population was 33,506 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Cumberland</span> was originally settled as part of <span class="loc">Rehoboth</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, which was purchased from the local Native Americans by the <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span>. It was later transferred to <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> as part of a long-running boundary dispute. The town was named in honor of <span class="per">Prince William</span>, <span class="per">Duke of Cumberland</span>. <span class="per">William Blackstone</span> (also spelled <span class="per">William Blaxton</span> in colonial times) was the first European to settle and live in <span class="per">Cumberland</span>. (He was also the first European to have settled in <span class="loc">Boston</span>, but left when he and the newly arrived Puritans disagreed about religion.) He preached his brand of tolerant Christianity under an oak tree that became an inspiration to Christians worldwide. He lived on a farm in the <span class="org">Lonsdale</span> area of <span class="per">Cumberland</span>, where he cultivated the first variety of American apples, the Yellow Sweeting. The site of his home is <span class="date">now</span> occupied by the <span class="org">Ann &amp; Hope</span> mill. The popular tourist destination "Nine Men's Misery" is a tomb found on the grounds of a former Trappist monastery (Abbey of Our Lady of the Valley), part of which was destroyed in a fire in <span class="date">1950</span>. The Trappists sold the monastery and grounds to the town and part of the building was converted into the <span class="per">Edward J. Hayden</span> Library, aka <span class="per">Cumberland</span> Public Library in <span class="date">1976</span>. This combined three smaller libraries into one.</p><br><br>
