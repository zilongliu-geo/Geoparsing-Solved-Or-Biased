  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Claremont</span> is a suburb of Cape Town, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It is situated six miles south of the city, and is one of the so-called "Southern Suburbs". It is an important commercial and residential area, which is currently experiencing significant growth and development. Until the arrival of Dutch colonists in <span class="date">1652</span>, the uncultivated veld of the <span class="loc">Cape Peninsula</span> was used by the nomadic Khoisan to grazed their cattle. The Dutch established an outpost on the shore of <span class="loc">Table Bay</span>, and in <span class="date">1657</span> they established a number of farms south of the outpost. The most southerly of those original farms, named <span class="per">Louwvliet</span> and <span class="per">Questenburg</span>, are <span class="date">today</span> covered by the suburbs of <span class="loc">Claremont</span> and <span class="loc">Newlands</span>. The area was agricultural for <span class="date">about 150 years</span>. Other estates that were established included Veldhuyzen in <span class="date">1676</span>, <span class="loc">Stellenberg</span> in <span class="date">1697</span>, <span class="loc">Weltevreden</span> (originally part of <span class="loc">Stellenberg</span>) in <span class="date">1730</span>, <span class="loc">Sans Souci</span> (originally part of <span class="per">Questenburg</span>) in <span class="date">1786</span>, and The Vineyard in <span class="date">1798</span>. They produced grain and grapes, and some farmers made wine. After the colony had been taken over by the British in <span class="date">1814</span>, the area gradually changed its character. British settlers and officials bought the farms, renamed some of them, and turned them into country residences. <span class="loc">Weltevreden</span> was subdivided in <span class="date">1822</span>, and it was a portion of it that was later to be renamed <span class="loc">Claremont</span>. The distinguished British astronomer Sir <span class="per">John Herschel</span> put the area on the map by living at <span class="loc">Feldhausen</span> (formerly Veldhuyzen) from <span class="date">1834</span> to <span class="date">1838</span>.</p><br><br>
