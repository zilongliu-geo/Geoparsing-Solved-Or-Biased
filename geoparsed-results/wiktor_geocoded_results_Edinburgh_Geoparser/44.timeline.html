  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Rita</span> (Chamorro: SÃ¥nta Rita) is a village located on the southwest coast of the <span class="loc">United States</span> territory of <span class="loc">Guam</span> with hills overlooking Apra Harbor. According to the <span class="date">2000</span> census it has a population of 7,500, down from 11,857 in <span class="date">1990</span>. <span class="loc">Santa Rita</span> is the newest village in <span class="loc">Guam</span>, having been established after the Second World War. Prior to the War, the village of <span class="loc">Sumay</span> occupied the <span class="loc">Orote Peninsula</span>, which forms the southern boundary of Apra Harbor. Once a thriving commerce center, it suffered severe devastation from bombardment by the <span class="loc">United States</span> military forces during the Liberation of <span class="loc">Guam</span> from the Empire of <span class="loc">Japan</span>. The <span class="loc">U.S.</span> military assumed control over the ruins of <span class="loc">Sumay</span> and built Naval Station, while the residents of <span class="loc">Sumay</span> were relocated to the hills between their former village and <span class="loc">Fena</span>. They established a new village, naming the settlement after <span class="per">Saint Rita</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, the <span class="loc">Fena</span> area, which houses Naval Magazine and <span class="loc">Fena</span> Lake (a main source of fresh water for the island), borders the eastern boundary of the village of <span class="loc">Santa Rita</span>. The <span class="loc">Department of Education</span> serves the public schools in <span class="loc">Santa Rita</span>.</p><br><br>
