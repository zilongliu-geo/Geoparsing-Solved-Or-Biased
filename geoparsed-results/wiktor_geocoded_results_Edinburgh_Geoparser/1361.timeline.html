  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Concord</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. <span class="loc">Louis County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 16,421 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It should not be confused with <span class="org">Concord</span> Township or <span class="org">Concord</span> Village; the CDP shares much land with both, but these areas' boundaries are not identical. <span class="org">Concord</span> is located at 38°30′52″N 90°21′13″W (38.514386, -90.353666). The CDP is shaped roughly like a figure 8, with the southern loop larger and more rounded than the angular northern loop. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 5.5 square miles (14 km2), all of it land. <span class="org">Concord</span> is mostly bounded by highways—by Interstate 255, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 67 (locally called Lindbergh Boulevard and co-signed here with <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 50 and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 61), Route 21 (known locally as Tesson Ferry Road), and Route 30 (known locally as Gravois Road). Interstate 270 bisects the CDP's southern node. Most of <span class="org">Concord</span> lies in the 63128 ZIP code; however, a significant northern portion is assigned to the 63123 ZIP code.</p><br><br>
