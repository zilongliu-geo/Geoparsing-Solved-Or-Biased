  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alexandria is a village in <span class="loc">Thayer County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 177 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In the 1840s and 1850s, the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trail passed through present-day <span class="loc">Thayer County</span>, following the <span class="loc">Little Blue River</span> through southeastern <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> before crossing into the valley of the <span class="loc">Platte River</span>. Settlers arrived along the trail in the late 1850s. The first permanent white residents of the county arrived in <span class="date">1858</span>, settling about two and a half miles (about four kilometers) south of present-day Alexandria, on the divide between the <span class="loc">Little Blue</span> and <span class="loc">Big Sandy Creek</span>. In <span class="date">1859</span>, <span class="per">Isaac Alexander</span> arrived from <span class="loc">Kansas</span> with a portable gristmill; he settled on <span class="loc">Big Sandy Creek</span>, where he built a log cabin and stockade. In <span class="date">1872</span>, the St. <span class="per">Joseph</span> and <span class="per">Denver</span> Railroad (later the St. <span class="per">Joseph</span> and <span class="loc">Grand Island</span>) was extended into <span class="loc">Thayer County</span>. The railroad passed through the <span class="per">Alexander</span> family's property. At the railroad's behest, the <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> Land and Town Company platted towns along its route, naming them in alphabetical order; the easternmost of these was Alexandria, followed by <span class="loc">Belvidere</span>, <span class="loc">Carleton</span>, and Davenport. The town was named after <span class="per">Isaac Alexander</span>'s son, S. J. <span class="per">Alexander</span>, who had been involved in negotiating the railroad's route through <span class="loc">Thayer County</span>, and who later served as <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>'s Secretary of State.</p><br><br>
