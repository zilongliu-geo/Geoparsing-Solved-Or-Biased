<p><span class="loc">Pula</span> (Latin: Nora) is a comune (municipality) in the <span class="loc">Province of Cagliari</span> in the Italian region of <span class="loc">Sardinia</span>, located about 25 kilometres (16 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">Cagliari</span>. As of December 31, 2004, it had a population of 6,937, and an area of 138.7 square kilometres (53.6 sq mi). <span class="loc">Pula</span> is a popular holiday resort, with many famous hotels and beaches. The ruins of the ancient <span class="loc">city of Nora</span> are among the most important archaeological sites of the island. The Municipality of <span class="loc">Pula</span> contains the frazione (subdivision) <span class="loc">Santa Margherita</span> di <span class="loc">Pula</span>. <span class="loc">Pula</span> is located near the ancient <span class="loc">city of Nora</span>. Nora was built by Phoenicians around the eighth century B.C. <span class="loc">Pula</span> may have arisen from pre-existing nuragic settlements, of which there are some testimonials, or according to the legend by the Iberians conducted in <span class="loc">Sardinia</span> by Norax. During the following centuries, the city was ruled by the Punics, and then by the Romans. The latter raised it for a short time in the capital of the <span class="loc">province of Corsica</span> et <span class="loc">Sardinia</span>, and then gave that title to the nearby Caralis (modern <span class="loc">Cagliari</span>). After the end of the Roman Empire, like many other ancient Sardinian coastal cities, because of the Saracen raids, the <span class="loc">city of Nora</span> ceased to exist from about the eighth century AD.</p>
