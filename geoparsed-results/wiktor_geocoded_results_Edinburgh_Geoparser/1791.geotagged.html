<p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 8,118, making it the fourth-least populous county in <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Meadville</span>. The county was formed on December 21, 1809 from portions of <span class="loc">Adams County</span> and named for Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. It is bisected by the <span class="loc">Homochitto River</span>, which runs diagonally through the county from northeast to southwest. This was the fourth county organized in <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. It was initially developed for agriculture, specifically cotton plantations based on enslaved labor of African Americans. Cotton continued to be important to the economy through the 19th century and into the early 20th century. This still rural county has had a decline in population by about half since 1910. It is the fourth least populous county in the state. Mechanization of agriculture and the blight of the boll weevil both reduced the need for farm workers; they left the area and often the state. Many African Americans went north or west in the Great Migration before and after World War II. The county in the 21st century is majority white in population; in the 2000 census, African Americans composed more than 36% of the population. (See Demographics section below.)</p>
