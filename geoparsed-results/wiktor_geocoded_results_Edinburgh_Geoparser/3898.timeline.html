  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Danao</span> is a fourth income class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Bohol</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, located 95 kilometres (59 mi) north-east of the provincial capital, <span class="loc">Tagbilaran</span>, with land area of 9,786 hectares (24,180 acres). According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 17,952; and at the <span class="date">2010</span> national election, there were 9,987 registered voters. According to the Diccionario Español-Bisaya (<span class="date">1885</span>), <span class="loc">Danao</span> means lago, laguna, pantano, estanque grande, avenida, campañas, etc. (lake, lagoon, freshet, large reservoir, arable land, field, etc.). Except that of a lake, all definitions of danao describe the municipality of <span class="loc">Danao</span>, with freshet being the most likely meaning. A freshet is either a sudden rise or overflow of a stream or river, or freshwater stream emptying into the sea. The Isumod river flowing near the town center of <span class="loc">Danao</span> may suddenly overflow and inundate a large portion of the town. The river joins the Wahig river and empties into the sea. Eco, Extreme, and Educational Adventure Tour (EAT) <span class="loc">Danao</span> offers a great new experience of <span class="loc">Bohol</span>. One can soar across one of Bohol's most attractive gorges like a bird; raft or canoe on a river; explore caves; practise mountain climbing, both on a wall, and on real cliffs; and explore some of the wildest spots of the island.</p><br><br>
