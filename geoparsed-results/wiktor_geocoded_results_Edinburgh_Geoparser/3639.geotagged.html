<p><span class="loc">Ina</span> is the southern-most village in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,455 as of the 2000 census. It is part of the Mount Vernon Micropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Ina</span> is located at 38°9′2″N 88°54′17″W (38.150648, -88.904709). According to the 2010 census, <span class="loc">Ina</span> has a total area of 2.45 square miles (6.35 km2), all land. <span class="loc">Ina</span> was located on high ground adjacent to the <span class="loc">Casey Creek</span>/<span class="loc">Big Muddy River</span> bottoms. The <span class="loc">Big Muddy</span> has since been dammed to form Rend Lake. Many <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> families settled in <span class="loc">Ina</span> around 1840. They were apparently refugees from the Trail of Tears. In the 1800s, <span class="loc">Ina</span> was jokingly referred to as "the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> Reservation." The main settlement in this area was <span class="loc">Spring Garden</span>, about three miles northeast of <span class="loc">Ina</span>. <span class="loc">Spring Garden</span> prospered from 1848 until the <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and Eastern <span class="loc">Illinois Railroad</span> was built in 1905. After that, the population and business shifted over to the depots at <span class="loc">Ina</span> and <span class="loc">Bonnie</span>. <span class="loc">Ina</span> is the home of the <span class="loc">Big Muddy River</span> Correctional Center and Rend Lake College. A famous double murder occurred in <span class="loc">Ina</span> in 1924, when Rev. Lawrence Hight and his lover Elsie Sweeten poisoned Sweeten's husband, in July, and Hight's wife in September. Autopsies revealed arsenic. Hight and Sweeten were both sent to prison. Elsie Sweeten was granted another trial and was later acquitted of murder and released from Jail.</p>
