<p><span class="loc">San Antonio</span>, or unofficially San Ann as the locals call it, is a city in <span class="loc">Pasco County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a suburban city included in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, <span class="loc">Florida Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It lies within <span class="loc">Florida</span>'s 5th congressional district. The population was 1,138 at the 2010 census. It was established as a Catholic colony by Judge Edmund F. Dunne. The city derives its name from <span class="loc">Saint Anthony</span>. Saint Leo University is located nearby. <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> is located at 28°20′12″N 82°16′30″W (28.336649, -82.275011). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.1 km2), all land. <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> was founded (in name only) in 1881 by Edmund F. Dunne who previously had been chief justice of the Arizona territory. Dunne was a legal counsel involved in the Disston Land Purchase, and as his commission, received 100,000 choice acres (400 km2) of land out of the 4,000,000 acre (16,000 km²) purchase. The following year on February 15, while surveying the Disston Purchase with his cousin, Captain Hugh Dunne, Judge Dunne selected the city's location and began settling it. He established the city as the center of a Catholic colony in <span class="loc">Florida</span>. Dunne planned several other villages for the surrounding area including <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span>, <span class="loc">Saint Thomas</span>, <span class="loc">Villa Maria</span>, <span class="loc">Carmel</span> and <span class="loc">San Felipe</span>, but only the rural community of <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> survives today. In 1889 the Benedictines established the monastery of St. Leo and St. Leo College on Dunne's former homestead and farm land, later incorporating the area as part of a separate town, St. Leo, <span class="loc">Florida</span>. At the time of its founding <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> was located in the southern third of <span class="loc">Hernando County</span>, as <span class="loc">Pasco County</span> was not created until 1887. The Orange Belt Railway first began service to <span class="loc">San Antonio</span> in November 1887.</p>
