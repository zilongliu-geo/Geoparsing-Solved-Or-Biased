<p><span class="loc">Farmington</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the town population was 7,760. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> is home to the University of Maine at Farmington, the Nordica Memorial Auditorium, the Homestead, and the annual Farmington Fair. The area was once territory of the Canibas tribe of Abenaki Indians. They had two camps located near <span class="loc">Farmington Falls</span>, with fields cleared for cultivation of maize and potatoes. Their fort's stockade enclosed about an acre at the center of what is today <span class="loc">Farmington Falls</span> village. A group from <span class="loc">Topsham</span> arrived in 1776 to explore the area and lay out a town, called Plantation No. 1 or Sandy River Plantation, but permanent settlement was delayed by the Revolutionary War. In 1781, the first settlers arrived, the same year a sawmill was established. On February 1, 1794, Sandy River Plantation was incorporated as <span class="loc">Farmington</span>, named for its unusually fertile soil. Beginning with a cluster of log houses at <span class="loc">Farmington Falls</span>, the town grew quickly and prospered. Agriculture was an important early occupation, with hay a principal product. Orchards yielded apples and other fruit. <span class="loc">Farmington</span> became one of the largest wool producing towns in <span class="loc">New England</span>, with many herds of sheep grazing the hills and intervales.</p>
