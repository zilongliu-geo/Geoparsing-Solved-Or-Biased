<p>Burton is a village in <span class="loc">Geauga County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,455 at the 2010 census. Burton was founded in 1798 and is <span class="loc">Geauga County</span>'s oldest settlement. Like many other early settlements in the Connecticut Western Reserve, Burton has a town square patterned after the village greens of <span class="loc">New England</span>. In 1972, an incident in Burton lead to a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> case. Hugo Zacchini performed a human cannonball act at Burton's annual <span class="loc">Geauga County</span> Fair and WEWS-TV recorded and aired the entire act against his wishes and without compensating him, as was required by <span class="loc">Ohio</span> law. In Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., the high court ruled in 1977 that the First Amendment did not shield the broadcaster from liability from common law copyright claims. Burton is located at 41°28′18″N 81°8′49″W (41.471584, -81.146888). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.05 square miles (2.72 km2), all land. Local elementary and secondary public education is provided by the Berkshire Local School District, which also serves the surrounding communities of Burton Township, <span class="loc">Claridon</span> Township and Troy Township. The school district's one high school, Berkshire High School, is located just north of Burton's town square. The district's only elementary school is located in Burton. The Claridon Elementary School was closed in 2005, and the Troy Elementary School was closed in 2009.</p>
