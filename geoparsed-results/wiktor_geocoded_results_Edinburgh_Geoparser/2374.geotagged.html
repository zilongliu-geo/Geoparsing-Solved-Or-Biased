Kami is located in west-central Miyagi Prefecture, bordered by Yamagata Prefecture to the west. The area of present-day Kami was part of ancient <span class="loc">Mutsu Province</span>, and has been settled since at least the Jomon period by the Emishi people. During later portion of the Heian period, the area was ruled by the Northern <span class="loc">Fujiwara</span>. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested by various samurai clans before the area came under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate. The modern town of Kami was created on April 1, 2003, as a result of a merger between three towns, <span class="loc">Miyazaki</span>, <span class="loc">Nakaniida</span>, and <span class="loc">Onoda</span>, all from Kami District. The economy of Kami is largely based on agriculture, primarily the cultivation of rice. Kami is not currently served by any railway lines.</p>
