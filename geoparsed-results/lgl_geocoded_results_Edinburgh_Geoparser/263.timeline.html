  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Gift vendors rake in sales as sons and daughters mark <span class="date">Mother's Day</span> . Chebel Rahme insisted that his appreciation stems from many things that his mother <span class="loc">Nawal</span> continues to do daily to show her care and love for him, but added that he also recognizes how much she sacrificed of her own comfort in life, "to make us happy, to make us comfortable," especially during hard times. When asked what gift he would like to give her, Rahme paused and said, "I want to give back to her in my lifetime as much as she gave to me in hers." To cater to an increased demand for greater variety in gift choices, Theirry's featured new collections of gifts <span class="date">this year</span>, including themed items from aprons, gloves, and slippers to fancy vases and flowers - all with the <span class="date">2009</span> color scheme of pink and white for the holiday. As a non-native of <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>, one might ask what makes mothers the object of so much ardent affection on this annual holiday. <span class="loc">Mawla</span> thinks it's because "she is more close to her children compared to mothers in other countries because she spends more time with them." Many appreciated the strength their mothers showed during their childhoods, especially those who grew up during the <span class="date">1975</span>-<span class="date">1990</span> Civil War. "The way she took care of us and protected us during the Civil War was amazing ... she made us feel there was nothing to be scared of. When I was little she would hug me when they were bombing and tell me it was just a game ... and that when I grew up <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> would be a better country," said <span class="per">Ahmed Hamade</span> about his mother, Fatima. Others cited their mother's constant and vocal concern with their well-being as the cornerstone of their appreciation. <span class="per">Maria Hrawi</span> said she loves her mother Eliana for "always being there when I need her ... I know I'm always in her thoughts and I never feel alone."</p><br><br>
