<p><span class="loc">Pavlovsk</span> (Russian: Па́вловск) is a municipal town in <span class="loc">Pushkinsky District</span> of the federal <span class="loc">city of St. Petersburg</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south from St. Petersburg proper and about 4 kilometers (2.5 mi) southeast from <span class="loc">Pushkin</span>. Population: 16,087 (2010 Census). The town developed around the Pavlovsk Palace, a major residence of the Russian imperial family. Between 1918 and 1944, its official name was <span class="loc">Slutsk</span>, after the revolutionary Vera Slutskaya, and then was changed back to <span class="loc">Pavlovsk</span>. <span class="loc">Pavlovsk</span> is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site <span class="loc">Saint Petersburg</span> and Related Groups of Monuments. A wooden fortress was built by Russians on the place of <span class="loc">Pavlovsk</span> and was known from at least 13th century as part of an Administrative division of <span class="loc">Novgorod</span> Land. The fortress and the entire region were later captured by the Swedes. On 13 August 1702, the Russian army led by Peter the Great and Fyodor Apraksin met Swedes at the <span class="loc">Izhora</span> River and pushed them to the fortress. For several days, the Swedish Army was reinforcing their positions but were expelled upon a surprise frontal attack.</p>
