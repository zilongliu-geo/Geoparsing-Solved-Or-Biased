  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>What policy? . Apart from <span class="per">Shimon Peres</span> giving <span class="per">Hillary Clinton</span> a kiss on the cheek, nothing much emerged from the first visit to <span class="loc">the Middle East</span> of the new <span class="loc">US</span> secretary of state. We have no indication of where the policies of the Obama administration are heading. Actually, it seems so far that there is no tangible change from the policies of the former administration. During her visit to <span class="loc">Israel</span>, <span class="per">Clinton</span> spoke in favour of the two-state solution but said she has no intention of talking to Hamas. <span class="per">Clinton</span> had nothing to say about the need for <span class="loc">Israel</span> to stop building settlements all over Palestinian land. Nor did she have anything to say about the <span class="loc">Gaza</span> tragedy. She didn't mention the need to open the crossings and follow up on the efforts <span class="loc">Egypt</span> is making to bring about a calming down period. And yet <span class="per">Clinton</span> made a point of empathising with <span class="loc">Israel</span> with regards to Palestinian rockets. And she fully understood <span class="loc">Israel</span>'s concern over the prospects of <span class="loc">Iran</span> developing nuclear weapons. <span class="per">Clinton</span> kept her options open concerning future talks with <span class="loc">Syria</span> and <span class="loc">Iran</span>. <span class="loc">Washington</span> seems prepared to engage the Syrians in dialogue if this helps Damascus distance itself from <span class="loc">Tehran</span>. And the Syrians seem willing to go to any lengths to stay on Washington's good side. It seems that the <span class="loc">US</span> wants to see moderate Arabs and Palestinians negotiating with <span class="loc">Israel</span>, although actually the Palestinians have been doing just that for quite some time <span class="date">now</span> to no avail. <span class="loc">Israel</span> expressed strong reservations about any negotiations with <span class="loc">Tehran</span>, and obtained a promise that <span class="loc">Washington</span> wouldn't formulate its policy regarding the Iranian nuclear question without consulting with Israeli officials first. And it seems that <span class="per">Clinton</span> bought Livni's claim that moderate Arab countries are more concerned about <span class="loc">Iran</span> than <span class="loc">Israel</span>. Some Arab countries were ecstatic that <span class="per">Clinton</span>'s first visit to the region started in Sharm El-Sheikh, where she attended a conference for the reconstruction of <span class="loc">Gaza</span>. I don't know how relevant this is to anything. What I know is that Arab countries have failed to ask for anything specific. They have failed to come up with a cohesive view and to relay it to the Americans. At present, the Arabs have no policy for dealing with an Israeli right-wing government led by Netanyahu. The designated prime minister has never showed any interest in peace, aside from what he sees as "economic peace"; namely, any arrangement that allows <span class="loc">Israel</span> to exploit the resources of the region at will. It may be too early to speculate on <span class="date">the future</span> of the region as <span class="loc">Washington</span> sees it. But by the look of things it seems that <span class="loc">Washington</span> is hoping that the region will turn against <span class="loc">Tehran</span> and all radical groups affiliated with it. But what's in it for us? Hostility to <span class="loc">Iran</span> can only benefit <span class="loc">Israel</span> and divide the Arab world. It would be a continuation of the same circumstances that led to the tragedy in <span class="loc">Gaza</span>. <span class="per">Clinton</span> came to the region with <span class="loc">Iran</span> on her mind. The main issue -- namely, the Arab-Israeli conflict -- is not being addressed for <span class="date">now</span>. And it is unlikely to be broached before a new Israeli government is formed. I know some people are hoping to see <span class="per">Clinton</span> give her backing to Egyptian efforts for a calming-down period in <span class="loc">Palestine</span> and for inter-Palestinian reconciliation. But I find it worrisome that we still have no idea how the Obama administration might react to someone like Lieberman becoming <span class="loc">Israel</span>'s next foreign minister. The man is a racist who insulted the Egyptian president, threatened to bomb the <span class="loc">High Dam</span>, and described the Palestinians as insects. How will <span class="loc">Washington</span> deal with such a man? More importantly, how will Cairo deal with such a man?</p><br><br>
