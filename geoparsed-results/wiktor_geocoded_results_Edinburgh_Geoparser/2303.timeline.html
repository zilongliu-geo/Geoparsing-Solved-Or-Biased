  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pamplona</span> (Spanish: [pamˈplona]; French: Pampelune; English: Pampeluna) or Iruña (Basque: [iɾuɲa], alternative spelling: Iruñea, IPA: [iɾuɲea]) is the historical capital <span class="loc">city of Navarre</span>, in <span class="loc">Spain</span>, and of the former Kingdom of <span class="loc">Navarre</span>. The city is famous worldwide for the running of the bulls during the <span class="per">San Fermín</span> festival, which is held annually from <span class="date">July 6</span> to 14. This festival was brought to literary renown with the <span class="date">1926</span> publication of <span class="per">Ernest Hemingway</span>'s novel The Sun Also Rises. After the <span class="date">2015</span> municipal elections, there are 27 seats in Pamplona's municipal council: ten of <span class="org">Navarrese People's Union</span> (Unión del Pueblo Navarro), five of EH Bildu, five of Geroa Bai, three of the Socialist Party of <span class="loc">Navarre</span>, three of Aranzadi (supported by Podemos), and one of Izquierda-Ezkerra. <span class="loc">Pamplona</span> is located in the middle of <span class="loc">Navarre</span> in a rounded valley, known as the Basin of <span class="loc">Pamplona</span>, that links the mountainous North with the Ebro valley. It is 92 km (57 mi) from the <span class="loc">city of San Sebastián</span>, 117 km (73 mi) from <span class="loc">Bilbao</span>, 735 km (457 mi) from <span class="loc">Paris</span> and 407 km (253 mi) from <span class="loc">Madrid</span>. The climate and landscape of the basin is a transition between those two main Navarrese geographical regions. Its central position at crossroads has served as a commercial link between those very different natural parts of <span class="loc">Navarre</span>.</p><br><br>
