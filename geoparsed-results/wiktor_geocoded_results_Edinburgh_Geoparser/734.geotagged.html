<p>Dalton is a civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Rotherham</span> in <span class="loc">South Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Dalton is situated 162 miles (260.7 km) north from <span class="loc">London</span> and is 2 miles (3.2 km) north-east from the centre of <span class="loc">Rotherham</span> town centre. The population of the parish as taken at the 2011 Census was 10,292. The parish includes the communities of <span class="loc">Brecks</span>, <span class="loc">Dalton Brook</span>, Dalton Foljambe, <span class="loc">Dalton Magna</span>, <span class="loc">Dalton Parva</span>, <span class="loc">Flanderwell</span>, <span class="loc">Sunnyside</span> and Woodlaithes. The civil parish name of “Dalton” means valley farmstead and takes its name from the valley of the Dalton Brook located nearby. There are two entries for Dalton in the Domesday Book reflecting the two settlements with in the parish. The two main settlements in Dalton were the hamlets of <span class="loc">Dalton Magna</span> and <span class="loc">Dalton Parva</span>. A third settlement, Dalton Brook, grew up along the <span class="loc">Rotherham</span> - Doncaster Road due to the need of extra houses for the ever expanding population. The Church, known as the Holy Trinity Church, located in <span class="loc">Dalton Parva</span> was erected in 1848 and completed in 1849 by G. S. Foljambe. At first the Holy Trinity Church was only permitted to complete the Baptism procedure. However in 1850 it gained licenses to do both marriages and burials. Initially the land was owned by William de Percy (Governor of <span class="loc">York</span> in 1067) and William de Warrene (who was related to William the Conqueror and the builder of <span class="loc">Conisbrough</span> Castle) before it was taken over by the parish council. The Parish Council is involved in the provision of allotment gardens, recreation areas, lettings of halls, environmental improvements, provision of cash grants to local organisations and the consideration of local planning matters. It also makes representations to Local Government, National Government, Police, Health Service, Passenger Transport Authority and other organisations on matters which are of concern to the local population.</p>
