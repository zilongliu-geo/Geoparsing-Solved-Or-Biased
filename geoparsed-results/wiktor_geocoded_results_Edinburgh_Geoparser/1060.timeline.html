  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Portland</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,732 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The town center is listed as a census-designated place (CDP). It is situated across the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> from <span class="loc">Middletown</span>. Brownstone quarried in <span class="loc">Portland</span> was used in the construction of <span class="org">Hartford's Old State House</span> in <span class="date">1796</span>. The vast majority of the brownstone buildings in <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> (see College Row at <span class="org">Wesleyan</span> University and the <span class="loc">Long Walk</span> at Trinity College) as well as the famous brownstones in New <span class="loc">York City</span> were built with brownstone from Portland's quarries. About half of the town's perimeter is made up of the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>. The town has eight marinas and boat clubs as well as three 18-hole golf courses. The Wangunk tribe lived in the area prior to European settlement, and lived in <span class="loc">Portland</span> continuously throughout the settler period. Wangunk descendants still live in the area <span class="date">today</span>. Their name referred to the bend in the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> which curves around half of the town's perimeter. The first European settlers came to <span class="loc">Portland</span> in the 1690s. They were attracted by brownstone, which was used both for construction and for gravestones. Proximity to the river meant that the stone could be transported far and wide, and the Portland brownstone quarries supplied to <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">Boston</span> and even <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> and <span class="loc">England</span>. By the 1850s, more than 1,500 people were employed in the quarry industry. More than 25 ships transported the stone. By the 1850s, shipbuilding became more important as an industry, and the economic center of town shifted toward the Gildersleeve area. Immigrants from <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, then <span class="loc">Sweden</span>, then (to a lesser extent) <span class="loc">Italy</span> came to town to work the quarries.</p><br><br>
