<p>Davis, Massachusetts is the abandoned location of the Davis Pyrite Mine. Once the largest iron pyrite-mine in Massachusetts, Davis grew to be a decent sized mining village at the beginnings of the Second Industrial Revolution (1870–1915). But, in 1911, a non-fatal collapse of the mine due to “poor mining practices” ended the nearly 30-year run. By 1937, the mining camp had faded, and all that remained were a blacksmith shop and about 150 cellar holes. Davis is located at 42°41′52″N 72°52′13″W. The abandoned mining village is located in the Town of <span class="loc">Rowe</span>, in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, about three miles north of <span class="loc">Charlemont</span> and two miles south-southeast of <span class="loc">Rowe</span>. The area is east of Davis Mine Road and west of Davis Mine Brook. Both <span class="loc">Rowe</span> (2000 pop - 351) and <span class="loc">Charlemont</span> (2000 pop - 1358) are picturesque small towns in the rolling hills of northwestern <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Both communities have a long heritage. <span class="loc">Rowe</span> was established in 1762 and incorporated in 1785, and <span class="loc">Charlemont</span> was established in 1742 and incorporated in 1765. It was in the wooded hills between the two towns that an iron pyrite outcrop was discovered and a mine developed by H.J. Davis around 1882. The eastern section of <span class="loc">Rowe</span>, called Davis, became the center of activity because of the profitable operation of Davis <span class="loc">Sulfur</span> <span class="loc">Ore</span> Mine for twenty-nine years. The Davis Mine supplied a major economic boost to both <span class="loc">Rowe</span> and <span class="loc">Charlemont</span>.</p>
