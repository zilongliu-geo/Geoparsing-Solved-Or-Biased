  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Nashville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Howard County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,627 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Howard County</span>. <span class="loc">Nashville</span> is situated at the base of the Ouachita foothills and was once a major center of the peach trade in southwest <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. <span class="date">Today</span> the land is mostly given over to cattle and chicken farming. The world's largest dinosaur trackway was discovered near the town in <span class="date">1983</span>. <span class="loc">Mine Creek</span> Baptist Church was built along the banks of <span class="loc">Mine Creek</span> by the <span class="per">Rev. Isaac Cooper Perkins</span> (<span class="date">1790</span>–<span class="date">1852</span>) in the area where <span class="loc">Nashville</span> <span class="date">now</span> stands around <span class="date">1835</span>. Settlers later established a post stop along the settlement roads in <span class="date">1840</span>, and a post office incorporated in <span class="date">1848</span>. <span class="per">Michael Womack</span> (<span class="date">1794</span>–<span class="date">1861</span>), a <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> native reputed to have killed the British General <span class="per">Edward Packenham</span> during the War of <span class="date">1812</span>, settled in the area with his family in <span class="date">1849</span>. The area was then known by locals as <span class="loc">Mine Creek</span>, but was also called Hell's Valley and <span class="loc">Pleasant Valley</span>. Settlement in the area progressed slowly but steadily, though industry declined during the American Civil War. Following the war, the village's prospects improved, industry and settlement picked up, and the town was officially incorporated as <span class="loc">Nashville</span> on <span class="date">18 October 1883</span>, with <span class="per">D.A. Hutchinson</span> serving as the first mayor. <span class="per">Womack</span> is attributed with first proposing the name and called the town after <span class="loc">Nashville</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. <span class="date">The following year</span>, <span class="org">Nashville and Hope</span> were connected via railroad, spurring further growth, and the county seat was relocated from <span class="loc">Center Point</span> to <span class="loc">Nashville</span>. With the establishment of county government in the town, and due to the increased trade and access brought by the railroad, <span class="loc">Nashville</span> continued to grow. The town had a population of 928 in <span class="date">1900</span>, and boasted "a cotton-compress and gin" and a "bottling-works"; by <span class="date">1920</span> the population had risen to 2,144.</p><br><br>
