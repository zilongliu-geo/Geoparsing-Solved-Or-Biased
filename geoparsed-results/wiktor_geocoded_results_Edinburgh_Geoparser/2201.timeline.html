  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Malta</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Saratoga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town is in the central part of the county and is south of <span class="loc">Saratoga Springs</span>. The population was 13,005 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. "Tradition says a certain <span class="per">Drummond</span> and <span class="per">McKelpin</span>, Loyalists, were very early settlers, but left as the Revolutionary War came closer to the area." The earliest documented settlement occurred around <span class="date">1771</span>, many of the settlers migrating from <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. Michael Dunning may have been the first; others included <span class="per">John Rhodes</span>, Jeheil Parks, <span class="per">Samuel Clark</span>, <span class="per">Luther Landon</span>, <span class="per">Dean Chase</span>, <span class="per">Ebenezer Valentine</span>, <span class="per">Ebenezer</span> Dibble, <span class="per">Ebenezer Millard</span>, <span class="loc">Obadiah</span> <span class="per">Tompkins, Reuben</span> <span class="per">Doolittle, Cornelius</span> Abeel, <span class="per">Stephen Ireland</span>, <span class="per">Robert Hemple</span>, and <span class="per">William Marvin</span>. The town, originally called Dunning Street, was created in <span class="date">1802</span> from part of the Town of <span class="loc">Stillwater</span>. More territory was gained from the Town of <span class="loc">Saratoga</span> in <span class="date">1805</span>. The name "<span class="loc">Malta</span>" is said to derive from a malt brewery in the area that was formerly called "Malt-ville" and is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Maltaville</span>. The village of <span class="loc">Round Lake</span> was founded in <span class="date">1868</span> as "the <span class="loc">Round Lake</span> Camp Meeting of the Methodist Episcopical Church." Attendance the first year was 8000. In <span class="date">1869</span> permanent cottages began to be built, replacing the original tents. In <span class="date">1969</span>, the community of <span class="loc">Round Lake</span> became an incorporated village within the town.</p><br><br>
