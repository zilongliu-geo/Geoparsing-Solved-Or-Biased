<p>Parma is a village in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 769 at the 2010 census. Parma is the birthplace of world-renowned ecologist and soil scientist Dr. Robert E. Horton and NASCAR driver Brian Tyler. Parma was originally located a few miles east of its current location along the Michigan Central Railroad at a stop known as Gidley's Station. When it was moved to its current location, it was known as <span class="loc">Groveland</span>, after a noticeable grove of trees within the town. Part of this grove still exists where Grove St. curves around a copse of trees near its intersection with Westlawn St. in the eastern half of Parma. When the village was incorporated in 1847, its name was changed to Parma. In the early 1900s Parma was also known as Cracker Hill. A book was published called Cracker Hill Crumbs in 1976. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.06 square miles (2.75 km2), all land. Parma is bisected by a township line; as a result, the town lies in both Parma and Sandstone townships.</p>
