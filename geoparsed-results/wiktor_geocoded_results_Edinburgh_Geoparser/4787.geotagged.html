<p><span class="loc">Princeton</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Caldwell County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the seat of its county. The population was 6,329 during the 2010 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census. Princeton is home to several notable attractions such as Adsmore Museum, Champion-Shepherdson House (home of the Princeton Art Guild), University of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> Research and Education Center Botanical Garden, Capitol Cinemas, the Annual Black Patch Festival, and Newsom's Aged <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> Ham. The community at the head of <span class="loc">Eddy Creek</span> was first called Eddy Grove for the creek's source at a large whirling spring. 1,700 acres (690 ha) of surrounding land was granted to the Virginian William Prince for his service during the American Revolution. He settled there in what was then <span class="loc">Livingston County</span> in 1799 and erected <span class="loc">Shandy Hall</span>, a brick home and tavern. Prince's heirs and another local landowner named Thomas Frazier granted 40 acres (16 ha) around Eddy Grove and <span class="loc">Prince's Place</span> towards the establishment of a new town in 1817, provided the courthouse of the newly formed <span class="loc">Caldwell County</span> was relocated there from <span class="loc">Eddyville</span>. The county court accepted the proposal in July and named the new community <span class="loc">Princetown</span>, which shortened to <span class="loc">Princeton</span> by the time of the Eddy Grove.</p>
