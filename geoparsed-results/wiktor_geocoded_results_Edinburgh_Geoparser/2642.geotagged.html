<p><span class="loc">Zagora</span> (Berber language: Tazagurt, Arabic: زاكورة‎) is a town in the valley of the <span class="loc">Draa</span> River in Draa-Tafilalet southeastern <span class="loc">Morocco</span>. It is located at around 30°19′50″N 5°50′17″W. It is flanked by the mountain <span class="loc">Zagora</span> from which the town got its name. Originally it was called 'Tazagourt' (ⵜⴰⵣⴰⴳⵓⵔⵜ) the singular of plural 'Tizigirt' (ⵜⵉⵣⵉⴳⵉⵔⵜ), <span class="loc">Berber</span> for 'twinpeaks', referring to the fortress of the Murabitun, or Almoravid, people. In old European maps the mountain <span class="loc">Zagora</span> is already indicated but the town itself was only built in the 20th century. On the top of the Zagora mountain the remains of an Almoravid fortress can still be seen. The exact location of the former Almoravid mosque is still a matter of dispute. Each year the moussem (festival) of the Sufi saint moulay Abdelkader Jilali is celebrated at <span class="loc">Zagora</span>. Languages spoken in the city include Moroccan Arabic, Tachelhit and Tamazight. A well known sign at the town border states "Tombouctou 52 days", the supposed time it takes to get to <span class="loc">Timbuktu</span>, <span class="loc">Mali</span> on foot or camel.</p>
