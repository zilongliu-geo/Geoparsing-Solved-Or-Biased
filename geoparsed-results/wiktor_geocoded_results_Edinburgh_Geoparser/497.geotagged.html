<p><span class="loc">Nazareth</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Northampton County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,746 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Nazareth</span> is located seven miles (11 km) northwest of Easton, four miles (6 km) north of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> and twelve miles (19 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Allentown</span>. It is located in the center of <span class="loc">Northampton County</span>, and is part of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>'s <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley region. The borough is named for the Biblical town of <span class="loc">Nazareth</span>, where Jesus spent his youth. The names of other places in the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley area of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> are similarly inspired, including <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>, <span class="loc">Emmaus</span>, <span class="loc">Egypt</span>, and <span class="loc">Allentown</span>'s <span class="loc">Jordan Creek</span>. <span class="loc">Nazareth</span> was founded in 1740 by Moravian immigrants from <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The property was purchased from George Whitefield after the construction of the Whitefield House. Initially, <span class="loc">Nazareth</span> was specifically Moravian by charter. Outside faiths were not allowed to purchase property within <span class="loc">Nazareth</span>, a basically all German Protestant community. In 1735 a small group of the Moravian missionaries had begun work in the newly settled community of <span class="loc">Savannah</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. Their intent was to evangelize the Native American tribes and minister to the settlers. Governor Oglethorpe, founder of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, and John and Charles Wesley, founders of the Methodist Church and deeply interested in Moravian ideals, came along on the same boat. The Brethren settled along the <span class="loc">Savannah River</span> in <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. Like the Quakers, the Brethren refused to take part in the war with the Spanish and, as a result, they were evicted from <span class="loc">Georgia</span> in 1739.</p>
