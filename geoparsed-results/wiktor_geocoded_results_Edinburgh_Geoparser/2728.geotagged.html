<p>Columbia is a planned community comprising 10 self-contained villages, located in <span class="loc">Howard County</span>, Marylandâ€”the second wealthiest county in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, according to 2013 U.S. Census Bureau figures. It began with the idea that a city could enhance its residents' quality of life. Creator and developer James W. Rouse saw the new community in terms of human values, rather than merely economics and engineering. Opened in 1967, Columbia was intended to not only eliminate the inconveniences of then-current subdivision design, but also eliminate racial, religious, and class segregation. Columbia has consistently ranked in the top ten of CNN Money's Best Places to Live in <span class="loc">America</span>. Columbia proper consists only of that territory governed by the Columbia Association, but larger areas are included under its name by the U.S. Postal Service and the Census Bureau. These include several other communities which predate Columbia, including <span class="loc">Simpsonville</span>, <span class="loc">Atholton</span>, and in the case of the census, part of <span class="loc">Clarksville</span>. The census-designated place had a population of 103,683 according to 2013 Census estimates, making it the most populous community in <span class="loc">Maryland</span> after <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>.</p>
