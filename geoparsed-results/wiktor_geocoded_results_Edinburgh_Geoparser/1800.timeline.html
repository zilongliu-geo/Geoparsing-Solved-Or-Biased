  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Conway</span> is an unincorporated community in southwestern Jackson Township, <span class="loc">McPherson County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 56 and a <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and <span class="loc">Oklahoma Railroad</span> line, west of the <span class="loc">city of McPherson</span>, the county seat of <span class="loc">McPherson County</span>. For millennia, the land <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was inhabited by Native Americans. In <span class="date">1803</span>, most of modern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was secured by the <span class="loc">United States</span> as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In <span class="date">1854</span>, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in <span class="date">1861</span> <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In <span class="date">1867</span>, <span class="loc">McPherson County</span> was founded. In <span class="date">1878</span>, <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway and parties from <span class="loc">Marion County</span> and <span class="loc">McPherson County</span> chartered the <span class="loc">Marion</span> and <span class="loc">McPherson Railway</span> Company. In <span class="date">1879</span>, a branch line was built from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">McPherson</span>, in <span class="date">1880</span> it was extended to <span class="per">Lyons</span>, in <span class="date">1881</span> it was extended to <span class="loc">Ellinwood</span>. The line was leased and operated by the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway. The line from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">Marion</span>, was abandoned in <span class="date">1968</span>. In <span class="date">1992</span>, the line from <span class="loc">Marion</span> to <span class="loc">McPherson</span> was sold to Central <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Railway. In <span class="date">1993</span>, after heavy flood damage, the line from <span class="loc">Marion</span> to <span class="loc">McPherson</span> was abandoned. The original branch line connected <span class="loc">Florence</span>, <span class="loc">Marion</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span>, <span class="loc">Lehigh</span>, <span class="org">Canton</span>, <span class="loc">Galva</span>, <span class="loc">McPherson</span>, <span class="loc">Conway</span>, <span class="loc">Windom</span>, <span class="loc">Little River</span>, Mitchell, <span class="per">Lyons, Chase</span>, <span class="loc">Ellinwood</span>.</p><br><br>
