  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cumberland</span> (/ˈkʌmbələnd/ KUM-bə-lənd; locally /ˈkʊmbələnd/ KUUM-bə-lənd) is a historic <span class="loc">county of North West England</span> that had an administrative function from the 12th century until <span class="date">1974</span>. It was bordered by <span class="loc">Northumberland</span> to the east, <span class="loc">County Durham</span> to the southeast, <span class="loc">Westmorland</span> and <span class="loc">Lancashire</span> to the south, and <span class="loc">Dumfriesshire</span> in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> to the north. It formed an administrative county from <span class="date">1889</span> to <span class="date">1974</span> (excluding <span class="loc">Carlisle</span> from <span class="date">1914</span>) and <span class="date">now</span> forms part of <span class="loc">Cumbria</span>. The first record of the term "Cumberland" appears in 945, when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that the area was ceded to <span class="per">Malcolm I</span> of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> by <span class="per">King Edmund of England</span>. At the time of the Domesday Book in <span class="date">1086</span> most of <span class="date">the future</span> county remained part of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> although some villages in the ancient <span class="loc">district of Millom</span>, which were the possessions of the <span class="per">Earl of Northumbria</span>, were included in the Yorkshire section with the <span class="loc">Furness region</span>. In <span class="date">1092</span> <span class="per">King William</span> <span class="loc">Rufus</span> of <span class="loc">England</span> invaded the <span class="loc">Carlisle district</span>, settling it with colonists. He created an Earldom of <span class="loc">Carlisle</span>, and granted the territory to Ranulf Meschyn. In <span class="date">1133</span> <span class="loc">Carlisle</span> was made the see of a new diocese, identical with the area of the earldom. However, on the death of <span class="per">King Henry I</span> in <span class="date">1135</span>, the area was regained by <span class="loc">Scotland</span>'s <span class="per">King David I</span>. He was able to consolidate his power and made <span class="loc">Carlisle</span> one of his chief seats of government, while <span class="loc">England</span> descended into a lengthy civil war. In <span class="date">1157</span> <span class="per">Henry II</span> of <span class="loc">England</span> resumed possession of the area from <span class="per">Malcolm IV</span> of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, and formed two new counties from the former earldom: <span class="loc">Westmorland</span> and "Carliol". The silver-mining area of <span class="loc">Alston</span>, previously associated with the Liberty of <span class="loc">Durham</span>, was also added to the new <span class="loc">county of Carliol</span> for financial reasons. By <span class="date">1177</span> the <span class="loc">county of Carliol</span> was known as <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>. The border between <span class="loc">England</span> and <span class="loc">Scotland</span> was made permanent by the Treaty of <span class="loc">York</span> in <span class="date">1237</span>.</p><br><br>
