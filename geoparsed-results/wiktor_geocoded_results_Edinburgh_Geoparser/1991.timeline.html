  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Lodi /ˈloʊd.aɪ/ LOHD-eye is a city located in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Joaquin County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, in the northern portion of <span class="loc">California</span>'s Central Valley. The population was 62,134 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Its estimated population as of <span class="date">July 1, 2013</span> was 63,338. <span class="loc">Lodi</span> is best known for being a center of wine production (the "<span class="org">Zinfandel Capital</span> of the World"), although its vintages have traditionally been less prestigious than those of <span class="loc">Sonoma</span> and <span class="loc">Napa</span> counties. However, in <span class="date">recent years</span>, the Lodi Appellation has become increasingly respected for its Zinfandel wine and other eclectic varietals. National recognition came from the Creedence Clearwater Revival song "Lodi." Nearby <span class="loc">Woodbridge</span> is the home of the well known winery, <span class="loc">Woodbridge</span> by <span class="per">Robert Mondavi</span>. <span class="per">Mondavi</span> grew up in <span class="loc">Lodi</span>, and <span class="per">Mondavi</span> Winery is considered one of the most influential in the American wine industry. <span class="loc">Lodi</span> gained international attention in <span class="date">2005</span> when local residents <span class="loc">Hamid</span> and <span class="loc">Umer</span> <span class="loc">Hayat</span> were arrested and charged in the first terrorism trial in the state of <span class="loc">California</span>. When a group of local families decided to establish a school in <span class="date">1859</span>, they settled on a site near present-day <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> Lane and Turner Road. In <span class="date">1869</span>, the Central Pacific Railroad was in the process of creating a new route, and pioneer settlers <span class="per">Ezekiel Lawrence</span>, <span class="per">Reuben Wardrobe, A.C.</span> <span class="per">Ayers</span> and <span class="per">John</span> <span class="loc">Magley</span> offered a townsite of 160 acres (0.65 km2) to the railroad as an incentive to build a station there. The railroad received a "railroad reserve" of 12 acres (49,000 m2) in the middle of town, and surveyors began laying out streets in the area between <span class="loc">Washington</span> to <span class="per">Church</span> and <span class="per">Locust</span> to Walnut. Settlers flocked from nearby <span class="loc">Woodbridge</span>, <span class="loc">Liberty City</span>, and <span class="loc">Galt</span>, including town founders <span class="per">John M. Burt</span> and <span class="per">Dan Crist</span>.</p><br><br>
