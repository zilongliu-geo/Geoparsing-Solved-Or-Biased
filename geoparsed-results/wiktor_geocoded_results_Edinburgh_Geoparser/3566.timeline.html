  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Medford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Piscataquis County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 254 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In <span class="date">1808</span> <span class="per">James Grover</span> was the first white settler in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Medford</span>. In <span class="date">1820</span>, the state opened a road from the <span class="loc">Piscataquis River</span>, which helped increase settlement. In <span class="date">1820</span>, <span class="per">John Parker Boyd</span>, owner of the eastern half of the town, erected a combination sawmill and shingle mill on the <span class="loc">Piscataquis River</span>. In <span class="date">1824</span> the town incorporated as <span class="loc">Kilmarnock</span>, the name chosen by <span class="per">Boyd</span>. An <span class="date">1825</span> fire destroyed over three-quarters of the buildings in town, as well as the large stand of pine trees used to supply the sawmill and shingle mill. The mill was saved, but later closed because the burning of the nearby trees had deprived the business of a steady supply of wood. The inhabitants of <span class="loc">Kilmarnock</span> petitioned to change the town's name to <span class="loc">Medford</span> in <span class="date">1856</span>. The town surrendered its charter in <span class="date">1940</span>, and was organized as a plantation in <span class="date">1942</span>. In <span class="date">1967</span> <span class="loc">Medford</span> was again organized as a town. Town of <span class="loc">Medford</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span></p><br><br>
