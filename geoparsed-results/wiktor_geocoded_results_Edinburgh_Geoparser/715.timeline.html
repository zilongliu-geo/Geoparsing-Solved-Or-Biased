  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Weston is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">North Hertfordshire district</span> of <span class="loc">Hertfordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is located around 4 miles north of <span class="loc">Stevenage</span>, 2.5 miles south of <span class="loc">Baldock</span> and the same distance south-east of <span class="loc">Letchworth</span>, although it lies in the <span class="loc">Hitchin</span> post town. The A1(M) motorway passes to the west and the A505 <span class="loc">Baldock</span> bypass to the north, in a cut-and-cover tunnel that passes through the <span class="loc">Weston Hills</span>. These hills were made famous by the Robin Hood-style character Jack o'Legs, who was allegedly buried in the village's church graveyard. The legend of Jack o'Legs is connected to the village of Weston, and explained on a signpost in the village green. The legend is that a Jack o'Legs was an abnormally tall man who stole from shops in the nearby town of <span class="loc">Baldock</span>. He took his lootings and hid them in a cave somewhere around <span class="loc">Weston Hills</span>. After he was captured and severely wounded by the shopkeepers of <span class="loc">Baldock</span> he shot an arrow from there 3 miles into the churchyard at Weston to show where he wished to be buried. In the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Weston, there is a grave for Jack o'Legs, which is unusually long, possibly placed there to fuel belief in the legend.</p><br><br>
