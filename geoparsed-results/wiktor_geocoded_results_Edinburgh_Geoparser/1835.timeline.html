  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Quincy is an unincorporated community in northeastern Taylor Township, <span class="loc">Owen County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies just south of CR1150N, north of the town of Spencer, the county seat of <span class="loc">Owen County</span>. Its elevation is 738 feet (225 m), and it is located at 39°27′13″N 86°42′45″W (39.4536575, -86.7125050). Although Quincy is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 47456. Quincy had its start in the <span class="date">year 1853</span> by the building of the New Albany Railroad (a precursor to the Monon Railroad) through that territory. Many of the workers on this railroad had built homes along <span class="loc">Brush Creek</span>, where the railroad crossed it. William L. Hart and his wife <span class="per">Lucy</span> had the area around the <span class="loc">Brush Creek</span> trestle surveyed for a town, which was to be named Quincy. This plat was received at the <span class="loc">Owen County</span> Courthouse in Spencer on <span class="date">June 7, 1853</span>. The town of Quincy was thriving when a fire was accidentally started on <span class="date">November 3, 1873</span>. Most of the business district was destroyed, including three dry goods stores. Another fire occurred on <span class="date">May 9, 1930</span> which destroyed the same part of town. The buildings that were destroyed were the <span class="per">O.E. Stewart</span> store, <span class="loc">Dunkin</span> general store, the Herbert store, the post office and two smaller buildings. This meant all five stores of Quincy were burned down. The Red Men and Knights of Pythias lodges, which held their meetings in the upper floors of two of these buildings, lost everything. Three of the buildings destroyed were two stories tall. This and the burning of the Quincy school on <span class="date">February 2, 1953</span> signaled the end of the town. The population has ranged between 200 and 300 since the Civil War.</p><br><br>
