As of 2013, the city's population was estimated to have increased to 117,006, with just over 211,700 residents living in the <span class="loc">Springfield Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which includes <span class="loc">Sangamon County</span> and the adjacent <span class="loc">Menard County</span>. Present-day Springfield was first settled by European Americans in the late 1810s, around the time <span class="loc">Illinois</span> became a state.

Major tourist attractions include a multitude of historic sites connected with <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span> including his presidential museum, his home from 1837 to 1861, his tomb at Oak Ridge Cemetery, and the historical town of <span class="loc">New Salem</span>, within a short drive from the city. The city lies on a mostly flat plain that encompasses much of the surrounding countryside. Hilly terrain lies near the <span class="loc">Sangamon River</span>. Lake Springfield, a large artificial lake owned by the City Water, Light &amp; Power company (CWLP), supplies the city with recreation and drinking water. Weather is fairly typical for middle latitude locations, with hot summers and cold winters. Spring and summer weather is like that of most midwestern cities; severe thunderstorms are common. Tornadoes hit the <span class="loc">Springfield</span> area in 1957 and 2006.</p>
