<p>Auburn is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Androscoggin County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 23,055 at the 2010 census. It is one of two principal cities of and included in the Lewiston-Auburn, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> <span class="loc">New England</span> city and town area and the Lewiston-Auburn, <span class="loc">Maine Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area (which is part of the Portland-Lewiston-South <span class="loc">Portland</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span> combined statistical area). Auburn and Lewiston (directly across the <span class="loc">Androscoggin</span> River) are known locally as the <span class="loc">Twin Cities</span> or Lewiston-Auburn (L-A). The area was originally part of the Pejepscot Purchase, land bought in 1714 by a consortium from <span class="loc">Boston</span> and <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> following the Treaty of <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>, which brought peace between the Abenaki Indians and English settlements. In 1736, however, the Massachusetts General Court granted a large section of the land to veterans of the 1690 Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. Conflicting claims led to prolonged litigation; consequently, settlement was delayed until after the French and Indian Wars. Auburn was first settled in 1786 as part of <span class="loc">Bakerstown</span>, renamed <span class="loc">Poland</span> when it was incorporated by the Massachusetts General Court in 1795. It was then part of <span class="loc">Minot</span>, set off from <span class="loc">Poland</span> and incorporated in 1802. Auburn would itself be set off and incorporated on February 24, 1842. The name was apparently inspired by "Auburn", a village (real or fictitious) featured in the 1770 poem "The Deserted Village" by Oliver Goldsmith. Originally part of <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, the town became county seat of <span class="loc">Androscoggin County</span> at its creation in 1854. By annexing land from towns around it, including part of <span class="loc">Poland</span> in 1852, <span class="loc">Minot</span> in 1873, and all of <span class="loc">Danville</span> (first called <span class="loc">Pejepscot</span>) in 1867, Auburn grew geographically into one of <span class="loc">Maine</span>'s largest municipalities. Incorporated a city in 1868, Auburn in 1917 would be the first city in the state to adopt a council-manager form of government.</p>
