<p>Duncan is a town in <span class="loc">Spartanburg County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,181 at the 2010 census. Duncan is located at 34°56′6″N 82°8′5″W (34.934983, -82.134801). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 3.5 square miles (9.1 km2), all of it land. Founded by Zachary Barnett Duncan. In 1811, a post office was established on what is now S.C. Highway 290. A tiny settlement sprung up around it, and both the post office and community were named <span class="loc">New Hope</span>. In 1854, the town changed its name to Vernonville or <span class="loc">Vernonsville</span> in honor of local physician J.J. Vernon. In the mid-1850s, plans were under way to put a railroad line through Duncan, but the impending Civil War disrupted them. It wasn’t until 1873 that the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> and <span class="loc">Richmond Railroad</span> laid a line through the town. Shortly after the Civil War, Leroy Duncan came to town and began buying land. Duncan was an ambitious man who craved recognition. During celebrations for the new railroad line, Duncan promised townspeople that he would provide land for city streets if they would agree to rename the town after him. In 1881, the name change became official.</p>
