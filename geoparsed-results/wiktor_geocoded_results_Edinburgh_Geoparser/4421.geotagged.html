<p><span class="loc">Abbotsford</span> is a suburb in the Inner West of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Abbotsford</span> is 10 kilometres west of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district in the local government area of the City of <span class="loc">Canada Bay</span>. <span class="loc">Abbotsford</span> sits on the peninsula between <span class="loc">Abbotsford</span> Bay and Hen and Chicken Bay, on the <span class="loc">Parramatta River</span>. Abbotsford Public School is a local primary school at 350 Great North Road. <span class="loc">Abbotsford</span> took its name from Abbotsford House, owned by Sir Arthur Renwick. He named his property after Abbotsford House in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, the residence of historical novelist and poet, <span class="loc">Sir Walter Scott</span>. <span class="loc">Abbotsford</span> was first known by its Aboriginal name Bigi Bigi. The suburb was originally part of Five <span class="loc">Dock Farm</span> and when subdivided in 1837, was called <span class="loc">Feltham</span>. Sir Arthur Renwick, a doctor, philanthropist and politician built his home here in 1890 and called it Abbotsford House in honour of <span class="loc">Sir Walter Scott</span>'s home. Renwick sold his property in 1903 to Albert Grace, and in 1918 it became the site of a Nestl√© chocolate factory, with the house used initially for chocolate production and later as their administrative offices. The factory was closed in 1991, after which the area was redeveloped as the medium-density <span class="loc">Abbotsford</span> Cove housing complex.</p>
