<p><span class="loc">Clifton</span> is a village and civil parish in the English <span class="loc">county of Bedfordshire</span>. The original hundred of <span class="loc">Clifton</span> is named after it. The original "hundred" comprised: The <span class="loc">Parishes of Arlesey</span>; Campton-Cum-Shefford; <span class="loc">Chicksands</span>; <span class="loc">Clifton</span>; <span class="loc">Henlow</span>; <span class="loc">Holwell</span>; <span class="loc">Meppershall</span>; part of <span class="loc">Shillington</span>; <span class="loc">Lower Stondon</span>; Little Holwell; <span class="loc">Stotfold</span>; <span class="loc">Upper Stondon</span>. The first recorded reference to <span class="loc">Clifton</span> is in 944 when it is referred to as Cliftune. <span class="loc">Clifton</span> is also mentioned in the Domesday Book. The entry reads: Cliftone: William de Cairon from Bishop of Lincoln, Eudo FitzHubert and Nigel d'Aubigny; Leofwin from St. Benedict's of <span class="loc">Ramsey</span>; <span class="loc">Alwin</span> from Countess Judith. 2 mills. All Saints Church, built in the 14th and 15th centuries was heavily restored in the nineteenth. <span class="loc">Clifton</span> village is now a popular place to live as a consequence of its good transport links and proximity to the railway station at <span class="loc">Arlesey</span>. <span class="loc">Clifton</span> was voted <span class="loc">Bedfordshire</span> Village of the Year in 2003, 2005 and 2009. It is today largely residential, but in the past it was a centre for straw plaiting. The original <span class="loc">All Saints</span> school was a "Straw Plait School" where children were expected to learn to plait straw from as young as four years of age. They would also be taught to read.</p>
