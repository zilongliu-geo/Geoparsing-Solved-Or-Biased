It lies approximately 650 kilometres (400 mi) northwest of <span class="loc">Juba</span>, the capital and largest city in that country. <span class="loc">Wau</span> was initially established as a zariba (fortified base) by slave-traders in the 19th century. During the time of condominium rule, the city became an administrative center. <span class="per">Burr</span> and <span class="per">Collins</span> in <span class="date">1994</span> described <span class="loc">Wau</span>: as follows: No one has ever been “at home” in <span class="loc">Wau</span>. It is surrounded by a host of disorganized and diverse peoples . . . It was and remains a town belonging to no single ethnic group, deriving its importance only from its position as a commercial and administrative center . . . Located in the midst of the vast Nilotic plain hundreds of miles from nowhere, it was miserable under the best of circumstances . . . During the Second <span class="org">Sudanese Civil War</span>, it was a garrison town of the <span class="loc">Khartoum</span>-based Sudanese Armed Forces, and was the scene of extensive fighting in the <span class="date">spring of 1998</span>. Battles erupted again in the town in the <span class="date">spring of 2007</span>, killing several hundred people.</p><br><br>
