<p><span class="loc">Gladstone</span> is a city located in <span class="loc">Clackamas County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 11,497 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> is an approximately 4-square-mile (10 km2) suburban community, 12 miles (19 km) south of <span class="loc">Portland</span>, the largest city in <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, and located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Clackamas</span> and <span class="loc">Willamette</span> rivers. <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> has held several important cultural and social events, hosting both the inaugural <span class="loc">Clackamas County</span> Fair and the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> State Fair, before both were moved to more spacious locations. Both Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and presidential candidate Theodore Roosevelt have given public speeches in the city. Prior to European settlement, there were several Native American groups living in the area that was to become <span class="loc">Gladstone</span>. In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore the Louisiana Territory and beyond. Although the expedition passed only near the <span class="loc">Gladstone</span> â€“ <span class="loc">Oregon City</span> locality on their way to and from the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>, via the <span class="loc">Columbia River</span>, natives such as the Kalapuya and the <span class="loc">Clackamas</span> people told them about the area. In the subsequent years, successive waves of explorers and traders would introduce epidemics of cholera and smallpox, which would take a heavy toll on the native peoples and contributed to a substantial reduction in population.</p>
