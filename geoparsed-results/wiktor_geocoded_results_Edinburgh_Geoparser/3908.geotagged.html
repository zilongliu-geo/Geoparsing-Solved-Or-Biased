<p>Mornington is a suburb of the <span class="loc">city of Dunedin</span>, in the <span class="loc">South Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. It is situated on hilly slopes 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) to the west of the city centre, the slopes forming part of a ridge which surrounds the heart of the city. At the time of the 2006 census, the permanent population was 3,393, a decrease of 15 since 2001. The use of the name Mornington for the area was first recorded in 1862. There seems to be some conjecture about the origin of the name - some sources record it as being purely descriptive, with the suburb receiving the first rays of the sunrise. There is some likelihood, however, that it was named by early landholder David Mailer after Mornington, Victoria. Mornington was a separate borough until amalgamation with <span class="loc">Dunedin city</span> in 1916 Mornington's main streets are <span class="loc">Mailer Street</span>, <span class="loc">Elgin Road</span>, <span class="loc">Glenpark Avenue</span>, <span class="loc">Eglinton Road</span>, and <span class="loc">Kenmure Road</span>. It is a mainly residential suburb, with a retail area on <span class="loc">Mailer Street</span>. The suburb is surrounded by the suburbs of <span class="loc">Kenmure</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Roslyn</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Maryhill</span> to the southwest, Belleknowes to the northeast, and The Glen - divided roughly between <span class="loc">Mornington</span> and <span class="loc">Caversham</span> in the southeast.</p>
