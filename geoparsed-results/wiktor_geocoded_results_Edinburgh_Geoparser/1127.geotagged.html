<p><span class="loc">Brod</span> (Serbian Cyrillic: Брод; Bosnian: <span class="loc">Bosanski Brod</span>, pronounced [bǒsanskiː brôːd]) is a town and municipality located on the south bank of the river <span class="loc">Sava</span> in the northern part of <span class="loc">Bosnia and Herzegovina</span>. It is situated in the northwestern part of the <span class="loc">Republika Srpska</span> entity and the western part of the <span class="loc">Posavina region</span>. Prior to the Bosnian War of the 1990s, it was <span class="loc">Bosanski Brod</span>. After the war the official name is only <span class="loc">Brod</span>. In May 2009, the National Assembly of the <span class="loc">Republika Srpska</span> removed the prefix Bosanski resulting in the name <span class="loc">Brod</span>. Today its official name is just <span class="loc">Brod</span>, without the prefix Bosanski or Srpski. The Croatian town of <span class="loc">Slavonski Brod</span> is situated on the opposite (northern) bank of the <span class="loc">Sava</span> forming a built-up area of more than 110,000 inhabitants. The bridge over the <span class="loc">Sava River</span> at <span class="loc">Brod</span> was one of the few between <span class="loc">Croatia</span> and <span class="loc">Bosnia</span> not to be destroyed; it was reinforced by NATO, using troops of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 10th Mountain Division, to keep open a link between the two countries. • Brod • <span class="loc">Brusnica Mala</span> • <span class="loc">Brusnica Velika</span> • Donja Barica • Donja Močila • Donja Vrela • <span class="loc">Donje Kolibe</span> • <span class="loc">Donji Klakar</span> • Gornja Barica • Gornja Močila • Gornja Vrela • <span class="loc">Gornje Kolibe</span> • <span class="loc">Gornji Klakar</span> • Grk • Koraće • Kričanovo • Kruščik • Liješće • <span class="loc">Novo Selo</span> • Sijekovac • Unka • Vinska i Zborište.</p>
