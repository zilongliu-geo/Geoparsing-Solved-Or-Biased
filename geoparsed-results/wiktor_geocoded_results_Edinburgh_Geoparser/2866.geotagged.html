<p>Tia, (pronounced ‘tie ah’) is a settlement and parish located approximately 30 kilometres east of <span class="loc">Walcha</span>, on the <span class="loc">Northern Tablelands region</span> of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Tia River Station was first settled by Richard and William <span class="loc">Denne</span> in 1840, then comprising an area of 100 square miles (260 km2). It was later purchased by Augustus Hooke in 1882. It was on this station that <span class="loc">Blue Spec</span>, a brown stallion foaled in 1899, was bred and who later won the <span class="loc">Kalgoorlie Cup</span>, <span class="loc">Perth Cup</span> and the 1905 Melbourne Cup in record time. The first gold mining activity was recorded at Tia in 1866. In 1873 a reef was discovered at McLeod’s Creek, when a rush occurred. In 1877 two Scotsmen, Matheson and Mclntyre spent considerable effort tunnelling and digging shafts. In 1879 they erected a machine for crushing rock and constructed a race half a mile long to bring water to work the machine. After yields slightly over an ounce to the ton they sold out in 1887 to the Tia Gold Mining Company, which deepened shafts, and spent money on their operations, but with poor results. Large scale mining petered out, although fossicking continued for some years to come.</p>
