<p>Weston is a suburb and electoral <span class="loc">ward of Bath</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>, located in the north west of the city. Originally a separate village, Weston has become part of Bath as the city has grown, first through the development of <span class="loc">Lower Weston</span> in Victorian times and then by the incorporation of the village itself – also called <span class="loc">Upper Weston</span> – into the city with the siting of much local authority housing there in the period after World War II. The earliest evidence of occupation comes from two Celtic Caddy spoons found in the village in 1825. There are believed to have been used as ceremonial anointing regalia. During the 10th century Weston had been divided into two estates. One, on the slopes of <span class="loc">Lansdown</span> was given by <span class="loc">Edmund</span> I to Aethelare in 946. Weston was the birthplace of Saint Alphege who was born around 954. The two manors are recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 one held by Abbot Sewold and the other by Arnulf de Hesding. During the 12th and 13th centuries Weston had close ties with the monks of Bath Abbey and in the late 13th century the first vicar of Weston was appointed by the church. Weston was part of the hundred of Bath Forum, with a manorial court or Halmote being held in the Parish. The land continued to be owned by the church and leased to tenants until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. The estates in Weston then reverted to the king. In 1628 it was sold to the Corporation of London although the king continued to receive rent until 1671 when it was old to Sir Walter Long, who was Member of Parliament for Bath from 1679 (the Habeas Corpus Parliament) to 1681. Following the Battle of <span class="loc">Lansdowne</span> in 1643, some of the defeated Roundheads took refuge in Weston.</p>
