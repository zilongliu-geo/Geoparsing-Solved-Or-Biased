<p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 69,709. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Steubenville</span>. The county is named for Thomas Jefferson, who was at the time Vice President. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is part of the Weirton-Steubenville, WV-OH Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-WV-OH Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was organized on July 29, 1797 by proclamation of Governor Arthur St. Clair, six years before <span class="loc">Ohio</span> was granted statehood. In 1786, the <span class="loc">United States</span> built Fort Steuben to protect the government surveyors mapping the land west of the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>. When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement <span class="loc">La Belle</span>. When the County was created in 1797, <span class="loc">La Belle</span> was selected as the County seat. The town was subsequently renamed <span class="loc">Steubenville</span>, in honor of the abandoned fort. During the first half of the nineteenth century, <span class="loc">Steubenville</span> was primarily a port town, and the rest of the county consisted of small villages and farms. However, in 1856, <span class="loc">Frazier</span>, <span class="loc">Kilgore</span> and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft, resulting in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> becoming one of the leading centers of the new Industrial Revolution.</p>
