  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Whoops! <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> aqueduct springs a leak. A LANDMARK feature on the <span class="loc">River Lune</span> has been closed – after springing a leak. The 200-year-old Lune Aqueduct has been closed by British Waterways for inspection and repairs. Dams are being installed to allow water in the aqueduct to be lowered for inspection by engineers. A spokesman for <span class="org">British</span> Waterways says: “The aqueduct is one of the iconic structures on the waterways. We are speaking to waterways businesses that depend on the canal and, while we’re currently in the <span class="date">winter</span> low season, I am mindful of the importance of the canal to local tourism should the aqueduct require a longer period of closure.” Built by canal engineer <span class="per">John Rennie</span> between <span class="date">1794</span> and <span class="date">1797</span>, the Grade I listed aqueduct – which carries the canal over the <span class="loc">River Lune</span> – is reputedly the finest aqueduct in <span class="loc">North West England</span>.</p><br><br>
