  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Lane County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located about two miles south of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> and two miles north of <span class="loc">Junction City</span>, on <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Route 99E near the <span class="loc">Willamette River</span>. The first post office in the area was named Freedom, established in <span class="date">1858</span>. The name was changed to <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> in <span class="date">1866</span> and to <span class="loc">Junction City</span> in <span class="date">1872</span>. It is likely the office was moved south two miles after the last renaming. About <span class="date">1852</span> or <span class="date">1853</span>, a man named Woody started a "house of entertainment" (aka a roadhouse) at this locale, which he named "Woodyville". It was also known as Woody's Landing. The property was bought by Johnson Mulkey, who built a sawmill at the site and changed the name to <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>. The sawmill was still operating in <span class="date">1861</span> and likely longer. Two stores operated at the site, which was chosen for its proximity to the southernmost navigable point on the river and a prosperous agricultural district, with hopes of the place becoming a viable town. The Great Flood of <span class="date">1862</span> changed the course of the river, leaving the town too far from the main channel, however, and the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and <span class="loc">California Railroad</span> bypassed <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, so <span class="loc">Junction City</span> became the more important community.</p><br><br>
