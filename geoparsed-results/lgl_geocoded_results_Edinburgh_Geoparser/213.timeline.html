  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">South Ossetia</span> on edge of war. Diplomats are pushing urgent peace talks between Georgian and South Ossetian officials to avert all-out war as heavy fighting in the region killed at least a dozen <span class="date">yesterday</span>. Tensions have only escalated in breakaway <span class="loc">South Ossetia</span> after severe violence <span class="date">last weekend</span>, and show no sign of abating. The streets of the secessionist capital are reportedly abandoned and <span class="per">Tbilisi</span> says the South Ossetian separatist leader has fled. In an address to the nation <span class="date">yesterday evening</span>, Georgian President <span class="per">Mikheil Saakashvili</span> said he ordered a unilateral ceasefire. “A few hours ago I gave an order&#x97;a very painful order for a commander-in-chief to give&#x97;that not a single Georgian unit, neither a police nor other unit under our control should return fire to end the very intense bombardment.” “We must stop this spiral of violence.” Interfax reported that Russian officials have succeeded in arranging emergency talks between Georgian and separatist officials for <span class="date">tomorrow</span>. Talks scheduled for <span class="date">yesterday</span> were derailed, ostensibly over a disagreement on what format the negotiations would be in. As of last night the violence was continuing, and Georgian officials denied reports that the South Ossetians had agreed to a ceasefire. Violence grew throughout week The confrontation sparked <span class="date">last weekend</span> after the fiercest fighting in <span class="date">years</span> left six dead. The conflict zone fell briefly quiet after that, but growing clashes have pushed the situation to the edge over <span class="date">the last several days</span>. Both sides reported heavy shootouts overnight <span class="date">Wednesday</span> that continued into the day. By <span class="date">yesterday evening</span>, the South Ossetians counted two dead and 18 wounded. Reports put the number of Georgian dead at ten, with 50 wounded. <span class="per">Tbilisi</span> says the separatists launched an attack <span class="date">yesterday</span> on the Georgian-controlled villages of <span class="loc">Nuli</span> and <span class="loc">Avnevi</span> in a bid to take strategic heights overlooking the area. A Georgian armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the attacks, confirmed Interior Ministry spokesman <span class="per">Shota Utiashvili</span>, wounding three Georgian troops. “Heavy shootings continue,” he told the Messenger <span class="date">yesterday</span>. The South Ossetian separatist press committee said Georgian forces attacked an Ossetian-controlled village and were pushed back from strategic hills. Late in the evening <span class="per">Utiashvili</span> said that South Ossetian fighters continued to attack despite the Georgian ceasefire. The Georgian-controlled village of <span class="loc">Prisi</span> reportedly came under attack late last night. Separatists had claimed the day before there were Georgian artillery attacks from the heights above <span class="loc">Prisi</span>. <span class="loc">Tamarasheni</span>, a Georgian town a stone’s throw from Tskhinvali, also came under fire last night, according to the <span class="org">Georgian Interior Ministry</span>. Accusations of preparing for war Tbilisi accuses the separatists of starting the violence. A <span class="org">Georgian Foreign Ministry</span> statement <span class="date">yesterday</span> said the separatists’ attacks are made “with the purpose of inciting large-scale confrontation and thwarting direct dialogue.” An earlier statement pointed to South Ossetian announcements of arriving volunteer fighters from the North Caucasus as further evidence they are gearing up for war. Separatist officials accuse <span class="loc">Georgia</span> of amassing armored vehicles and infantry near the edge of the conflict zone, and say they have evacuated women and children from Tskhinvali. They also claim Grad missile systems are set up by the Georgian town of <span class="loc">Gori</span>, south of the conflict zone. Eyewitnesses in the area said they saw large Georgian military convoys headed toward for the region. <span class="per">Utiashvili</span>, the Interior Ministry spokesman, denied the deployment of missile systems but confirmed a “rotation of military forces near Gori.” A Russian peacekeeper officer in <span class="loc">South Ossetia</span> told reporters <span class="date">yesterday</span> that their forces recorded eight flyovers of Georgian warplanes and surveillance drones in the previous 24 hours. <span class="date">Yesterday</span>’s <span class="org">Georgian Foreign Ministry</span> statement said <span class="loc">Moscow</span> shoulders much of the blame for the violence. “The only way that separatists manage to maintain their grip on power is through military, human and technical resources provided to them by the <span class="loc">Russian Federation</span>,” the statement read. “The recent developments have shown clearly that the position of the <span class="loc">Russian Federation</span> will be the decisive factor in how the process will unfold in the Tskhinvali region.” <span class="loc">Russia</span>’s deputy foreign minister said the remarks were “unfair” and that <span class="loc">Moscow</span> is trying to mediate in the crisis to prevent more bloodshed. The Georgian president’s speech, delivered after the Foreign Ministry statement was released, changed the tone on <span class="loc">Russia</span>’s responsibility for the clashes: “The leaders of the [Russian] peacekeeping force told us a few hours ago they have completely lost control over the separatists’ actions&#x85; We are in constant contact with the <span class="org">Russian Foreign Ministry</span>’s leadership. The <span class="org">Russian Foreign Ministry</span> is trying&#x97;they say they are trying, but not succeeding&#x97;to get the separatists to cease fire.” <span class="loc">Georgia</span> is <span class="loc">Russia</span>’s “natural ally,” said <span class="per">Saakashvili</span>. Tbilisi urges talks after negotiations fail <span class="loc">Georgia</span>’s top official for conflict issues, <span class="per">Temur Iakobashvili</span>, told reporters that hoped-for talks fell through after he traveled to the conflict zone <span class="date">yesterday</span>, where South Ossetian representatives refused to meet him. “Tskhinvali looked empty, as I know [separatist leader <span class="per">Eduard</span>] Kokoity has left the town,” <span class="per">Iakobashvili</span> said, adding that <span class="loc">Russia</span>’s own envoy was not able to reach Tskhinvali due to car troubles. Asked whether Georgian army troops could be sent into <span class="loc">South Ossetia</span>, <span class="per">Iakobashvili</span> said: “We are doing everything to resolve the tense situation by peaceful means. However, we’re always ready to protect our citizens wherever they are.” <span class="date">Earlier in the week</span> Tbilisi announced that direct talks were scheduled, but South Ossetian officials later said they would not participate, insisting that any negotiations must be within the Joint Control Commission format which includes Russian, North Ossetian, South Ossetian and Georgian representatives. <span class="loc">Georgia</span> says the Joint Control Commission is unbalanced and declared <span class="date">last year</span> it would no longer take part in its meetings. <span class="per">Saakashvili</span> last night called for direct talks in “any kind of format.” He also reiterated offers of wide autonomy for <span class="loc">South Ossetia</span> within <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, which he said <span class="loc">Russia</span> could oversee. Deep international concern The OSCE, <span class="org">EU</span> and <span class="org">UN</span> all weighed in <span class="date">yesterday</span> with statements of concern over the violence, calling for an immediate halt and direct negotiations. <span class="org">Reuters</span> reported that senior <span class="loc">US</span> <span class="loc">State Department</span> official <span class="per">Daniel</span> Fried and the deputy Russian foreign minister had spoken and agreed to cooperate on keeping the violence from growing.</p><br><br>
