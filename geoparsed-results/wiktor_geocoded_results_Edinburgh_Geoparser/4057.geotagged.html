<p><span class="loc">Bexley</span> is a suburb in southern <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Bexley</span> is located 14 kilometres south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district, in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Rockdale</span> and is part of the <span class="loc">St George</span> area. James Chandler named the suburb after his birthplace, <span class="loc">Bexley</span> in the south-east of <span class="loc">London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Chandler bought Sylvesterâ€™s Farm in 1822, from Thomas Sylvester who had been granted the land about ten years earlier. That year he was also granted 1,200 acres (490 ha) of land which stretched from what is now <span class="loc">Bexley</span> North to most of <span class="loc">Rockdale</span> and <span class="loc">Kogarah</span>. The estate was heavily timbered and a track through the centre, used by timber-getters, is today called Forest Road. Queen Victoria Street, <span class="loc">Gladstone Street</span> and <span class="loc">Beaconsfield Street</span> commemorate the British Queen and two of her prime ministers. Chandler was a well-respected citizen and became known locally as the Squire of <span class="loc">Bexley</span>, but his property attracted bushrangers, escaped convicts and other odd types. Chandler was not happy with his ill-assortment of neighbours and sold the land to Charles Thompson in 1836. Later it was bought by Charles Tindell, who began subdividing the land by 1856 for home sites.</p>
