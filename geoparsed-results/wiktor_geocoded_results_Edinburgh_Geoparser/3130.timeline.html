  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Shelton</span> is an area of the <span class="loc">city of Stoke-on-Trent</span> in <span class="loc">Staffordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, between <span class="loc">Hanley</span> and <span class="loc">Stoke-upon-Trent</span>. The route of the Roman Road called the <span class="loc">Rykeneld</span> Street passed very close to Stoke-on-Trent railway station. <span class="loc">Shelton</span> had an artisan pottery industry which was documented as early as <span class="date">1685</span>, when one <span class="per">Thomas Miles</span> was producing white stone ware. <span class="loc">Shelton</span> had the earliest gas works in the Potteries. The works were opened in Shelton's Lower <span class="loc">Bedford</span> Street, under the ownership of the British <span class="org">Gaslight Company</span>, to supply <span class="per">Hanley</span> and <span class="per">Stoke</span> in <span class="date">1825</span>. The British Pottery Manufacturer's Federation Club is a large private member's club situated in Federation House, just opposite Stoke-on-Trent railway station, and is run for the benefit of the many local pottery manufacturers. It was established in <span class="date">1951</span>, and still operates. <span class="loc">Shelton</span> is the home of the main <span class="org">Staffordshire University</span> campus and library, which specialises in art and design teaching. The presence of a major University has resulted in the residential area having a large student population during term-time. <span class="loc">Shelton</span> mostly consists of Victorian terraced houses and is occupied by a combination of owner occupiers, students, and private landlords. Families tend to cluster more around the western edges of <span class="loc">Hanley Park</span> and around the large cemetery that stretches north into Cliff Vale. These latter two protected green spaces, along with the route of the <span class="loc">Cauldon</span> Canal, serve as a natural buffer between <span class="loc">Shelton</span> and the south of <span class="loc">Hanley</span> (the "city centre").</p><br><br>
