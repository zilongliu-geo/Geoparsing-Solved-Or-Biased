<p>Mason is a city in southwestern <span class="loc">Warren County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, approximately 22 miles (35 km) from downtown <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>. As of the 2010 census, Mason's population was 30,712. Mason was transformed into a large, bustling community, and one of the most affluent in Greater Cincinnati, beginning in the 1990s. Mason sits at the core of the <span class="loc">Cincinnati-Dayton Metropolitan</span> Region, the 14th largest urban area in the nation. In 2013, Mason was ranked seventh in Money Magazine's 2013 Top 50 Best Places to live in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In 2008 and 2011, CNN named Mason one of the top 100 places to live in the <span class="loc">United States</span>.

On June 1, 1803, Revolutionary War veteran William Mason paid $1,700 at auction to purchase 640 acres (2.6 km2) of land in what is now downtown Mason. In 1815, he platted 16 lots on this land and named the village "<span class="loc">Palmira</span>." In 1832, two years after the death of William Mason and according to his will, more than 40 additional lots were platted on the north, south, and west of <span class="loc">Palmira</span>. When the plat was officially recorded, the name of the village was listed as "Palmyra."</p>
