  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Franklin</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Southfield Township</span>, <span class="loc">Oakland County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 3,150 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The community is known for large, estate-style homes situated on ravines, as well as its vintage downtown and a nearby cider mill. The community was founded in <span class="date">1825</span> by <span class="per">Elijah Bullock</span> and other settlers, and was named <span class="per">Franklin</span> in <span class="date">1831</span>. The village is named after <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>. By <span class="date">1830</span>, a business district was formed. The collection of essentially original condition structures in the village is quite unusual in suburban <span class="loc">Detroit</span>. The village was incorporated in <span class="date">1953</span>. A historical marker was erected in <span class="date">1960</span> which reads: "<span class="per">FRANKLIN VILLAGE</span> Founded in 1824-1825, <span class="per">Franklin</span> received its present name in <span class="date">1828</span>. First postmaster was <span class="per">Dr. Ebenezer Raynale</span>, state legislator and physician. The <span class="per">William Huston</span> store, opened in <span class="date">1830</span>, was the forerunner of a business center that later included the famous Broughton Wagon Shop, the Van Every Mills, <span class="date">now</span> "Ye Olde Cider Mill," several taverns, two distilleries, and two churches. The village also was a station on the Underground Railroad. <span class="per">Franklin</span> still has the appearance and atmosphere of an early Michigan village.</p><br><br>
