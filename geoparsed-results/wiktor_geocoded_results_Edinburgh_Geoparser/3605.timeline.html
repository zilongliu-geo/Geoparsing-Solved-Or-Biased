  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Huntington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Emery County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,131 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is the largest town in <span class="loc">Emery County</span>. <span class="loc">Huntington</span> is named after <span class="loc">Huntington Creek</span>, and <span class="loc">Huntington Creek</span> was probably named for <span class="per">William, Oliver</span>, and <span class="org">Dimick Huntington, brothers</span> who led exploring parties into the region during the 1850s. The first settlers of European extraction in the area were four stockmen, <span class="loc">Leander</span> <span class="per">Lemmon, James</span> McHadden, Bill Gentry, and <span class="per">Alfred Starr</span>, who brought their herds to <span class="loc">Huntington Creek</span> in <span class="date">1875</span>. In the <span class="date">fall of 1877</span>, in response to the same call from The Church of <span class="per">Jesus Christ</span> of Latter-day Saints that brought settlers to the other creeks in Castle Valley, a small group from <span class="loc">Fairview</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, under the leadership of <span class="per">Elias Cox</span>, established a dugout colony on the banks of <span class="loc">Huntington Creek</span> and began digging irrigation canals. The colony grew from 126 in <span class="date">1880</span> to 738 in <span class="date">1890</span> and 1,293 in <span class="date">1910</span>. A majority of the early settlers came from <span class="loc">Sanpete</span> Valley, which by the late 1870s had outgrown its irrigable land, and many belonged to three or four interrelated kinship groups, making for an abundance of cousins in the community.</p><br><br>
