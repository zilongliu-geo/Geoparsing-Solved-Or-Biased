<p><span class="loc">Elderslie</span> is a suburb of the <span class="loc">Macarthur Region</span> of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> in Camden Council. In addition, it is located on the east side of the <span class="loc">Nepean River</span>. It has a small local shop, high school, primary school, netball courts, cricket, AFL, Football (Rugby League) oval, a BMX track and a historic house John Oxley Cottage built in the 1890s and converted into the Camden Visitors' centre in 1989. It was named after explorer John Oxley who held an early grant of land in the area. The area now known as <span class="loc">Elderslie</span> was probably originally home to the Tharawal people, based in the <span class="loc">Illawarra region</span>, although the Western <span class="loc">Sydney</span>-based Darug people and the Southern Highlands-based Gandangara people were also known to have inhabited the greater Camden area. Very early relations with British settlers were cordial but as farmers started clearing and fencing the land affecting food resources in the area, clashes between the groups arose until 1816 when a number of indigenous people were massacred and the remainder retreated from direct conflict with the settlers.</p>
