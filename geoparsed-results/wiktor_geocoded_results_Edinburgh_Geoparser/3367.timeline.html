  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tunis</span> (Arabic: تونس‎  Tūnis) is both the capital and the largest <span class="loc">city of Tunisia</span>. The greater metropolitan area of <span class="loc">Tunis</span>, often referred to as Grand Tunis, holds some 2,700,000 inhabitants. Situated on a large <span class="loc">Mediterranean Sea</span> gulf (the <span class="loc">Gulf of Tunis</span>), behind the Lake of <span class="loc">Tunis</span> and the port of <span class="loc">La Goulette</span> (Ḥalq il-Wād), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its antic medina, a world heritage site. Beyond this district lie the suburbs of <span class="loc">Carthage</span>, <span class="loc">La Marsa</span>, and <span class="loc">Sidi Bou Said</span>. Just through the Sea Gate (also known as the <span class="loc">Bab el Bahr</span> and the <span class="loc">Porte</span> de <span class="loc">France</span>) begins the modern city, or <span class="loc">Ville Nouvelle</span>, transversed by the grand Avenue <span class="per">Habib Bourguiba</span> (often referred to by popular press and travel guides as "the Tunisian Champs-Élysées"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. As the capital city of the country, <span class="loc">Tunis</span> is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life; it is also the centre of the country's commercial activity. The expansion of the Tunisian economy in recent <span class="date">decades</span> is reflected in the booming development of the outer city where one can see clearly the social challenges brought about by rapid modernization in <span class="loc">Tunisia</span>.</p><br><br>
