  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Somerset</span> /ˈsʌmərsɛt/ is a borough in <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 6,277 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The borough is surrounded by <span class="loc">Somerset</span> Township. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> is just off Exit 110 of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Turnpike (I-70 and I-76). <span class="loc">Somerset</span> is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, <span class="loc">PA</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, and is also one of two cities, the other being <span class="loc">Johnstown</span>, that make up the larger Johnstown-Somerset, <span class="org">PA Combined Statistical Area</span>. The <span class="loc">Somerset County Courthouse</span> and Uptown <span class="loc">Somerset</span> Historic District are listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> is located at 40°0′25″N 79°4′53″W (40.006920, -79.081297). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 2.7 square miles (7.0 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> has the ninth-highest elevation of towns in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, at 2,190 feet (670 m) above sea level. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> has a humid continental climate that is affected by the high elevation, rendering them colder much of the <span class="date">winter</span> than <span class="loc">Altoona</span>, <span class="loc">Johnstown</span>, or State College, despite being well south of either location and quite similar to those seen in northern <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, although the average <span class="date">winter</span> high temperatures are a bit higher. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> holds the <span class="date">June</span> and <span class="date">November</span> record lows for the state of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. <span class="loc">Somerset</span> is also the only place in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> to receive accumulations of snow in <span class="date">June</span> (other places received a partial dusting at most) when they received 3 inches of snow from the same polar front that caused them to drop to 20 degrees on <span class="date">June 10, 1913</span>, and due to the arctic air, it was powdery snow that was photographed being swept off porches with brooms. That same cold snap brought snow to many other <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> communities, especially in the northern counties.</p><br><br>
