<p><span class="loc">Baldwin</span> is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located in the town of <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> in <span class="loc">Nassau County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 24,033 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Baldwin</span> is also a station on the <span class="loc">Babylon</span> Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. Original inhabitants of the area between <span class="loc">Parsonage Creek</span> near <span class="loc">Oceanside</span> and <span class="loc">Milburn Creek</span> near <span class="loc">Freeport</span> were Native Americans known as Merokes, or <span class="loc">Merrick</span>, an Algonquian tribe indigenous to most of the <span class="loc">South Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Long Island</span>, who lived in two villages along <span class="loc">Milburn Creek</span>. In 1643, the land became known as Hick's Neck after two of <span class="loc">Hempstead</span>'s early settlers, John Spragg from <span class="loc">England</span> and John Hicks from Flushing, who extended <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> village south to the salt meadows. The grist mill built by John Pine in 1686 on <span class="loc">Milburn Creek</span> attracted more settlers who engaged in fishing, farming, marshing, raising longwood, and breeding and raising sheep. Between the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, growing Hick's Neck came to be called the village of <span class="loc">Milburn</span>. The first churches were built in 1810 and 1872, and the first school was built in 1833.</p>
