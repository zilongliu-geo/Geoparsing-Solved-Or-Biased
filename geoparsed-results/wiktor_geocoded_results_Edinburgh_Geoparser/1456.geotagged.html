<p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a small city on the outskirts of Metro <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, in northeast <span class="loc">Oakland County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 12,711 at the 2010 census. The city has the following neighborhoods: <span class="loc">Stony Creek</span> is a neighborhood on the northeast end of the city on the border with <span class="loc">Rochester Hills</span>. The Bluffs is a neighborhood on the southeast corner of the city on the border with <span class="loc">Rochester Hills</span>. <span class="loc">Yates</span> is shared with Shelby Charter Township, <span class="loc">Macomb County</span> and <span class="loc">Rochester Hills</span>. The first settlers in what would become <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, the Graham family, built a log cabin in 1817. The cabin was located where the Quik Pik and Penn Station stores today exist at the intersection of Main and Second Street. The city was named for <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, just like <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, as many early settlers to the area were formerly from the state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. The city became an industrial center with abundant water power from the <span class="loc">Clinton River</span> and <span class="loc">Paint Creek</span>. The interconnected waterways are no longer used for travel or local industry, but provide natural beauty, some fishing, and a healthy portion of the Clinton Watershed. Historically, past industries formerly located in <span class="loc">Rochester</span> included a refinery for sugar beets, a paper products company, and the Western Knitting Mills factory, which was later adapted and utilized during World War II for incendiary productionâ€”businesses that no longer exist in the area. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was served by two railroads as well as the Detroit United Railway, an interurban to <span class="loc">Royal Oak</span> and <span class="loc">Detroit</span>.</p>
