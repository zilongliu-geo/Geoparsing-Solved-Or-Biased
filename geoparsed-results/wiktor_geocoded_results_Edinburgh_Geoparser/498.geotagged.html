<p><span class="loc">Nazareth</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Castro County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 311 at the 2010 census, down from 356 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Nazareth</span> is located in eastern <span class="loc">Castro County</span> on the high plains of the <span class="loc">Llano Estacado</span> at 34°32′39″N 102°06′10″W. It is 12 miles (19 km) east of Dimmitt, the county seat, and 20 miles (32 km) west of <span class="loc">Tulia</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, <span class="loc">Nazareth</span> has a total area of 0.36 square miles (0.94 km2), all of it land. The town of <span class="loc">Nazareth</span> was established through the efforts of a Catholic priest, Joseph Reisdorff, who moved to the site in 1902 with four farmers interested in purchasing land in the area. Father Reisdorff named his colony after the biblical <span class="loc">Nazareth</span> and advertised for settlers in several midwestern German Catholic newspapers. By September 1902 the first settlers had begun to arrive. A post office was established in 1903, and later that year the Catholic community finished building its first church. <span class="loc">Nazareth</span> had 71 residents by January 1904, and the town was platted latter that year. By 1905, in addition to the church, the settlement included a blacksmith shop, a store, and a school; when the community's cemetery was consecrated in 1906, it became the only Catholic cemetery in the area. For many years local church officials supplied what little government the community required.</p>
