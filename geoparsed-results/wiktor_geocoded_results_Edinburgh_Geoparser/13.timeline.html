  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Victoria</span>, also known as <span class="loc">Rabat</span> or by its title Città <span class="per">Victoria</span>, is the capital <span class="loc">city of Gozo</span>, the second largest island in <span class="loc">Malta</span>. The city has a total population of 6,901 (<span class="date">March 2014</span>), and by population is the largest locality in <span class="loc">Gozo</span>. The area around the town, situated on a hill near the centre of the island, has been settled since Neolithic times. <span class="per">Victoria</span> is the name given <span class="date">10 June 1887</span> by the British government on the occasion of <span class="per">Queen Victoria</span>'s Golden Jubilee, at the request of the <span class="per">Bishop of Malta</span>, Mons. <span class="per">Sir Pietro Pace</span>. However many Gozitans still often refer to it by the name <span class="loc">Rabat</span>. It is usually known as Ir-Rabat Għawdex to distinguish it from the town of <span class="loc">Rabat</span> on the main island of <span class="loc">Malta</span>. In the heart of <span class="per">Victoria</span> lies the <span class="loc">Cittadella</span> (Citadel), formerly known as il <span class="loc">Castello</span>, which has been the centre of activity of the island since possibly Neolithic times, but is known to be first fortified during the Bronze Age c. <span class="date">1500 BC</span>. It was later developed by the Phoenicians and continued into becoming a complex Acropolis by Roman times.</p><br><br>
