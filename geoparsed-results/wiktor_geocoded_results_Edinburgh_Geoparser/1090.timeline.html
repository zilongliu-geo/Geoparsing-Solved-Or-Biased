  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The <span class="loc">city of Union</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Union County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,393 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the principal city of the <span class="org">Union</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span> (population 28,961 according to <span class="date">2010</span> Census), an (MSA) which includes all of <span class="loc">Union County</span> and which is further included in the greater Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, <span class="loc">South Carolina Combined Statistical Area</span> (population 1,266,995 according to the <span class="date">2010</span> Census). Both the <span class="loc">city of Union</span> and <span class="loc">Union County</span> received their names from the old <span class="org">Union</span> Church that stood a short distance from the Monarch Mill. When it was first founded, the <span class="loc">city of Union</span> was known as <span class="loc">Unionville</span>; later the name was shortened to <span class="org">Union</span>. The county’s first white settlers came from Virginia in <span class="date">1749</span>. <span class="loc">Union County</span>’s population grew the fastest between <span class="date">1762</span> and the start of the Revolutionary War. Settlers built log cabins and cultivated tobacco, flax, corn and wheat. <span class="org">Union</span> was one of the first towns settled in the area and was untouched during the Civil War because the <span class="loc">Broad River</span> flooded and turned Sherman’s troops away from the town.</p><br><br>
