  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mogo</span> (postcode: <span class="date">2536</span>) is a small heritage town in the South Coast region of the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Mogo</span> is administered by the Eurobodalla Shire council. The town is located on the Princes Highway (Highway 1), south of <span class="loc">Batemans Bay</span> and north of <span class="loc">Moruya</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Mogo</span> had a population of 263 people. <span class="loc">Mogo</span> was established during the Gold Rush after a gold find was reported in <span class="date">1851</span>. Bimbimbie, the last gold mine in the Mogo area, closed in <span class="date">1984</span> with the floating of <span class="org">the Australian</span> dollar. The town survived as a sleepy highway town, and during <span class="date">the 1990s</span> was revitalised with the growth in regional tourism. <span class="loc">Mogo</span> is <span class="date">now</span> home to a variety of tourist-centric stores including cafes, art galleries, potters, and furniture stores. <span class="loc">Mogo</span> is also a centre for the Aboriginal population of the area. <span class="loc">Mogo</span> is home to the <span class="org">Mogo Zoo</span>, a private zoo specializing in breeding programs for endangered species. Although small in comparison to metropolitan zoos, <span class="org">Mogo Zoo</span> is home to many exotic species, such as the red panda and the snow leopard, the latter of which was successfully bred at <span class="org">Mogo Zoo</span> in <span class="date">1999</span>. <span class="org">Mogo Zoo</span> also participates in programs with other Australian zoos, and its collection of animals changes regularly.</p><br><br>
