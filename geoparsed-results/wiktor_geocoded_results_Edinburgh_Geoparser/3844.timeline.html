  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Colton is a city in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Bernardino County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city is located in the Inland Empire region of the state and is approximately 57 miles east of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. The population of Colton is 52,154 according to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 47,662 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. Colton was until recently the site of Colton Crossing, one of the busiest at-grade railroad crossings in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The crossing was installed in <span class="date">1882</span> by the <span class="loc">California</span> Southern Railroad to cross the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks while building northward from <span class="loc">San Diego</span>. As a result of railroad acquisitions and mergers, this became the point at which the Burlington Northern <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span>'s "Southern Transcontinental Route" crossed the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific's "Sunset Route". As traffic on each line began to soar in the mid-1990s, fueled largely by the vast increase in imports passing through the ports of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and Long Beach, the primitive crossing became a serious bottleneck. On <span class="date">August 28, 2013</span>, the at-grade crossing was officially replaced by a fly-over that raises the east–west UP tracks over the north–south BNSF tracks.</p><br><br>
