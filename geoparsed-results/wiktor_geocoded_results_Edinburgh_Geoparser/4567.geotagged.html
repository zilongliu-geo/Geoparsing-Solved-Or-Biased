<p><span class="loc">Manhattan</span> (/mænˈhætən/, /mənˈhætən/) is one of the five <span class="loc">boroughs of New York</span> City, in the state of <span class="loc">New York</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The borough is coterminous with New <span class="loc">York County</span>, founded on November 1, 1683 as one of the state's original counties. The borough consists mostly of <span class="loc">Manhattan</span> Island, bounded by the East, Hudson, and Harlem Rivers, and also includes several small adjacent islands and <span class="loc">Marble Hill</span>, a small neighborhood on the mainland. <span class="loc">Manhattan</span> is often said to be the economic and cultural center of the <span class="loc">United States</span> and hosts the <span class="loc">United Nations Headquarters</span>. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower <span class="loc">Manhattan</span>, New <span class="loc">York City</span> has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and <span class="loc">Manhattan</span> is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization: the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Many multinational media conglomerates are based in the borough. Historically documented to have been purchased by Dutch colonists from Native Americans in 1626, for the equivalent of US$1050, <span class="loc">Manhattan</span> real estate has since become among the most expensive in the world, with the value of <span class="loc">Manhattan</span> Island, including real estate, estimated to exceed US$3 trillion in 2013.</p>
