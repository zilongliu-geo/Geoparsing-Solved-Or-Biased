<p>Lee is a town in <span class="loc">Berkshire County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> settled by. It is part of the <span class="loc">Pittsfield</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, metropolitan statistical area. The population was 5,943 at the 2010 census. Lee, which includes the villages of South and <span class="loc">East Lee</span>, is part of the Berkshires resort area. Lee occupies land which was originally territory of Mahican Indians. The first non-native settlement in the area was known as <span class="loc">Dodgetown</span> as early as 1760. <span class="loc">Dodgetown</span> was named after its founding settler, Asahel Dodge, who immigrated to the area from Cape Cod. Lee was incorporated in 1777 from parts of <span class="loc">Great Barrington</span> and <span class="loc">Washington</span>. It is named after Revolutionary War General Charles Lee. Lee is a former mill town. In the autumn of 1786 during Shays' Rebellion, about 250 followers of Daniel Shays encountered state troops commanded by General John Paterson near <span class="loc">East Lee</span>. The Shaysites paraded a fake cannon crafted from a yarn beam, and the troops fled. Early industries included agriculture, lumbering, and lime making. Abundant streams and rivers provided water power for mills which produced textiles and wire. In 1806, papermaking became the principal industry with the construction of the Willow Mill by Samuel Church in <span class="loc">South Lee</span>. In 1827, the <span class="loc">Columbia</span> Mill in central Lee was established, and would eventually be the first to supply 100% groundwood newsprint to The New York Times. By 1857, there were 25 paper mills in Lee. The Smith Paper Company discovered how to manufacture paper solely from wood pulp in 1867, and through the 1870s was the largest producer of paper in the country. The mills previously owned by Smith Paper Company were closed in 2008. Today, Lee has only a single papermaking facility.</p>
