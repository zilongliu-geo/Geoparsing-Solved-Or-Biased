The county seat is <span class="loc">Hampton</span>. The county was formed on January 15, 1851 and named after Benjamin Franklin. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is home to the <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> Fair. Held annually for five days in mid-July, the <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> Fair is held on the fairgrounds located on the west side of <span class="loc">Hampton</span>. Traditionally, grandstand entertainment begins on Wednesday with the Barnes PRCA Rodeo. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday are usually concerts featuring nationally known entertainment. In 2007 such names as Terri Clark, Marshall Tucker Band, and Trent Tomlinson &amp; Danielle Peck brought fans to the grandstand. On Sunday the Figure 8 Races generally fill the grandstand. The fair also includes free entertainment and a carnival midway. The fairgrounds features the Franklin County Historical Museum, Pleasant Hill (turn of the century village with stores, crafters, old west shows, music and entertainment), and Grandpa's Farm (all phases of farming demonstrated with vintage implements powered by draft horses, steam engines and antique tractors).</p>
