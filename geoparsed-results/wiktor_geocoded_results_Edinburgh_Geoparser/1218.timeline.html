  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> settlement in the Colony of Virginia was the second permanent English settlement in <span class="loc">the Americas</span> after <span class="loc">Bermuda</span>. <span class="per">William Kelso</span> says <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> "is where the British Empire began ... this was the first colony in the British Empire." Established by the <span class="org">Virginia Company</span> of <span class="loc">London</span> as "<span class="loc">James</span> Fort" on <span class="date">May 4, 1607</span> (O.S., <span class="date">May 14, 1607</span> N.S.), and considered permanent after brief abandonment in <span class="date">1610</span>, it followed several earlier failed attempts, including the Lost Colony of <span class="loc">Roanoke</span>. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> served as the capital of the colony for <span class="date">83 years</span>, from <span class="date">1616</span> until <span class="date">1699</span>. The settlement was located within the country of Tsenacommacah, which was administered by the Powhatan Confederacy, and specifically in that of the Paspahegh tribe. The natives initially welcomed and provided crucial provisions and support for the colonists, who were not agriculturally inclined. Relations with the newcomers soured fairly early on, leading to the total annihilation of the Paspahegh in warfare within <span class="date">3 years</span>. Mortality at <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> itself was very high due to disease and starvation, with over 80% of the colonists perishing in 1609-1610 in what became known as the "Starving Time".</p><br><br>
