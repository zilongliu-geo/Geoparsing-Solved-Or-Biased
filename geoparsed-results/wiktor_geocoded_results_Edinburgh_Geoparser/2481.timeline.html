  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Matanzas</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [maˈtansas]) is the capital of the Cuban <span class="loc">province of Matanzas</span>. Known for its poets, culture, and Afro-Cuban folklore, it is located on the northern shore of the island of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, on the Bay of <span class="loc">Matanzas</span> (Spanish <span class="loc">Bahia de Matanzas</span>), 90 kilometres (56 mi) east of the capital <span class="loc">Havana</span> and 32 kilometres (20 mi) west of the resort town of <span class="loc">Varadero</span>. <span class="loc">Matanzas</span> is called <span class="org">the City of Bridges</span>, for the seventeen bridges that cross the three rivers that traverse the city (<span class="loc">Rio Yumuri</span>, <span class="loc">San Juan</span>, and <span class="loc">Canimar</span>). For this reason it was referred to as the "Venice of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>." It was also called "La Atenas de <span class="loc">Cuba</span>" ("The <span class="loc">Athens</span> of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>") for its poets. <span class="loc">Matanzas</span> is known as the birthplace of the music and dance traditions danzón and rumba. <span class="loc">Matanzas</span> was founded in <span class="date">1693</span> as <span class="loc">San Carlos</span> y <span class="loc">San Severino</span> de <span class="loc">Matanzas</span>. This followed a royal decree ("real cédula") issued on <span class="date">September 25, 1690</span>, which decreed that the bay and port of <span class="loc">Matanzas</span> be settled by 30 families from the <span class="loc">Canary Islands</span>.</p><br><br>
