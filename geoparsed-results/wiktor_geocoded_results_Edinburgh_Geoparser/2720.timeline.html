It is a census-designated place (CDP) used for statistical purposes. The population was 23,973 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The community is southeast of <span class="loc">Lansing</span>, just south of I-96 between US-127 and M-99. The <span class="loc">city of Mason</span> is about 6 miles (9.7 km) southeast and the village of <span class="loc">Dimondale</span> is about 6 miles (9.7 km) west. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 4.3 square miles (11 km2), of which 4.3 square miles (11 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) (0.46%) is water.
