  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Columbia</span> was a town in <span class="loc">Fluvanna County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, at the confluence of the <span class="per">James</span> and <span class="per">Rivanna</span> Rivers. The population was 49 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census, making it <span class="loc">Virginia</span>'s smallest incorporated town. Known as <span class="org">Point of Fork</span> through the late 18th century, it was the setting of a minor battle during the Revolutionary War. <span class="org">Columbia</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Charlottesville Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="org">Columbia</span> dates back to <span class="date">1788</span>. In the mid-19th century, <span class="org">Columbia</span> was a point along the stagecoach route between <span class="loc">Richmond</span> and <span class="loc">Staunton</span>. <span class="loc">Gum Creek</span>, <span class="org">Point of Fork Arsenal</span>, <span class="org">Point of Fork Plantation</span>, and Tinsley Tavern are listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. The town saw significant flooding during Hurricane Camille in <span class="date">1969</span>. <span class="org">Columbia</span> was the last remaining independent town in <span class="loc">Fluvanna County</span>. However, in <span class="date">May 2014</span>, <span class="org">Columbia's Mayor and Town Council</span> proposed disincorporation which, if successful, would result in the town being reabsorbed by the County. In <span class="date">June 2014</span>, Preservation <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, a historic preservation group in the Commonwealth, placed the Town of <span class="loc">Columbia</span> on its "most endangered" list. A small group of individuals has stepped forward to raise public support to document and preserve the history of the town, which had a mayor before there was a President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p><br><br>
