<p>Franklin is a village in <span class="loc">Southfield Township</span>, <span class="loc">Oakland County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 3,150 at the 2010 census. The community is known for large, estate-style homes situated on ravines, as well as its vintage downtown and a nearby cider mill. The community was founded in 1825 by Elijah Bullock and other settlers, and was named Franklin in 1831. The village is named after Benjamin Franklin. By 1830, a business district was formed. The collection of essentially original condition structures in the village is quite unusual in suburban <span class="loc">Detroit</span>. The village was incorporated in 1953. A historical marker was erected in 1960 which reads: "FRANKLIN VILLAGE Founded in 1824-1825, Franklin received its present name in 1828. First postmaster was Dr. Ebenezer Raynale, state legislator and physician. The William Huston store, opened in 1830, was the forerunner of a business center that later included the famous Broughton Wagon Shop, the Van Every Mills, now "Ye Olde Cider Mill," several taverns, two distilleries, and two churches. The village also was a station on the Underground Railroad. Franklin still has the appearance and atmosphere of an early Michigan village.</p>
