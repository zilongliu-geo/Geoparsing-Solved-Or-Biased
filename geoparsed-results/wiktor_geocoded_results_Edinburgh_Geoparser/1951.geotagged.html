The population was 13,709 at the 2010 census. For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place <span class="loc">Oxford</span>, please see the article <span class="loc">Oxford</span> (CDP), <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was first settled in 1686 and was officially incorporated in 1713. It was the birthplace of <span class="loc">Clara Barton</span>, the first president and founder of the <span class="loc">American Red Cross</span>. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was originally settled by Huguenots in two waves, the original settlement having been abandoned after four residents (John Johnson and his three children, Peter, Andrew and Mary) were killed in a violent confrontation with local Native Americans. This event, the Johnson Massacre, is commemorated near the south end of town on Main Street. The remains of the <span class="loc">Huguenot</span> Fort (built in 1686) still exist off <span class="loc">Huguenot</span> Road. The first town clerk of <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was John Town, who also served as selectman and as a church deacon.

The town sits in a valley, and much of its area lies in the flood plain of the <span class="loc">French River</span>, which runs through the town. A substantial parcel north and west of <span class="loc">Oxford</span> Center is held, for flood control purposes, by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The land, known as <span class="loc">Greenbriar</span>, also serves as a nature preserve.</p>
