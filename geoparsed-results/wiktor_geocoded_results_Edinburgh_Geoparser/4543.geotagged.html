<p><span class="loc">Murray County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 39,628. The county seat is <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span>. <span class="loc">Murray County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Dalton</span>, <span class="loc">GA</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Chattanooga-Cleveland-Dalton, TN-GA-AL Combined Statistical Area. In December, 1832 the Georgia General Assembly designated the extreme northwestern corner of the state as <span class="loc">Murray County</span>. Formerly part of <span class="loc">Cherokee County</span>, the area was named for a distinguished <span class="loc">Georgia</span> statesman from <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, Mr. Thomas W. Murray, a former speaker of the Georgia House. Within a short time the legislature found the county was too large to administer properly as the population grew, for the county then included what is now Dade, Walker, <span class="loc">Catoosa</span>, <span class="loc">Whitfield</span>, <span class="loc">Murray</span>, Gordon and parts of Bartow and Chatooga Counties, so further division became necessary. Within two decades, <span class="loc">Murray County</span> came to be 342 square miles (886 km2) of land with Spring Place as its county seat until the railroad was built through <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span>. With <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> more accessible, the county seat was moved there.</p>
