<p><span class="loc">Winchester</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Lewis County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Camas Prairie</span> in the north central part of the state. The population was 340 at the 2010 census, up from 308 in 2000. <span class="loc">Winchester</span> is within the <span class="loc">Nez Perce Indian Reservation</span>, and similar to the opening of lands in <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> government opened the reservation for white settlement in November 1895. The proclamation had been signed less than two weeks earlier by President Cleveland. The city was named in 1900 during a meeting to establish a school district. While considering the possibilities, an individual looked at the stack of Winchester rifles at the door and suggested the name, which was approved. The sawmill closed in May 1965 after the mature timber in the area had been cut. The mill was operated by Boise Cascade for its final five years; its closure followed a fire which destroyed much of downtown <span class="loc">Winchester</span> in November 1964. A half mile (1 km) outside of town is Winchester Lake State Park, planned in 1966 and established in 1969. Originally it was a mill pond, created in 1910 by damming <span class="loc">Lapwai Creek</span>. Water quality issues at the lake were addressed with the installation of aeration units in 2002.</p>
