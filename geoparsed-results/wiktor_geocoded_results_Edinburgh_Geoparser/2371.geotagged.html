In 1806, Zebulon Pike led the Pike expedition westward from St Louis, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, of which part of their journey followed the <span class="loc">Cottonwood River</span> through <span class="loc">Marion County</span> near the current <span class="loc">cities of Florence</span>, <span class="loc">Marion</span>, <span class="loc">Durham</span>. From the 1820s to the 1870s, one of the most significant land routes in the <span class="loc">United States</span> was the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail. It was located about 1 mile northwest of <span class="loc">Durham</span>. The trail was active across <span class="loc">Marion County</span> from 1821 to 1866. In 1854, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in 1861 <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In 1855, <span class="loc">Marion County</span> was established within the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory, which included the land for modern day <span class="loc">Durham</span>.</p>
