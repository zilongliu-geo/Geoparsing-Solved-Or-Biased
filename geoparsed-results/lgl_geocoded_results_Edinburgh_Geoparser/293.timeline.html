  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Trucking toward a port-pollution solution. The gig: Founder and chief executive of one of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>' smallest publicly traded firms. <span class="org">Balqon Corp.</span> is a 12-employee company that recently completed the assembly of the first in a series of heavy-duty electric trucks that will be hauling cargo at the Port of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, the nation's busiest container port. The L.A. port has signed on for 25 trucks at a cost of $5.7 million. <span class="loc">Samra</span> is hoping to market the technology to railroads and others. Family influence: <span class="loc">Samra</span>, 46, who was born near <span class="loc">New Delhi</span>, is the first male in his family to choose a civilian career over the military. <span class="loc">Samra</span> jokes that his civilian status makes him "the only wimp in the family," but discipline seems to run in his blood. <span class="loc">Samra</span> says he barely allowed himself to sleep during college and often works as late as 1 a.m. Background: <span class="loc">Samra</span> came to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> in <span class="date">1980</span> and went to work on his first day in the country at <span class="loc">Micro Peripherals</span> in <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span>. Later, as the quality-control manager for a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> electronics firm called Flextronics, he held overseas factories to a 100-point efficiency and quality measurement standard, demanding that each subcontractor show improvement in performance annually. He held himself to the same rigid standards when he formed Balqon in <span class="date">2005</span>. Education: Chemical engineering degree from <span class="org">Panjab University</span>. <span class="loc">Samra</span> says he has never used his chemical engineering training and viewed every firm that contracted with his employers as a case study on how to run a business. The problem: <span class="loc">Samra</span>'s company had the expertise to design its electric vehicle but didn't have the capital or a location suitable for a vehicle assembly line. The breakthrough: In the Port of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="loc">Samra</span> found the rough equivalent of a venture capitalist and a technology incubator desperate for answers to Southern <span class="loc">California</span>'s biggest single source of air pollution. Under an arrangement with the port and the South Coast Air Quality Management District, Balqon got $527,000 in seed money to build and test a prototype. <span class="loc">Samra</span> was required to move his company across the county line from <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> to <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, and he found an office park facility in <span class="loc">Harbor City</span> that was large enough to work on several trucks at once. Coming together: The truck chassis arrives pre-assembled, but without an engine or a standard transmission. Power is generated through two trays of seven forklift batteries. <span class="loc">Samra</span> doesn't talk about the controller itself or the software that runs it. "That would be the secret sauce," he quips. Hobbies: None. The <span class="loc">Laguna Hills</span> resident is so busy with his new truck line that he has time only for work. Bare bones: Walk into the Balqon offices, and no one greets you. The company is hiring engineers first and a receptionist later. <span class="loc">Samra</span>'s office has that just-moved-in look, even though Balqon relocated <span class="date">seven months ago</span>. A copy of <span class="per">Ayn Rand</span>'s "Atlas Shrugged" sits untouched on the corner of his desk where a <span class="date">Christmas</span> gift-giver left it. "Maybe by <span class="date">next Christmas</span>," he says.</p><br><br>
