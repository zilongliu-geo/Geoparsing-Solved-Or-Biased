  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Marion</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Williamson County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 17,193 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of a dispersed urban area that developed out of the early 20th Century coal fields. <span class="date">Today</span> <span class="loc">Marion</span> serves as the largest retail trade center in Southern <span class="loc">Illinois</span> with its central location along Interstate 57 and <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Route 13 (colloquially known as Southern <span class="loc">Illinois</span>' "Main Street"). It is home to the <span class="org">Illinois Star Centre</span> mall and the Southern <span class="loc">Illinois Miners</span> baseball team, and is in the process of being selected for <span class="loc">Illinois</span>' first STAR Bonds District for the proposed <span class="loc">Boulder Creek</span> at The Hill development. The city is part of the Marion-Herrin <span class="org">Micropolitan Area</span> and is a part of the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, <span class="org">Illinois Combined Statistical Area</span> with 123,272 residents, the sixth most populous Combined statistical area in <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The city is also part of the unofficial Metro Lakeland area. Following the creation of <span class="loc">Williamson County</span> out of the south half of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> by the <span class="org">Illinois General Assembly</span>, three commissioners appointed by the lawmakers met at <span class="loc">Bainbridge</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, on <span class="date">August 19, 1839</span>, for the purpose of locating a new county seat as close to the center of the county as possible. <span class="date">The next day</span>, <span class="date">August 20</span>, they laid out a town of 20 acres (81,000 m2) with a public square about one-quarter of a mile east of the county's center, but a point on top of a slight hill of 448 feet (137 m) above sea level. The site sat in a small open grassland known as Poor Prairie. For a name, they chose <span class="loc">Marion</span> to honor American Revolutionary War hero <span class="per">General Francis</span> "<span class="loc">Swamp Fox</span>" <span class="loc">Marion</span>.</p><br><br>
