<p><span class="loc">Hampton</span> is a developing township to the <span class="loc">south of Peterborough</span>, <span class="loc">Cambridgeshire</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. The first two neighbourhoods to be complete are <span class="loc">Hampton Hargate</span>, which is home to a community of around 1,700 homes, and <span class="loc">Hampton</span> Vale, with approximately 1,900 homes. Each neighbourhood is based around its own local centre with community facilities, shops and primary school. Work is continuing on building a third neighbourhood at <span class="loc">Hempsted</span>, while planning is now underway on a fourth neighbourhood, the <span class="loc">Hamptons</span>, which, like other parts of <span class="loc">Hampton</span>, will have its own distinct character. Adjoining these is <span class="loc">Hampton</span>'s central and commercial area where the Serpentine Green shopping centre, Hampton College secondary and primary schools, and two business parks - <span class="loc">Cygnet</span> Park and <span class="loc">Kingston Park</span>, are located. Eventually <span class="loc">Hampton</span> will have up to 8,500 new homes spread over its four local areas, with additional schools, local centres and leisure facilities, as well as commercial and retail areas providing more than 12,000 jobs. Construction started in 1996 and is scheduled to continue until at least 2023. Since the first arrivals to Holly Walk, <span class="loc">Hampton Hargate</span>, in 1997, more than 4,750 new homes have been built at a rate of up to 500 a year. More than 30 home builders and housing associations have built schemes, including around 900 units of affordable housing.</p>
