  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">Pott Co.</span> would get biggest boost from US-24 project. <span class="loc">Pottawatomie County</span> likely will be the biggest economic benefactor of a US-24 corridor expansion project, according to preliminary results of a study funded by area government and KDOT. That was the message consultants told visitors at a town hall meeting at the Green Valley Community Center <span class="date">Wednesday evening</span>. The study is being performed in part to assess the effect that recent and future economic expansion will have on the highway and jobs in the Manhattan area through <span class="date">2030</span>. It is also looking at what those effects will be and where they will occur. Similar studies are being performed in other counties through which US-24 runs, such as <span class="loc">Leavenworth</span> and <span class="loc">Shawnee</span>. The National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility and the jobs it likely will create in the Manhattan area also was a major factor in the local study. Consultants said they based it in part on communities with similar federal research facilities, such as Fermilab in <span class="loc">Kane County</span>, <span class="loc">Ill.</span>, and <span class="loc">NERI</span> in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Colo</span>. A similar meeting was held <span class="date">Wednesday</span> in <span class="loc">St. George</span>. A third meeting takes place at 5 this evening at the <span class="org">Wamego Seniors Center</span>.
