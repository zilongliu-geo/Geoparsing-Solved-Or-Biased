  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>For the former town in <span class="loc">Bristol County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, see <span class="per">Warren</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. <span class="per">Warren</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,135 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place <span class="per">Warren</span>, please see the article <span class="per">Warren</span> (CDP), <span class="per">Massachusetts</span>. <span class="per">Warren</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1664</span> and was officially incorporated on <span class="date">January 16, 1741</span> as the town of Western. Originally a part of Quaboag Plantation, the town <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="per">Warren</span> was part of <span class="loc">Brookfield</span> for <span class="date">68 years</span> until it was renamed Western. <span class="per">Warren</span> includes land petitioned from both the Quaboag Plantation and the "Kingsfield", which included parts of <span class="per">Palmer</span> and <span class="per">Brimfield</span>. On <span class="date">March 13, 1834</span>, the town was renamed <span class="per">Warren</span> in honor of General <span class="per">Joseph Warren</span>, who died at the Battle of <span class="loc">Bunker Hill</span> during the American Revolutionary War. The need to rename the town came about due to confusion of the name "Western" with the town of <span class="loc">Weston</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. According to the History of <span class="per">Warren Massachusetts</span> by Olney I. Darling, Western was renamed <span class="per">Warren</span> due to "countless mistakes in the transmission of the mails." On <span class="date">January 13, 1834</span>, a town meeting was held to discuss a name change. Shortly thereafter, the town petitioned the legislature to change the name, which was soon done, and the first town meeting under the name "<span class="per">Warren</span>" was held on <span class="date">April 28, 1834</span>.</p><br><br>
