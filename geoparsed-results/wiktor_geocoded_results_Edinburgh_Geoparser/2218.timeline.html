  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Monroe</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Snohomish County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 17,304 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The population was 17,510 at <span class="date">2013</span> Estimate from Office of Financial Management. The history of <span class="per">Monroe</span> is intertwined with that of the Great Northern Railway which pushed over the <span class="org">Cascade</span> Range at <span class="loc">Stevens Pass</span> and worked its way down the Skykomish River Valley. Prior to that time the main settlement in the area had been located about one mile west of where the downtown eventually grew up and was known as <span class="loc">Park Place</span>. However, the city's merchants relocated when the railroad survey was completed to have better access to the new transportation corridor. The new development was originally known as <span class="loc">Tye City</span>, but became <span class="per">Monroe</span> when <span class="loc">Park Place</span>'s main store, the one containing the <span class="org">U.S. Post Office</span>, relocated and took up the name "<span class="per">Monroe</span> at <span class="loc">Park Place</span>" in honor of <span class="per">James Monroe</span>, the nation's fifth president. Because the <span class="org">U.S. Postal Department</span> would not allow any new post offices to use double names, the post office, and eventually the town, became known simply as "<span class="per">Monroe</span>."</p><br><br>
