  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lismore</span> is a town in northeastern <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> and the main population centre in the <span class="loc">City of Lismore</span> local government area; it is also a regional centre in the Northern Rivers region of the State. <span class="loc">Lismore</span> had an estimated urban population of 29,388 at <span class="date">June 2014</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Lismore</span> lies in the Bundjalung people's nation area. However, the actual area of the Bundjalung people from <span class="loc">Evans Head</span> is currently under examination, as well as the actual origin of the name Bundjalung. It has been suggested that the Aboriginal people called the area Tuckurimbah meaning "glutton." The European history of the city begins in c.â€‰<span class="date">1843</span>: a pastoral run covering an area of 93 square kilometres (36 sq mi) was taken up by <span class="per">Captain Dumaresq</span> at this time covering the <span class="loc">Lismore</span> area and was stocked with sheep from the <span class="loc">New England</span> area. <span class="per">Ward Stephens</span> took up the run in the same year, but the subtropical climate was unsuited for sheep grazing, so it was eventually abandoned. In <span class="date">January 1845</span>, <span class="per">William</span> and <span class="per">Jane</span> <span class="per">Wilson</span> took it over. The <span class="loc">Wilsons</span> were Scottish immigrants, who arrived in <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> in <span class="date">May 1833</span>. One theory has it that <span class="per">Jane Wilson</span> was responsible for naming the location for <span class="loc">Lismore</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, where the couple had honeymooned, whereas another one is that it was named after <span class="loc">Lismore</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span> because of the similarity in the scenery.</p><br><br>
