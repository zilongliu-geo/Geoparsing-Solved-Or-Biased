<p>Milton (2011 census population 84,362) is a town in <span class="loc">Southern Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, and part of the <span class="loc">Halton Region</span> in the Greater Toronto Area. The town received a significant amount of attention after the 2006 and 2011 censuses indicated that Milton was the fastest growing municipality in the Greater <span class="loc">Golden Horseshoe</span>, with a 71.4% increase in population between 2001 and 2006, and a 56.4% increase in population between 2006 and 2011. In early 2014, Milton's population is estimated to be 102,000 with an estimated growth to 228,000 by 2031. Milton is located 40 km (25 mi) west of Downtown Toronto on Highway 401, and is the western terminus for the Milton line commuter train and bus corridor operated by GO Transit. Milton is on the edge of the <span class="loc">Niagara Escarpment</span>, a UNESCO world biosphere reserve and the <span class="loc">Bruce</span> Trail. The town took root out of a settlement by Jasper Martin along the <span class="loc">Sixteen Mile Creek</span>; Martin immigrated from <span class="loc">Newcastle</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> with his wife Sarah and two sons on May 17, 1818. Martin was granted 100 acres (40 ha) of land, from the Crown in 1820, designated Lot 14, Concession 2, Township of <span class="loc">Trafalgar</span>, <span class="loc">Halton County</span>, in the District of Gore. Martin later built a grist mill along the creek and created a pond, known as <span class="loc">Mill Pond</span>, to power his mill. The mill became the centre of settlement for others as they settled in the region. In 1837 the area had a population of approximately 100 people and was named Milton after the English poet John Milton. The town, as it is today, soon after became known as Milton. The two principal property owners of the young town were the Martins and the Fosters. The current site of Milton's town hall was donated from Mr. Hugh Foster (and thus, Hugh Foster Hall).</p>
