  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Woman is robbed behind <span class="loc">Berea</span> apartment complex. <span class="loc">Berea</span> police are searching for a suspect in a <span class="date">March 21</span> robbery, but have only a limited description to go on. <span class="org">Berea Police Department</span> spokesman Capt. <span class="per">Ken Clark</span> said the victim in the robbery outside an apartment complex in the 800 block of Candlewood Drive could provide only a partial description. “We don’t have much to go on,” <span class="per">Clark</span> said. The woman described the man who shoved her to the ground and stole her purse as a tall, large male wearing a dark or gray hooded sweatshirt, <span class="per">Clark</span> said. The man fled the scene as a passenger in a green car. <span class="per">Clark</span> said the woman was outside smoking behind the complex when the suspect pushed her to the ground, causing cuts to her knees and hands. “That’s why we made it a robbery first (degree), because the statute says if someone’s injured,” <span class="per">Clark</span> said. Walmart robberyA <span class="loc">Berea</span> man was charged with second-degree robbery and resisting arrest after fighting with Walmart employees and <span class="loc">Berea</span> police attempting to detain him for allegedly shoplifting from the store. <span class="per">Grant W. Graham</span>, 27, of the <span class="date">1000</span> block of Brooklyn Boulevard, was stopped by Walmart employees around <span class="date">7 p.m. Sunday</span> for allegedly attempting to take merchandise from the store. <span class="per">Clark</span> said <span class="per">Graham</span> was involved in an altercation with loss prevention specialists before fleeing, and then fought with officers who attempted to arrest him. Anyone with information about these crimes is asked to call the <span class="org">Berea Police Department</span> at 986-8456. <span class="per">Brian Smith</span> may be reached at bsmith@richmondregister.com or at 624-6694.</p><br><br>
