  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Weston is a town in <span class="loc">Windsor County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 566 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Home to the <span class="org">Weston Playhouse Theatre Company</span>, it includes the villages of Weston and the Island. Weston was originally the western part of <span class="loc">Andover</span> called <span class="loc">West Town</span>. Because <span class="per">Markham</span> and <span class="per">Terrible</span> mountains blocked travel between the town's halves, it was set off and incorporated on <span class="date">October 26, 1799</span>, by the legislature. Set among the <span class="loc">Green Mountains</span>, the terrain is very rough and mountainous, but the intervales provided good soil for agriculture and pasturage. A second village grew at the canal cut to divert the <span class="loc">West River</span> to power watermills. Called the Island, it developed into a small mill town. By <span class="date">1859</span>, when Weston's population was 950, industries included ten sawmills, a gristmill, two tanneries, one wood-turning mill, one machine shop, one axe shop, one carding machine, in addition to shops for blacksmiths, carpenters, tinsmiths, wheelwrights and shoemakers. <span class="loc">Vermont</span>'s oldest professional theatre, the <span class="org">Weston Playhouse Theatre Company</span>, was founded in <span class="date">1935</span>. The <span class="loc">Vermont</span> Country Store, a catalogue, retail, and e-commerce business, was established here in <span class="date">1946</span> by <span class="per">Vrest</span> and <span class="per">Ellen</span> <span class="loc">Orton</span>.</p><br><br>
