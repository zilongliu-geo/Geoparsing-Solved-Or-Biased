  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Concord</span> /ˈkɒŋ.kərd/ is the capital city of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Merrimack County</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, its population was 42,695. <span class="org">Concord</span> includes the villages of <span class="loc">Penacook</span>, <span class="loc">East Concord</span>, and <span class="loc">West Concord</span>. The city is home to the <span class="org">University of New Hampshire School of Law</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>'s only law school; St. Paul's School, a private preparatory school; NHTI, a two-year community college; and the Granite State Symphony Orchestra. The area that would become <span class="org">Concord</span> was originally settled <span class="date">thousands of years ago</span> by Abenaki Native Americans called the <span class="loc">Pennacook</span>. The tribe fished for migrating salmon, sturgeon, and alewives with nets strung across the rapids of the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span>. The stream was also the transportation route for their birch bark canoes, which could travel from <span class="loc">Lake Winnipesaukee</span> to the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>. The broad sweep of the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span> valley floodplain provided good soil for farming beans, gourds, pumpkins, melons and maize. On <span class="date">January 17, 1725</span>, the Province of <span class="loc">Massachusetts Bay</span>, which then claimed territories west of the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span>, granted the <span class="org">Concord</span> area as the Plantation of <span class="loc">Penacook</span>. It was settled between <span class="date">1725</span> and <span class="date">1727</span> by <span class="per">Captain Ebenezer Eastman</span> and others from <span class="loc">Haverhill</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. On <span class="date">February 9, 1734</span>, the town was incorporated as <span class="loc">Rumford</span>, from which Sir <span class="per">Benjamin Thompson</span>, Count <span class="loc">Rumford</span> would take his title. It was renamed <span class="org">Concord</span> in <span class="date">1765</span> by Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span> following a bitter boundary dispute between <span class="loc">Rumford</span> and the town of Bow; the city name was meant to reflect the new concord, or harmony, between the disputant towns. Citizens displaced by the resulting border adjustment were given land elsewhere as compensation. In <span class="date">1779</span>, New <span class="loc">Pennacook</span> Plantation was granted to <span class="per">Timothy Walker</span>, Jr. and his associates at what would be incorporated in <span class="date">1800</span> as <span class="loc">Rumford</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, the site of <span class="loc">Pennacook</span> Falls.</p><br><br>
