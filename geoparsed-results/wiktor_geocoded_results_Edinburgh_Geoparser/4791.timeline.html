  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Princeton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Collin County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census it had a population of 6,807. In the late 1870s <span class="per">T. B. Wilson</span> and his brother <span class="per">George</span> began farming near the site of future <span class="loc">Princeton</span>. In <span class="date">1881</span> the <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and <span class="org">Texas Railroad Company</span> extended its line from <span class="loc">Greenville</span> to <span class="loc">McKinney</span>, passing through land owned by the brothers. The name "<span class="per">Wilson</span>'s <span class="org">Switch</span>" was commonly used to designate the area. When residents applied for a post office branch, however, they learned that the name <span class="per">Wilson</span> was already being used. The community then submitted the name "<span class="loc">Princeton</span>" in honor of <span class="per">Prince Dowlin</span>, a landowner and promoter of the town. This name was accepted, and a post office was established in <span class="date">1888</span>. In <span class="date">1940</span>, a camp of 76 cabins was built west of <span class="loc">Princeton</span> to house up to 400 migrant workers, who came to work during the onion and cotton <span class="date">seasons</span>. In <span class="date">February 1945</span>, the site became a prisoner-of-war camp for Germans prisoners captured during the Second World War. The local farmers paid the POWs to work on their farms. This operation continued for <span class="date">eight months</span>. Under a special bill, the German prisoners were contracted to work on the City Park located across from city hall. The park was built as a living memorial and shrine to those who served and died during World War II. The Community Park/WWII P.O.W. Camp is located at 500 West College Street.</p><br><br>
