<p>Due to the presence of Sebara Deldel, one of only two bridges across the <span class="loc">Abay</span> River until the late 19th century, Mota became a major commercial center, which was described by at least one group of European travellers as "the most considerable market" in <span class="loc">Gojjam</span>; it attracted merchants from as far away as <span class="loc">Begemder</span>, <span class="loc">Gondar</span> and <span class="loc">Tigray</span>. To reinstate the commerce prior to the bridge being broken, Bridges to Prosperity is building a 100-meter suspended pedestrian bridge to provide safe access Those crossing the river are able to obtain cotton cloth, cattle, and horses. Likewise, Mota was the seat of an important royal fiefdom during the Gondarine period, and a notable place for asylum in the early 19th century. The artist Aleqa Elyas <span class="loc">Hailu</span>, believed to be <span class="loc">Ethiopia</span>'s first foreign-trained artist, was born in Mota around 1861. He worked mostly in <span class="loc">Shewa</span> where he decorated manuscripts and many churches, although he also decorated one in his native town. His son Aleqa Gebre Ezgziabher Elyas was a man of literature, writing the Royal Chronicle of Lij Iyasu and the Empress Zewditu.</p>
