  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>200 Knucklehead's patrons brawl in <span class="loc">Chiefland</span>. Off-duty officers from three agencies were called in <span class="date">early Saturday</span> to break up a <span class="loc">Chiefland</span> bar brawl that turned into a street fight involving as many as 200 people. <span class="loc">Chiefland</span> Police Chief <span class="per">Robert Douglas</span> said his officers were called to Knucklehead’s Bar at about <span class="date">1:30 a.m. Saturday</span> to break up a fight that had moved to the parking lot. The first officers on the scene called for backup immediately due to the size of the brawl and then waited for additional officers from the police department, the <span class="loc">Levy County</span> Sheriff’s Office, the Florida Highway Patrol and all off-duty officers in the area to arrive. “Even with all that manpower, it took about 30 minutes to remove the crowd and break up all the fights,” <span class="per">Douglas</span> said. He characterized the participants as mostly men in <span class="date">the 20s</span> and 30s, with most from the <span class="loc">Chiefland</span> or <span class="loc">Cross City</span> areas. A motive for the fighting had not been established by <span class="date">Monday morning</span>. “We have had some fights at that bar, but none this big,” <span class="per">Douglas</span> said. “We aren’t sure what started this, but when we got there the majority of the fighting was in the parking lot where there were guys swinging bar stools. Some officers were hit in the head. It was a street fight.” One man was arrested, although others could have been charged for a variety of offenses, officials said. “As the fights were broken up, people ran off and that is something we will be addressing for future events,” <span class="per">Douglas</span> said.</p><br><br>
