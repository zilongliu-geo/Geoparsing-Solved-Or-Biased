  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Huckabee</span> campaigns with <span class="per">McDonnell</span> in <span class="loc">Roanoke</span>. <span class="loc">ROANOKE</span> -- Former Arkansas Gov. <span class="per">Mike Huckabee</span> campaigned with Virginia gubernatorial candidate <span class="per">Bob McDonnell</span> in <span class="loc">Roanoke</span> <span class="date">yesterday</span>, helping him raise $50,000 and praising him as the Republican who can help restore the party's fortunes nationwide. Speaking to reporters, <span class="per">Huckabee</span>, who lost to Arizona Sen. <span class="per">John McCain</span> <span class="date">last year</span> in his bid to win the Republican nomination for president, criticized those who say "that the Republican Party has sort of already experienced its demise and that the funeral services are being planned in the near future." "You come to places like Virginia and you see that with <span class="per">Bob McDonnell</span>, we've got a very strong pulse," <span class="per">Huckabee</span> said at the <span class="org">Shenandoah Club</span> downtown. "Cancel the memorial." <span class="per">McDonnell</span>, who resigned as state attorney general to run for governor, opened his campaign <span class="date">Saturday</span> by promising to create jobs and make Virginia a leading energy producer. <span class="per">McDonnell</span> favors drilling for oil and gas off Virginia's shore and says he wants to cut red tape to make it easier to start a business in the state. State Democratic Party leaders responded to <span class="per">McDonnell</span>'s campaign kickoff by labeling him an obstructionist who is unable to work across party lines to carry out the business of Virginia. The lone Republican in the race for the governor's job, <span class="per">McDonnell</span> is counting on <span class="per">Huckabee</span> to help him raise cash for the impending battle with the winner of the Democratic nomination. Three candidates are running for the Democratic nod: former Democratic National Committee chairman <span class="per">Terry McAuliffe</span> of <span class="loc">McLean</span>, former <span class="loc">Del</span>. <span class="per">Brian J. Moran</span> of Alexandria and state Sen. R. <span class="per">Creigh Deeds</span> of <span class="loc">Bath County</span>.</p><br><br>
