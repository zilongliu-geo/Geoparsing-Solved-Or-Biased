<p>2 from planning board vie for council seat. ISLE OF PALMS â€” Two members of the city Planning Commission will appear on the May 12 ballot for a special election to fill Mayor Dick Cronin's unexpired City Council term. Barbara Bergwerf, 65, commission member, and commission Chairman Ron Denton, 46, both have filed for the seat. Concerns about the community's short-term rentals and development prompted Bergwerf, a retired artist and photographer, to run. "I feel like I could do more for the community on the City Council than the planning commission," she said. Bergwerf said no one, herself included, is against renting out island homes, but she is concerned with large six- to 10-bedroom homes being built within residential neighborhoods. "I'm concerned about development on the island and the future development of the island," she said. Denton, an architect, said he is running to unify the community. "I just want to bring cohesiveness between those who live in Wild Dunes, those who live outside Wild Dunes and a cohesive conclusion to concerns regarding short-term rentals," he said. The Planning Commission has been reviewing the city's current short-term rental ordinance to judge its effectiveness. Denton said some people in the community would like stricter laws, but he said the law needs examination before the city makes anymore changes. Denton said he would keep his eye on the city budget as a councilman. City officials have embarked on a number of projects, including building a new public safety building, he said. <span class="loc">Cronin</span> was elected to finish out the former mayor's term in February. His council seat is up for re-election in November.</p>
