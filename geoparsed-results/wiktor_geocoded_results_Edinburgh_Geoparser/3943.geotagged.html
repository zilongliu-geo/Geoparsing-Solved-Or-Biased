<p><span class="loc">Marsa</span> (Maltese: Il-Marsa) is a town in the <span class="loc">South Eastern Region</span> of <span class="loc">Malta</span>, with a population of 4,401 people as of March 2014. The name <span class="loc">Marsa</span> means "the harbour". <span class="loc">Marsa</span> is located on the <span class="loc">Marsa Creek</span>, a body of water formed by the flow of water from wadis in high ground nearby to the sea. The creek includes the <span class="loc">Grand Harbour</span> which the town is based on. A port was first established at <span class="loc">Marsa</span> by the Phoenicians. Remains of Roman constructions have been found close to the town. It is thought a foundry of the Order of the Knights of <span class="loc">St. John</span> may have been located at <span class="loc">Marsa</span>. During the Great Siege of <span class="loc">Malta</span> of 1565, <span class="loc">Marsa</span> was used as a camp by troops of the Ottoman Empire. Following their defeat, <span class="loc">Marsa</span> became a barony containing a number of vineyards. In the 17th century a historical museum, the Museo di <span class="loc">San Giacomo</span>, was located at <span class="loc">Marsa</span>. This was created when Giovanni Francesco Abela converted his house into a museum and was the first of its type on <span class="loc">Malta</span>. Many of its artefacts are now held at the <span class="loc">National Museum</span> of Archaeology in <span class="loc">Malta</span>'s capital city <span class="loc">Valletta</span>.</p>
