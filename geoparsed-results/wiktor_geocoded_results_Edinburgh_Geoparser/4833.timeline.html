  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Bellingham</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 16,332 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town sits on the southwestern fringe of <span class="per">Metropolitan Boston</span>, along the rapidly growing "outer belt" that is Route 495. It is formally a part of the <span class="loc">Boston–Cambridge–Quincy metropolitan</span> statistical area, as well as the <span class="loc">Providence metropolitan</span> area. For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place <span class="per">Bellingham</span>, please see the article <span class="per">Bellingham</span> (CDP), <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The area of the town south of the <span class="loc">Charles River</span> constituted the southwestern corner of the Dedham Grant, which sprouted much of what has become <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>. The land was swampy, and the town of <span class="loc">Dedham</span> did not believe it worthy of settlement. The area north of the river would be purchased by <span class="per">Edward Rawson</span>, and due to the settlement of borders with the surrounding communities, these two areas would eventually merge. By <span class="date">1713</span>, there were enough citizens to warrant village meetings in the area. By <span class="date">1718</span>, the village petitioned for separation, and the town officially incorporated on <span class="date">November 27, 1719</span>. The village was originally named "Westham" (short for "<span class="loc">West Dedham</span>"), but at the time of incorporation, its name was changed to <span class="loc">Bellingham</span> without record of the benefactor. The town is named for <span class="per">Richard Bellingham</span>, an early governor of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span>.</p><br><br>
