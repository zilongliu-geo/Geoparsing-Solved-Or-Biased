  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Mosty [ˈmɔstɨ] is a village in the administrative <span class="loc">district of Gmina Chęciny</span>, within <span class="loc">Kielce County</span>, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, in south-central <span class="loc">Poland</span>. It lies approximately 6 kilometres (4 mi) south-west of Chęciny and 19 km (12 mi) south-west of the regional capital <span class="loc">Kielce</span>. The village has a population of 130. Mosty’s underdevelopment is caused partially by the fact that for <span class="date">many years</span> the area was planned to be flooded and become Morze Chęcińskie (Chęciny Sea), an artificial lake that would cover the village and its surroundings. The idea emerged in <span class="date">1930s</span> and, if successful, it would have been the biggest artificial lake (reservoir) in <span class="loc">Europe</span>. Due to this project, only in <span class="date">2005</span> proved unprofitable and aborted, there was no investment in the area. Until <span class="date">today</span>, many houses still do not have running water and the village was connected to the electricity line in <span class="date">1970s</span>. 2. <span class="per">Baran, P.</span> (<span class="date">2014</span>, <span class="date">June 31</span>).
