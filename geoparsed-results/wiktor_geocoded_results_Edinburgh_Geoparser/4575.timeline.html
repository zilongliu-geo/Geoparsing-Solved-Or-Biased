  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The Town of <span class="per">Dillon</span> is a Home Rule Municipality in <span class="loc">Summit County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 904 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The original town of <span class="per">Dillon</span> was built as a stage stop and trading post on the northeast side of the <span class="loc">Snake River</span>. The town was named for <span class="per">Tom Dillon</span>, a prospector, and was incorporated in <span class="date">1883</span>. By <span class="date">1892</span> the town had been relocated twice, both times in order to be closer to railroad lines that were extended into the area. All three of these historic townsites were situated very close to the Blue River Valley confluence where the <span class="loc">Snake River</span> and <span class="loc">Tenmile Creek</span> flowed in, and this area is <span class="date">now</span> referred to collectively as "<span class="per">Old Dillon</span>". During the Great Depression, <span class="loc">Denver</span> Water began acquiring land around <span class="per">Dillon</span>. In <span class="date">1956</span>, residents and business owners in <span class="per">Dillon</span> were notified that they would need to sell their property and move out, because <span class="loc">Denver</span> Water was about to begin construction on a dam just downstream from the town, and the resulting reservoir (which would help supply water to Front Range communities) was going to flood <span class="per">Dillon</span> and the surrounding valley. About a mile to the north, some land on a hillside was set aside for the current townsite, which is <span class="date">now</span> situated on the shoreline of <span class="loc">Dillon</span> Reservoir.</p><br><br>
