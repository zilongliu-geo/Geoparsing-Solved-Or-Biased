<p><span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span>, affectionately called St. <span class="loc">Joe County</span> by locals, is an unincorporated community in German Township, <span class="loc">Vanderburgh County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and centered on St. Joseph Catholic Church. Along with that of <span class="loc">Darmstadt</span>, its colonization marked the beginning of German-American immigration to southern <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. The area was chosen as a settlement for its rich farmland. The town is named after the church in its center, St. Joseph Catholic Church. The church is named for the <span class="loc">Saint Joseph</span> the Carpenter, the father of Jesus. Unlike most other local communities, St. Joseph has never had a railway station. The nickname "St. <span class="loc">Joe County</span>" originates from the fact that there are multiple churches by the name of St. Joseph in the Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="loc">Evansville</span> and <span class="loc">Vincennes</span>, and different names were needed to distinguish one from the next in conversation and on paperwork. The church is referred to as "St. Joe in the County", referring to the fact that the other St. Joseph Catholic Churches are located in <span class="loc">Evansville</span> ("St. Joe [in the] City") and Jasper "St. Joe [in] Jasper"). The name is frequently truncated to "St. <span class="loc">Joe County</span>", and members of the diocese have come to know the town as "St. <span class="loc">Joe County</span>".</p>
