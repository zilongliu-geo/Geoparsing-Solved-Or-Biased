The history of <span class="loc">Novotroitsk</span> goes to the beginning of the 20th century with a small farm in the wilderness. Near it, were the farms Akkermanovsky, Beloshapochny, and the village of <span class="loc">Khabarnoye</span>. Several families of peasants/immigrants from <span class="loc">Ukraine</span> settled near Silnova and named their settlement <span class="loc">Novotroitsk</span>. <span class="date">The 1930s</span>, large industrial buildings were created. Before <span class="loc">Novotroitsk</span> was founded, the villagers heard news of the construction of factories in <span class="loc">Orsk</span>, and the finding of minerals. Fersman, a well-known academician, spoke in his writings of the fabulous and wealthy <span class="loc">Orsk region</span>, and called Orsk-Khalilovsk area a "true gem of the <span class="loc">Urals</span>."
