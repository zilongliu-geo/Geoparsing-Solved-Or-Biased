<p>Marina, also Marina <span class="loc">El Alamein</span> (Arabic: مارينا العلمين‎  Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mæˈɾiːnæ l.ʕælæˈmeːn]), ancient Leukaspis or Antiphrae, is an up-scale resort town catering mainly to Egyptian elites. It is located on the northern coast of <span class="loc">Egypt</span>, with an 11 km (6.8 mi) long beach, about 300 km (190 mi) away from <span class="loc">Cairo</span>, in the <span class="loc">El Alamein</span> area. Leukaspis was a large port town, with a population around 15,000. The center of the town featured a basilica and a town hall that was converted into a Christian church. It was probably an important trading center between <span class="loc">Egypt</span> and <span class="loc">Libya</span>, and appears to have been a major center for Cretian imports. The settlement was destroyed in 365, when an earthquake off the coast of <span class="loc">Crete</span> created a tsunami. The town was not rebuilt, partially due to the crumbling state of the Roman Empire. Leukaspis was lost until 1986, when a group of engineers who were building roads in Marina revealed ancient houses and tombs. 200 acres (81 ha) of surrounding land was designated an archeological area, and excavations began in the 1990s. Prior to the site's discovery, the port area of the settlement was destroyed to make a man-made lagoon for a resort.</p>
