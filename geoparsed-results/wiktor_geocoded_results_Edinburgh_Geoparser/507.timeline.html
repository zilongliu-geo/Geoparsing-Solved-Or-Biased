Jackson</span> Street. They arrived in <span class="per">Jackson</span> on a well-traveled Indian trail leading west from Ann Arbor. <span class="loc">Blackman</span> hired <span class="per">Laverty</span> and <span class="per">Pewytum</span> to guide him west. <span class="loc">Blackman</span> returned to Ann Arbor and then <span class="loc">Monroe</span> and registered his claim for 160 acres (65 ha) at two dollars an acre. <span class="loc">Blackman</span> returned to <span class="per">Jackson</span> in <span class="date">August 1829</span>, with his brother <span class="per">Russell</span>. Together they cleared land and built a cabin on the corner of what would become <span class="loc">Ingham</span> and Trail streets. The town was first called Jacksonopolis. Later, it was renamed <span class="loc">Jacksonburgh</span>. Finally, in <span class="date">1838</span> the town's name was changed to simply <span class="per">Jackson</span>.</p><br><br>
