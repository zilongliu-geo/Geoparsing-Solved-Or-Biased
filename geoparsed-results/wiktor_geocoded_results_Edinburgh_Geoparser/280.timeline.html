  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Salvador</span> (English: Holy Savior) is the capital city of <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>, and the capital of the <span class="loc">San Salvador</span> department. It is the country's most populated municipality as well as its most important political, cultural, educational and financial center. The <span class="org">San Salvador Metro Area</span> is the core nucleus of <span class="loc">El Salvador</span> and is one of the largest urban centers in the Central <span class="loc">America</span> isthmus. Due to destruction caused by earthquakes, original Spanish colonial period structures are almost non-existent in the city; instead Gothic- and Modernist-style cathedrals have taken their place. Architecturally, <span class="loc">San Salvador</span>'s noteworthy structures have distinct Modern, <span class="per">Googie</span> and <span class="per">Populuxe</span> influences, similarly to those of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, a city <span class="loc">San Salvador</span> is influenced by. As a gamma global city, <span class="loc">San Salvador</span> is also an important financial center hub within Central <span class="loc">America</span>. The city is home to the <span class="per">Concejo de Ministros</span> de <span class="loc">El Salvador</span> (Council of Ministries of <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>), La Asamblea Legislativa (The Legislative Assembly of <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>), the <span class="per">Corte Suprema de Justicia</span> (The <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span>), and other governmental institutions, as well as the official residence of the president of the Republic. <span class="loc">San Salvador</span> is located in the Salvadoran highlands, surrounded by volcanoes and prone to earthquakes. The Spaniards called the area "<span class="loc">El Valle</span> de <span class="loc">Las Hamacas</span>" (English: <span class="org">The Valley of Hammocks</span>), a translation of the name given it by the native Pipil people in allusion to the need for beds that would sway with the earth's movements during an earthquake. With a population of 567,698 (2,442,017 in the metro area), it is the fifth most populated city in Central <span class="loc">America</span>, and its metropolitan area is the second most populated. The city is also home to the Catholic Archdiocese, as well as many Protestant branches of Christianity, including Evangelicals, Latter-day Saints, Baptists, and Pentecostals. <span class="loc">San Salvador</span> has the second largest Jewish community in Central <span class="loc">America</span>, and a small Muslim community. Spanish is spoken by the entire population, and a high percentage speaks English.</p><br><br>
