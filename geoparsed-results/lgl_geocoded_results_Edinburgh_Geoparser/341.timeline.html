  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Houses not selling despite low prices. BY <span class="loc">KENT</span> MALLETT Advocate Reporter <span class="date">March 30, 2009</span> <span class="loc">NEWARK</span> -- The recent reported surge in home sales nationally has not yet reached <span class="loc">Licking County</span>, according to <span class="loc">Licking County</span> property transfer records provided by the county. The number of sales through <span class="date">March 15</span> dropped from 493 in <span class="date">2008</span> to 309 <span class="date">this year</span>, a 37 percent decline. The average sale price fell from $122,492 in <span class="date">2008</span> to $110,416 so far in <span class="date">2009</span>, an almost 10 percent decrease. <span class="per">Jackie Lewis</span>, president of the <span class="org">Licking County Board</span> of Realtors, said she has seen signs better times are ahead, but buyers remain cautious. "I can truly say people are out looking, but they're still hesitant to make up their minds because so many homes are sitting bank-owned," <span class="per">Lewis</span> said. "In warmer weather, people start to look." The National Association of Realtors reported sales of existing homes increased 5.1 percent in <span class="date">February</span> compared to <span class="date">January</span>, the largest monthly sales jump since <span class="date">July 2003</span>. But local sales were virtually unchanged from <span class="date">January</span> to <span class="date">February</span>, according to the local board of Realtors. In the three <span class="loc">Licking County</span> <span class="loc">cities of Newark</span>, Heath and <span class="loc">Pataskala</span>, the sales through <span class="date">March 15</span> dropped from a combined 251 <span class="date">last year</span> to 155 <span class="date">this year</span>, a 38 percent tumble. <span class="per">Lewis</span> predicts a surge not only because residents traditionally look more seriously in the spring, but also because of investors facing a tax deadline. They want to buy, <span class="per">Lewis</span> said, because they have money they don't want taxed. The <span class="org">Licking County Board</span> of Realtors reports home sales through its Multiple Listing Service fell during <span class="date">the first two months</span> of the year, from 151 in <span class="date">2008</span> to 114 <span class="date">this year</span>, a 25 percent decline. Prices also dropped by 11 percent. Still, she thinks the deals are just too good for people to pass up much longer, and the increased sales elsewhere will begin to show up here. "We see this in anything," <span class="per">Lewis</span> said. "It always hits the West Coast first and comes our way. Why? I have no idea. It's all about educating our buyers." <span class="per">Nathan Gill</span>, a mortgage banker with <span class="org">American Eagle Mortgage Corp.</span>, said he has fielded an increase in phone calls requesting loan applications, mostly from first-time homebuyers. The reason for the increased interest, he said, probably is the federal tax credit available through <span class="date">Nov. 30</span>. The refundable tax credit, on 2009 taxes filed in <span class="date">2010</span>, is for 10 percent of the sale price up to $8,000. "I think the word is finally getting out," <span class="per">Gill</span> said. "We're trying to let people know there are advantages to purchasing homes right <span class="date">now</span>. "The tax credit, I believe, will have an effect <span class="date">this year</span>. People have got to take advantage of it <span class="date">now</span>." The <span class="org">Ohio Housing Finance Agency's Homebuyer Tax Credit Advantage Program</span>, which starts <span class="date">March 30</span>, allows homebuyers to use up to 3 percent of the purchase price for the down payment. They don't have to pay the loan back until <span class="date">July 1, 2010</span>, he said Interest rates, <span class="per">Gill</span> said, were available <span class="date">Friday</span> at about 4.75 percent, compared to 8 percent in <span class="date">2000</span>, when homes were selling in large numbers.</p><br><br>
