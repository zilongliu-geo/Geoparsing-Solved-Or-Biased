<p>Regina (/rᵻˈdʒaɪnə/ <span class="loc">Assiniboine</span>: huhúžubina; Cree: oskana kā-asastēki) is the capital city of the Canadian <span class="loc">province of Saskatchewan</span>. The city is the second-largest in the province, after <span class="loc">Saskatoon</span>, and a cultural and commercial centre for southern <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span>. It is governed by <span class="loc">Regina City</span> Council. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159. Regina was previously the seat of government of the North-West Territories, of which the current <span class="loc">provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta</span> originally formed part, and of the <span class="loc">District of Assiniboia</span>. The site having previously been <span class="loc">Wascana</span> ("Buffalo Bones" in Cree), it was renamed in 1882 in honour of Queen Victoria, Victoria Regina, by her daughter Princess Louise, wife of the <span class="loc">Marquess</span> of <span class="loc">Lorne</span>, then the Governor General of <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West, on its treeless flat plain Regina has few topographical features other than the small spring run-off, <span class="loc">Wascana Creek</span>. Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to create a decorative lake to the south of the central business district with a dam a block and a half west of the later elaborate 840-foot (260 m) long Albert Street Bridge across the new lake. Regina's importance was further secured when the new <span class="loc">province of Saskatchewan</span> designated the city its capital in 1906. <span class="loc">Wascana Centre</span>, created around the focal point of <span class="loc">Wascana</span> Lake, remains one of Regina's attractions and contains the Provincial Legislative Building, both campuses of the University of Regina, the provincial museum of natural history, the Regina Conservatory (in the original Regina College buildings), the Saskatchewan Science Centre, the MacKenzie Art Gallery and the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts.</p>
