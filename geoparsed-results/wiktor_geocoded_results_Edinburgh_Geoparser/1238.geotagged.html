<p><span class="loc">La Carolina</span> is a Municipality located in the <span class="loc">province of Jaén</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>. According to the 2014 census, the municipality has a population of 15,808 inhabitants. <span class="loc">La Carolina</span> was formerly the capital of the <span class="loc">Intendencia</span> of the Nuevas Poblaciones de Andalucía y <span class="loc">Sierra Morena</span> founded in this formerly remote and desolate area of the <span class="loc">Sierra Morena</span> in 1767 by King Carlos III. The object of the plan, drawn up by his minister Pablo de Olavide, administrator of <span class="loc">Andalucia</span>, was to populate the area around Despeñaperros gorge. Known as "the gateway to <span class="loc">Andalucia</span>"; this pass was a notorious point on the Cadiz-to-Madrid royal highway for bandits. Other towns of note in this plan were <span class="loc">La Carlota</span> and <span class="loc">La Luisiana</span>. The <span class="loc">Intendencia</span> administrative division was wrapped up in 1813. Six thousand Catholic settlers arrived from <span class="loc">Belgium</span>, <span class="loc">Germany</span>, <span class="loc">Austria</span> and <span class="loc">Switzerland</span> to take advantage of the generous offers of land and livestock being made to colonizers (five chickens, five goats, five sheep, two cows, and a sow per family). With a few years, about half of them had died from illness or gone home: the rest gradually lost their national identities over the years, and took on the language and customs of their host country. One can still find people in this area with Germanic surnames such as Eisman, Minch, Smidt and Kobler.</p>
