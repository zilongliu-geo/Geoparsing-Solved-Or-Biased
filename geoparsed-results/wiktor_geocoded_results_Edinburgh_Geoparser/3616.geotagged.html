<p><span class="loc">Queenstown</span>, named after Queen Victoria, is a town in the middle of the Eastern Cape Province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>, roughly half way between the smaller towns of <span class="loc">Cathcart</span> and <span class="loc">Sterkstroom</span>. It is currently the commercial, administrative, and educational centre of the prosperous surrounding farming district. The nickname of the town, 'Rose Capital of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>', comes from the large gardens and open places for flowers (especially roses) in and around town. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of <span class="loc">Queenstown</span>. Churches of all faith denominations are to be found in and around <span class="loc">Queenstown</span>. The town was founded in early 1853 under the direction of Sir George Cathcart, who named the settlement, and then fort, after Queen Victoria. Work on its railway connection to <span class="loc">East London</span> on the coast was begun by the Cape government of John Molteno in 1876, and the line was officially opened on 19 May 1880. The town prospered from its founding up to the worldwide depression of the 1930s, and again thereafter. In the 1960s, the majority of the Black population were moved east to the township of Ezibeleni, as part of the attempt to move African people to so-called "homelands". The area has in the past had very severe weather problems, luckily, often only affecting the surrounding areas. In 2002, heavy snowfall around <span class="loc">Queenstown</span> caused a severe disaster, especially since the area was not funded or ready for such a disaster. Then, in 2004, the surrounding areas of the Eastern Cape were affected by strong winds and heavy rainfall, although <span class="loc">Queenstown</span> once again escaped much flooding and some wind damage, power shortages soon followed. Other natural disasters include droughts and veld fires (wild fires).</p>
