  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>New apartment building for disabled in demand. A new $2.6 million independent-living facility in Marshall for people with disabilities is fully occupied and has a waiting list. The last tenant at <span class="org">Fithian House</span>, named after the late <span class="per">Bradford Woods</span> Mayor Ted <span class="per">Fithian</span>, will move in <span class="date">next month</span>, said <span class="per">Dick Lynch</span>, executive director of the <span class="org">Spina Bifida Association</span> of Western <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. <span class="org">Fithian House</span> is on 32 acres owned by the Woodlands Foundation, a nonprofit agency on the Marshall/<span class="per">Bradford Woods</span> border. The Woodlands serves more than 5,000 people each year who have disabilities and chronic illnesses. Even though the agencies are separate, they work hand-in-hand to improve the quality of life for people who have disabilities, said <span class="per">Leslie Uriss-Spehar</span>, the Woodlands' communications director. The <span class="org">Spina Bifida Association</span> manages day-to-day operations at <span class="org">Fithian House</span>, which sits on a small parcel of land it bought from the Woodlands. The new 14-unit apartment building was built for low-income people with disabilities who meet certain criteria. The association started accepting applications for the units in <span class="date">September</span> and about 12 people are on a waiting list for an apartment, <span class="per">Mr. Lynch</span> said. He said there are plans to build another similar apartment building next door to <span class="org">Fithian House</span>. The association probably will apply for <span class="org">Housing and Urban Development</span> financing <span class="date">this summer</span>, he added. <span class="per">Mr. Lynch</span> said the need for another apartment building is clear given the success of <span class="org">Fithian House</span>. The one-bedroom units have kitchens and bathrooms. Even though 24-hour on-site care is not available, residents have access to staff working just yards away at the Gatehouse, a transitional-living facility, where 11 people with disabilities can live for <span class="date">up to two years</span>, learning life and job skills so they can live independently. The association paid for <span class="org">Fithian House</span> with a $2.1 million HUD grant and $350,000 from the <span class="loc">Allegheny County</span> Multi-Housing Division, with the remaining amount contributed by the association. The <span class="org">Fithian House</span> took <span class="date">about three years</span> from concept to completion, <span class="per">Mr. Lynch</span> said. The man for whom the building is named volunteered regularly at The Woodlands and was on the board of directors for The Woodlands and the <span class="org">Spina Bifida Association</span> of Western <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. <span class="per">Mr. Fithian</span> died in <span class="date">September</span>. Although the apartment building is full, work continues, <span class="per">Ms. Uriss-Spehar</span> said. Before <span class="date">the end of the month</span>, surveyors will look over land that the Woodlands wants to make into a 6-foot-wide accessible and graded trail leading from <span class="org">Fithian House</span> to the main campus, <span class="per">Ms. Uriss-Spehar</span> said. The trail, which is expected to be done by fall, will be for both <span class="org">Fithian House</span> and Gatehouse residents, she added. The Woodlands also is coordinating a volunteer day when <span class="org">FedEx</span> Ground employees will take <span class="org">Fithian House</span> residents shopping to outfit their apartments. At the same time, other <span class="org">FedEx</span> employees will shop to equip the apartment building's common kitchen, while others will shop for food and cook dinner. At <span class="date">the end of the day</span>, the employees and residents will sit down and eat the meal together, <span class="per">Ms. Uriss-Spehar</span> said. "Our mission is to enrich the lives of people with disabilities, and partnering with <span class="org">FedEx</span> Ground to help the new residents of <span class="org">Fithian House</span> is a fun and unique way for us to do this," <span class="per">Ms. Uriss-Spehar</span> said. "Our staff, as well as the volunteers, are really looking forward to it." Applications from those who want to live at <span class="org">Fithian House</span> are screened by a committee using HUD guidelines. <span class="per">Ms. Uriss-Spehar</span> said the process is anonymous so no one gets special preference. Information on the application process is available at the association's Web site www.sbawp.org or by calling 724-934-9600.</p><br><br>
