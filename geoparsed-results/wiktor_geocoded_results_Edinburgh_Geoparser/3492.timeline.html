The town was named for New York Governor <span class="per">DeWitt Clinton</span>. The population was 1,653 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census.

Several military engagements occurred during the American Civil War which involved <span class="per">Clinton</span>. <span class="org">Union</span> General <span class="per">Benjamin Grierson</span> occupied <span class="per">Clinton</span> on <span class="date">June 7, 1863</span>, <span class="date">one month</span> before the fall of <span class="loc">Vicksburg</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. <span class="per">Grierson</span> found the town deserted, as Confederates had withdrawn ten miles to the north. According to the historian <span class="per">John</span> D. Winters in The Civil War in <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> (<span class="date">1863</span>), the <span class="org">Union</span> "burned a railroad depot, a warehouse containing several hundred hides, a small supply of corn, a machine shop, a locomotive, a crude woolen mill, a cartridge factory, a supply of ammunition, and several barrels of <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> rum."</p><br><br>
