  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Denton</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">borough of Darlington</span> and the ceremonial county of <span class="loc">County Durham</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Denton</span> taken at the <span class="date">2011</span> Census was less than 100. Details are maintained in the <span class="loc">parish of Gainford</span>. It is situated a short distance to the north-west of <span class="loc">Darlington</span> between <span class="loc">Walworth</span> to the East and Summerhouse to the West. Houghton-Le-Side lies to the North and <span class="loc">Piercebridge</span> to the South. The village is home to approximately 18 houses, new and old, all surrounding <span class="loc">Denton</span> <span class="loc">Hall Farm</span> and contained within the vast Raby Estate. Most of the farm buildings are whitewashed. There are many local legends explaining this. The most common of these is that <span class="per">Lord Barnard</span> was lost in the mist and sought refuge in a farm house. Believing it to be one of his own he demanded his keep, only to discover that it was privately owned. To prevent such a mistake occurring again he ordered that all his buildings should be painted white. <span class="loc">Denton</span> <span class="loc">Hall Farm</span> is a mixed farm of arable and livestock. Horse racing / training is a large part of village life.</p><br><br>
