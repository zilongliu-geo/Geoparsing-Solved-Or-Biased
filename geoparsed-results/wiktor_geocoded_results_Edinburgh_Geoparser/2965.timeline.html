Students attend elementary school (K-6) in Page while students attend middle school through high school (7-12) in Hope. The school mascot is the Spartans, recently changed from the Wolverines due to a recent cooperation of sports programs between Hope-Page High School and Finley-Sharon High School. Oddly enough, the mascots for <span class="org">Michigan State University</span> and the <span class="org">University of Michigan</span> are the Spartans and Wolverines, respectively. This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters.
