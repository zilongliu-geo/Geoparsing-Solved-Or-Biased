<p>Easton is a village on the <span class="loc">Isle of Portland</span> in <span class="loc">Dorset</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The village is situated at <span class="loc">Tophill</span>, within the centre of the island. As with the rest of Portland's villages and settlements, Easton, including the settlements Reforne and Straits, has been designated as a conservation area, as it is a place of special architectural and historic interest. Easton, Wakeham and Reforne were designated pre-1974. The village has a small square with many shops and shopping arcade, three churches, a small park, and other amenities, including various pubs, as well as the nearby Secondary school Royal Manor Arts College. Along with Fortuneswell, Easton is the main hub of the <span class="loc">Isle of Portland</span>'s activities. St George's Centre and The George Inn lies within the Reforne area of Easton, and provides facilities for many local events. Easton was established around a natural watercourse and various springs, of which there are indications of medieval inhabitants. The village pond was situated at Easton Square, and a well head and pump were later installed in 1775. Easton largely developed through Tophill's prime industry of agriculture. By 1782, Easton was the island's second largest settlement. The island's first school, Maister's School, opened in Straits during 1720. St. George's Church was built as the island's parish church within Reforne, between 1754 and 1766, replacing St Andrew's.</p>
