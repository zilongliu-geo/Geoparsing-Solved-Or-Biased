  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bukovo</span> (pronounced [ˈbuːkɔʋɔ]) is a settlement in the Municipality of <span class="loc">Cerkno</span> in the traditional Littoral region of <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. <span class="loc">Bukovo</span> is a scattered village along the southwest slope of Mount Kojca (1,303 meters or 4,275 feet) on the saddle between the valleys of the Bača and Idrijca rivers. It also includes several hamlets southeast of the village center: Krtečne, <span class="loc">Kojca</span>, Selc, Žabže (or Žabče), and Laharn (from north to south). The soil is sandy and marly. The tilled fields lie on steep slopes, which traditionally necessitated carrying the last furrow plowed to the top of the slope by hand, or using oxen or a block-and-tackle system. <span class="loc">Kojca</span> is the oldest of the hamlets comprising <span class="loc">Bukovo</span>. In <span class="date">1652</span> it was mentioned as the seat of a district that also included <span class="loc">Bukovo</span>, Krtečne, Žabže, and Selc. Most of the hamlet of Selc burned in <span class="date">1935</span> because of a lightning strike. During the Second World War, German forces burned two houses and a hayrack in <span class="loc">Bukovo</span> and looted the village on <span class="date">November 1, 1943</span>. The hamlet of Žabže was burned on <span class="date">June 10, 1944</span>; during the attack, three men were killed and four women burned to death.</p><br><br>
