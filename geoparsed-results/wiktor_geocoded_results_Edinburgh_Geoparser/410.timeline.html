  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Salem</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Henry County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 383 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Salem</span> was settled originally by Quakers with the intent that it be a community of Friends. In <span class="date">1835</span> <span class="per">Aaron Street</span>, while wending his way westward, came upon an uninhabited spot and declared “<span class="date">Now</span> have mine eyes beheld a country teeming with every good thing…Hither will I come with my flocks and my herds, with my children and my children’s children, and our city shall be called <span class="loc">Salem</span>, for thus was the city of our fathers, even near unto the seacoast.” Independently another <span class="per">Quaker, Isaac</span> Pigeon, who may have visited the spot before Street, brought his family to the area. They became the first citizens of <span class="loc">Salem</span>, and with <span class="per">Peter Boyer</span>, began to recruit other Quakers to migrate westward to join them. As early as <span class="date">1837</span>, Friends meetings were held in private homes, and after the village was laid out in <span class="date">1839</span> by <span class="per">Aaron Street</span>, Jr., and <span class="per">Peter Boyer</span>, a meeting house was built. From the early <span class="date">years</span> members of other Christian denominations settled in <span class="loc">Salem</span>, so it was never an exclusively <span class="per">Quaker</span> community.</p><br><br>
