<p><span class="loc">Brunswick</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span> in southeastern <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 20,278 at the 2010 census. Part of the <span class="loc">Portland-South Portland-Biddeford metropolitan</span> area, <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> is home to Bowdoin College, the Bowdoin College Museum of Art, the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum, The Theater Project, and the Maine State Music Theatre. It is also home to Mid Coast Hospital, one of <span class="loc">Maine</span>'s newest full-service hospitals; and Parkview Adventist Medical Center. It was home to Naval Air Station <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> which was permanently closed on May 31, 2011. Settled in 1628 by Thomas Purchase and other fishermen, the area was called by its Indian name, <span class="loc">Pejepscot</span>, meaning "the long, rocky rapids part [of the river]". In 1639, Purchase placed his settlement under protection of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> <span class="loc">Bay Colony</span>. During King Philip's War in 1676, <span class="loc">Pejepscot</span> was burned and abandoned, although a garrison called Fort Andros was built on the ruins during King William's War. During the war, in Major Benjamin Church's second expedition a year later, he arrived on 11 September 1690 with 300 men at <span class="loc">Casco</span> Bay. He went up the <span class="loc">Androscoggin</span> River to the English Fort Pejepscot (present day <span class="loc">Brunswick</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>). From there he went 40 miles up-river and attacked a native village. Three or four native men were shot in retreat; when Church discovered 5 English captives in the wigwams, six or seven prisoners were butchered as an example; and nine prisoners were taken. A few days later, in retaliation, the natives attacked Church at <span class="loc">Cape Elizabeth</span> on <span class="loc">Purpooduc</span> Point, killing 7 of his men and wounding 24 others. On September 26, Church returned to <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>.</p>
