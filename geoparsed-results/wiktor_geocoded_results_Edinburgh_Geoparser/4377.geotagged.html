<p>Memphis is a city in <span class="loc">Scotland County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,822 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Scotland County</span>. Memphis is located adjacent to <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 136, east of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, and west of <span class="loc">Kahoka</span>. Although <span class="loc">Scotland County</span> was organized by an act of the Missouri General Assembly on January 29, 1841 the town of Memphis did not come to be until more than two years later. County commissioners met at <span class="loc">Sand Hill</span> on May 15, 1843 to select the county seat. A spot near the geographical center of the county was chosen, and after some debate, was named Memphis, after the ancient <span class="loc">city of Memphis</span>, <span class="loc">Egypt</span>. The name had been previously used by a U.S. Post Office that operated on the <span class="loc">North Fabius River</span> a short distance away. The land for the town, about fifty acres, was donated to the county by early settler Samuel Cecil. After being laid out in town lots the original plat of Memphis was filed with county court on October 11, 1843. However a few homes already existed on the site and had for several years, the first being a log cabin constructed in 1835 by Burton Tompkins.</p>
