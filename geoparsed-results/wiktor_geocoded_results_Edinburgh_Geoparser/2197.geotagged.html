<p><span class="loc">Suba</span> (Arabic: صوبا‎) was a Palestinian Arab village west of <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> that was depopulated and destroyed in 1948. The site of the village lies on the summit of a conical hill called Tel Tzova (Hebrew: תל צובה‎), or <span class="loc">Jabal Suba</span>, rising 769 metres above sea level, and it was built on the ruins of a Crusader castle. It has been suggested that <span class="loc">Suba</span> was Subahiet, one of 21 villages given by King Godfrey as a fief to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1114, the gift was re-confirmed by Baldwin I of <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>. A "Brother William of <span class="loc">Belmont</span>" was mentioned in Crusader sources in the years 1157 and 1162, he might have been castellan at <span class="loc">Belmont</span>. Sometime before 1169, the Crusaders built a castle there called <span class="loc">Belmont</span>, run by the Hospitallers. In 1170 an unnamed castellan was mentioned. Today, parts of the northern and western Crusader wall remain, as well as ruins of a tower and other structures. These include large underground cisterns, some pre-dating the Crusader period. <span class="loc">Belmont Castle</span> was taken by <span class="loc">Saladin</span> in 1187. According to the chronicles it was destroyed by him in 1191 but no trace of the destruction was located during the archaeological investigation.</p>
