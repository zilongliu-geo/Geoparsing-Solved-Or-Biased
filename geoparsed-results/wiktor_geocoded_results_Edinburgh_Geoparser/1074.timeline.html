  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The Town of <span class="per">Franklin</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Norfolk County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">US</span>. <span class="per">Franklin</span> is one of fourteen <span class="per">Massachusetts</span> municipalities that have applied for, and been granted, city forms of government but wish to retain "The town of‚Äù in their official names. As of <span class="date">2012</span>, the city's population was 33,092. It is home to the country's first library, with its first books donated by <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>. It also contains the largest Catholic parish in the Boston Archdiocese, St. Mary's Catholic church, with some 15,000 members. <span class="per">Franklin</span> was first settled by Europeans in <span class="date">1660</span> and officially incorporated during the American Revolution. The town was formed from the western part of the town of <span class="loc">Wrentham</span> on <span class="date">February 16, 1778</span>; its designated name at incorporation was to be <span class="loc">Exeter</span>. However, the town's citizens chose to be called <span class="per">Franklin</span> in honor of the statesman <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>, the first municipality in the <span class="loc">US</span> to be so named. It was hoped that <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span> would donate a bell for a church steeple in the town, but donated 116 books instead, beginning a debate over who should be allowed access to these books. On <span class="date">November 20, 1790</span>, it was decided that the volumes would be lent to the residents of <span class="per">Franklin</span> for free via its library, which has been in operation since then. The Ray Memorial Library building was dedicated in <span class="date">1904</span>. In <span class="date">1990</span>, on the library's bicentennial, its staff published a booklet, "A History of <span class="org">America's First Public Library</span> at <span class="per">Franklin Massachusetts</span>, <span class="date">1790</span> ~ <span class="date">1990</span>" to commemorate <span class="loc">America</span>'s first public library and book collection.</p><br><br>
