  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ina</span> is the southern-most village in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,455 as of the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is part of the Mount <span class="org">Vernon Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Ina</span> is located at 38°9′2″N 88°54′17″W (38.150648, -88.904709). According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="loc">Ina</span> has a total area of 2.45 square miles (6.35 km2), all land. <span class="loc">Ina</span> was located on high ground adjacent to the <span class="loc">Casey Creek</span>/<span class="loc">Big Muddy River</span> bottoms. The <span class="loc">Big Muddy</span> has since been dammed to form Rend Lake. Many <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> families settled in <span class="loc">Ina</span> around <span class="date">1840</span>. They were apparently refugees from <span class="org">the Trail of Tears</span>. In the 1800s, <span class="loc">Ina</span> was jokingly referred to as "the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> Reservation." The main settlement in this area was <span class="loc">Spring Garden</span>, about three miles northeast of <span class="loc">Ina</span>. <span class="loc">Spring Garden</span> prospered from <span class="date">1848</span> until the <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and Eastern <span class="loc">Illinois Railroad</span> was built in <span class="date">1905</span>. After that, the population and business shifted over to the depots at <span class="loc">Ina</span> and <span class="loc">Bonnie</span>. <span class="loc">Ina</span> is the home of the <span class="loc">Big Muddy River</span> Correctional Center and Rend Lake College. A famous double murder occurred in <span class="loc">Ina</span> in <span class="date">1924</span>, when <span class="per">Rev. Lawrence Hight</span> and his lover <span class="per">Elsie Sweeten</span> poisoned <span class="per">Sweeten</span>'s husband, in <span class="date">July</span>, and Hight's wife in <span class="date">September</span>. Autopsies revealed arsenic. <span class="per">Hight</span> and <span class="per">Sweeten</span> were both sent to prison. <span class="per">Elsie Sweeten</span> was granted another trial and was later acquitted of murder and released from Jail.</p><br><br>
