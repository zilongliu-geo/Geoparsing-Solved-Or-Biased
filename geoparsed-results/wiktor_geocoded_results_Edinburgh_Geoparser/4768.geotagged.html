<p><span class="loc">Martin County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 24,505. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Williamston</span>. The county was formed in 1774 from the southeastern part of <span class="loc">Halifax County</span> and the western part of <span class="loc">Tyrrell County</span>. It was named for Josiah Martin, the last royal governor of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> (1771–75). Whereas <span class="loc">Dobbs County</span> and <span class="loc">Tryon County</span>, named for Martin's predecessors Arthur Dobbs and William Tryon, were abolished after American independence, <span class="loc">Martin County</span> was neither abolished nor renamed, a fact which has been attributed to the popularity of Alexander Martin, twice governor of the state (1782–84, 1789–92). The <span class="loc">Martin County Courthouse</span> was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. <span class="loc">Martin County</span> is a member of the Mid-East Commission regional council of governments. <span class="loc">Martin County</span> has tended to vote in line with the rest of the country in presidential elections. In 2008, Barack Obama won the county with 52.2% of the vote. This was very similar to his national figure of 52.91%.</p>
