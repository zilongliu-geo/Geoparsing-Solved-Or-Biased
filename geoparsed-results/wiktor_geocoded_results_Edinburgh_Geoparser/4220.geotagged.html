Large parts of the district consist of newly built, modern buildings and houses. <span class="loc">Pirita</span> beach is located in <span class="loc">Pirita</span>. <span class="loc">Pirita</span> is one of the most prestigious and wealthiest <span class="loc">districts of Tallinn</span>, partly thanks to natural benefits such as its beach and yachting harbour. <span class="loc">Pirita</span> beach is the largest in <span class="loc">Tallinn</span>, and in the summer can attract up to 30,000 visitors a day. <span class="loc">Pirita</span> has a population of 17,592 (As of 1 November 2014). <span class="loc">Pirita</span> is divided into 9 subdistricts (Estonian: asum): <span class="loc">Iru</span>, <span class="loc">Kloostrimetsa</span>, <span class="loc">Kose</span>, <span class="loc">Laiaküla</span>, <span class="loc">Lepiku</span>, <span class="loc">Maarjamäe</span>, <span class="loc">Merivälja</span>, <span class="loc">Mähe</span> and <span class="loc">Pirita</span>. <span class="loc">Pirita</span> monastery Tallinn TV Tower Tallinn Botanic Garden Pirita Yachting Centre</p>
