<p><span class="loc">Dama</span> (Arabic: داما‎) is a village in the As-Suwayda Governorate of southwest <span class="loc">Syria</span>. It is located in the heart of the Lejah lava plateau, 29 km north west of the <span class="loc">city of As-Suwayda</span>. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, <span class="loc">Dama</span> had a population of 1,799 in the 2004 census. <span class="loc">Dama</span> and neighboring villages are thought to be the place where <span class="loc">Saint Paul</span> took refuge after escaping from <span class="loc">Damascus</span>. The village, like most of the villages in Jabal ad-Druze, was an old Roman location. Many of its houses are still in their original condition. The inhabitants are mostly Druze and their main occupation is agriculture. In 1596 <span class="loc">Dama</span> appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as part of the nahiya of Bani Abdullah in the <span class="loc">Qada</span> of <span class="loc">Hauran</span>. It had an entirely Muslim population consisting of 74 households and 28 bachelors. Taxes were paid on wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and/or beehives. <span class="loc">Dama</span> played a major role in the late stages of the Great Syrian Revolution (1925-1927). It hosted the important Dama Convention which resulted in the refusal of French proposals and the collapse of negotiations between the Druze rebels and the French. It was also the site of some of the last battles in the revolution fought by guerrilla groups led by Emir Adel Arslan.</p>
