  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Troy is a city in the <span class="loc">US</span> State of <span class="loc">New York</span> and the seat of <span class="loc">Rensselaer County</span>. The city is located on the western edge of <span class="loc">Rensselaer County</span> and on the eastern bank of the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>. Troy has close ties to the nearby <span class="loc">cities of Albany and Schenectady</span>, forming a region popularly called the Capital District. The city is one of the three major centers for the <span class="loc">Albany Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area (MSA), which has a population of 1,170,483. At the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population of Troy was 50,129. Troy's motto is Ilium fuit, Troja est, which means "Ilium was, Troy is". Before European arrival, the area was settled by the Mahican Indian tribe. The Dutch began settling in the mid 17th century; the patroon <span class="per">Kiliaen van Rensselaer</span> called the area Pafraets <span class="loc">Dael</span>, after his mother. Control of <span class="loc">New York</span> passed to the English in <span class="date">1664</span> and in <span class="date">1707</span> <span class="per">Derick Van</span> der Heyden purchased a farm near <span class="date">today</span>'s downtown area. In <span class="date">1771</span> <span class="per">Abraham Lansing</span> had his farm in <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="loc">Lansingburgh</span> laid out into lots. Responding to <span class="per">Lansing</span>'s success to the north, in <span class="date">1787</span>, Van der Heyden's grandson Jacob had his extensive holdings surveyed and laid out into lots as well, calling the new village Vanderheyden.</p><br><br>
