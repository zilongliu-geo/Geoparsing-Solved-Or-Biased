  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Roma</span> is a settlement under the <span class="org">Manonyane Community Council</span> in the <span class="loc">Maseru District</span> of <span class="loc">Lesotho</span>, some 34 kilometers southeast of <span class="loc">Maseru</span>, the capital of <span class="loc">Lesotho</span>. The <span class="loc">Roma</span> valley is broad and fertile, and is surrounded by sandstone cliffs topped to the East by basalt mountains which provide magnificent scenery. Founded in <span class="date">1862</span> by Roman Catholic missionaries in the valley known as Tloutle, <span class="loc">Roma</span> <span class="date">now</span> has three seminaries and various novitiates, and they began the institution that became the National University of <span class="loc">Lesotho</span>. The surrounding area has become quite densely populated and is a significant residential area, recently gaining street lights on the main road. There are many dinosaur footprints in the area, some within the National University of <span class="loc">Lesotho</span>, and others on <span class="loc">Roma</span> Plateau. Some <span class="date">years</span> ago the <span class="org">US Peace Corps</span> ran its training programmes in <span class="loc">Roma</span>, and a local steep prominent mountain, Makhetha, is still referred to as Peace Corps Mountain, as an ascent was traditionally part of their programme. There are a number of schools situated around <span class="loc">Roma</span>, including three high schools. Christ the King High School, a boys school, was initially an early teacher training college, set up by the <span class="org">Marist Brothers</span>, and from <span class="date">1937</span> was run by the Brothers of The <span class="loc">Sacred Heart</span>. In <span class="date">1961</span> CKHS became a high school only. Nearby there is St. <span class="org">Marys High School</span>, which is a girls school, started by the Holy Family Sisters. The third is the <span class="org">NUL International School</span>, situated within the university campus.</p><br><br>
