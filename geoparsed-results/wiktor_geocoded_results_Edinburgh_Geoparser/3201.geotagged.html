<p>Warren is a city in <span class="loc">Macomb County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The 2010 census places the city's population at 134,056, making Warren the largest city in <span class="loc">Macomb County</span>, the third largest city in <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, and Metro <span class="loc">Detroit</span>'s largest suburb. The city is home to a wide variety of businesses, including General Motors Technical Center, the United States Army <span class="loc">Detroit</span> Arsenal, home of the United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command and the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC), the headquarters of Big Boy Restaurants International, and Asset Acceptance. The current mayor is James R. Fouts, who was elected to his first mayoral term in November 2007. Beebe's Corners, the original settlement in what would become the <span class="loc">city of Warren</span>, was founded in 1830 at the corner of Mound Road and Chicago Road; its first resident was Charles Groesbeck. Beebe's Corners was a carriage stop between <span class="loc">Detroit</span> and <span class="loc">Utica</span>, and included a distillery, mill, tavern, and trading post. It was not until 1837 that the now-defunct Warren Township was organized around the settlement, first under the name Hickory, then renamed <span class="loc">Aba</span> in April 1838, and finally renamed Warren shortly thereafter. It was named for War of 1812 veteran, and frontier cleric, Rev. Abel Warren. However, when it was originally organized the township was named for Rev. Warren who was a Methodist Episcopal preacher who left his native <span class="loc">New York</span> in 1824 for Shelby Township. He went throughout the present-day <span class="loc">Macomb</span>, <span class="loc">Lapeer</span>, <span class="loc">Oakland</span>, and St. <span class="loc">Clair Counties</span>, baptizing, marrying, and burying pioneers of the area, as well as establishing congregations and preaching extensively. He was the first licensed preacher in the State of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>.</p>
