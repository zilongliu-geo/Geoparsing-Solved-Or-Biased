<p><span class="loc">La Plata</span> is a ghost town on the southern end of <span class="loc">Cache County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located in the Bear <span class="loc">River Mountains</span> on a small tributary of the east fork of the <span class="loc">Little Bear River</span>, <span class="loc">La Plata</span> was a short-lived silver mining boomtown in the 1890s. The first ore in the area was discovered in July 1891 by a mountain shepherd, who brought a curiously dense rock to show his foreman. The foreman recognized it as silver-bearing galena and took it to be assayed in <span class="loc">Ogden</span>. The sample was 45% lead, with a silver concentration of 400 ounces per ton. The two quietly registered a mining claim, but the secret got out. Several more high-grade ore pockets were found, and a silver rush began. This was the first major Utah mining claim ever found north of <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span>, and many northern Utahns became interested. By August 1891 more than 1000 miners had arrived, and the number soon reached 1500. Lines of cabins and stores stretched along either side of the creek, forming a town called <span class="loc">La Plata</span> (Spanish for "silver"). There were 60â€“70 buildings in all, including two stores, saloons, a bank, and a post office.</p>
