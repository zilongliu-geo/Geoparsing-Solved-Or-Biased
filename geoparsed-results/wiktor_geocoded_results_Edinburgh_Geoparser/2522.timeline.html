Fragments of pottery from the Persian period have been found in <span class="loc">Kabul</span>, as well as excavated burial chambers, used from the 1st to the 4th <span class="date">centuries</span>. <span class="loc">Kabul</span> is probably the Biblical Cabul mentioned by Joshua. In Roman times, Josephus calls the town "Chabolo" and camped there. He described it as a post from which incursions were made into the <span class="loc">Galilee</span>. Potsherds dating from the end of the Hellenistic–Early Roman period, Roman, and Byzantine periods have been found. and bathhouse dating from the Byzantine era, and used well into the Umayyad era, have been excavated. Al-Muqaddasi visited <span class="loc">Kabul</span> in 985 CE, while it was under Abbasid rule. He writes that "it is a town in the coastal district. It has fields of sugarcanes, and they make the best sugar — better than in all the rest of <span class="loc">Syria</span>." Ali of Herat reports in <span class="date">1173</span> that two sons of Jacob are buried in the town, namely <span class="per">Reuben</span> and <span class="per">Simeon</span>. <span class="loc">Kabul</span> was one of the principal <span class="loc">cities of Jund</span> al-Urrdun. Its <span class="org">Crusader</span> name was "Cabor". In the 14th and 15th <span class="date">centuries</span>, it was a place for Jewish pilgrimage for containing the tombs of the Jewish scholars and philosophers <span class="per">Abraham ibn Ezra</span> and <span class="per">Judah Halevi</span>.</p><br><br>
