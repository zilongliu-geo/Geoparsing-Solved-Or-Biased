  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dingle (Irish: An <span class="loc">Daingean</span> or Daingean Uí Chúis, meaning "Ó Cúis' fort") is a town in <span class="loc">County Kerry</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. The only town on the <span class="loc">Dingle Peninsula</span>, it sits on the Atlantic coast, about 50 kilometres (30 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">Tralee</span> and 71 kilometres (40 mi) northwest of <span class="loc">Killarney</span>. Principal industries in the town are tourism, fishing and agriculture: Dingle Mart (livestock market) serves the surrounding countryside. In <span class="date">2006</span> Dingle had a population of 1,920. Dingle is situated in a <span class="loc">Gaeltacht region</span>. There used to be two secondary schools but they have <span class="date">now</span> amalgamated to produce Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne. A friendly dolphin named Fungi lives in the harbour. In <span class="loc">Ireland</span> the town was developed as a port following the Norman invasion of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. By the thirteenth century more goods were being exported through Dingle than <span class="loc">Limerick</span>, and in <span class="date">1257</span> an ordinance of <span class="per">Henry III</span> imposed customs on the port's exports. By the fourteenth century, importing wine was a major business. <span class="per">Maurice FitzGerald</span>, 1st <span class="per">Earl of Desmond</span>, who held palatine powers in the area, imposed a tax on this activity around <span class="date">1329</span>. By the sixteenth century, Dingle was one of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>'s main trading ports, exporting fish and hides and importing wines from the continent of <span class="loc">Europe</span>. French and Spanish fishing fleets used the town as a base.</p><br><br>
