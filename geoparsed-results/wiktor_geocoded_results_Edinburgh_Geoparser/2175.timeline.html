  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Sharon is a town in <span class="loc">Windsor County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It had a population of 1,502 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Sharon was the birthplace of <span class="per">Joseph Smith</span>, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, and as such is an important historical site for Latter Day Saints. The town is also home to The <span class="org">Sharon Academy</span>, an independent middle and high school. One of the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> grants, the township was created on <span class="date">August 17, 1761</span>, by a royal charter which King <span class="per">George III</span> of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> issued to Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span>. It was granted to <span class="per">John Taylor</span> and 61 others, many from Sharon, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. The town was first settled about <span class="date">1765</span> by Robert Havens and family. In <span class="date">1780</span> during the Revolution, the village was attacked in the Royalton Raid, when a combined force of British soldiers and Indians burned houses and killed livestock. Although the surface of the town is very broken, the intervales contain fertile soil, and farming became an important industry. On <span class="date">June 26, 1848</span>, the <span class="org">Vermont Central Railroad</span> opened from <span class="loc">White River</span> Junction to Bethel, traversing Sharon and accelerating its development. The <span class="loc">White River</span> and its tributaries provided water power for mills. By <span class="date">1859</span>, when the population reached 1,240, Sharon had 12 sawmills, a gristmill, and a bobbin factory.</p><br><br>
