  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wilson</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ellsworth County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The community promotes itself as the "Czech Capital of <span class="loc">Kansas</span>" due to the role of Czech immigrant settlers in its early history. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population of the city was 781. The Butterfield Overland Despatch built a stagecoach station one-half mile south of present-day <span class="loc">Wilson</span> in <span class="date">1865</span>. <span class="date">Three years later</span>, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Pacific Railway built <span class="loc">Wilson</span> Station, named after the surrounding township, at the modern town site. In <span class="date">1871</span>, The National Land Company surveyed and planned the first town there, naming it <span class="loc">Bosland</span> in the hopes of attracting the cattle trade. Settlers from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, including some Pennsylvania Dutch, arrived over <span class="date">the following year</span>. The settlement never became a center of the cattle trade, however, and continued to be known as <span class="loc">Wilson</span>, a name the <span class="org">U.S. Post Office</span> officially codified in <span class="date">1873</span>. Beginning in <span class="date">1874</span>, Czech immigrants from <span class="loc">Bohemia</span> came to <span class="loc">Wilson</span> to work on the railroad, establishing the town as an area center of Czech culture. <span class="loc">Wilson</span> was incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1883</span>.</p><br><br>
