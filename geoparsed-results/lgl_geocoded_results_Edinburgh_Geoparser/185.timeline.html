  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Dog-nappers hit Lindsay area. <span class="per">Jerry Hughes</span> bought his dog in <span class="loc">Caddo</span>, <span class="loc">Okla</span>. and he called him Okie. <span class="date">Now</span> <span class="per">Hughes</span> —a 72-year old <span class="loc">Cooke County</span> resident — is having a hard time understanding why a brazen group stopped and picked up the <span class="date">eight month</span> old dog. “I can’t believe they just drove up to my yard and took my dog,” <span class="per">Hughes</span> said. This isn’t the first time <span class="per">Hughes</span> and his wife have lost pets. He said <span class="date">a few years ago</span> he had two other dogs. One of them was a cherished pet named Heck who he found on his doorstep one <span class="date">Christmas Day</span>. “Me and my wife were sitting in the house and we heard this whimpering noise and I wondered what in the world it was. We went outside and there was little dog in a box. <span class="per">Hughes</span> said he joked with his wife about getting rid of the tiny puppy. “But I would never do anything like that,” he said. <span class="per">Hughes</span> said he and his wife fed the foundling with a bottle. “He was just a baby,” he said. Heck grew up and <span class="per">Hughes</span> said he developed a bond with his dog. “He was special. He was really special,” he said. The other dog was a sweet <span class="per">Jack Russell</span> terrier. But Heck was special. Heck had a habit of stopping by while <span class="per">Hughes</span> was sitting in a chair in his living room. <span class="date">One day</span> the dog walked up to his owner and lingered by the chair. The dog seemed uneasy or scared. At first, <span class="per">Hughes</span> said he didn’t realize anything was wrong. “I thought he wanted me to pet him,” he said. “So I petted his chest. He always liked me to pet him like this, “ he said, reaching out with his arm. Heck suddenly slumped at his feet. “He died in my arms,” <span class="per">Hughes</span> recalled, his eyes full of sorrow. Outside, he found the couple’s <span class="per">Jack Russell</span> stretched out on the ground, also dead. “He was stiff, you know. He’d been there a while,” <span class="per">Hughes</span> said. He believes both dogs were poisoned. The latest incident finds <span class="per">Hughes</span> grieving all over again. He said the crime was hard to comprehend. Two cars drove past his house and Okie - who was a friendly dog — just jumped into one of the cars. “All they had to do was whistle and he got right in the car,” he said. He said he didn’t get a good look at the car’s occupants and still cannot describe them. “I just watched them take my dog. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” he said. His first concern was that the thieves might hurt Okie. “Then I realized they weren’t going to do anything to him. They took him because they wanted him,” he said. <span class="per">Hughes</span> also said he knows there isn’t much anyone can do. “I called the Lindsay Police and I talked to a (<span class="loc">Cooke County</span>) deputy that came out, but I don’t think they can do anything,” he said. “I just had to tell somebody.”</p><br><br>
