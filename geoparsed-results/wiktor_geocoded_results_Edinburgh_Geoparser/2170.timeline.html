  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mars</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,699 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Mars</span> is located in southern <span class="loc">Butler County</span> at 40°41′48″N 80°0′44″W (40.696594, -80.012205), about halfway between the <span class="loc">cities of Pittsburgh and Butler</span>. The small community is nestled in a small valley along <span class="loc">Breakneck</span> Creek. <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Route 228 bypasses the borough to the south, leading east 4 miles (6 km) to <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Route 8 and west 8.5 miles (13.7 km) to Interstates 79 and 76 in Cranberry Township. The <span class="loc">Mars-Evans City</span> Road leads out of town to the north. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the <span class="loc">borough of Mars</span> has a total area of 0.5 square miles (1.2 km2), all land. <span class="loc">Mars</span> is home to the popular roadside attraction the <span class="loc">Mars</span> "Spaceship" or "Flying Saucer". It is also home to the <span class="loc">Mars</span> Station, one of the last railroad depots still standing from the <span class="date">now</span> defunct <span class="per">Pittsburgh</span> and <span class="per">Western</span> Railroad. In <span class="date">1873</span>, <span class="per">Samuel Parks</span> constructed a home and a water-powered gristmill along <span class="loc">Breakneck</span> Creek. Parks decided to have a post office placed in his home, so he received help from his friend <span class="per">Samuel Marshall</span> to help establish it. The name of the post office became <span class="loc">Overbrook</span>. In <span class="date">1877</span>, the <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, New Castle and Lake Erie Railroad was constructed through <span class="loc">Overbrook</span>, and had a station built there. In <span class="date">1882</span>, the name of the community was changed to <span class="loc">Mars</span> since the railroad already had a stop with the name "Overbrook". No one is sure how the name "<span class="loc">Mars</span>" came into being. Some say it was Park's wife who enjoyed astronomy, or it was shortened after <span class="per">Samuel Marshall</span>'s name. On <span class="date">March 6, 1895</span>, <span class="loc">Mars</span> was incorporated as a borough.</p><br><br>
