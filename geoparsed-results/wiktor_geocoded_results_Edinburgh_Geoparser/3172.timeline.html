  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fremont</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Sandusky County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 16,734 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It was the home of <span class="per">Rutherford B. Hayes</span>, who served as President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> from <span class="date">1877</span> to <span class="date">1881</span>. The Rutherford <span class="per">B. Hayes</span> <span class="org">Presidential Center</span> remains one of the focal points of <span class="loc">Fremont</span>, <span class="loc">OH</span>. The National Arbor Day Foundation designated <span class="loc">Fremont</span> as a Tree City <span class="loc">USA</span>. The area which is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Fremont</span> was originally a Wyandot village. In the 1750s a French trading post was established there. In <span class="date">1787</span> the <span class="loc">United States</span> established the Northwest Territory, and in <span class="date">1803</span> the southeastern portion of the Territory was admitted to the <span class="org">Union</span> as part of the new state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. During the early and mid 1800s a few Europeans and African Americans, predominantly runaway slaves, settled in the area, which became known as <span class="loc">Lower Sandusky</span> for its location on the <span class="loc">Sandusky River</span>. Under the terms of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s admission, <span class="loc">Lower Sandusky</span> was defined as Indian Territory, so the non-Wyandot settlements were in direct violation of the Treaty of <span class="loc">Greeneville</span>; at one point the <span class="loc">United States</span> Army considered removing the settlers by force, but did not carry out the threat. <span class="loc">Fort Stephenson</span> was built there during the War of <span class="date">1812</span>, and the Battle of <span class="loc">Fort Stephenson</span> was fought there in <span class="date">August 1813</span>.</p><br><br>
