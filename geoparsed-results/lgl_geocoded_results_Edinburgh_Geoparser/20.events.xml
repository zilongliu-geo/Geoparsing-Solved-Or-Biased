    The move to establish the Washington Latin School, led by T.R. Ahlstrom and Headmaster Tom Soule, is gearing up for the start to its academic calendar on September 8 at a location yet to be determined in Old Town.

  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="found in the last seven years">
    Ahlstrom said that the results found at the Washington Latin Public Charter School in Washington, D.C., one of two public Latin schools that he has helped found in the last seven years — Bronx Latin in New York City is the other — prove that people of all economic backgrounds can thrive in the demanding, classical setting.

    “This is my third school in the last seven years,” Ahlstrom said.

    In 2008, the school opened a second campus in D.C. for its eighth and ninth graders, and applications for the upcoming school year are up 74 percent, Cutts said.

    Donna Molinari of Alexandria Country Day School said that the Latin School is starting in much the same way that ACDS did in the 1980s, and that based on the differences in curriculum the new school probably would not affect its enrollment too much.
