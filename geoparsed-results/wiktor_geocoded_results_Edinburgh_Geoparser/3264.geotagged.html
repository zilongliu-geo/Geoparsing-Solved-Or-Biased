<p><span class="loc">Bolu</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Turkey</span>, and administrative center of the <span class="loc">Bolu Province</span>. The population is 131,264 (2012 census). The mayor is Alaaddin Yılmaz (AK Party) since local elections in 2004. <span class="loc">Bolu</span> is on the old highway from <span class="loc">Istanbul</span> to <span class="loc">Ankara</span>, which climbs over Mount Bolu, while the new motorway passes through Mount Bolu Tunnel below the town. <span class="loc">Bolu</span> was part of one of the Hittite kingdoms around 2000 BC and later 500 BC became one of the leading cities of the Kingdom of Bithynia (279 BC - 79 BC) . Bebryces,Mariandynes, Koukones, Thyns and Paphlagons are native people of the area in antique era.Strabo (XII, 4, 7) mentions a Hellenistic town, Bithynium (Greek: Βιθύνιον), celebrated for its pastures and cheese, which according to Pausanias (VIII, 9) was founded by Arcadians from <span class="loc">Mantinea</span>. In the Ancient Roman era, as is shown by its coins, the town was commonly called <span class="loc">Claudiopolis</span> after Emperor Claudius. It was the birthplace of Antinous, the posthumously deified favourite of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who was very generous to the city, and his name was later added to that of Claudius on the coins of the city. Emperor Theodosius II (408-50) made it the capital of a new province, formed out of Bithynia and Paphlagonia, and called by him Honorias in honour of his younger son Honorius.</p>
