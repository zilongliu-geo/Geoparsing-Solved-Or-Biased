<p><span class="loc">Peabody</span> closing eastern <span class="loc">Illinois</span> coal mine. <span class="loc">RIDGE FARM</span>, <span class="loc">Ill</span>. (AP) — Pebody Energy says it is closing an eastern <span class="loc">Illinois</span> coal mine because geological conditions prevent its expansion. <span class="loc">Peabody</span> says the roughly 160 employees of the Vermilion Grove mine near <span class="loc">Ridge Farm</span> will be offered transfers to the company’s 13 other mines across the <span class="loc">Midwest</span>. Employees were told Thursday. Company spokeswoman Megan Gallagher says the coal that can be safely reached in the mine is gone. She says further expansion isn’t practical or safe because of local geology. The mine opened in 2002. St. Louis-based Peabody Energy plans for workers to spend the next two months shutting the mine down. <span class="loc">Ridge Farm</span> is about 45 miles southeast of Champaign near the <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">Ill.</span>, border.</p>
