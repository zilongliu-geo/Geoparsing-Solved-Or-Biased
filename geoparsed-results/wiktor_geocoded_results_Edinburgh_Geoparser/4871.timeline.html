  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ferndale</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Humboldt County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Its population was 1,371 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 1,382 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The city contains dozens of well-preserved Victorian storefronts and homes. <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> is the northern gateway to <span class="loc">California</span>'s Lost Coast and the city, which is sited on the edge of a wide plain near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Eel River</span>, is also located near the extensive preserves of Coast Redwood forests. Before American settlement, <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> was a glade of giant ferns reaching more than six feet, surrounded by <span class="per">Alder, Willow</span>, <span class="loc">Sitka</span> <span class="per">Spruce, Douglas</span> fir, Coast Redwood, swampy land and windswept prairies. The area was populated by the southern <span class="loc">Wiyot</span> people, centered along the <span class="loc">Eel River</span> where they caught lamprey eels, salmon and sturgeon in iris leaf fish nets, collected shellfish along the river and at its mouth, while cultivating only a <span class="loc">California</span> species of tobacco until settlement by <span class="per">Willard Allard</span>, <span class="per">Seth Louis Shaw</span> and his brother <span class="per">Stephen W. Shawi</span> established the town the <span class="date">summer of 1852</span>. In <span class="date">August 1852</span>, <span class="loc">Allard</span> and the <span class="loc">Shaw</span> brothers borrowed a canoe from the Wiyots in the <span class="loc">Table Bluff</span> area and rowed it across the Eel and up <span class="loc">Francis Creek</span> to arrive with their supplies to the approximate vicinity of <span class="per">Main</span> and <span class="per">Shaw</span> streets. In <span class="date">September 1852</span> they cleared a five-acre area of ferns and began building a cabin near the base of the Wildcat Road even though <span class="per">Allard</span> was sick with the ague. By <span class="date">January 1853</span>, twelve men were living in the <span class="loc">Shaws</span>' cabin including <span class="per">Seth Kinman</span>, who provided the group with meat, and <span class="per">Joe Russ</span> (<span class="date">1825</span>-<span class="date">1886</span>), whose later holdings included the Fern Cottage Historic District. About this time, <span class="per">Stephen Shaw</span> painted the portrait of <span class="loc">Wiyot</span> elder Kiwelattah (or Ki-we-lah-tah) and kept a detailed journal of <span class="date">two years</span> of trying to grow plants in cold coastal fog.</p><br><br>
