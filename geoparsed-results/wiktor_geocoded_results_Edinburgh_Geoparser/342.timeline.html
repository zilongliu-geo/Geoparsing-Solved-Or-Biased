  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Clifton</span> is a hamlet by the <span class="loc">River Cherwell</span> in <span class="loc">Deddington</span> civil parish about 6 miles (10 km) <span class="loc">south of Banbury</span>, <span class="loc">Oxfordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">Clifton</span> is on the B4031 road between <span class="loc">Deddington</span> and <span class="loc">Croughton</span>, <span class="loc">Northamptonshire</span>. A dependent chapel of <span class="loc">Deddington parish</span> church still existed in <span class="loc">Clifton</span> in <span class="date">1523</span> but seems to have disappeared by the 17th century. <span class="per">A Methodist</span> chapel was built in <span class="loc">Clifton</span> in about <span class="date">1815</span>. It was a small brick building and has since been demolished. The Methodists replaced it in <span class="date">1869</span> with a new brick and stucco chapel with plain lancet windows. It was still in use for worship in <span class="date">the 1950s</span> but was disused by <span class="date">1983</span> and is <span class="date">now</span> a private house. A new <span class="org">Church of England</span> chapel of <span class="loc">Saint James</span> the Great was completed in <span class="date">1853</span>. The <span class="loc">Diocese of Oxford</span> declared the chapel redundant in and sold it for secular commercial use in <span class="date">1974</span>. <span class="loc">Clifton</span> has a public house, the <span class="per">Duke of Cumberland</span>'s Head, that is <span class="date">now</span> a gastropub. The <span class="loc">Clifton</span> dog actor <span class="per">Sykes</span> (born c.2004), is owned by a local animal trainer. He has appeared as "Harvey" in Thinkbox marketing commercials, TV serials, and films. His advertisement for <span class="per">John Smith</span>'s Brewery saw him play "Tonto" against <span class="per">Peter Kay</span>.</p><br><br>
