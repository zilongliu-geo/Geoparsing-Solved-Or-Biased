<p><span class="loc">Charleston</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Cochise County</span> in the southeastern part of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. It was occupied from the late-1870s through the late-1880s, and was located in what was then known as the Arizona Territory. Located on the west bank of the <span class="loc">San Pedro River</span>, <span class="loc">Charleston</span>'s economy was based on milling silver ore mined from nearby Tombstone in the community of <span class="loc">Millville</span>, located directly across the river. <span class="loc">Charleston</span> is located at 31°38′9″N 110°10′21″W (31.635833, -110.1725), on the west bank of the <span class="loc">San Pedro River</span>, about 9 miles (14 km) southwest of Tombstone. <span class="loc">Millville</span> is located directly across the river, on the east bank. <span class="loc">Charleston</span> was originally settled as a residence for the mill workers in <span class="loc">Millville</span>, on the opposite bank of the <span class="loc">San Pedro River</span>, where two mills were built to process ore from the silver mines of nearby Tombstone. The mills were constructed in <span class="loc">Millville</span> due to a lack of water, needed for refinement, in the immediate vicinity of Tombstone. The mills, one operated by the Tombstone Mill and Mining Company and the other by the <span class="loc">Corbin</span> Mill and Mining Company, processed or "stamped" the silver ore into fine powder in preparation for smelting. The mills began operations in 1879, and at their peak from 1881–1882, they processed almost $1.4 million in silver bullion in one year.</p>
