  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Livingston</span> is a city and the county seat of <span class="loc">Park County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="per">Livingston</span> is located in southwestern <span class="loc">Montana</span>, on the <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span> River, north of <span class="loc">Yellowstone National Park</span>. The population was 7,044 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Livingston</span> evolved from a trading post on the <span class="loc">Yellowstone</span> River called Benson’s Landing which was approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) downstream from present day <span class="per">Livingston</span>. In <span class="date">July 1882</span>, when Northern Pacific Railway (NPR) contractors arrived, the trading post was renamed <span class="loc">Clark City</span> for contractor Heman Clark. The railroad officially reached <span class="loc">Clark City</span> on <span class="date">November 22, 1882</span>. At that time, the community moved to its present location upstream from the trading post and was renamed <span class="per">Livingston</span> in honor of a Northern Pacific Railway stockholder and director, <span class="per">Johnston Livingston</span> (<span class="date">1875</span>–81 and <span class="date">1884</span>–87). <span class="per">Livingston</span> became the first gateway town to Yellowstone National Park, which the NPR began promoting heavily to visitors from the East. The NPR operated a branch line running some sixty miles south to first the Cinnabar station and later <span class="loc">Gardiner</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>. <span class="per">Livingston</span> was also headquarters for the NPR's <span class="loc">Central Division</span> and location for railroad shops to service NPR steam trains before their ascent over the <span class="loc">Bozeman Pass</span>, the highest point on the line 5,702 feet (1,738 m).</p><br><br>
