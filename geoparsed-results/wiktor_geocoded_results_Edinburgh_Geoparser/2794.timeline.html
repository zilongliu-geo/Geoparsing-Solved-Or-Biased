  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and is a suburb of <span class="loc">Sioux Falls</span>. The population was 4,089 by the <span class="date">2010</span> census, having grown from 958 in <span class="date">2000</span> census. The population of the Harrisburg zip code has grown from 2,476 in <span class="date">2000</span> to 10,342 in <span class="date">2010</span>. Before the railroad was built through <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, a stagecoach brought mail to the <span class="loc">Johnson</span> <span class="loc">Harris Homestead</span> located on <span class="loc">Nine Mile Creek</span> in Dayton Township. <span class="per">Johnson Harris</span> named the post office <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> in honor of himself. The history of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> started <span class="date">August 1, 1879</span>, when the first train came rolling through the territory. The train went from <span class="loc">Sioux City</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, to <span class="loc">Sioux Falls</span>, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>. The post office was moved to the Emory J. Darling Homestead, 1 mile south of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>. The post office was called Salina in honor of <span class="per">Mrs. Jim Stillwell</span>, an early settler and a highly respected teacher. Finally in <span class="date">1890</span>, the depot was moved to its present site. The post office took back its original name and the town of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> was born.</p><br><br>
