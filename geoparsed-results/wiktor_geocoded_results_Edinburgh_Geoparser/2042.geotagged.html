<p><span class="loc">Union County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 201,292. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Monroe</span>. <span class="loc">Union County</span> is included in the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, <span class="loc">NC-SC Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The county was formed in 1842 from parts of <span class="loc">Anson County</span> and <span class="loc">Mecklenburg County</span>. Its name was a compromise between Whigs, who wanted to name the new county for <span class="loc">Henry Clay</span>, and Democrats, who wanted to name it for Andrew Jackson. The Helms, <span class="loc">Starnes</span>, <span class="loc">McRorie</span>, and <span class="loc">Belk</span> families took a major part in the <span class="loc">Monroe</span> and Charlotte, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>. Most of these families came from Goose Creek Township. <span class="loc">Monroe</span>, the county seat of <span class="loc">Union County</span>, also became a focal point during the Civil Rights Movement. In 1958, local NAACP Chapter President Robert F. Williams defended a nine-year-old African-American boy who had been kissed by a white girl in an incident known as the Kissing Case. A second African-American boy, aged seven, was also convicted and sentenced to live in a juvenile reformatory until he was 21 for simply witnessing the act. In 1961, Williams was accused of kidnapping an elderly white couple, when he sheltered them in his house during a very explosive situation of high racial tensions. Williams fled and went into exile in <span class="loc">Cuba</span> and in the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span> before returning to the <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p>
