<p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> State of <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> and is the county seat of <span class="loc">Olmsted County</span>. Located on the <span class="loc">Zumbro River</span>'s south fork, the city has a population of 106,769 according to the 2010 United States Census. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the 2014 population was 111,402. It is <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>'s third-largest city and the largest city located outside of the Minneapolis-St. <span class="loc">Paul-Bloomington Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. As of 2013, the <span class="loc">Rochester</span> metropolitan area has a population of 211,853. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was platted in 1855. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> developed as a stagecoach stop between <span class="loc">Saint Paul</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, and <span class="loc">Dubuque</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. When the railroad arrived in the 1860s, it brought new residents and business opportunities. In 1863, Dr. William W. Mayo arrived as the examining surgeon for draftees in the Civil War. The community was named after <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. On August 21, 1883, the Great Tornado demolished much of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, leaving 37 dead and about 200 injured. As there was no medical facility at the time, Mayo and his two sons worked together to care for the wounded. Donations of $60,000 were collected and the Sisters of St. Francis, assisted by Mayo, opened a new facility named St. Marys Hospital in 1889. The Mayo practice grew and is today among the largest and most well-respected medical facilities in the world. Many famous people from around the world, including former Presidents George H. W. Bush, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan, have visited <span class="loc">Rochester</span> as patients of the <span class="loc">Mayo Clinic</span>. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> has also been hit by two F4 tornadoes since 1950 (the first on May 10, 1953 and the other on September 16, 1962.)</p>
