  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Asadabad</span> or <span class="loc">Asad Abad</span> (Pashto: اسدآباد‎ - Asadābād, Persian: اسدآباد‎‎) is the capital <span class="loc">city of Kunar</span> Province in <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>. It is located in the eastern portion of the country adjacent to <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>. The city is located within a valley at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Pech River</span> and <span class="loc">Kunar River</span> between two mountain ridgelines running along both sides of the valley from Northeast to Southwest. <span class="loc">Asadabad</span> is in a mountainous region of the <span class="loc">Hindu Kush</span> mountains about 13 km (eight miles) northwest of the Pakistani border and 80 km (50 miles) northeast of <span class="loc">Jalalabad</span>, <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span>. <span class="loc">Asadabad</span> deals with a moderate amount of trade goods. <span class="loc">Nawa Pass</span>, that lies about 16 km (10 miles) south of <span class="loc">Asadabad</span>, is the next major border crossing point north of the <span class="loc">Khyber Pass</span> for the region. The pass is under constant observation due to its relative ease to cross for commerce and its potential usage for smuggling and Taliban insurgents. The surrounding <span class="loc">Kunar Province</span> lies near the historic routes connecting Central <span class="loc">Asia</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>, and <span class="loc">Iran</span>, such as the Silk Road and the Grand Trunk Road through the <span class="loc">Khyber Pass</span>, as well as routes through the <span class="loc">Hindu Kush</span> mountains. <span class="loc">Asadabad</span> lies at the confluence of the two major rivers of the area, the <span class="loc">Kunar</span> and the <span class="loc">Pech</span>. The region would have come under the borders of various empires of the ages, including the Achaemenid Persians, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, etc. It was very close to the paths Alexander the Great passed by on his way from conquering <span class="loc">Persia</span> to invading <span class="loc">India</span>. <span class="loc">Asadabad</span> is also on the eastern boundary of what was <span class="loc">Kafiristan</span> - part of <span class="loc">Afghanistan</span> not converted to <span class="loc">Islam</span> until the 1890s.</p><br><br>
