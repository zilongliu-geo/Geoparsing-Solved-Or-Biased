  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Charlestown</span> (Irish: Baile Chathail) is a town in <span class="loc">County Mayo</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, contiguous with <span class="loc">Bellaghy</span>, <span class="loc">County Sligo</span>, at the crossroads of the N17 and N5. <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> was built in the mid-19th century on the initiative of <span class="per">Lord Dillon</span>'s agent, <span class="per">Charles Strickland</span>, adjoining <span class="loc">Bellaghy</span> in <span class="loc">County Sligo</span>. The town <span class="date">now</span> has a population of approximately 800. There are two schools in <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>, St. Attracta's National School and St.Joseph's Marist Convent. The village was the subject of a serialised social commentary in <span class="org">The Irish Times</span> by <span class="per">John Healy</span>. This was later published as Death Of An Irish Town, and later republished as No One Shouted Stop! Written in <span class="date">1967</span>, it was highly critical of government policies towards rural areas, and took <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> as an example solely because it was the town of the author's birth. Gaelic Football team Charlestown Sarsfields reached the All-Ireland club semi-final in <span class="date">2001</span>, losing out on a final spot by two points. In <span class="date">2012</span> the town's sporting offering was complemented with the formation of <span class="org">Charlestown Boxing Club</span>. In a relatively short time, the club has successfully acquired numerous county and provincial titles, 1 National championship title and 3 Runner's-Up. It's boxers have also been selected to represent Co. <span class="loc">Mayo</span> in inter-county competition.</p><br><br>
