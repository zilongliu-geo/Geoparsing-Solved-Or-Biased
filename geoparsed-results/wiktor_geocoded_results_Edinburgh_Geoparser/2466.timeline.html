  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Liverpool</span> is a lakeside village in <span class="loc">Onondaga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,347 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The name was adopted from the <span class="loc">city of Liverpool</span> in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. The village is located on <span class="loc">Onondaga Lake</span>, in the western part of the town of Salina and is northwest of <span class="loc">Syracuse</span>, of which it is a suburb. The area was originally inhabited by the <span class="loc">Iroquois</span>, starting in the 16th century. In the mid-17th century, Canadian French Jesuits visited the area, setting up missions. These were not very permanent, however. An example of these missions is <span class="loc">Sainte Marie</span> among the <span class="loc">Iroquois</span>, on <span class="loc">Onondaga Lake</span> just outside the village. Once the (<span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal)and (<span class="loc">Oswego</span> Canal)were built, the area was settled by Irish canal workers, Yankee settlers, and, later, German immigrants. The early recorded name for the village was "<span class="loc">Little Ireland</span>". The <span class="org">Lucius Gleason House and Liverpool Cemetery</span> are listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. <span class="per">Jonathan Danforth</span>, brother of <span class="per">Asa Danforth</span>, who was the founder of <span class="loc">Onondaga</span> Valley, was the first settler in the region east of <span class="loc">Onondaga Lake</span> which forms the village of <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> <span class="date">today</span>. <span class="per">Danforth</span> moved there in <span class="date">1794</span> to manufacture salt.</p><br><br>
