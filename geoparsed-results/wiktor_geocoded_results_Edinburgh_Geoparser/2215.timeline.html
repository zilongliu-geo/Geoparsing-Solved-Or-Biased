So while thinking of a name, they decided to go fishing for <span class="date">a week</span>. And while preparing to go fishing, they saw a box floating not far from shore. Wading to reach the box and carrying it ashore, they opened the box to find a statue of Saint Ildephonsus. The young women of the place carried the statue to the center of the village, where it was enshrined in a small hut for <span class="date">many years</span>. He became the patron saint of the municipality, and his name was decided to become the name of the fledgling municipality.</p><br><br>
