<p><span class="loc">Marietta</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. During 1788, pioneers to the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> Country established <span class="loc">Marietta</span> as the first permanent settlement of the new <span class="loc">United States</span> in the Territory Northwest of the River <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. <span class="loc">Marietta</span> is located in southeastern <span class="loc">Ohio</span> at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Muskingum River</span> at its confluence with the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>. The population was 14,085 at the 2010 census. It is the second-largest city in the Parkersburg-Marietta-Vienna, West Virginia-Ohio (part) Metropolitan Statistical Area. The private, nonsectarian liberal arts Marietta College is located here. It was a station on the Underground Railroad before the Civil War. This is the site of the prehistoric Marietta Earthworks, a <span class="loc">Hopewell</span> complex more than 1500 years old, whose Great Mound and other major monuments were preserved by the earliest settlers in parks such as the Mound Cemetery. The city was named in honour of <span class="loc">Marie Antoinette</span>, Queen of France; <span class="loc">Marietta</span> being an affectionate nickname for the Queen. Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples have lived along the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> and its tributaries for thousands of years. Among them were more than one culture who built earthwork mounds, monuments which generally expressed their cosmology, often with links to astronomical events.</p>
