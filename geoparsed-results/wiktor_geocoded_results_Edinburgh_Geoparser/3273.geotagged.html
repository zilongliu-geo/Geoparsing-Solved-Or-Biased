<p><span class="loc">Inglewood</span> is a neighbourhood in central <span class="loc">Calgary</span>, <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, centred on 9th Avenue SE for several blocks east of the <span class="loc">Elbow River</span> and downtown. It also contains the Business Revitalization Zone of <span class="loc">Inglewood</span>. It is represented in the <span class="loc">Calgary City</span> Council by the Ward 9 councillor. The postal code in this area is T2G. <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> has the distinction of being <span class="loc">Calgary</span>'s oldest neighbourhood and it is immediately across the Elbow river from Fort <span class="loc">Calgary</span>. The community was established in 1875 after the fort was built. It was developed by a group headed by Acheson Irvine, Major John Stewart and James Macleod. Ninth Avenue (formerly Atlantic Avenue) was probably the first "main street" in the city. Today, the neighbourhood is a shopping and arts district. It is also home to the <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> <span class="loc">Bird Sanctuary</span>, an urban wildlife refuge. Originally known as <span class="loc">East Calgary</span> or Brewery Flats, the community was not officially given the name <span class="loc">Inglewood</span> until 1911, when it was named after the nearby homestead established by Col. James Walker. (Walker also was responsible for setting aside the lands later used by the bird sanctuary).</p>
