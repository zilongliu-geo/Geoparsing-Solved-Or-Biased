<p>Stanton is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 1,417 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Montcalm County</span>. It is located at the corners of four townships and incorporates land from each: Day Township to the northeast, Evergreen Township to the southeast, Sidney Township to the southwest, and Douglass Township to the northwest. Stanton was organized in 1860 when the people of <span class="loc">Montcalm County</span> voted to move the county seat here from <span class="loc">Greenville</span>, which was the original county seat from 1840. At that time, the County Board purchased 40 acres (160,000 m2) from Fred Hall of <span class="loc">Ionia</span> and named the city "Fred" in his honor. The family of Levi Camburn was the first to settle here and he became its first postmaster on March 10, 1862. The city was renamed for Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton in 1863. Stanton was platted in 1865, incorporated as a village in 1869, and as a city in 1881. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.15 square miles (5.57 km2), all land.</p>
