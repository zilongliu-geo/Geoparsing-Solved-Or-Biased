  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Munda</span> is the largest settlement on the island of <span class="loc">New Georgia</span> in the <span class="loc">Western Province</span> of the <span class="loc">Solomon Islands</span>, and consists of a number of villages. It is located at the southwestern tip (called <span class="loc">Munda Point</span>) of the western end of <span class="loc">New Georgia</span>, and the large <span class="loc">Roviana Lagoon</span> is just offshore. <span class="loc">Munda Point</span> was originally the site of a coconut plantation established by Englishman Norman Wheatley, and then owned by Australian <span class="per">Lesley Gill</span>. During World War II the Japanese built an airstrip to serve as a staging point to <span class="loc">Guadalcanal</span>. A convoy put in to <span class="loc">Munda Point</span> on <span class="date">24 November 1942</span>, and started construction under careful concealment from the air by means of rows of coconut palms suspended by cable. The airstrip was discovered by American planes on <span class="date">3 December</span>, and the first airstrikes were delivered by B-17 Flying Fortress bombers on <span class="date">9 December</span>. However, the Japanese were able to use <span class="loc">Munda</span> despite regular bombardment from both air and sea, and the Americans' New <span class="loc">Georgia</span> Campaign spent <span class="date">July 1943</span> closing in on Munda overland, capturing it on <span class="date">6 August</span>. The airstrip remains <span class="date">today</span> and daily flights land from <span class="loc">Honiara</span> and <span class="loc">Gizo</span>.</p><br><br>
