  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Oak Park is a city in south <span class="loc">Oakland County</span> of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. It is a northern suburb of the <span class="loc">city of Detroit</span>, which is located in neighboring <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, and part of its metropolitan area. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population of Oak Park is 29,319. This area was designated as within Royal Oak Township; it was first settled by European Americans in <span class="date">1840</span>, but remained sparsely populated for <span class="date">many decades</span> following. The first major housing development was constructed in <span class="date">1914</span> at the time of the Great War, when the township sold land to the <span class="org">Majestic</span> Land Company to be developed as the Oak Park subdivision. The subdivision was incorporated as a village on <span class="date">May 3, 1927</span>. Two petition drives during the Great Depression to dissolve the village government and return it to the township, citing "excessively high cost of village government," failed in <span class="date">1931</span> and <span class="date">1933</span>, respectively. The village incorporated as city on <span class="date">October 29, 1945</span> following the end of World War II. Stimulated by the GI Bill which aided veterans in buying new housing, highways to improve commuting, and planned developments in <span class="date">the late 1950s</span>, Oak Park from <span class="date">1950</span> to <span class="date">1960</span> was named as "<span class="loc">America</span>'s Fastest <span class="loc">Growing City</span>". Its population increased sevenfold, from 5,000 to more than 36,000. Much of its population were second and third-generation children of European immigrants who had settled in <span class="loc">Detroit</span> in the early 20th century. These included many Jewish Americans descended from immigrant ancestors from the Russian Empire, including present-day <span class="loc">Poland</span> and <span class="loc">Ukraine</span>. Major civic improvements in this period included construction of an outdoor swimming pool and an ice rink in Major Park (<span class="date">now</span> known as Shepherd Park, after former mayor <span class="per">David Shepherd</span>, but long known informally as Oak Park Park).</p><br><br>
