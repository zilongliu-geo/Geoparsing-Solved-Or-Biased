  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Darlington</span> is a small, inner-city suburb of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is located about 3 kilometres south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district and is part of the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Sydney</span>. At the time of its incorporation in <span class="date">1864</span>, it had the distinction of being the smallest municipality in the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> metropolitan area, at a mere 44 acres. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is bordered by City Road, <span class="per">Cleveland Street</span>, Golden Grove Street, <span class="loc">Wilson Street</span> and <span class="loc">Abercrombie Street</span>. The first Aboriginal inhabitants of <span class="loc">Darlington</span> were the Cadigal people of the Eora belonging to the wider Dharug language group. The Cadigal were a coastal people who subsisted on fishing, hunting land animals and gathering shellfish and plants. <span class="loc">Darlington</span> was part of their southern range bordered by the Kameygal clan to the south at <span class="loc">Botany Bay</span> and the <span class="loc">Wangal</span> clan to the west. The earliest recorded British history of <span class="loc">Darlington</span> is linked to school purposes when in <span class="date">1789</span>, Governor <span class="per">Arthur Phillip</span> received instructions from <span class="loc">England</span> to set aside land in the new penal colony for church and school use. In <span class="date">1819</span>, fifty two acres of land was given to <span class="per">William Hutchinson</span> by Governor <span class="per">Lachlan Macquarie</span>. In <span class="date">1835</span>, a 28 acres land grant was made to <span class="per">William Shepherd</span> by Governor <span class="per">Richard Bourke</span>. It had been promised <span class="date">earlier in 1827</span> by Governor <span class="per">Ralph Darling</span> and in his honour, Shepherd named the fruit and flower farm he established 'Shepherd's Darling Nursery'. His nursery is still remembered <span class="date">today</span> in many <span class="loc">Darlington</span> street names such as Ivy, Pine, <span class="per">Myrtle, Rose</span>, <span class="per">Vine</span> and <span class="per">Shepherd</span> Streets. By <span class="date">1844</span>, the Hutchinson estate, much of Shepherd's Nursery and a portion of the adjoining 96 acre land grant to <span class="per">William Chippendale</span> comprised much of present-day <span class="loc">Darlington</span>.</p><br><br>
