<p>Ex-officer testifies he did not rob drug dealers. But his effort to rebut the federal charges he is facing was undermined by his inability to identify a cell phone number he called or was called from 16 times before, during and after he allegedly robbed <span class="loc">South Philadelphia</span> drug kingpin Ricardo McKendrick Jr. on Dec. 14, 2007. Snell was fired shortly after his arrest in the incident. A federal trial that focused only on the Pottstown home invasion ended with a hung jury in October. Authorities expanded the charges against Snell after McKendrick and other reputed drug dealers agreed to cooperate against him.</p>
