  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dundee</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Nobles County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, United States The population was 68 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.31 square miles (0.80 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> is located in the extreme northeastern corner of <span class="loc">Nobles County</span>. The <span class="loc">Murray County</span> line defines Dundee's northern border, and the <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> line defines its eastern border. Main highways Include: <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> State Highway 62 (west) <span class="loc">Nobles County</span> Road 1 <span class="loc">Dundee</span> was established in <span class="date">1879</span> when the St. <span class="per">Paul</span> and <span class="per">Sioux</span> City Railway Company built a branch line, then known as the <span class="loc">Heron Lake</span> &amp; Black Hills Railroad. The first station out of <span class="loc">Heron Lake</span> was proposed in the extreme northeastern corner of <span class="loc">Nobles County</span>, and was originally named <span class="per">Warren</span>, in honor of <span class="per">Joseph Warren</span> who fell at the Battle of <span class="loc">Bunker Hill</span>. The town was surveyed and platted in <span class="date">July 1879</span>, and construction of a depot began on <span class="date">August 13</span>. Mr. G. Foils moved to town and assumed duties of stationmaster on <span class="date">September 1</span>. He was also named postmaster when a post office was established on <span class="date">November 1, 1879</span>. It was at this time that the name was changed to <span class="loc">Dundee</span>, after the <span class="loc">city of Dundee</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. The reason for the name change is lost to history, although it is known that stationmaster/postmaster G. Foils (whose first name is also lost to history) made the change. A Scottish Company known as the <span class="org">Dundee Improvement Company</span> was then financing construction of an elevator, general store, and hotel in nearby <span class="loc">Kinbrae</span>, and perhaps <span class="per">Mr. Foils</span> thought he could attract investment in <span class="loc">Dundee</span>. The first business was opened in the <span class="date">spring of 1880</span> by <span class="per">F. D. Lindquist</span> and <span class="per">H. A. Scherlie</span>. Several homes were also built in that second year, but real growth for <span class="loc">Dundee</span> did not occur until the late-nineties when the country began to recover from the Panic of <span class="date">1893</span>. A census taken on <span class="date">December 23, 1897</span>, gave the village a population of 187. At this time, citizens petitioned for incorporation, and on <span class="date">January 4, 1898</span>, the county commissioners granted their request. A special election was held on <span class="date">February 15</span>, and on <span class="date">March 11, 1898</span>, the <span class="loc">Dundee</span> council met for the first time. <span class="per">F. D. Lindquist</span> was named village president.</p><br><br>
