  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Kent</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and the largest city in <span class="loc">Portage County</span>. It is located along the <span class="loc">Cuyahoga River</span> in Northeast Ohio on the western edge of the county. The population was 28,904 in the <span class="date">2010</span> Census and 29,639 in the <span class="date">2014</span> estimate. The city is counted as part of the <span class="loc">Akron Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area. Part of the <span class="loc">Connecticut Western Reserve</span>, <span class="loc">Kent</span> was settled in <span class="date">1805</span> and was known for <span class="date">many years</span> as <span class="per">Franklin Mills</span>. Settlers were attracted to the area due to its location along the <span class="loc">Cuyahoga River</span> as a place for water-powered mills. Later development came in the 1830s and 1840s as a result of the settlement's position along the route of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Canal</span>. Leading up to the American Civil War, <span class="per">Franklin Mills</span> was noted for its activity in the "Underground Railroad". With the decline of the canal and the emergence of the railroad, the town became the home of the <span class="org">Atlantic and Great Western Railroad</span> maintenance shops through the influence of <span class="per">Marvin Kent</span>. In <span class="date">1864</span> the town was renamed <span class="per">Kent</span> in honor of and in gratitude for <span class="per">Marvin Kent</span>'s efforts. It was incorporated as a village in <span class="date">1867</span> and became a city after the <span class="date">1920</span> Census. <span class="date">Today</span> <span class="per">Kent</span> is a college town best known as the home of the main campus of <span class="org">Kent State University</span>, founded in <span class="date">1910</span>, and as the site of the <span class="date">1970</span> <span class="per">Kent</span> State shootings.</p><br><br>
