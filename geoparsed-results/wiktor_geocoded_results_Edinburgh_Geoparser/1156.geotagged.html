<p><span class="loc">Ceres</span> is a village in Fife, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, located in a small glen approximately 2 miles over the <span class="loc">Ceres Moor</span> from <span class="loc">Cupar</span> and 7 miles from <span class="loc">St Andrews</span>. The former parish of that name included the settlements of <span class="loc">Baldinnie</span>, <span class="loc">Chance Inn</span>, <span class="loc">Craigrothie</span>, <span class="loc">Pitscottie</span> and <span class="loc">Tarvit Mill</span>. It is one of the most historic and picturesque villages in <span class="loc">Scotland</span> and one of the few Scottish villages to have a village green, known as the "Bow Butts" since its use as an archery practice ground in medieval times. The <span class="loc">Ceres Burn</span> runs through the village and alongside the green. An old packhorse bridge, known as the "Bishop's Bridge" has spanned the burn since the 17th century and still stands close to a more modern road bridge. The village's most memorable feature is possibly the 18th century statue of "The Provost". It is thought to depict the Rev. Thomas Buchanan (related to the 17th century theologian George Buchanan), who became the last church provost of <span class="loc">Ceres</span> in 1578. The figure portrays him as a toby jug and is probably satirical. The sculptor, a local stonemason named James Howie, also carved a panel below the figure depicting the Battle of <span class="loc">Bannockburn</span>.</p>
