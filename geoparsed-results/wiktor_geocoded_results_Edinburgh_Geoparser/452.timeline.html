  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Batan</span> is a fourth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Aklan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="loc">Batan</span> has a population of 30,312 people. <span class="loc">Batan</span> was believed to be the seat of the government of <span class="loc">Datu</span> Bendahara Kalantiaw III, the promulgator of the Code of Kalantiaw in <span class="date">1433</span>. The code is a collection of 17 laws used during the time of the <span class="loc">Datu</span> before the coming of the Spaniards. <span class="loc">Batan</span> is one of oldest town founded in the province <span class="loc">Aklan</span>. <span class="loc">Batan</span> was formerly an encomienda of <span class="per">Miguel Rodriguez</span> in <span class="date">1591</span>. The parish in <span class="loc">Batan</span> was established by the Augustinians in <span class="date">1601</span> under the patronage of Our Lady of <span class="date">Immaculate Conception</span>. <span class="loc">Batan</span> was first incorporated to <span class="loc">Aclan</span> or <span class="loc">Aklan</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Kalibo</span>) in <span class="date">1603</span> and in <span class="date">1789</span> it became an independent municipality. In <span class="date">1903</span>, <span class="loc">Batan</span> was again incorporated to the new town of <span class="loc">New Washington</span> and became independent again in <span class="date">1931</span>. In <span class="date">1957</span>, the <span class="org">Kalantiaw National Shrine</span> marker was erected by the <span class="org">Philippine Historical and Cultural Society</span> to honor the significance of <span class="loc">Datu</span> Kalantiaw where it displays a copy of the “original manuscript” of the Code. It was built in this former school building near the port which houses the province's historical mementos and antiques, including the original manuscript of the code which the Spaniards obtained from an old chief and translated. In <span class="date">2004</span> however, after <span class="date">years</span> of investigation and historical findings, the National Historical Institute concluded that the Code of Kalantiaw was fake and a hoax. Remnants of the <span class="org">Kalantiaw National Shrine</span> marker still remain in <span class="loc">Batan</span>.</p><br><br>
