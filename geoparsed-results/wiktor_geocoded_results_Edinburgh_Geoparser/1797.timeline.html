  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Conway</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Carroll County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the most populous community in the county, and the most populous in the state north of <span class="loc">Hanover</span>. The population was 10,115 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, more than 1/5 of the total population of <span class="loc">Carroll County</span>. <span class="org">Parts of the White Mountain National Forest</span> are in the west and north of the town. Cathedral Ledge (popular with climbers) and Echo Lake State Park are in the west. Villages within the town include <span class="loc">Conway</span>, <span class="loc">North Conway</span>, <span class="loc">Center Conway</span>, <span class="loc">Redstone</span> and <span class="loc">Kearsarge</span>, as well as a portion of the village of <span class="loc">Intervale</span>. The region was once home to the <span class="loc">Pequawket</span> Indians, an Algonquian Abenaki tribe. Along the <span class="loc">Saco</span> River they fished, hunted or farmed, and lived in wigwams sheltered within stockades. In <span class="date">1642</span>, explorer <span class="per">Darby Field</span> of <span class="loc">Exeter</span> paddled up the <span class="loc">Saco</span> in a canoe, and would report seeing "Pigwacket," an Indian community stretching from present-day <span class="loc">Conway</span> to <span class="loc">Fryeburg</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>. The <span class="loc">Pequawket</span> tribe dwindled from disease, probably smallpox brought from abroad. In <span class="date">May 1725</span>, during <span class="org">Dummer's War</span>, 36 men from <span class="loc">Dunstable</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> led by <span class="per">John Lovewell</span> skirmished with the <span class="loc">Pequawket</span>. The <span class="loc">Pequawket</span> losses are not known but the result of the day's battle was the withdrawal of the tribe from the area.</p><br><br>
