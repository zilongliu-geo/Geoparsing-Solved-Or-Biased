  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Belen (/bəˈlɪn/; Spanish: Belén) is the second most populous city in <span class="loc">Valencia County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, after its county seat Los Lunas. The population was 7,175 in <span class="date">2014</span> census data. Belen is Spanish for <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> but gained the nickname "The <span class="loc">Hub City</span>" because of a major rail junction on BNSF Railway's Southern Transcon rail line. The city is geographically near the center of <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and has been a significant transportation hub for central <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> that includes access to rail, the interstate and air at <span class="loc">Valencia County</span>'s only public airport. Belen is at the southern end of the <span class="loc">Albuquerque Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The city is located 35 miles south of <span class="loc">Albuquerque</span>. Belen was founded in <span class="date">1740</span> as <span class="loc">Nuestra Senora de Belen</span> by a group of Spanish colonists led by <span class="per">Diego Torres</span> and <span class="per">Antonio Salazar</span>, who received permission to settle the tract of land known as the Belen Grant <span class="date">the year before</span>. Recognizing the strategic significance of Belen, Spanish authorities established a fort in Belen to protect the settlements along the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> in <span class="date">1760</span>. By the 1790s, Belen had established a city center known as <span class="loc">Plaza Vieja</span>, or <span class="loc">Old Town</span>, and had grown from a paraje, or precinct, to a partido, or district, with a population of 1,695. By <span class="date">1793</span>, a Catholic church and parish was founded.</p><br><br>
