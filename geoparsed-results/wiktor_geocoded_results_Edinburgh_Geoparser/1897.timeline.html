  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Teresita</span> is a city in the seaside La Costa Partido of the Province of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. Established in <span class="date">1946</span>, the town owed its initial growth to the <span class="org">Santa Teresita Development Association</span> led by José Milano, who successfully lobbied provincial authorities for paved roads, a telephone exchange, power plant, and clinic (all of which had been opened by <span class="date">1949</span>). A curupay wooden pier was built by the association in <span class="date">1947</span>, and in <span class="date">1972</span>, extended to 200 m (656 ft) – though damage from a <span class="date">1983</span> storm later led to its rebuilding in concrete. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> engineer Luther Koontz, who had stayed in <span class="loc">Argentina</span> after helping <span class="per">Alister MacKenzie</span> design two golf courses for the Argentine Jockey Club, opened the <span class="org">Santa Teresita Golf Club</span> in <span class="date">1950</span>, and the first lodging establishment, the Hostería <span class="loc">Santa Teresita</span>, was opened by <span class="loc">Horacio</span> <span class="per">Fiocco</span> and <span class="per">Angel</span> de <span class="loc">Martino</span>. Four hotels opened during <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, and in <span class="date">1959</span>, the town's best known inn, the Hotel Bristol, welcomed its first guests. The <span class="date">1960</span> Census counted 547 year-round residents. A monthly periodical, <span class="loc">Santa Teresita</span>, was started in <span class="date">1958</span>, as was <span class="org">Stefani Brothers</span>, the first local home builder. Schools, cinemas, cafés, and a police department were added, and in <span class="date">1965</span>, the <span class="per">Jorge Newbery</span> Airfield. The town's first local bank, the Banco de <span class="loc">Crédito Rural</span> <span class="loc">Argentino</span>, opened in <span class="date">1967</span>, though mismanagement led to its collapse in <span class="date">1986</span>.</p><br><br>
