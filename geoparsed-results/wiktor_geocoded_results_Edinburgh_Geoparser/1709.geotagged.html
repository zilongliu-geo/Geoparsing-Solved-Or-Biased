<p><span class="loc">Marlborough</span> is a small township located 106 kilometres (66 mi) north west of the <span class="loc">city of Rockhampton</span> in central <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. The town lies on the Bruce Highway. It is within the local government area of Shire of <span class="loc">Livingstone</span> (between 2008 and 2013, it was within the <span class="loc">Rockhampton Region</span>). At the 2006 census, <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> and the surrounding area had a population of 355. The town, first established in 1856, is a small service centre for the surrounding area, and one of a number of fuelling points on an otherwise isolated stretch of highway. To the south lies the Kunwarara Magnesite mine, which works one of the world's largest supplies of the mineral. The town has a school with only a few students. They compete against different schools in the area such as Clarke Creek State School, Milman State School and School of Distance Education. They compete in swimming and athletic carnivals which they normally host, having a 16-metre pool and a grassy oval. <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> is famous for producing the world's finest chrysoprase, a semi-precious gem once coveted by Alexander the Great and <span class="loc">Cleopatra</span>. The small but high-grade deposit is located about 20 kilometres (12 mi) south-south-west of the township and is universally regarded as the most valuable find in the world.</p>
