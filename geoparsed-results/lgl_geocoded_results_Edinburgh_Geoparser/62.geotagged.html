<p>Police ready to enforce skate ban. <span class="loc">Ziegler</span> said many businesses in the downtown area have placed signs up banning skating on their property. He said since those signs have gone up, calls to those area for skaters have decreased. As of next week, however, the entire downtown business area will be a posted zone prohibiting skating. Also, <span class="loc">Athens</span> Parks and Recreation Director Austin Fesmire said the city parks are available for skating as long as there are no signs prohibiting it. Fesmire added the steps at Athens Regional Park by the lake Pavilion have been signed as a no skating zone because of the danger of injury. Knox Park is a no skating zone, also, along with the fountain area of Veterans Memorial Park and the tennis courts at Ingleside Ave.</p>
