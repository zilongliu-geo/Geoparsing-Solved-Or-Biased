<p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ward County</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> was founded in 1883, having been third in a series that included two earlier settlements. Despite this, <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is still the oldest city in <span class="loc">Ward County</span>, as well as north-western and north central <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>. In 1885, as it was the only city in the then-newly formed Imperial <span class="loc">Ward County</span> (now split into Ward, <span class="loc">Renville</span>, Mountrail, and Burke counties), it was given the county seat, a position it held until 1888. The population was 1,060 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is part of the Minot Micropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, and its former settlements were founded by James Johnson and James Colton (the men who also settled <span class="loc">Larimore</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>) in Dakota Territory in the late 1870s. Earlier settlements were The Forks, and later Colton (named after James Colton), which are considered forerunners of the city. Its current name was given to it by James Johnson during the creation of the post office, and was the name of his hometown of <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. The name "The Forks" is used as a nickname for <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, both alluding to its heritage, as well as its geographic location at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Des Lacs</span> and <span class="loc">Souris Rivers</span>. One of the first buildings in <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, the first '<span class="loc">Ward County</span> Courthouse'; built by James Johnson, and used originally as a granary; was moved to the <span class="loc">North Dakota</span> State Fair fairgrounds in the mid-20th century and now serves as one of the 2 buildings of the <span class="loc">Ward County</span> Historical Society`s Fairgrounds Museum. In the early 1890s, the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> Reporter became the first newspaper in western <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>. It would in the future be renamed to the Minot Daily News. On June 24, 2011, the entire city was evacuated when floodwaters wiped through the town.</p>
