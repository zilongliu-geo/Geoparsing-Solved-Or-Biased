<p>Nuestra Señora de <span class="loc">La Paz</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈnwes.tɾa seˈɲoɾa ðe la pas]; English: Our Lady of Peace), commonly known as <span class="loc">La Paz</span> (/lɑː ˈpɑːz/; Spanish pronunciation: [la ˈpas]), named Chuqi <span class="loc">Yapu</span> (<span class="loc">Chuquiago</span>) in <span class="loc">Aymara</span>, is <span class="loc">Bolivia</span>'s third-most populous city (after <span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span> and <span class="loc">El Alto</span>), the seat of the country's government, and the capital of La Paz Department. It is located on the western side of <span class="loc">Bolivia</span> at an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level. It is, de facto, the world's highest administrative capital. While the official capital of <span class="loc">Bolivia</span> (and its seat of justice) is <span class="loc">Sucre</span>, <span class="loc">La Paz</span> has more government departments. In May 2015, <span class="loc">La Paz</span> was officially recognized as one of the <span class="loc">New7Wonders Cities</span> together with <span class="loc">Vigan</span>, <span class="loc">Doha</span>, <span class="loc">Durban</span>, <span class="loc">Havana</span>, <span class="loc">Beirut</span>, and <span class="loc">Kuala Lumpur</span>. The city sits in a bowl surrounded by the high mountains of the altiplano. As it grew, the city of <span class="loc">La Paz</span> climbed the hills, resulting in varying elevations from 3,200 to 4,100 m (10,500 to 13,500 ft). Overlooking the city is towering triple-peaked <span class="loc">Illimani</span>, which is always snow-covered and can be seen from many parts of the city, including from the neighboring city of <span class="loc">El Alto</span>. As of the 2008 census, the city had a population of 877,363.</p>
