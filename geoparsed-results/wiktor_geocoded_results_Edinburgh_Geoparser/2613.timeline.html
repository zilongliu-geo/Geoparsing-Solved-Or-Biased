  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Collinsville</span> is a city in <span class="per">Rogers</span> and <span class="per">Tulsa</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, and a part of the <span class="loc">Tulsa</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was named for <span class="per">Dr. A. H. Collins</span>, an engineer and surveyor who first surveyed the land that became this community. The population was 5,606 according to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, an increase of 37.5 percent from 4,077 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. A community that had existed here had no official name until <span class="per">Dr. A. H. Collins</span>, the town namesake, established a post office on <span class="date">May 28, 1897</span>. Henry P. Cook was the first postmaster. Then it became known as either <span class="loc">Collins</span> or <span class="loc">Collins Post</span> Office. The name officially became <span class="loc">Collinsville</span> by <span class="date">June 1898</span> and it incorporated as a city in <span class="date">April 1899</span>. The population in <span class="date">1900</span> was 376. The <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> routed its line from <span class="loc">Kansas</span> to <span class="loc">Owasso</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> about a mile west of <span class="loc">Collinsville</span> in <span class="date">1899</span>, to avoid crossing an additional stream. The town's buildings were moved on rollers to be nearer the track in <span class="date">1899</span> and <span class="date">1900</span>. <span class="loc">Collinsville</span> originally was located in <span class="loc">Rogers County</span>. In <span class="date">1918</span>, the residents voted to be annexed by <span class="loc">Tulsa County</span>, in order to be nearer a county seat. It was only 20 miles (32 km) north of <span class="loc">Tulsa</span>.</p><br><br>
