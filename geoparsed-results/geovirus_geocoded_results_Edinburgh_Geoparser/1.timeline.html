  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The <span class="org">Philippine Department of Agriculture</span> (DA), local health and agricultural teams <span class="date">Sunday</span> have started slaughtering, burning and burying roughly 6,500 hogs at a farm in <span class="loc">Pandi</span>, <span class="loc">Bulacan</span> in Central Luzon on <span class="date">Sunday</span> after three farm workers became infected with <span class="loc">Reston</span> ebolavirus (ERV) of the virus group <span class="loc">Ebola</span>, as a precautionary measure and to protect the local livestock industry. "We culled around 300 heads—piglets and growers—in two and a half hours; we tried to start the process at <span class="date">5 p.m. Sunday</span>; after three hours we disposed of 442 hogs; that includes transporting the hogs to an area in the farm where they will be disposed of; with this rate and with some improvements in the procedure <span class="date">tomorrow</span>, we expect to complete the depopulation by <span class="date">Wednesday</span>,” Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) head <span class="per">Davinio Catbagan</span> said. "With the problems we encountered last night, we may go beyond <span class="date">Thursday</span>," he added.</p><br><br>
