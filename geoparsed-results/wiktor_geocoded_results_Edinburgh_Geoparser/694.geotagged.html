<p><span class="loc">Stratford</span> is a town and district in <span class="loc">east London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, in the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Newham</span>. It is in <span class="loc">West Ham</span> and located 6 miles (9.7 km) east northeast of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span> and is one of the major centres identified in the London Plan. It was historically an agrarian settlement in the ancient parish of <span class="loc">West Ham</span> in the <span class="loc">county of Essex</span>, which transformed into an industrial suburb following the introduction of the railway in 1839. As part of the growth of <span class="loc">London</span> in the late 19th century, <span class="loc">Stratford</span> significantly expanded and increased in population, becoming the centre of administration of the Borough of <span class="loc">West Ham</span> in 1886 and it has formed part of <span class="loc">Greater London</span> since 1965. The more recent economic history is underpinned by a move away from railway works and heavy industry towards becoming a significant commercial and cultural centre. <span class="loc">Stratford</span> is the location of the <span class="loc">London Olympic</span> Park and is currently experiencing regeneration and expansion linked to the 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2011, <span class="loc">Stratford</span> had a population of 98,812. The name is first recorded in 1067 as Strætforda and means 'ford on a Roman road'. It is formed from Old English 'stræt' and 'ford'. The crossing is that of the <span class="loc">London</span> to <span class="loc">Colchester</span> road over one of the many branches of the <span class="loc">River Lea</span> to the west of the settlement. The nearby settlement of Bow – over the <span class="loc">River Lea</span> and now in <span class="loc">Tower Hamlets</span> – was also known as <span class="loc">Stratford</span> and a variety of suffixes were used to distinguish the two. The settlement to the east of the Lea was also known as Estratford referring to the location east of the other <span class="loc">Stratford</span>, Statford Hamme alluding to the location within the parish of <span class="loc">West Ham</span>, Abbei Stratford, referring to the presence of <span class="loc">Stratford Langthorne</span> Abbey and Stretford Langthorne.</p>
