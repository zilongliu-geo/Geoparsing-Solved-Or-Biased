  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">China</span>, officially the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span> (PRC), is a sovereign state in East <span class="loc">Asia</span>. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of over 1.35 billion. The PRC is a one-party state governed by the Communist Party, with its seat of government in the capital <span class="loc">city of Beijing</span>. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces; five autonomous regions; four direct-controlled municipalities (<span class="loc">Beijing</span>, <span class="loc">Tianjin</span>, <span class="loc">Shanghai</span> and <span class="loc">Chongqing</span>); two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (<span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> and <span class="loc">Macau</span>); and claims sovereignty over <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>. Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, <span class="loc">China</span> is the world's second-largest country by land area, and either the third or fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement. <span class="loc">China</span>'s landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the <span class="loc">Gobi</span> and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The <span class="loc">Himalaya</span>, Karakoram, <span class="loc">Pamir</span> and <span class="loc">Tian Shan</span> mountain ranges separate <span class="loc">China</span> from South and Central <span class="loc">Asia</span>. The <span class="loc">Yangtze</span> and <span class="per">Yellow Rivers</span>, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the <span class="loc">Tibetan Plateau</span> to the densely populated eastern seaboard. <span class="loc">China</span>'s coastline along the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi) long, and is bounded by the <span class="loc">Bohai</span>, Yellow, East and South <span class="loc">China</span> Seas.</p><br><br>
