  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Plata</span> is the capital city of the Province of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>, and of the partido <span class="loc">La Plata</span>. According to the <span class="date">2001</span> census [INDEC], it has a population of 740,369 and its metropolitan area has 894,253 inhabitants. <span class="loc">La Plata</span> was planned and developed to serve as the provincial capital after the city of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> was federalized in <span class="date">1880</span>. It was officially founded by <span class="per">Governor Dardo Rocha</span> on <span class="date">19 November 1882</span>. Its construction is fully documented in photographs by <span class="per">Tomás Bradley Sutton</span>. <span class="loc">La Plata</span> was renamed <span class="per">Eva</span> <span class="loc">Perón City</span> (Ciudad <span class="per">Eva Perón</span>) between <span class="date">1952</span> and <span class="date">1955</span>. The city is home to two important first division football (soccer) teams: <span class="loc">Estudiantes</span> de <span class="loc">La Plata</span>, and Gimnasia y Esgrima <span class="loc">La Plata</span>. <span class="per">Rocha</span> decided to erect a new city to host the provincial government institutions and a university which had already been planned. Urban planner <span class="per">Pedro Benoit</span> designed a city layout based on a rationalist conception of urban centers. The city has the shape of a square with a central park and two main diagonal avenues, north to south and east to west. In addition, there are numerous other shorter diagonal streets. This design is copied in a self-similar manner in small blocks of six by six blocks in length. For every six blocks, there is a small park or square. Other than the diagonal streets, all streets are on a rectangular grid and are numbered consecutively. Thus, <span class="loc">La Plata</span> is nicknamed "la ciudad de las diagonales" (city of diagonals). It is also called "la ciudad de los tilos" (city of linden trees), because of the large number of linden trees lining the many streets and squares. The linden tree is one of a number of deciduous Northern Hemisphere tree species which dominate <span class="loc">La Plata</span>'s parks and streets; ash, horsechestnut, plane, sweetgum and tulip tree are among the other examples. Palms and subtropical broadleaf evergreen trees thrive, but are comparatively infrequent.</p><br><br>
