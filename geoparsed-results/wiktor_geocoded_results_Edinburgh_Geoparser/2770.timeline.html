  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Atlanta</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Phelps County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 131 at the <span class="date">2010</span> Census. During World War II the town was neighbored by Camp <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, which housed more than 3,000 Nazi German prisoners of war over <span class="date">three years</span>. The camp was said to house more prisoners during the war than the town had in its entire existence. <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> was laid out in <span class="date">1883</span> when the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Burlington</span> &amp; Quincy Railroad was extended to that point. It was likely named after <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. In the first part of the 20th century <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> was home to several amenities for neighboring farmers. They included a grocery store, post office, cafe, and a tourist shop for drivers on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 6, as well as corn and grain elevators and two gas stations. Chataqua groups entertained at the town hall, with annual events such as the <span class="org">Atlanta Institute</span>, which was an annual fair. There were also free outdoor "picture shows", and the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> Industry Day Picnic. The <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> schoolhouse had eight grades. At the beginning of WWII, there was one street about two blocks long, with only a few business buildings drooping and dwindling along its edges.</p><br><br>
