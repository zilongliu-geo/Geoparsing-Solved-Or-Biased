  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alma is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Wabaunsee County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 832. For millennia, the land <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was inhabited by Native Americans. In <span class="date">1803</span>, most of modern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was secured by the <span class="loc">United States</span> as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In <span class="date">1854</span>, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in <span class="date">1861</span> <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In <span class="date">1859</span>, <span class="loc">Wabaunsee County</span> was founded. The first house was built at Alma in <span class="date">1867</span>. In <span class="date">1887</span>, the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Nebraska Railway built a main line from <span class="loc">Topeka</span> through Alma to <span class="loc">Herington</span>. The <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Nebraska Railway was foreclosed in <span class="date">1891</span> and taken over by <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> and Pacific Railway, which shut down in <span class="date">1980</span>. This line of the former <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> Railroad was sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad and later merged into the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific that operates and owns the line <span class="date">today</span>. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the "<span class="loc">Rock Island</span>". The city was named after either the <span class="loc">city of Alma</span>, <span class="loc">Germany</span>, or for a stream in the <span class="loc">Ukraine</span>.</p><br><br>
