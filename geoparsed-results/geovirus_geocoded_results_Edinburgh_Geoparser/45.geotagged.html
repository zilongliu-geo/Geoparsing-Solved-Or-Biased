<p>A five-year-old boy has been suspected to have died from the H1N1 swine flu virus in <span class="loc">Buckinghamshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The boy came from Emberton School, which now has just 29 pupils attending. Health tests are currently being carried out to determine whether or not the child did indeed die from the virus. He was admitted to a hospital in <span class="loc">Milton Keynes</span>, but later died in the early hours of Sunday morning. At present, the individual remains unidentified. Steve Dunning is the principal in the school. Speaking to BBC Three Counties Radio, Dunning said: "The staff of Emberton School are very saddened to learn of the death of one of their pupils who was a confident, delightful and happy student and will be missed greatly. At this time we are focusing on supporting the children and parents in our small village community. I have spoken directly with the mother and passed on the condolences of all the staff and governors at the school."</p>
