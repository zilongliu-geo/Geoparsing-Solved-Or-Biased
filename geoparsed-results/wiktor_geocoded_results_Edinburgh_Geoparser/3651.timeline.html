  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Shendi</span> or <span class="loc">Shandi</span> (Arabic: شندي) is a town in northern <span class="loc">Sudan</span>, situated on the east bank of the <span class="loc">Nile River</span> 150 km northeast of <span class="loc">Khartoum</span>. <span class="loc">Shandi</span> is also about 45 km southwest of the ancient <span class="loc">city of Meroe</span>. Located in the <span class="loc">River Nile</span> wilayah, <span class="loc">Shandi</span> is the center of the Ja'aliin tribe and an important historic trading center. Its principal suburb on the west bank is Al-Matamma. A major traditional trade route across the Bayuda Desert connects Al-Matamma to <span class="loc">Marawi</span> and <span class="loc">Napata</span>, 250 km to the northwest. Very basic services and infrastructure mean that <span class="loc">Shendi</span> exists mainly as a center for trade in agricultural goods from nearby farms. Roads have begun to be laid cross the city. The railway station in the city is no longer used for passenger travel, although freight trains continue to use the tracks. <span class="loc">Shendi</span> is home to an airport (ICAO code HSND). Mobile telephone coverage exists within the city, neighboring towns of alMisiktab and <span class="per">Al Mattamah</span>, outlying villages and the ancient Meriotic pyramids to the north. Schools exist within the town and local villages <span class="per">A UNESCO</span> funded center exists within the town to promote education in foreign languages and Information Technology.</p><br><br>
