<p><span class="loc">Ontario</span> is the largest city in <span class="loc">Malheur County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies along the <span class="loc">Snake River</span> at the <span class="loc">Idaho</span> border. The population was 11,366 at the 2010 census. The city is the largest community in the region of far eastern <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, also known as the Western Treasure Valley. <span class="loc">Ontario</span> is the principal city of the <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, OR-ID Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes <span class="loc">Malheur County</span> in <span class="loc">Oregon</span> and <span class="loc">Payette County</span> in <span class="loc">Idaho</span>. <span class="loc">Ontario</span> is approximately halfway between <span class="loc">Portland</span> and <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span>. It is the closest city to the <span class="loc">Idaho</span> border along Interstate 84. The city's slogan is "Where <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Begins". <span class="loc">Ontario</span> was founded on June 11, 1883, by developers William Morfitt, Mary Richardson, Daniel Smith, and James Virtue. In March 1884, Richard Welch started a post office for the quarter of <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, so named by James Virtue after <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Two months later Joseph Morton applied for a Morton post office at an island about one mile south of town, with Oscar Scott as postmaster. Unfortunately for Morton and Scott, merchants Morfitt and Richardson of <span class="loc">Malheur City</span>, gold miner Virtue, and lumberman Smith of Baker City acquired more land and were better financed. More importantly, Morfitt had negotiated a train depot for <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. All the settlers and speculators knew the railroad was coming and how important that would be to <span class="loc">Ontario</span>'s future so Scott closed his Morton post office and built a hotel at present-day <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. By December, Scott was <span class="loc">Ontario</span>'s postmaster.</p>
