<p>Armstrong is a town in <span class="loc">Bryan County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along the <span class="loc">Blue River</span>. The population was 105 at the 2010 census, a 25.2 percent decrease from 141 at the 2000 census. The town was named for Frank C. Armstrong, a member of the Dawes Commission. The town of Armstrong began along the route of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad (Katy) in 1872. The town had a post office in 1882-3, but thereafter the mail was sent to <span class="loc">Caddo</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. In 1896, another post office opened in Armstrong, but it was closed in 1920. The post office was located in the only grocery store, and the store owner was also the postmaster. In 1911, the population was 41. The Oklahoma Office of the <span class="loc">Game Warden</span> (now the Department of Wildlife Conservation) established a fish hatchery in the town about 1916. Otherwise the town survived economically by serving small farms in the area and catering to the needs of sport fishermen who were attracted to the <span class="loc">Blue River</span> and nearby <span class="loc">Lake Texoma</span>, By 1980, the town had 133 residents. The population dropped to 122 in 1990, then rose to 141 in 2000. It dropped again, and was 105 in 2010.</p>
