<p>Marion is a city in <span class="loc">LaMoure County</span>, <span class="loc">North Dakota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 133 at the 2010 census. The city was founded in 1900 as <span class="loc">Elmo</span>, but changed its name to Marion in 1902. The new name came from Marion Mellen, daughter of Northern Pacific Railway president Charles Sanger Mellen. Marion was located at the end of a Northern Pacific branch line starting in <span class="loc">Casselton</span> and known as the "lady line" due to the many cities bearing female names located alongside the tracks. The line was in place in Marion until 2002, when eventual owner Red River Valley &amp; Western filed for abandonment. Marion is located at 46°36′26″N 98°20′1″W (46.607360, -98.333510). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.01 square miles (2.62 km2), of which 0.84 square miles (2.18 km2) is land and 0.17 square miles (0.44 km2) is water. Marion was mentioned on the March 5, 2014 episode of "<span class="loc">Wheel of Fortune</span>." A former resident, Stephanie Limesand, appeared on the show.</p>
