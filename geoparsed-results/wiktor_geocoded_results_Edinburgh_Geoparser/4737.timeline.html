  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Exeter</span> is a Canadian community in the municipality of <span class="loc">South Huron</span>, in the southern portion of <span class="loc">Huron County</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, located approximately 50 kilometres north of <span class="loc">London</span>. The community proclaims itself the "<span class="org">Home of the White Squirrel</span>", owing to the presence of the unusually-coloured mammals. <span class="loc">Exeter</span>'s mascot, "<span class="per">Willis</span> The White Wonder" can be seen at many community events throughout the year, including <span class="loc">Canada</span> Day celebrations, the <span class="loc">Exeter</span> Rodeo, and the Santa Claus Parade. <span class="loc">Exeter</span> was first founded in the <span class="date">winter of 1832</span> by the Irish settlers <span class="per">James</span> and <span class="per">Jane Willis</span> accompanied by the explorer <span class="per">Sir Michael Jacques</span>. By <span class="date">1853</span>, <span class="loc">Exeter</span> had grown into a community of over 300 with the help of <span class="per">Isaac Carling</span> bringing immigrants from the <span class="loc">Exeter</span> and <span class="loc">Devon</span> areas of England.The original <span class="per">Carling</span> homestead, a designated historical landmark still stands on Huron St.W. It was on <span class="date">July 1, 1873</span>, when the villages north and south of the <span class="loc">Ausable River</span> (<span class="loc">Francistown</span> and <span class="loc">Exeter</span> respectively) merged to form the Village of <span class="loc">Exeter</span>. <span class="loc">Exeter</span> eventually became a town of over 4,700 people. Paintings of some of <span class="loc">Exeter</span>'s historical citizens, by the late artist <span class="per">Harry Burke</span>, may be seen at the <span class="loc">Exeter</span> Legion Hall.</p><br><br>
