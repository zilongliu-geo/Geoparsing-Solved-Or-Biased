  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Brunswick</span> is a rural city in <span class="loc">Chariton County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 858 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Brunswick</span>, by official state proclamation, is the Pecan Capital of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. The <span class="org">Missouri Farmers Association</span> (MFA Incorporated) was founded in <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> in <span class="date">1914</span>. For <span class="date">thousands of years</span> varying cultures of indigenous peoples settled by the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. At the time of European contact, historical tribes in the area included the <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">Osage</span>, <span class="loc">Kaw</span>, <span class="loc">Otoe</span> and others. In <span class="date">1723</span> <span class="per">Etienne de Veniard</span>, <span class="per">Sieur de Bourgmont</span> built Fort Orleans near here, established on the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Grand River</span>. It was occupied 1723-1726 as the first multi-year European fort and settlement in present-day <span class="loc">Missouri</span>. It was to be a trading centerpiece of La Louisiane, the new territory claimed by the French. Following the Louisiana Purchase and the end of the French colonial period the area saw a large influx of immigrants from the <span class="loc">U.S.</span>, especially <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> and <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. They brought African-American slaves and slaveholding traditions with them. The new land owners planted and cultivate crops similar to those in the Upper South: hemp and tobacco. <span class="loc">Chariton</span> was one of several counties along the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River to become known as <span class="loc">Little Dixie</span>.</p><br><br>
