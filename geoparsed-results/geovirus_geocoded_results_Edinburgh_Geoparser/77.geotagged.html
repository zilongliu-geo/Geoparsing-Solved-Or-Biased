<p>A man about to be indicted by the United States Department of Justice died Tuesday. His lawyer has called the death a suicide. Bruce Edwards Ivins, 62, was taken to Frederick Memorial Hospital in Frederick, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, where he died of an overdose of Tylenol and codeine, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. Ivins, who worked at the biodefense laboratories in Fort <span class="loc">Detrick</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span> for 18 years, was about to be charged by the Justice Department in connection with the 2001 anthrax attacks, which killed five people and infected 17 others. Ivin's lawyer, Paul Kemp, insisted that his client had no role in the attacks, which targeted politicians in <span class="loc">Washington</span> <span class="loc">DC</span>, and members of the media in New <span class="loc">York City</span> and <span class="loc">Florida</span>. "For six years, Dr. Ivins fully cooperated with that investigation, assisting the government in every way that was asked of him," Mr. Kemp told the New York Times. "The relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people, as has already been seen in this investigation. In Dr. Ivins’ case, it led to his untimely death." “Everybody is jumping to the conclusion that because this guy committed suicide, he must be the anthrax killer,” Mr. Clawson told the New York Times. “That is a lousy premise. The pressure of these F.B.I. investigations on individuals is phenomenal, and it is quite likely that this guy cracked under that pressure but had nothing to do with the killings.” The New York Times reports that Ivins had been undergoing psychiatric treatment within the last month and had a restraining order placed on him by a woman he was allegedly stalking and threatening. According to National Public Radio (NPR), mental health professional Jean C. Duley requested that a <span class="loc">Frederick County</span> court issue a "peace order", a type of restraining order, against Ivins in July. Duley submitted documents to the court which show a history of "homicidal actions, threats and plans."</p>
