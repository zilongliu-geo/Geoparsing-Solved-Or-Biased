  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Brewster</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Nobles County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 473 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Founding of <span class="per">Brewster</span>: The town of <span class="per">Brewster</span> was in established in the <span class="date">spring of 1872</span>, but was known for <span class="date">many years</span> as <span class="per">Hersey</span>. It was the first town established in <span class="loc">Nobles County</span> by the St. <span class="per">Paul</span> and <span class="per">Sioux</span> City Railroad, and was named after General <span class="per">Samuel F. Hersey</span>, a lumber baron from <span class="loc">Maine</span>, and one of the railroad's directors. The first resident was <span class="per">W. R. Bennett</span>, who came to take charge of the railroad station. T. J. Smith put up the first store which was run by <span class="per">A. J. Timlin</span> for <span class="date">many years</span>. <span class="per">Mr. A. O. Conde</span> established a lumber yard and a grain business, <span class="per">Martin Heiser</span> opened a second store, a hotel was opened by a <span class="per">Mr. Humphrey</span>, and <span class="per">John Iverson</span> established a blacksmith shop. All of this occurred in <span class="date">1872</span>, the same year that <span class="per">A. J. Timlin</span> became postmaster. Source of name: In <span class="date">1880</span>, the St. <span class="per">Paul</span> and <span class="per">Sioux</span> City Railroad was purchased by the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="per">St. Paul</span>, <span class="loc">Minneapolis</span> and <span class="loc">Omaha Railway</span>, or the <span class="loc">Omaha Road</span>, and there was already a station named <span class="per">Hersey</span> on the latter road's track in <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. In order to avoid confusion, the name of <span class="per">Hersey</span> was changed, briefly to <span class="loc">Nobles County</span> Station. Soon thereafter, the name <span class="per">Brewster</span> was settled upon. There is some confusion regarding the choice of name. E. F. Drake, president of the St. <span class="per">Paul</span> and <span class="per">Sioux</span> City Railroad once stated that the name "was changed to <span class="per">Brewster</span> after a director of the <span class="loc">Omaha Road</span>." But a brochure later put out by the <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and North <span class="org">Western Railway Company</span> stated that "the present name was given in honor of <span class="per">Brewster</span>, a town in <span class="loc">Barnstable County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, which was named in honor of Elder <span class="per">William Brewster</span>, one of the first settlers of <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span>."</p><br><br>
