  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> (<span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> German: Harrisbarig) is the capital city of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Dauphin County</span>. With a population of 49,673, it is the tenth-largest city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. It lies on the east bank of the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span>, 105 miles (169 km) west-northwest of <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and 204 miles (328 km) east of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. The <span class="loc">Harrisburg-Carlisle Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which includes Dauphin, <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, and Perry counties, had a population of 509,074 in <span class="date">2000</span> and grew to 549,850 in <span class="date">2010</span>. A <span class="date">July 1, 2007</span> estimate placed the population at 528,892, making it the fifth largest Metropolitan Statistical Area in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> after <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>, <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Allentown</span>−Bethlehem−Easton (the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley), and Scranton−Wilkes Barre.
