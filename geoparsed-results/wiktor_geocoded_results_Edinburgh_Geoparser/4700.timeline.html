  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Grantham</span> is an unincorporated community in Upper Allen Township, <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, best known <span class="date">today</span> for the Christian liberal arts college, <span class="org">Messiah College</span>, whose students make up most of its population. There is no industry, no mass-commercialization, and very little night life outside of the college. The population of <span class="loc">Grantham</span> is 85-90% between the ages of 18 and <span class="date">25 years</span> old - if you only count the student population. The actual residents number between 600-650, a large number of which are Messiah alumni, employees or parents of the same. Founded in the early twentieth century, <span class="loc">Grantham</span> was built around the rapidly growing industry built along the nearby railway line, which supplied the labor and logistical support to the macaroni factory run by <span class="org">Messiah College</span>'s first president S.R. Smith. After the macaroni plant went out of business, the facility was used for aircraft parts and a greeting card business. It was destroyed by fire prior to <span class="date">1957</span> and stood derelict for <span class="date">many years</span>; eventually it was demolished to provide a new maintenance facility for the growing college.</p><br><br>
