  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Bell (Hunsrück) is an Ortsgemeinde – a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality – in the <span class="loc">Rhein-Hunsrück-Kreis (district</span>) in Rhineland-Palatinate, <span class="loc">Germany</span>. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of <span class="loc">Kastellaun</span>, whose seat is in the like-named town. Bell’s Ortsteile are the main centre, also called Bell, and the outlying centres of <span class="loc">Hundheim</span>, <span class="loc">Krastel</span>, <span class="loc">Leideneck</span>, <span class="loc">Wohnroth</span> and Völkenroth along with the Blümlingshof and the Rothenberger Hof. In <span class="date">1220</span>, Bell had its first documentary mention in the directory of yearly payments to the Archbishopric of Trier, the liber annalium. Even so, Bell is a much older settlement. The name itself is pre-Germanic, being a Celtic word for a hill or a settlement in the heights. Grave finds near Bell, particularly <span class="org">the Wagon Grave of Bell</span> from late Hallstatt times (about <span class="date">500 BC</span>), show that the area was settled by Celts. A Roman estate east of the church discovered in the mid 19th century and certified as a “ground monument”, and a Frankish manor just to its south in the cadastral area “In den Hupfeldern” (whose name refers to this estate; foundations of this manor were unearthed when the land was opened to development) give one some clue as to the village’s importance in the time when the Franks were taking over the land. Bell was also the main centre of a parish to which belonged <span class="loc">Leideneck</span>, Horn, Alterkülz and even the later castle and residence town of <span class="loc">Kastellaun</span>, <span class="date">now</span> the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde. Neighbouring places with names ending in —heim and —bach (<span class="loc">Hundheim</span>, <span class="loc">Michelbach</span>) date from the time of the Frankish takeover (500–700) during the Migration Period (Völkerwanderung), and are therefore much younger than Bell. Places with names ending in —roth were established in the time of widespread woodland clearing in the Early Middle Ages. Bell also lay near the Celtic, later Roman, “high road”.</p><br><br>
