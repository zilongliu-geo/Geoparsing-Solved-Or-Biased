  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Miramar</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Broward County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 122,041. It is part of the <span class="loc">South Florida metropolitan</span> area, which was home to 5,564,635 people at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Miramar</span> was founded by A.L. Mailman to serve as a “bedroom community" for nearby <span class="loc">Miami</span> and Fort Lauderdale. <span class="per">Mr. Mailman</span> bought the original property he was to develop from H.D. Perry, Sr. in <span class="date">1953</span>. He built 56 homes on the property that were inexpensive homes of concrete and flat roofs. These homes sold quickly because of the low cost of both the homes and the land, and the <span class="loc">city of Miramar</span> came into being. The <span class="loc">City of Miramar</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">May 26, 1955</span>. At the time of incorporation, the city had a population of less than two hundred people. With approximately 2.9 square miles land area, Miramar's original city boundaries were Southwest 64 Avenue on the east, University Drive on the west, the <span class="loc">Dade County</span> line on the south, and Pembroke Road on the north. On <span class="date">June 20th, 1955</span>, the city's first mayor and city council were sworn in, all of which were appointed by the governor and served until <span class="date">January 1959</span> at which time the first municipal election was held. <span class="per">Robert Gordon</span>, the first mayor of the city gave <span class="loc">Miramar</span> its name which translates to “Look at the Sea” in Spanish. "Miramar" was an exclusive suburb of <span class="loc">Havana</span> in pre-Castro <span class="loc">Cuba</span>. The city seal is inscribed with the motto “<span class="per">Beauty</span> and <span class="per">Progress</span>".</p><br><br>
