  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fortuna</span> (formerly, Slide, <span class="loc">Springville</span>) (Wiyot: Vutsuwitk Da'l, "ashes stay") is a city the northeast shore of the <span class="loc">Eel River</span> (approximately 9 miles (14 km) from where it enters the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>), and is on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 101 in western-central <span class="loc">Humboldt County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 11,926 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 10,497 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The settlement was originally called "Slide," for Slide Hill, in <span class="date">1874</span>, named for the slide that was a fixture on the northeast side of the <span class="loc">Eel River</span> and the southwest portion of Christian Ridge just to the northwest, near the edge of town. In <span class="date">1875</span>, the name was changed to <span class="loc">Springville</span> during the construction of the <span class="loc">Springville</span> Mill, a lumber mill for the nearby redwood forests, named so because of the numerous springs in the area. The mill's owners were <span class="per">Henry Rohner</span> (namesake of neighboring <span class="loc">Rohnerville</span>), <span class="per">Alexander Masson</span>, M. N. Weber and <span class="per">G. F. Gushaw</span>. <span class="loc">Springville</span> was originally a company town belonging to the mill, and the few people that resided there all worked at the mill. By the late 1870s <span class="loc">Springville</span> had grown enough to warrant a post office, but a town called <span class="loc">Springville</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> (<span class="date">now</span> part of <span class="loc">Camarillo</span>, in <span class="loc">Ventura County</span>) already existed in the state. The post office was named Slide on <span class="date">May 24, 1876</span>. In <span class="date">1884</span> the residents petitioned the state legislature for the name <span class="loc">Fortuna</span>, Spanish for "fortune" and Latin for "chance," and by <span class="date">July 3, 1888</span> the name was changed to <span class="loc">Fortuna</span>. The name was chosen when settlers saw the proximity of the forests, the river and its valley, and the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>, as ideal for enjoying a good quality of life, and felt "fortunate" to live there. It is believed that a local minister and real estate agent, desiring to sell lots to newcomers, devised the name as a marketing tool.</p><br><br>
