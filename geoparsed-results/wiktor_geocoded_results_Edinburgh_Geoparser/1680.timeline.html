  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Columbia County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 63,096. The county seat is <span class="per">Hudson</span>. The name comes from the Latin feminine form of the name of <span class="per">Christopher Columbus</span>, which was at the time of the formation of the county a popular proposal for the name of the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>. <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Hudson</span>, <span class="loc">NY</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which is also included in the Albany-Schenectady, <span class="org">NY Combined Statistical Area</span>. It is located on the east side of the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>. At the time of European encounter, the area was occupied by the indigenous Mohican Indians. To the west of the river were the <span class="loc">Mohawk</span> and other four tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy, extending past what is <span class="date">now</span> the border of <span class="loc">New York</span> state. The first known European exploration of <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> was in <span class="date">1609</span>, when <span class="per">Henry Hudson</span>, an English explorer sailing for the Dutch, ventured up the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>. An accident to his craft forced him to stop at what is <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Columbia County</span>, and search for food and supplies. In <span class="date">1612</span>, the Dutch established trading posts and minor settlements, constructing <span class="loc">New Amsterdam</span> (<span class="date">today</span> New <span class="loc">York City</span>) and <span class="loc">Fort Orange</span> (<span class="date">today</span> <span class="loc">Albany</span>). <span class="loc">Fort Orange</span> became a center of the fur trade with the <span class="loc">Mohawk</span> people. Traders began to stop at midway points along the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>, on their travels between <span class="loc">New Amsterdam</span> and <span class="loc">Fort Orange</span>. Small settlements arose along the river to supply the traders' ships.</p><br><br>
