<p>Hawking on past - and end of future. PROFESSOR Stephen Hawking will star in a new three-part documentary charting the history of the universe from the Big Bang and his theories on the end of time. The series, commissioned by the Discovery Channel with the working title Stephen Hawking's Universe, is the eminent cosmologist's first major TV project in his specialist area in more than a decade. The 67-year-old, who suffers from motor neurone disease and uses a voice synthesiser to speak, will tackle some of the great mysteries of the cosmos: how the universe began, how it will end, the likelihood of extra-terrestrial life and the possibility of time travel. Prof Hawking said: "This ambitious series explores some of the most fascinating aspects of cosmology and I am pleased to bring these theories to a new audience. "I hope these visions of the universe will evoke a sense of wonder for everyone, and maybe inspire a new generation of cosmologists." The series will use a combination of live action, archive footage, computer-generated images and special effects to bring Hawking's theories to life. Prof Hawking, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, has made huge contributions to the field of cosmology, and particularly the study of black holes, during his career - his best-selling book, A Brief History Of Time, brought the subject to a popular audience. John Ford, the Discovery Channel's president and general manager, said: "We are breaking the mould of documentary film-making and storytelling in Stephen Hawking's Universe. Visualising the universe through one of the greatest minds on the planet is an incredibly challenging prospect." The series will comprise one two-hour and two one-hour shows, and is expected to be broadcast early next year.</p>
