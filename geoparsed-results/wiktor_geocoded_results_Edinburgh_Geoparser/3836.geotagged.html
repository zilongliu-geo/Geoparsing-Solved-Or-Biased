<p><span class="loc">Artas</span> (Arabic: أرطاس‎) is a Palestinian village located four kilometers southwest of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> in the <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span> Governorate in the central <span class="loc">West Bank</span>. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the town had a population of 3,663 in 2007. <span class="loc">Artas</span> and the surrounding area is characterized by the diversity of landscapes, flora and fauna due to its location at a meeting place of ecosystems. From a spring below the village an aqueduct used to carry water to Birket el Hummam by Jebel el <span class="loc">Fureidis</span>. Nasir Khusraw wrote that: "a couple of leagues from <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> is a place where there are four villages, and there is here a spring of water, with numerous gardens and orchards, and it is called Faradis (or the Paradises), on account of the beauty of the spot." According to Moshe Sharon, professor of early Islamic history at Hebrew University, two inscriptions found in the village show the great interest in <span class="loc">Artas</span> from leaders in the Fatimid and Mamluk states, as well as the wealth of the village at that time. During the Crusader era, the village was known as <span class="loc">Artasium</span>, or Iardium Aschas. In 1227, Pope Gregory IX confirmed that the village had been given to the Church of <span class="loc">Bethlehem</span>. Remains of the Crusader Church were torn down in the 19th century.</p>
