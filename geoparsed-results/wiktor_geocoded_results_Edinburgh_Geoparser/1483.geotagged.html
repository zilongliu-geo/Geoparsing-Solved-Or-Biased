As of the 2010 census, its population was 182. It is part of the <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, <span class="loc">MD-WV Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The ZIP code for <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is 26710. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is the home of the Old Fashioned Apple Harvest Festival (started in 1973), which has grown into the biggest celebration of its kind in the Eastern Panhandle of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. It is held annually on the first weekend of October. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is situated along the old Northwestern Turnpike (<span class="loc">US</span> 50) in southeastern <span class="loc">Mineral County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. German and English settlers began to populate the area of <span class="loc">Burlington</span> in the second quarter of the 18th century following the surveying of <span class="loc">Patterson Creek</span> Manor by Thomas, Lord Fairfax in 1738. The village took shape around the turn of the 19th century as several mills constructed along <span class="loc">Mill Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Patterson Creek</span> brought commerce to the region. The Burlington Post Office was established on September 24, 1827. (It was closed from 1844-1853 and from 1860-1867). The construction of the Northwestern Turnpike through <span class="loc">Burlington</span> in 1831 helped to further its development into a regional center for commerce. Many of the houses admired for their architecture in the village today were constructed in the first half of the 19th century during this time of economic prosperity. One of the oldest houses in <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, the Homestead, was built as a tavern to service the stage coach traffic which came through the village along the turnpike. Constructed by John and Ruth Ann Vandiver, the Homestead continued to serve as an inn and restaurant well into the mid-twentieth century.</p>
