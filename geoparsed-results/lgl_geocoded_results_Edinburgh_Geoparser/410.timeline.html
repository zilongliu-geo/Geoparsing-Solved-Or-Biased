But his effort to rebut the federal charges he is facing was undermined by his inability to identify a cell phone number he called or was called from 16 times before, during and after he allegedly robbed <span class="loc">South Philadelphia</span> drug kingpin <span class="per">Ricardo McKendrick Jr.</span> on <span class="date">Dec. 14, 2007</span>. Snell was fired shortly after his arrest in the incident. A federal trial that focused only on the Pottstown home invasion ended with a hung jury in <span class="date">October</span>. Authorities expanded the charges against Snell after <span class="per">McKendrick</span> and other reputed drug dealers agreed to cooperate against him.</p><br><br>
