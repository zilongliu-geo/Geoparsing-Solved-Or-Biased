  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Dalton</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Chariton County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 17 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Dalton</span> is located at 39°23′50″N 92°59′28″W (39.397130, -92.991248). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.18 square miles (0.47 km2), all of it land. <span class="per">Lewis</span> and <span class="per">Clark</span> made camp at what would later be known as the Cut-Off on <span class="date">June 12, 1804</span>, and it was here that the expedition met with Pierre Dorion, a man who had reportedly been with the <span class="loc">Sioux</span> for <span class="date">20 years</span> and was thought to have some influence upon them. The <span class="per">Lewis</span> and <span class="per">Clark</span> journal entry describes the <span class="per">Dalton</span> Cut-Off as connected to the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River by a creek. <span class="date">More than sixty years</span> after the <span class="per">Lewis</span> and <span class="per">Clark</span> Expedition passed through the area—after the end of the Civil War—the village of <span class="per">Dalton</span> was born when the railroad created a need for it. The village was named for <span class="per">William Dalton</span> who had donated the 40 acres (160,000 m2) and a railroad depot was built for the St. Louis &amp; Pacific line. [note: <span class="per">William Dalton</span> was believed to be the grandfather of <span class="loc">Missouri</span>'s sitting governor at the time the village was named, but the contributor has not yet found sources to support that claim.]</p><br><br>
