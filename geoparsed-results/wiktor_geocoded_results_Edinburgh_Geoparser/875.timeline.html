  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Rudnik [ˈrudnik] is a village in Gmina Hażlach, <span class="loc">Cieszyn County</span>, Silesian Voivodeship, southern <span class="loc">Poland</span>. It has a population of 453 (<span class="date">2008</span>). The name of the village is derived from a name of a local stream <span class="loc">Rudnik</span>, mentioned as early as <span class="date">1442</span> (do potoka jmenem Rudnika), which is a transformation of a word rudy, meaning rdzawy (rusty). It lies in the historical region of <span class="per">Cieszyn</span> Silesia. Up to recently it was stated that the village was first mentioned in <span class="date">1566</span> as <span class="loc">Rudnik</span>, however another documents exists issued by Wenceslaus III Adam, <span class="per">Duke of Cieszyn</span> on <span class="date">5 November 1608</span> which retrospectively affirms another document from <span class="date">1523</span> that mentioned the village among others obliged to consume ale produced only in <span class="per">Cieszyn</span>. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of <span class="loc">Teschen</span>, a fee of the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Bohemia</span>, which after <span class="date">1526</span> became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of <span class="per">Cieszyn</span> Silesia in <span class="date">1920</span>, it became a part of <span class="loc">Poland</span>. It was then annexed by <span class="loc">Nazi</span> <span class="loc">Germany</span> at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to <span class="loc">Poland</span>.</p><br><br>
