  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Stockton</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 143 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Salisbury</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Stockton</span>, originally called <span class="loc">Sandy Hill</span>, grew up at the crossing of the post road from <span class="loc">Snow Hill</span> south to Virginia (whose track is generally followed by modern <span class="loc">Maryland</span> Route 12) with the road from <span class="loc">Mattapony</span> Landing on the <span class="loc">Pocomoke</span> River to the <span class="loc">Chincoteague</span> Bay (the eastern part of which is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Maryland</span> Route 366), where small ocean-going vessels could drop anchor. The landing on <span class="loc">Chincoteague</span> Bay came to be known as George Island Landing. Settlement in the area began in the 1660s, when the area was still part of <span class="loc">Somerset County</span>. <span class="loc">Worcester County</span> was separated from <span class="loc">Somerset</span> in <span class="date">1742</span>, and by <span class="date">1774</span> <span class="loc">Sandy Hill</span> had grown large enough to merit a chapel of ease within All Hallows' Parish, <span class="date">today</span> called Holy Cross Chapel. <span class="loc">Sandy Hill</span>, unlike neighboring <span class="loc">Girdletree</span>, was never incorporated, but in <span class="date">1870</span> the name of the town was officially changed, by act of the legislature, from <span class="loc">Sandy Hill</span> to <span class="loc">Stockton</span>. In <span class="date">1872</span> the <span class="loc">Worcester County</span> election district which took its name from <span class="loc">Sandy Hill</span> was renamed <span class="loc">Stockton</span>.</p><br><br>
