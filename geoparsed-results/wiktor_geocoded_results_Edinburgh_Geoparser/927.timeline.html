  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Albany</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,033 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>. It is located on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 127, about 6 miles (10 km) north of the Tennessee border. The community of <span class="loc">Albany</span> grew up around a tavern established by <span class="per">Benjamin Dowell</span> in the early 19th century. In <span class="date">1837</span>, residents voted to make the location the seat of county government. It is generally accepted that the town, formally incorporated on <span class="date">January 27, 1838</span>, was named after <span class="loc">Albany</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, but a local legend holds that, during the vote to determine the location of the county seat, patrons of <span class="per">Dowell</span>'s tavern shouted "All for Benny!", then "all Benny," which led to the town being called <span class="loc">Albany</span>. During the Civil War, <span class="loc">Albany</span> was attacked by Confederate forces, and many buildings, including the courthouse, were burned. A marker in the courthouse square notes that Clinton was the native <span class="loc">county of Civil War</span> terrorist Champion "Champ" <span class="org">Ferguson</span>, hanged after the war for atrocities.</p><br><br>
