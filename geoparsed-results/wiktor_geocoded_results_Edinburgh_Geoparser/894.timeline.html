  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is a town in the far northwestern portion of <span class="loc">Grant Parish</span>. The parish itself is located in north central <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> was 787 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census but dropped by 6 percent to 730 in <span class="date">2010</span>. The town has a poverty rate of 37 percent and a median household income of just under $22,000. The median age is just under forty; the population in <span class="date">2010</span> was 78 percent white. <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Alexandria Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area though it is forty miles north of Alexandria. Founded in <span class="date">1712</span>, even before <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>, <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is situated on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 71 close to the boundary with <span class="per">Natchitoches</span> and <span class="per">Winn</span> parishes. It is located on the eastern bank of the <span class="loc">Red River</span>. In <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> was known as one of the smaller communities in the state which could draw considerable crowds to political gatherings. William J. "Bill" <span class="loc">Dodd</span>, veteran <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> politician, in his memoirs Peapatch Politics: The <span class="per">Earl Long</span> Era in <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> Politics, recalls a <span class="date">1955</span> gathering in which he "eulogized" <span class="per">Huey Long</span>, <span class="per">Earl Long</span>, and attorney general candidate <span class="per">Jack</span> P.F. Gremillion. Dodd satirized <span class="per">Gremillion</span>'s World War II record: "Why he almost got killed himself when an enemy shell plowed into one of his most vital organs; if you don't believe <span class="per">Jack Gremillion</span> earned his Purple Heart, he will show you the scars he has to prove it." The scars were on <span class="per">Gremillion</span>'s rear end, much to the embarrassment of the successful candidate. From <span class="loc">Montgomery</span>, the Long train headed to the parish seat of <span class="loc">Colfax</span>.</p><br><br>
