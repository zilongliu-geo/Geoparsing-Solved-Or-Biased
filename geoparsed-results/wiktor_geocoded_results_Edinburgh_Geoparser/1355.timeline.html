  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Goma</span> is a city in the eastern <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>. It is located on the northern shore of Lake Kivu, next to the Rwandan <span class="loc">city of Gisenyi</span>. The lake and the two cities are in the Albertine Rift, the western branch of the East African Rift system. <span class="loc">Goma</span> lies only 13 to 18 km due south of the crater of the active Nyiragongo Volcano. The recent history of <span class="loc">Goma</span> has been dominated by the volcano and the Rwandan Genocide of <span class="date">1994</span>, which in turn fuelled the First and Second Congo Wars. The aftermath of these events was still having effects on the city and its surroundings in <span class="date">2010</span>. The city was captured by rebels during the M23 rebellion in <span class="date">late 2012</span>, but has since been retaken by government forces. <span class="loc">Goma</span> is capital of <span class="loc">North Kivu province</span>, ethnically and geographically similar to <span class="loc">South Kivu</span> (capital <span class="loc">Bukavu</span>); the two provinces are known as "the Kivus". The Rwandan Genocide of <span class="date">1994</span> was perpetrated by the <span class="loc">Hutu</span>-dominated provisional Rwandan government on the Tutsi population and <span class="loc">Hutu</span> moderates. In response the <span class="org">Rwandan Patriotic Front</span> (RPF), formed by Tutsi refugees in <span class="loc">Uganda</span>, which already controlled large areas of northern <span class="loc">Rwanda</span> following its <span class="date">1990</span> invasion and the ongoing Civil War, overthrew the <span class="loc">Hutu</span> government in <span class="loc">Kigali</span> and forced it to relocate to the border town of <span class="loc">Gisenyi</span>. As the RPF captured ground, thousands of <span class="loc">Hutu</span> refugees fled before it, many ending up in <span class="loc">Gisenyi</span>. Then, from <span class="date">July 13</span> to <span class="date">July 14</span>, <span class="date">1994</span>, 10,000â€“12,000 refugees per hour crossed the border into <span class="loc">Goma</span> as the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> refugee crisis took shape. The massive influx created a severe humanitarian crisis, as there was an acute lack of shelter, food and water. Shortly after the arrival of nearly one million refugees, a deadly cholera outbreak claimed thousands of lives in the <span class="loc">Hutu</span> refugee camps around <span class="loc">Goma</span>.</p><br><br>
