<p><span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a county located in east central <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 34,273. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Chandler. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Oklahoma City</span>, <span class="loc">OK Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. In 2010, the center of population of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> was located in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, near the town of Sparks. The <span class="loc">United States</span> purchased the large tract of land known as the Louisiana Purchase from <span class="loc">France</span> in 1803. Washington Irving, Charles J. Latrobe, and Count Albert de Pourtal√®s accompanied Henry L. Ellsworth and others on an expedition in Indian Territory that may have passed through the far northwestern corner of the future <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>. The <span class="loc">Osage</span> hunted on land that includes present-day <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> until they ceded the area in an 1825 treaty to the federal government. The government then assigned the land to the Creek and the Seminoles after they were removed from the southeastern <span class="loc">United States</span>. After the Civil War in 1866, these tribes were forced to give up lands that included present-day <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> in Reconstruction Treaties for siding with the Confederacy. The federal government then used the area to resettle the Sac and Fox, Potawatomi, Kickapoo and Ioway tribes. Established in 1870, the Sac and Fox agency, established on the eastern edge of the present-day county, was the first settlement in the area.</p>
