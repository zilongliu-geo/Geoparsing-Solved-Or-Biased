<p><span class="loc">Warren County</span> is a county located in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 212,693. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>. The county was erected May 1, 1803, from <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span>, and named for Dr. Joseph Warren, a hero of the Revolution who sent Paul Revere on his ride and who died at the Battle of <span class="loc">Bunker Hill</span>. <span class="loc">Warren County</span> is part of the Cincinnati-Middletown, <span class="loc">OH-KY-IN Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Along with <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, <span class="loc">Warren County</span> comprises the geographical center of the <span class="loc">Cincinnati-Dayton Metropolitan</span> Region, home to 3.3 million and the 14th most populous in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. This is the key factor to the county's rapid suburban growth. <span class="loc">Warren County</span> was created by the first Ohio General Assembly in the Act of March 24, 1803, which also created Butler and Montgomery Counties. The act defined <span class="loc">Warren County</span> as "all that part of the <span class="loc">county of Hamilton</span> included within the following bounds, viz.: Beginning at the northeast corner of the <span class="loc">county of Clermont</span>, running thence west with the line of said county to the <span class="loc">Little Miami</span>; thence up the same with the meanders thereof to the north boundary of the first tier of sections in the second entire range of townships in the Miami Purchase; thence west to the northeast corner of Section No. 7 in the third township of the aforesaid range; thence north to the Great Miami; thence up the same to the middle of the fifth range of townships; thence east to the County line; thence with same south to the place of beginning." Originally this included land now in <span class="loc">Clinton County</span> as far east as <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>.</p>
