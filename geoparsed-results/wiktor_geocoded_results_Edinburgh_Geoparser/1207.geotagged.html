The population was 13,074 at the 2010 census. It is an eastern suburb of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>. <span class="loc">Bedford</span> is located at 41°23′33″N 81°32′04″W.

The area was originally marked as Lot 46 of the Western Reserve Survey and after the survey it was labeled as Range II Township 6 which would eventually become <span class="loc">Bedford</span> Township. The area attracted many enterprising settlers as it had both an abundance of hardwood forests and Tinkers Creek, which had waterfalls that were conducive for building mills. The first settlers to the area started to arrive in 1813. In 1816, the Taylor Chair Company was created by Benjamin Franklin <span class="loc">Fitch</span> along the banks of Tinkers Creek. The original workshop site was located at the corners of Libby Rd and Warrensville-Center Rd in <span class="loc">Bedford</span>, <span class="loc">Oh</span>. The company is still in existence today and is considered to be the longest running, single family owned company in the <span class="loc">US</span>.</p>
