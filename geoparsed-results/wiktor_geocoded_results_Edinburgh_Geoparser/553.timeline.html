  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hastings</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Wetzel County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies at an elevation of 755 feet (230 m). <span class="per">I Hastings</span> was established as a company town by the Hope Natural Gas Company in the early part of the 20th century. With a population of several hundred people who lived in as many as fifty company houses, the community also had a church, a school, a company store, an athletic field, a post office, and a community hall. The community had indoor athletic facilities for basketball, table tennis and billiards, and it also served as a theater. A hotel in the community was used by company employees who traveled to the site to perform maintenance and other tasks. <span class="per">Hastings</span> was named for <span class="per">Dennis Hastings</span>, the first superintendent of the original natural gas processing plant on site. It was a thriving community into <span class="date">the late 1960s</span> when they baby boomers began to graduate from high school and their parents and grandparents began retiring and moving away. Nowadays it is a virtual ghost town with only two company houses remaining.</p><br><br>
