<p><span class="loc">Sopo</span> is a civil parish in the municipality of <span class="loc">Vila Nova de Cerveira</span> in the Portuguese northern district of <span class="loc">Viana do Castelo</span>. The population in 2011 was 557, in an area of 14.82 kmÂ². References from 1258 identify the existence of several churches situated between the <span class="loc">Lima</span> and <span class="loc">Minho Rivers</span>, and that one of these churches, named <span class="loc">Zopo</span>, belonged to the Bishop of Tui. By the beginning of the 16th century, the <span class="loc">parish of Sopo</span> was part of the Archdiocese of <span class="loc">Braga</span> and belonged to the municipality of Caminha; comparably, <span class="loc">Sopo</span> was part of this municipality by 1546. A 1580 census completed by friar Baltasar Limpo, in order to determine the condition of the deaconship, referred to the <span class="loc">parish of Santiago</span> de <span class="loc">Sopo</span> within the comarca of Caminha, an area that was divided between the clergy of the archbishop and other lay clergy. Archbishop D. Diogo de Sousa confirmed a donation to <span class="loc">Sopo</span>, completed by several people to the Marquis of Vila Real. The Marquis, later, transferred the patronage of <span class="loc">Sopo</span> to his son, the Duke of Caminha, who was, along with his father, implicated in the conspiracy against John IV.</p>
