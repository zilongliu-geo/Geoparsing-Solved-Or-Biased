<p><span class="loc">Masaka</span> is a town in Central <span class="loc">Uganda</span>, lying west of <span class="loc">Lake Victoria</span>. It is the chief town of <span class="loc">Masaka District</span>. Besides being the headquarters of <span class="loc">Masaka District</span>, the town is the regional headquarters and largest metropolitan area in the <span class="loc">districts of Lyantonde</span>, <span class="loc">Sembabule</span>, <span class="loc">Lwengo</span>, <span class="loc">Bukomansimbi</span>, <span class="loc">Kalungu</span>, <span class="loc">Masaka</span>, <span class="loc">Rakai</span>, and <span class="loc">Kalangala</span>. <span class="loc">Masaka</span> lies approximately 140 kilometres (87 mi) to the southwest of <span class="loc">Kampala</span>, on the highway to <span class="loc">Mbarara</span>. The town lies very close to the Equator, as can be seen from the latitude values. It was <span class="loc">Uganda</span>'s second-biggest town for a long time. Today this status has changed, as the city was largely destroyed in the Uganda-Tanzania War of 1979 and again in the 1981-1986 civil war that removed <span class="loc">Obote</span> from power for the last time. The coordinates of the town are:0°20'28.0"S, 31°44'10.0"E (Latitude:-0.341111; Longitude:31.736111). According to the 2002 national census, the population of <span class="loc">Masaka</span> was about 67,800. In 2010, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), estimated the population of the town at 73,300. In 2011, UBOS estimated the mid-year population of <span class="loc">Masaka</span> at 74,100. In August 2014, the national population census put <span class="loc">Masaka</span>'s population at 103,829.</p>
