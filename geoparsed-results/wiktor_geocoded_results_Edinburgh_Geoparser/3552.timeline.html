  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lazo</span> (Лазо́ ) is a village in the Russian Maritime Province of Primorsky Krai in the Russian <span class="loc">Far</span> East. The village was founded and named Monomakh Slobidka (Мономахова Слободка) in <span class="date">1907</span> by settlers from <span class="loc">Bryansk</span> and <span class="loc">Chernihiv</span>. In <span class="date">1933</span> it was renamed Vangou (Вангоу). On <span class="date">26 August 1949</span>, by a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the village was renamed again, <span class="date">now</span> becoming <span class="per">Lazo</span> (Лазо) in honour of the revolutionary hero <span class="per">Sergey Lazo</span> (<span class="date">1894</span> - <span class="date">1920</span>). At the same time the <span class="loc">Sokolov District</span> in <span class="loc">Primorski Krai</span> was renamed as the "<span class="loc">Lazovsky District</span>". On <span class="date">2 July 2007</span> the administrative head office for the "<span class="org">Call of the Tiger</span>" National Park was established in <span class="per">Lazo</span>, at <span class="loc">Lenin</span> Street 23. <span class="per">Lazo</span> hit the headlines internationally at <span class="date">the end of 2005</span> when it was reported that a stray dog was killed by squirrels in a <span class="per">Lazo</span> park. The dog had barked at the squirrels who were alleged to be in a state of heightened frustration due to the absence, <span class="date">that year</span>, of pine cones in the trees.</p><br><br>
