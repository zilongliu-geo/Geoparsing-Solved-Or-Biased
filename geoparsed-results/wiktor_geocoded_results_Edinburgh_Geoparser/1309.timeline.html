As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 50,976. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Bartlesville. Named for President <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, it is the smallest county in <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> in total area, adjacent to the largest county in <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Osage County</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> comprises the Bartlesville, OK <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which is also included in the Tulsa-Muskogee-Bartlesville, OK Combined Statistical Area. It is located along the border with <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. The <span class="loc">Osage</span> ceded their land claims in <span class="date">1825</span>, and the Federal Government allowed the Western <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> to settle in this area in <span class="date">1828</span>. The <span class="date">1835</span> Treaty of <span class="loc">New Echota</span> confirmed <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> ownership of the land. The area <span class="date">now</span> covered by <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was part of the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> Saline District between <span class="date">1840</span> to <span class="date">1856</span> and the <span class="loc">Cooweescoowee District</span> from <span class="date">1856</span> to <span class="date">1906</span>. The first post office was established in <span class="date">1859</span> at the confluence of <span class="loc">Butler Creek</span> and the <span class="loc">Caney River</span> by James L. Butler. Known as Little Verdigris, the settlement also had a trading post and a school. The Civil War caused most of the inhabitants to move away and the post office closed in <span class="date">1866</span>. In <span class="date">1867</span>, the Cherokees sold 157,600 acres to the Eastern <span class="loc">Delaware</span></p><br><br>
