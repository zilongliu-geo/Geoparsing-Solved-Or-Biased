  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Chandler</span> is an abandoned townsite between <span class="loc">Merredin</span> and <span class="loc">Mukinbudin</span> in the <span class="loc">Wheatbelt region</span> of Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Initially established to serve the nearby <span class="loc">Alunite</span>, a source of potash, mine at nearby <span class="loc">Lake Campion</span>, land was set aside in <span class="date">1942</span> for a townsite. Lots were surveyed soon afterward and the town was gazetted in <span class="date">1943</span>. The mine was a state government project with government employees that was needed following the supplies of the mineral being cut off after the commencement of World War II. A potash works was erected in the town reserve in <span class="date">1943</span>. Following the war, the government closed down the plant once supply of <span class="loc">Alunite</span> had normalised. The company, Australian Plaster Industries, then took up a lease in the area and in <span class="date">1949</span> commenced production of gypsum that is used in the manufacture of plaster of paris and plasterboard. During that time, the town boomed and had two main streets, over 70 houses, a telephone exchange, a school and powerhouse. Production ceased in <span class="date">1952</span>; the entire town was sold off in <span class="date">1953</span>. The name of the town was chosen to honour <span class="per">Mr J Chandler</span>, a farmer, who had discovered the alunite deposits.</p><br><br>
