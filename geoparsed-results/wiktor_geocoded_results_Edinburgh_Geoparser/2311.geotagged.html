Hoysala empire: Early inscriptions, dated 1078 and 1090, have implied that the Hoysalas were ancestors of the Yadava by referring to the Yadava vamsa (clan) as Hoysala vamsa. But there are no early records directly linking the Hoysalas to the Yadavas of <span class="loc">North India</span>. The downfall of Hoysala resulted in the rise of another super power. <span class="loc">Manki</span> later fell into the hands of the Vijayanagara Empire.</p>
