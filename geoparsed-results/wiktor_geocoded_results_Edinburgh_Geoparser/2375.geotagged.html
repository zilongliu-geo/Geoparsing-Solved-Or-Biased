<p><span class="loc">Hala</span> (Sindhi: هـالا‎) is a city and taluka of <span class="loc">Matiari district</span> of <span class="loc">Sindh</span>, <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>. According to the Revenue record, <span class="loc">Hala</span> was given the status of Taluka in 1848. <span class="loc">Hala</span> became a leading centre of the Suhrawardi sect of Sufism from the 16th century onwards. It contains the mausoleum of Makhdum Nuh (died circa 1592), a Suhrawardi Pir, which attracts pilgrims. <span class="loc">Hala</span> has a rich Sindhi culture. Men clad themselves in a traditional Shalwar Kameez having broader bottoms and traditional Sindhi cap, previously in <span class="loc">Hala</span>, common wear for women was Gharara or 'Parro' with bangles all the way up till shoulders but now a days this type of wear is in countryside not on the <span class="loc">city of Hala</span>. Presently women at their homes wear Shalwar Kamiz with a Dupatta over their heads and out in town they prefer to wear Burqas in public. Clogging road-side tea-stalls with colleagues and friends, is a favorite pastime for Halai men. The Hala baazar is a famous bazaar where people from many cities go for shopping.Hala is also famous for its handicraft like Ajrak, Soosi, <span class="loc">Khadi</span>, <span class="loc">Jhandi</span> and <span class="loc">Kashi</span>.</p>
