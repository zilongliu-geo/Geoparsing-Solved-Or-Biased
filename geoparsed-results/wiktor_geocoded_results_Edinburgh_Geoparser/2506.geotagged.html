<p><span class="loc">Detroit</span> (pronounced "dee-troit" by local residents) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Dickinson County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 114. It was named after <span class="loc">Detroit</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. In the early years of the county, <span class="loc">Detroit</span> was once strongly considered to be the county seat because <span class="loc">Abilene</span> was considered to be "too wild" of a town to serve as a center of government. However, <span class="loc">Abilene</span> became the county seat and <span class="loc">Detroit</span> ceased to grow from that point forward. A post office was opened in <span class="loc">Detroit</span> in 1866, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1961. <span class="loc">Detroit</span> was a station on the Union Pacific Railroad. <span class="loc">Detroit</span> is located halfway between <span class="loc">Abilene</span> and <span class="loc">Chapman</span>, 2 miles (3 km) north of Enterprise. The town is at an elevation of 1,147 feet (350 m) above sea level. <span class="loc">Detroit</span> is a "square" town, two blocks long and two blocks wide. The three north-south streets are Main, Middle, and School. The three east-west streets are First, Second, and Third. There are no more streets in <span class="loc">Detroit</span>. All six streets are unpaved.</p>
