  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bardejov</span> ( pronunciation ; German: <span class="loc">Bartfeld</span>, Hungarian: Bártfa, Rusyn: Бардеёв, Polish: Bardiów) is a town in North-Eastern <span class="loc">Slovakia</span>. It is situated in the Šariš region on a floodplain terrace of the Topľa River, in the hills of the <span class="loc">Beskyd</span> Mountains. It exhibits numerous cultural monuments in its completely intact medieval town center. The town is one of <span class="org">UNESCO's World Heritage Sites</span> and currently maintains a population of about 30,000 inhabitants. The territory of present-day <span class="loc">Bardejov</span> has attracted settlers since the Stone Age. Traces of human settlements in <span class="loc">Bardejov</span> can be traced back to around 20,000 B.C. However, the first written reference to the town dates back to <span class="date">1247</span>, when monks from <span class="loc">Bardejov</span> complained to <span class="per">King Béla IV</span> about a violation of the town’s borders by Prešov, a neighbouring city. There is mention of German settlers coming up from Prešov in these records as well. The city is mentioned in Hypatian Codex for <span class="date">1240</span> when in the fall Daniel of <span class="loc">Galicia</span> passed it traveling from <span class="loc">Hungary</span> to <span class="loc">Poland</span>. In <span class="date">1320</span>, <span class="per">King Charles Robert</span> granted the settlers extensive city privileges and the town speedily began to grow. The main business of the people was trade, farming and crafts. <span class="loc">Bardejov</span> was a convenient center of trade due to its location on the road between the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> and the <span class="loc">Baltic Sea</span>. In <span class="date">1352</span>, the town was granted the privilege to set up an annual fair (jarmok) dedicated to St. Aegidius on <span class="date">September 1</span>. The deed mentions a new construction of the town of <span class="loc">Bardejov</span> with an order by <span class="per">King Louis I</span> to fortify it.[1] The entire defensive circuit was completed, with three gates on the main routes and bastions at strategic points.[2] In <span class="date">1376</span>, the <span class="per">King Ladislaus I</span> granted <span class="loc">Bardejov</span> the status of a free royal town. More than 50 guilds controlled the flourishing economy. Zigmund of <span class="loc">Luxemburg</span> granted the town storage privileges in <span class="date">1402</span>, for the goods brought here by the Russian and Polish merchants. Bardejov merchants were also free to travel across the entire country as far as <span class="loc">Dalmatia</span> without paying duty or royal taxes. There was a second phase of fortification between <span class="date">1420</span> and <span class="date">1474</span>.</p><br><br>
