<p><span class="loc">Penglai</span> (simplified Chinese: 蓬莱; traditional Chinese: 蓬萊; pinyin: Pénglái), is a port, county-level city and an administrative subdivision of the prefecture-level city <span class="loc">Yantai</span> in <span class="loc">Shandong Province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, on the northeastern (Bohai Sea) coast of the province. The port was formerly called <span class="loc">Dengzhou</span> (Chinese: 登州; pinyin: Dēngzhōu; Wade–Giles: Teng1-chou1). Penglai Water City or Water Fortress (Chinese: 水城; pinyin: Shuíchéng), a fortified harbor hidden from the sea, is one of <span class="loc">China</span>'s oldest military ports, built in 1376 under the Ming Dynasty and is a protected historical monument. It was "the harbor for the fleet of imperial war junks and town for the semi-imperial garrison."  The Water City is currently being rebuilt at a cost of 500 million yuan (more than 60 million dollars). There is a plank walk along the cliffs nearby. <span class="loc">Penglai</span> is the northernmost part of mainland <span class="loc">Yantai</span> and located in central <span class="loc">Yantai City</span>. Except for the Bohai Sea to the north, <span class="loc">Penglai</span> is entirely surrounded by other divisions of <span class="loc">Yantai</span>: <span class="loc">Fushan District</span> is to the east, <span class="loc">Longkou City</span> to the west, and <span class="loc">Qixia City</span> to the south. Its limits in geographic coordinates are 37° 25'–37° 50' N, 120° 35'–121° 09' E.</p>
