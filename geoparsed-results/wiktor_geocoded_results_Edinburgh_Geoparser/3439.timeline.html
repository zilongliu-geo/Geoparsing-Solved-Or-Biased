  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Sterling</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Whiteside County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 15,370 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 15,451 in <span class="date">2000</span>. Formerly nicknamed "<span class="org">The Hardware Capital of the World</span>", <span class="per">Sterling</span> has long been associated with manufacturing and the steel industry. <span class="per">Sterling</span> is located along the north bank of the <span class="loc">Rock River</span> opposite its twin city of <span class="loc">Rock Falls</span>. The terrain is mostly flat. The land immediately outside of town is almost entirely farmland. The prairie soil is part of one of the world's most fertile growing areas. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, <span class="per">Sterling</span> has a total area of 5.943 square miles (15.39 km2), of which 5.71 square miles (14.79 km2) (or 96.08%) is land and 0.233 square miles (0.60 km2) (or 3.92%) is water.

In <span class="date">1838</span>, the small towns of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> and <span class="loc">Chatham</span> combined to become the Town of <span class="per">Sterling</span> in an effort to attract the county seat. The name "<span class="per">Sterling</span>" was bestowed to the new town in honor of <span class="per">Major James Sterling</span>, who distinguished himself in the area during the <span class="org">Blackhawk War</span> in <span class="date">1832</span>. On <span class="date">February 16, 1857</span> <span class="per">Sterling</span> was incorporated as a city by state law.</p><br><br>
