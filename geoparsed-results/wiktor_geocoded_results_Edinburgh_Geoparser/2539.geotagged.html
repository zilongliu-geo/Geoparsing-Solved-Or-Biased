<p><span class="loc">Tabuk</span> is a city and the capital of the <span class="loc">province of Kalinga</span> in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 103,912 people. It borders with the town of <span class="loc">Pinukpuk</span> in the north and the town of <span class="loc">Rizal</span> in the north-east. On its westernmost section it shares border with the towns of <span class="loc">Pasil</span> and <span class="loc">Lubuagan</span>. On the south-west it borders with the town of <span class="loc">Tanudan</span>. <span class="loc">Tabuk City</span> is a border <span class="loc">city of Kalinga</span> with the <span class="loc">provinces of Isabela</span> and <span class="loc">Mountain Province</span>. In the east, it is bordered by the town of Quezon, Isabela, which is about 20 kilometers from the city center and the town of <span class="loc">Paracelis</span>, <span class="loc">Mountain Province</span>, to the south. The former municipal <span class="loc">district of Tabuk</span> was transformed into a regular municipality by Republic Act No. 533, approved June 16, 1950. During the 11th Congress (1998–2001), Congress enacted into law 33 bills converting 33 municipalities into cities. However, Congress did not act on a further 24 bills converting 24 other municipalities into cities. During the 12th Congress (2001–2004), Congress enacted into law Republic Act No. 9009 (RA 9009), which took effect on 30 June 2001. RA 9009 amended Section 450 of the Local Government Code by increasing the annual income requirement for conversion of a municipality into a city from ₱20 million to ₱100 million. The rationale for the amendment was to restrain, in the words of Senator Aquilino Pimentel, "the mad rush" of municipalities to convert into cities solely to secure a larger share in the Internal Revenue Allotment despite the fact that they are incapable of fiscal independence.</p>
