The locals that settled the town at its inception were ethnically of a mixed population but as the city experienced its worst ethnic riots between Sindhis and Muhajirs in the 1980s, the city was divided into Sindhi settling the town of <span class="loc">Qasimabad</span> and the Mohajirs settling down in <span class="loc">Latifabad</span>.

The land in <span class="loc">Latifabad</span> was further divided into sectors, sub-classifying it into numbered units.
