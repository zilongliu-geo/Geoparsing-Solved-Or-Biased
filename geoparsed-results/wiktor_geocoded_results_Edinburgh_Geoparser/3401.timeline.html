  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Strand is a district in Bærum, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. Mainly a residential area, it is also known as a marine recreational site, owing to its proximity to the <span class="loc">Oslofjord</span>. The district is located <span class="loc">west of Stabekk</span> and <span class="loc">Fornebulandet</span> and east of Høvik. To the south is <span class="loc">Holtekilen</span>, an arm of the <span class="loc">Oslofjord</span>. It has its name from the cotter's farm Strandbakken, which for <span class="date">many years</span> belonged to the farm Store Stabekk. In <span class="date">1886</span> Strandbakken was bought by barrister Henrik Homan, who built a villa there. The villa was bought by Bærum municipality in <span class="date">1924</span>, and became the well-known Strand Restaurant. The surrounding area was developed into a park (Strandparken) and a small boat harbor. Strand Restaurant is currently administered by the sailing club Bærum SF. Boat traffic to nearby islands was discontinued in <span class="date">the 1960s</span>. The canoeing club Strand KK, founded <span class="date">1936</span>, has its name from the district, but <span class="date">today</span> their base is at Høvik. A small tennis club founded in <span class="date">1975</span>, Strand TK, is based in Strandparken. The area north of Strand Restaurant was parcelled out in the early twentieth century, and was mostly built with villas. At eastern Strand, near Holtet farm, the Stabekk river emptied into <span class="loc">Holtekilen</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, most of the Stabekk Watershed has been led underground through a pipe system, and the waterway is no longer visible. In the early 2000s the district has been subject a number of controversial building cases.</p><br><br>
