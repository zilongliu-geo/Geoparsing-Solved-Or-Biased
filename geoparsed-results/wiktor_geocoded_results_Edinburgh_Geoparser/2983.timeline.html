  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wayne County</span> is the westernmost county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 42,481. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="per">Wayne</span>. The county was founded in <span class="date">1842</span> and named for General "Mad" <span class="per">Anthony Wayne</span>. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> is part of the Huntington-Ashland, <span class="loc">WV-KY-OH Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which is also included in the Charleston-Huntington-Ashland, WV-OH-KY Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> was originally <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, which was created from part of <span class="loc">Cabell County</span> in <span class="date">1842</span>. The county was named for General "Mad" <span class="per">Anthony Wayne</span>. There was no white settlement in the area that became <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> until after <span class="date">1794</span>, due to the constant threat of Indian attack. The area was made safe for white settlement in <span class="date">1794</span> through the defeat of the <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> at the Battle of <span class="loc">Fallen Timbers</span> by General "Mad" <span class="per">Anthony Wayne</span>. When the first permanent European settlers came to <span class="loc">Wayne County</span> around the <span class="date">year 1800</span>, the area was part of <span class="loc">Kanawha County</span>. Most of the original pioneer settlers were self-sufficient farmers. They raised their own food, sheep for wool clothing, and made their buildings, furnishings and tools out of the surrounding forest. A few trading posts provided the manufactured goods the pioneers could not make for themselves. Later, grist mills at <span class="per">Wayne</span>, <span class="loc">Dickson</span>, south of <span class="loc">East Lynn</span> and at <span class="loc">Lavalette</span> ground their corn into meal and their wheat into flour.</p><br><br>
