  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Santa Barbara</span> (Spanish for "<span class="loc">Saint Barbara</span>") is the county seat of Santa <span class="loc">Barbara County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. Situated on a south-facing section of coastline, the longest such section on the West Coast of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, the city lies between the steeply rising <span class="loc">Santa Ynez Mountains</span> and the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. <span class="loc">Santa Barbara</span>'s climate is often described as Mediterranean, and the city has been promoted as the "American <span class="loc">Riviera</span>". As of <span class="date">2014</span>, the city had an estimated population of 91,196, up from 88,410 in <span class="date">2010</span>, making it the second most populous city in the county after <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> while the contiguous urban area, which includes the <span class="loc">cities of Goleta and Carpinteria</span>, along with the unincorporated regions of <span class="loc">Isla Vista</span>, <span class="loc">Montecito</span>, Mission Canyon, Hope Ranch, <span class="loc">Summerland</span>, and others, has an approximate population of 220,000. The population of the entire county in <span class="date">2010</span> was 423,895. In addition to being a popular tourist and resort destination, the city economy includes a large service sector, education, technology, health care, finance, agriculture, manufacturing, and local government. In <span class="date">2004</span>, the service sector accounted for fully 35% of local employment. Education in particular is well represented, with five institutions of higher learning on the south coast (the <span class="org">University of California</span>, <span class="loc">Santa Barbara</span>, Santa <span class="loc">Barbara City</span> College, <span class="org">Westmont College</span>, <span class="org">Antioch University</span>, and the Brooks Institute of Photography). The <span class="loc">Santa Barbara</span> Airport serves the city, as does Amtrak. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 101 connects the <span class="loc">Santa Barbara</span> area with <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> to the southeast and <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> to the northwest. Behind the city, in and beyond the <span class="loc">Santa Ynez Mountains</span>, is the Los Padres National Forest, which contains several remote wilderness areas. Channel Islands National Park and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary are located approximately 20 miles (32 km) offshore.</p><br><br>
