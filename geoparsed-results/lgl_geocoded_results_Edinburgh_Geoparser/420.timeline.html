  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Man, 80, dies after being run over in lot outside grocery store. An 80-year-old man died <span class="date">yesterday</span> in the parking lot of a <span class="loc">Westmoreland County</span> Italian grocery store when a car driven by an 82-year-old woman backed out of handicapped parking space and ran him over. The accident happened in the parking lot at DeLallo Italian Marketplace along Route 30 in <span class="loc">Hempfield</span>. The man, whom police did not immediately identify pending notification of relatives, was pronounced dead at the scene of accident, which was reported at 9:38 a.m. State police said the driver, <span class="per">Theresa Pilkington</span> of <span class="loc">Jeannette</span>, was taken to <span class="org">Westmoreland Hospital</span> after growing distraught after the accident. "She's not injured but she is emotionally shaken up," <span class="loc">Westmoreland County</span> Deputy Coroner <span class="per">Gerry Fritz</span> said. While backing up her car to leave the parking lot, she told police, she spotted a man in her review mirror who was approaching the store entrance. She said she applied the brakes but then stepped on the accelerator again when she no longer could see him behind her vehicle. Her car plowed through three concrete planters before clipping the poles holding up an entranceway awning, causing it to collapse onto her car. At some point, she hit the man, trapping him under the car. Emergency crews had to use jacks to support the damaged awning to prevent further collapse as they worked to free the victim from underneath the car. DeLallo's remained open <span class="date">yesterday</span>, although customers had to use a rear entrance.</p><br><br>
