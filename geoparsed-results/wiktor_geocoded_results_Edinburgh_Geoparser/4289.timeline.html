  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kirkwood</span> is a town in the Eastern Cape Province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It is situated on the banks of the <span class="loc">Sundays River</span> in the eponymously named <span class="loc">Sundays River</span> Valley, which forms part of the <span class="loc">Sundays River</span> Valley Municipality in the <span class="per">Sarah Baartman</span> District Municipality of the Eastern Cape. <span class="loc">Kirkwood</span> is situated about 80 km (50 mi) from the <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span> and about 100 meters (330 ft) above sea level. The South <span class="org">African Weather Service</span> recorded a temperature of 50.3 °C (122.5 °F) in <span class="loc">Kirkwood</span> in <span class="date">1928</span> - the highest temperature ever recorded in <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. To the north of <span class="loc">Kirkwood</span> are the <span class="loc">Rietberg</span> Mountains with the Uyepoort (Uye Gateway), which provides passage to the <span class="loc">Zuurberg Mountains</span> and the <span class="loc">Addo Elephant National Park</span>. The Governor of the <span class="loc">Cape Colony</span>, <span class="per">Sir John Francis Cradock</span>, gave the first farms in the <span class="loc">Sundays River</span> Valley to the leaders of the successful burger commandos for their role in the victories in the border wars of <span class="date">1811</span> and <span class="date">1812</span>. These farms were awarded to Magistrate Cuyler (originally from the <span class="loc">United States</span>) of <span class="loc">Uitenhage</span>, who received <span class="loc">Geelhoutboom</span> (Yellow Tree, later <span class="loc">Dunbrody</span>); Commandant <span class="per">Ignatius Muller</span>, who received Klaaskraal (Klaas' Corral, situated just outside what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Kirkwood</span>) and Field Cornet J.S. van <span class="loc">Niekerk</span>, who received Gouwernements Belooning (Government's Reward). It is on the latter farm that <span class="loc">Kirkwood</span> would be established <span class="date">many decades later</span>.</p><br><br>
