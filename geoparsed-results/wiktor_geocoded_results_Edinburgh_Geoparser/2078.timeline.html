  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, is a ghost town in Santa <span class="loc">Clara County</span>, <span class="date">now</span> submerged by the <span class="loc">Lexington</span> Reservoir. Originally located along <span class="loc">Los Gatos</span> Creek, the town was 550 feet above sea level. <span class="per">Lexington</span> started out as a sawmill built in <span class="date">1848</span> by <span class="per">Isaac Branham</span> and <span class="per">Julian Jank</span>. Zachariah "Buffalo" <span class="loc">Jones</span> bought the mill for $3000 and laid out a town called "<span class="loc">Jones</span> Mill". In <span class="date">1860</span> <span class="per">John P. Hennings</span> bought some of the property and changed the name to <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, after his home town of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. <span class="per">Lexington</span> was a stop on the stagecoach route from <span class="loc">Los Gatos</span> to <span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span>. In the 1860s, the saw mills moved up into the hills and <span class="per">Lexington</span> began to lose importance. In <span class="date">1880</span>, a narrow gauge railroad from <span class="loc">Los Gatos</span> to <span class="loc">Santa Cruz</span> was completed, bypassing <span class="per">Lexington</span> and accelerating its decline; its post office had already been transferred to <span class="per">Alma</span>, a mile south, where the trains stopped and which was the transfer point to stagecoaches until the line was completed. The railroad ceased operations in <span class="date">March 1940</span>, following major damage by a <span class="date">winter</span> storm and the completion of State Route 17 that same year. When the <span class="loc">Lexington</span> Reservoir was created in <span class="date">1952</span>, both <span class="per">Lexington</span> and <span class="per">Alma</span> were officially abandoned and SR 17 was rerouted to its present location. The visible ruins under <span class="loc">Lexington</span> Reservoir are actually those of <span class="per">Alma</span>, not <span class="per">Lexington</span>; building foundations and original pavements of roads are sometimes visible during droughts.</p><br><br>
