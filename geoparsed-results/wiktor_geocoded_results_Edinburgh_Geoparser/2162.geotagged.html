<p><span class="loc">Florence</span> (O'odham: S-auppag) is a town, sixty-one miles southeast of Phoenix, in the <span class="loc">Pinal County</span> of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Florence</span>, which is the county seat of <span class="loc">Pinal County</span>, is one of the oldest towns in that county and is regarded as a National Historic District with over 25 buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The population of <span class="loc">Florence</span> was 25,536 at the 2010 census. The area where the current town of <span class="loc">Florence</span> is located was once inhabited by the members of the Athabascans, ancestors of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Prior to the establishment of the town, the <span class="loc">Gila River</span> served as a part of the border between the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. In 1853, the <span class="loc">Gadsden Purchase</span> extended American territory well south of the <span class="loc">Gila</span>. Levi Ruggles, a veteran of the American Civil War founded the town of <span class="loc">Florence</span>, on the southern boundary of the <span class="loc">Gila River</span>. He came to <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Territory in 1866 as a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Indian Agent. Recognizing the agricultural potential of the valley, he found an easily fordable crossing on the <span class="loc">Gila River</span> and surveyed a townsite there. With the aid of Governor R.C. McCormick, he secured a post office in August of the same year. Ruggles held numerous public offices including that of Territorial Legislator. <span class="loc">Florence</span> became the government seat of <span class="loc">Pinal County</span> Courthouse in the newly formed <span class="loc">Pinal County</span> and silver was discovered at the Silver King Mine in 1875.</p>
