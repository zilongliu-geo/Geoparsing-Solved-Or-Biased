  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,709 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place <span class="loc">Oxford</span>, please see the article <span class="loc">Oxford</span> (CDP), <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1686</span> and was officially incorporated in <span class="date">1713</span>. It was the birthplace of <span class="loc">Clara Barton</span>, the first president and founder of the <span class="loc">American Red Cross</span>. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was originally settled by Huguenots in two waves, the original settlement having been abandoned after four residents (<span class="per">John Johnson</span> and his three children, <span class="per">Peter, Andrew</span> and <span class="per">Mary</span>) were killed in a violent confrontation with local Native Americans. This event, the <span class="per">Johnson</span> Massacre, is commemorated near the south end of town on Main Street. The remains of the <span class="loc">Huguenot</span> Fort (built in <span class="date">1686</span>) still exist off <span class="loc">Huguenot</span> Road. The first town clerk of <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was <span class="per">John Town</span>, who also served as selectman and as a church deacon. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 27.5 square miles (71 km2), of which 26.6 square miles (69 km2) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.3 km2), or 3.20%, is water. The town sits in a valley, and much of its area lies in the flood plain of the <span class="loc">French River</span>, which runs through the town. A substantial parcel north and west of <span class="loc">Oxford</span> Center is held, for flood control purposes, by the <span class="org">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</span>. The land, known as <span class="loc">Greenbriar</span>, also serves as a nature preserve.</p><br><br>
