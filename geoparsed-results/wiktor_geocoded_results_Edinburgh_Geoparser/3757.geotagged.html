<p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 9,487. The county seat is <span class="loc">Mount Ida</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>'s 45th county, formed on December 9, 1842, and named after Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general. Stone spear and dart points found in the area verify that people from the Dalton Culture were present in <span class="loc">Mongomery County</span> around 8500 BC. Early signs of houses and American Indian cemeteries are present in and around <span class="loc">Caddo Gap</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, indicating the definite presence of the Caddo Indians having settled in the area in the 13th century and 14th century. In 1541, the explorer Hernando de Soto fought the Tula Indians at <span class="loc">Caddo Gap</span>, and that he was injured during that battle. The first white settlers arrived in 1812, when Martin and Mary Collier settled what is now <span class="loc">Caddo Gap</span>. They befriended the local tribes, and seemingly had no problems from them whatsoever. Granville Whittington arrived in 1835, and built a road that led from Hot Springs, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> to his farm about a mile north of the settlement of Montgomery. By 1836 when <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> received statehood, most of the native Indians were gone. Some of the native Indian women had intermingled and intermarried with local white settlers. <span class="loc">Whittington</span> opened a general store that drew customers from the surrounding area, and in 1842 he opened the Mount Ida Post Office in <span class="loc">Mount Ida</span>. West of the <span class="loc">Ouachita</span> River, settlers from a wagon train wintered in what is now <span class="loc">Oden</span>, and decided to stay when the weather cleared. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> was named after General Richard Montgomery, an American general who died during the American Revolution.</p>
