  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">York County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 434,972. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">York</span>. The county was created on <span class="date">August 19, 1749</span>, from part of <span class="loc">Lancaster County</span> and named either for the <span class="loc">Duke of York</span>, an early patron of the <span class="loc">Penn</span> family, or for the city and shire of <span class="loc">York</span> in <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="loc">York County</span> comprises the York-Hanover, <span class="loc">PA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which is also included in the Harrisburg-York-Lebanon, <span class="org">PA Combined Statistical Area</span>. It is in the <span class="loc">Susquehanna</span> Valley, a large fertile agricultural region in South Central Pennsylvania. Based on <span class="org">the Articles of Confederation</span> having been adopted in <span class="loc">York</span> by the Second Continental Congress on <span class="date">November 15, 1777</span>, the local government and business community began referring to <span class="loc">York</span> in <span class="date">the 1960s</span> as the first capital of the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>. The designation has been debated by historians ever since. Congress considered <span class="loc">York</span>, and the <span class="loc">borough of Wrightsville</span>, on the eastern side of <span class="loc">York County</span> along the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span>, as a permanent capital of the <span class="loc">United States</span> before <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span>, was selected.</p><br><br>
