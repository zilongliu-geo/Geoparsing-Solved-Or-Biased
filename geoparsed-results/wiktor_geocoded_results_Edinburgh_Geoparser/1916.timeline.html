  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Beaumont</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. A post office was opened in <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> on <span class="date">June 3, 1880</span>, and remained in operation until it was discontinued on <span class="date">August 16, 1997</span>. The <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> <span class="per">St. Louis</span> and <span class="per">San Francisco</span> Railroad Water Tank in <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> is on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> maintains a private airfield directly next to the town. The <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> <span class="per">Cafe</span> and <span class="per">Hotel</span> is a popular place to eat and stay for locals as well as pilots on their way through. There is a taxiway and parking area for small planes directly next to the restaurant itself. It is also near the Elk River Wind Project. The community is featured in the storyline of the <span class="date">1998</span> film "The Long Way Home" starring <span class="per">Jack Lemmon</span>. However, the actual locations filmed were in British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span> and not in <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. The surrounding area is farm land, settled by ranchers and farmers after the Civil War. Homesteaders from <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, and other eastern states came because of an abundance of cheap land. The town site was first a stop on the stagecoach route between <span class="loc">Fredonia</span> and <span class="loc">Wichita</span>. In <span class="date">1879</span> <span class="per">Edwin</span> and <span class="per">Emma</span> Russell built the <span class="per">Summit Hotel</span>, later renamed as the <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> Hotel. In <span class="date">1885</span> the St. <span class="per">Louis</span> and <span class="per">San</span> Francisco Railroad, better known as the <span class="loc">Frisco</span>, established <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> as a railroad town. One line of tracks ran east and west, connecting <span class="per">St. Louis</span> with <span class="loc">Wichita</span>. A spur was added later going south from <span class="loc">Beaumont</span> though <span class="loc">Latham</span> and on to the Oklahoma border. A roundhouse was built in <span class="date">1890</span> across from the <span class="per">Summit Hotel</span>, and employed 90 people. The water tower, built in <span class="date">1885</span>, stands across from the hotel and is on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. Because of the rich bluestem grass, the area was used as staging area to ship cattle back east.</p><br><br>
