<p><span class="loc">China</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,160 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Beaumontâ€“Port <span class="loc">Arthur Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The town is supported by agriculture, especially rice, and by the nearby oil and natural gas fields. <span class="loc">China</span> was first known as "<span class="loc">China</span> Grove", for a water stop for the <span class="loc">Texas</span> and New Orleans Railroad that sat amidst a grove of chinaberry trees. In the 1860s a small community grew around the water stop, and another a few miles away named Nashland. A post office with the name "<span class="loc">China</span>" was established there in 1893. When fire destroyed the <span class="loc">China</span> Grove depot in 1906, the railroad rebuilt in the larger Nashland area, but retained the established name "<span class="loc">China</span>" as the name of the depot. The Nashland post office changed its name to <span class="loc">China</span> shortly afterward. It wasn't until 1971 that the (now-merged) community voted to incorporate as the <span class="loc">city of China</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. During World War II, a small branch camp was built for German prisoners of war who were detailed to <span class="loc">China</span> from the larger Camp <span class="loc">Huntsville</span> in <span class="loc">Walker County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> (now a part of Sam Houston State University). These prisoners helped to maintain rice fields while local farmers were serving in the military.</p>
