  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Montgomery</span> (Welsh: Trefaldwyn; meaning "the town of <span class="loc">Baldwin</span>") is a town in the Welsh Marches, administratively in the Welsh <span class="loc">county of Powys</span>. It was previously the county town of <span class="loc">Montgomeryshire</span>. The town centre lies one mile (1.6 km) from the English border. Its castle, <span class="loc">Montgomery Castle</span>, was started in <span class="date">1223</span>, and its parish church in <span class="date">1227</span>. Other locations in the town include The Old Bell Museum, the Offa's Dyke Path, the Robber's Grave and the town wall. The large Iron Age hill fort of <span class="loc">Ffridd Faldwyn</span> is sited to the NW of the town and to the W of <span class="loc">Montgomery Castle</span>. In the <span class="date">2011</span> census, the community of <span class="per">Montgomery</span> had a population of <span class="date">1295</span>. The town was established around a Norman stone castle on a crag. The castle had been built in the early 13th century to control an important ford over the nearby <span class="loc">River Severn</span> and replaced an earlier motte and bailey fortification at <span class="loc">Hendomen</span>, one mile away. An important supporter of <span class="per">King William I</span> (the Conqueror), <span class="per">Roger de Montgomery</span>, originally from <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> in the <span class="loc">Pays d'Auge</span> in <span class="loc">Normandy</span>, was given this part of the Welsh Marches by <span class="per">William</span> and his name was given to the town surrounding the castle.</p><br><br>
