  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Plymouth County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,232 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was settled in <span class="date">1679</span> on the lands called "Sippican" by the local Wampanoags, along the coast of <span class="loc">Buzzards Bay</span>. (Sippican was the name of the local tribe.) It originally included the lands of <span class="loc">Mattapoisett</span>, <span class="loc">Marion</span> and parts of <span class="loc">Wareham</span> (which was lost when <span class="loc">Wareham</span> was founded in <span class="date">1739</span>). The town was officially incorporated on <span class="date">June 4, 1686</span> as <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, and was renamed for <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, from which early settlers to the town came. The town originally thrived with the early shipbuilding and whaling trade in <span class="loc">Mattapoisett</span> Harbor. However, in <span class="date">1852</span> and <span class="date">1857</span> the towns of <span class="loc">Marion</span> and <span class="loc">Mattapoisett</span>, respectively, were separated and incorporated as separate towns, thus landlocking <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. Since that time, the town has become mostly rural-residential, with some farms located in town. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a "Right to Farm" community. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.4 square miles (94 km2), of which 33.9 square miles (88 km2) is land and 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2), or 6.76%, is water. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> is located along the western border of <span class="loc">Plymouth County</span>, and is bordered by <span class="loc">Lakeville</span> and <span class="loc">Middleborough</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Wareham</span> and <span class="loc">Marion</span> to the east, <span class="loc">Mattapoisett</span> to the south, and <span class="loc">Acushnet</span> and <span class="loc">Freetown</span> to the west. The town's localities include <span class="loc">Bisbee Corner</span>, <span class="loc">East Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">North Rochester</span> and <span class="loc">Varella</span> Corner. The town is about 10 miles (16 km) northeast of <span class="loc">New Bedford</span>, 40 miles (64 km) east of Providence, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, and 60 miles (97 km) south of <span class="loc">Boston</span>.</p><br><br>
