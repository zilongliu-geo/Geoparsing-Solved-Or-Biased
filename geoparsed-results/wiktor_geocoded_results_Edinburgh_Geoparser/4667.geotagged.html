<p><span class="loc">Camden County</span> is a county located in the southeastern corner of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. According to the 2010 Census, the population was 50,513. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Woodbine, and the largest city is <span class="loc">St. Marys</span>. It is one of the original <span class="loc">counties of Georgia</span>, created February 5, 1777. <span class="loc">Camden County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">St. Marys</span>, <span class="loc">GA</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Jacksonville-St. Marys-Palatka, FL-GA Combined Statistical Area. The first recorded European to visit what is today <span class="loc">Camden County</span> was Captain Jean Ribault of <span class="loc">France</span> in 1562. Ribault was sent out by French Huguenots to find a suitable place for a settlement. Ribault named the rivers he saw the Seine and the Some, known today as the <span class="loc">St. Marys</span> and <span class="loc">Satilla Rivers</span>. Ribault described the area as, "Fairest, fruitfulest and pleasantest of all the world." In 1565, <span class="loc">Spain</span> became alarmed by the French settlements and sent out a large force to take over and settle the area. During that time, the Spaniards attempted to convert the Native Americans to Catholicism. At least two missions operated on <span class="loc">Cumberland Island</span>, ministering to the Timucuan people, who had resided on the island for at least four thousand years.</p>
