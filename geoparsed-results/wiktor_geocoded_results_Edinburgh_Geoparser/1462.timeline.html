By <span class="date">1859</span>, when the population was 1,493, industries included one gristmill, several sawmills, one tub factory, and a variety of mechanic shops. The <span class="loc">White River</span> Railroad from Bethel opened to <span class="loc">Rochester</span> in <span class="date">1900</span>, but was abandoned in <span class="date">1933</span> during the Great Depression. <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was one of thirteen <span class="loc">Vermont</span> towns isolated by flooding caused by Hurricane Irene in <span class="date">2011</span>.</p><br><br>
