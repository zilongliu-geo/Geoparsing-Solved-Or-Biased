<p><span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Yates County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,469 at the 2010 census. The town is named after the ancient <span class="loc">city of Jerusalem</span>. The Town of <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> is on the south border of the county and is southwest of <span class="loc">Geneva</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> was within the <span class="loc">Phelps</span> and <span class="loc">Gorham Purchase</span>. It was first settled around 1791. Among the earliest settlers were the evangelist Jemima Wilkinson and her congregation. The town was an original town of the county. It was established in 1789, while still in <span class="loc">Ontario County</span> and became part of <span class="loc">Yates County</span> when the county was created in 1823. The area around <span class="loc">Bluff Point</span> was annexed to the town in 1814. <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span> has been divided to form other towns in the county: in 1803, the Town of <span class="loc">Benton</span> was taken from <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>, and itself later divided to make other towns. <span class="loc">Branchport</span> is a purported birthplace of Seneca leader <span class="loc">Red Jacket</span>.
