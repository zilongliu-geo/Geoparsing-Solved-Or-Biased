<p>The <span class="loc">District of Taylor</span> is a small town in northeastern British Columbia, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, located on mile 36 of the Alaska Highway. Taylor, a member municipality of the <span class="loc">Peace River</span> Regional District, covers an area of about 17.09 kmÂ² with 1,373 residents. As it is just south of the much larger <span class="loc">city of Fort</span> <span class="loc">St. John</span>, there is a sizable amount of commuting and interaction between the two. The town sits on a terrace 60 m above the north bank of the <span class="loc">Peace River</span>. The first settler on the flat was a trapper named Herbert Taylor in 1911. The town incorporated in 1958 with industrial business beginning to locate there. Since then, Taylor has remained a small town, even though it has developed a large industrial base. It has become home to the annual World's Invitational Class 'A' Gold Panning Championships and was featured on the CBC Television program Village on a Diet. The town, and the <span class="loc">Taylor Flats</span> upon which the town is located, are named after Donald Herbert Taylor, a fur-trader with the Hudson's Bay Company who regularly met his Aboriginal trading counterparts on this river flat. In 1912 Taylor left his employers and took up residence on the flats with a few other squatters. That year the federal government opened the area to homesteading and Taylor was granted the land upon which he had settled. These early settlers were trappers with the first farm established by Henry Philip, from <span class="loc">Glasgow</span>, who inherited buildings, equipment and land from his survey team when they left the area. In 1919, with the help of Taylor's nine children, along with those from a few American families who settled there, the provincial government opened the Taylor Flats School.</p>
