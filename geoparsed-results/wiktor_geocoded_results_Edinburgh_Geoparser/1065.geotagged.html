<p><span class="loc">Portland</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Northampton County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Portland</span> is located in the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley region of the state. It is part of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>'s Slate Belt. The population of <span class="loc">Portland</span> was 579 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Portland</span> is located at 40°55′14″N 75°5′52″W (40.920622, -75.097738).

It served to increase at least one business – that of the taverns and hotels. Records show that the Hibblertown Hotel (present Ackerson house on State Street), the Dill’s Tavern (oldest tavern, was located on the south side of Emery’s, now torn down) and the What Cheer Inn (present Duckloe Showroom at the corner of <span class="loc">Delaware</span> Avenue and Main Street) all prospered because of loggers.</p>
