<p>Spring is a census-designated place (CDP) within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Houston in <span class="loc">Harris County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, part of the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area. The population was 54,298 at the 2010 census. While the name "Spring" is applied to a large area of northern <span class="loc">Harris County</span> and a smaller area of southern <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, the original town of Spring, now known as Old Town Spring, is located at the intersection of Spring-Cypress and Hardy roads and encompasses a relatively small area of perhaps 1 km2. The large geographic area now known as Spring was originally inhabited by the Orcoquiza Native Americans. In 1836, the Texas General Council of the Provisional Government placed what is now the town of Spring in the Harrisburg municipality. In 1838, William Pierpont placed a trading post on <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span>. In 1840, the town of Spring had 153 residents. By the mid-1840s, many German immigrants, including <span class="loc">Gus</span> Bayer and Carl Wunsche, moved to the area and began farming. People from <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> and other parts of the post-Civil War Southern U.S. settled in Spring. The main cash crops in Spring were sugar cane and cotton; area residents also grew vegetables.</p>
