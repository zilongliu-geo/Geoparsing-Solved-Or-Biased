<p>Easton is a town in <span class="loc">Fairfield County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,490 at the 2010 census. Easton contains the historic <span class="loc">district of Aspetuck</span>. The town is situated amongst <span class="loc">Redding</span>, <span class="loc">Monroe</span>, <span class="loc">Trumbull</span>, <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, <span class="loc">Weston</span>, and <span class="loc">Newtown</span>. Easton is made of green terrain. Easton was first settled in 1757 by men from <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>. In 1762 a congregation called the <span class="loc">North Fairfield</span> Society was established, and it gradually evolved into Easton. In 1787 <span class="loc">Weston</span>, then including lands now defined as Easton, was incorporated out of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>. The area was slow to develop because of the rough hills along the <span class="loc">Aspetuck River</span>, and so it was not until 1845 that what is now Easton separated from <span class="loc">Weston</span>. Today, half of the town's property is owned by the Aquarion Water Company of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, the major supplier of water in the area. On June 1, 1968, the deaf and blind activist Helen Keller died at the age of 87 in her Easton home, where she chose to spend her final days. Her house is still intact today and has been owned by several families since her death. The local middle school bears her name.</p>
