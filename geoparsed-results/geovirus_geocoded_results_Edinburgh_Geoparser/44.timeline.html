  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>As the annual Muslim Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca gets underway, Saudi Arabian authorities have expressed concern swine flu could impact pilgrims. Four, with underlying health issues, have already died. Two men and a woman in their seventies and a seventeen-year-old girl have died, according to the Health Ministry. The men from <span class="loc">India</span> and <span class="loc">Sudan</span>, the older woman from <span class="loc">Morocco</span>, and the teen from <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. None were vaccinated against the virus. One died in Mecca, the others in <span class="loc">Medina</span>. All had conditions including cancer and respiratory ailments. The <span class="org">World Health Organisation</span> puts the current swine flu death toll at 6,750. Four more people are in Saudi hospitals in critical condition and a further twelve are recovering in hospital. Each year around three million make the pilgrimage. And, Saudi authorities are concerned about the possible spread of the virus. At least one pilgrimage to Mecca is deemed mandatory for every Muslim capable of doing so. Fifteen thousand extra medical staff are deployed, ports and airports screen incomers with thermal cameras, and hundreds of extra hospital beds have been set aside. Visa requirements specify only those vaccinated against the flu strain can apply. In <span class="date">September</span>, <span class="loc">Egypt</span> forbade hundreds of Muslims from leaving <span class="loc">Cairo</span> for the Hajj after an Egyptian woman returning from a more minor pilgrimage <span class="date">last July</span> became the first swine flu fatality in both <span class="loc">Africa</span> and <span class="loc">the Middle East</span>. For <span class="date">Ramadan</span>, pilgrimage to <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span> was banned by <span class="loc">Iran</span> for the same reason.</p><br><br>
