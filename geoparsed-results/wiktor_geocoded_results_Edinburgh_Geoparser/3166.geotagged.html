<p><span class="loc">Lowell</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, along the <span class="loc">Muskingum River</span>. The population was 549 at the 2010 census. The first European settlers to the land that would become <span class="loc">Lowell</span> arrived in the late 18th century after the 1787 Northwest Ordinance opened the territory for settlement. Soon after the Ordinance took effect, the Ohio Company of Associates purchased 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km2) of land along the <span class="loc">Muskingum River</span> and proceeded to survey the area. The first settlement in what would become the state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span> was <span class="loc">Marietta</span>, founded in 1788 near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Muskingum</span> about 14 miles (23 km) downstream from the site that would become <span class="loc">Lowell</span>. By 1789, settlement had spread north to the area where the <span class="loc">Cats Creek</span> enters the <span class="loc">Muskingum River</span>. By the 1830s the <span class="loc">Muskingum</span> Valley had long been settled, and local leaders created a plan to improve the <span class="loc">Muskingum River</span> for use as a source of power. In 1836 the State Legislature approved a bill that appropriated $400,000 to create a series of locks and dams along the river as far north as <span class="loc">Dresden</span>. Between 1837 and 1841, eleven dams and twelve locks were built at a cost that had ballooned to over $1.6 million. The third lock was built within a one mile (1.6 km) long canal constructed near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Cats Creek</span> to bypass a series of rapids in the <span class="loc">Muskingum</span>. Two competing companies bought land near the canal with the intentions of building a town. The first settlement was laid out on November 8, 1837 and was named <span class="loc">Lowell</span> with the idea that it would grow into a large manufacturing city similar to <span class="loc">Lowell</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. It was located along the upper end of the canal on the west side of the <span class="loc">Cats Creek</span>. The second settlement, called Buell's <span class="loc">Lowell</span>, was laid out on March 22, 1838. The second settlement quickly grew to dominate to the point that the first settlement became known as <span class="loc">Upper Lowell</span>. In 1850, Buell's <span class="loc">Lowell</span> was incorporated as a village and in 1889 officially changed its name to <span class="loc">Lowell</span>.</p>
