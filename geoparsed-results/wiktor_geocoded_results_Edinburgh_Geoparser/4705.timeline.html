  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Warin</span> (German pronunciation: [vaˈʁiːn]) is a town in the <span class="loc">Nordwestmecklenburg district</span>, in Mecklenburg-Western <span class="loc">Pomerania</span>, <span class="loc">Germany</span>. It is situated 19 km southeast of <span class="loc">Wismar</span>. <span class="loc">Warin</span> is a small town with a population of under 4,000 persons. <span class="loc">Warin</span> is situated 104 km from <span class="loc">Hamburg</span> to the west, and 43 km from the Baltic port-city of <span class="loc">Rostock</span> to the north east. The countryside around <span class="loc">Warin</span> is composed of forests, lakes, and agricultural land given over to cereal production and animal husbandry of various kinds. The lakes are popular with canoeists, and swimmers, and also provide beautiful lakeshore frontage for the residential properties which skirt the two lakes situated immediately north and south of the town. The forests are ideal for nature-trail rambles, and are not too extensive to get easily lost, before one will encounter a forest trail to regain one's proper direction back to town. The majority of transport needs are met by a network of minor roads. 2 km to the south of <span class="loc">Warin</span>, on the northern edge of <span class="loc">Blankenberg</span>, there is a railway line which ultimately connects to Berlin Hauptbahnhof, approximately 180 km, to the south east, should visitors wish to travel to <span class="loc">Warin</span> for a relaxing time, or for the Warinese to experience a dramatic change of pace in the metropolis of <span class="loc">Berlin</span>, as an alternative to <span class="loc">Hamburg</span> or <span class="loc">Rostock</span>.</p><br><br>
