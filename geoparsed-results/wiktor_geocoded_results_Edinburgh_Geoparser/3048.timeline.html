  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gaoping</span> (Chinese: 高平) is a county-level city in <span class="loc">Shanxi Province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span> with a history stretching back to the Warring States period (403–221 BCE). Part of the city was formerly known as <span class="loc">Changping</span> where a noted battle took place in 260 BCE between forces from the rival States of <span class="per">Qin</span> and <span class="per">Zhao</span>. <span class="loc">Gaoping</span> is also famed as the birthplace of <span class="per">Lord Yan</span>, a legendary figure who was an early leader (or series of leaders) among the ancient Han Chinese. <span class="loc">Gaoping</span> (along with several other locations in <span class="loc">China</span>) was traditionally identified as <span class="per">Yan</span>'s hometown. Not until the late 20th and early 21st century was <span class="loc">Gaoping</span> widely accepted as <span class="per">Yan</span>'s birthplace by the global scholarly community. The hilly area around <span class="loc">Gaoping</span> is known as the Sheep's Head Mountains (Chinese: 羊头山), and it is this area that preserves the most concrete evidences of <span class="per">Yan</span>'s habitation there. A local temple to a female river spirit has been identified as portraying <span class="per">Yan</span>'s daughter Nüwa (Chinese: 女娃) - not to be confused with the goddess Nüwa (Chinese: 女娲) - since the Ming Dynasty. Ancient sources, such as the <span class="per">Guo Yu</span>, record that <span class="per">Yan</span> and his posterity flourished in the area around a river called the "<span class="loc">Giang</span> [<span class="loc">Jiang</span>] Water". The river is believed by scholars to be the <span class="loc">Giang</span> River of old is <span class="date">now</span> called the <span class="loc">Jiang</span> River (Chinese: 绛河) or the <span class="loc">Jiang</span> Water (Chinese: 降水), and is located in <span class="loc">Tunliu County</span>, whence it flows east into the <span class="loc">Zhang</span> River.</p><br><br>
