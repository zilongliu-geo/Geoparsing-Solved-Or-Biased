It is named after <span class="per">Prince Karim Aga Khan</span>, the spiritual head of Shia Ismaili Nizari community. <span class="org">The Guardian</span> ranked it as one of the five "Best Tourist Sites" in <span class="loc">Pakistan</span>. Both <span class="loc">Baldit</span> Fort and Karimabad village received <span class="org">the World Award of Tourism</span> in <span class="date">2000</span> when <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, <span class="loc">India</span> and <span class="loc">Britain</span> and other countries competed.
