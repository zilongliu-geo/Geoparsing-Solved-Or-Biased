  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Garden waste collection charge set to double. The cost of recycling green waste is set to double, affecting more than 10,000 residents. Previously residents could rent a 240 litre bin for <span class="date">a year</span> from when they signed up and pay no extra for collection, or buy 110 litre green sacks for £1 each, plus postage. But from <span class="date">Wednesday</span> every resident signing up to the fortnightly green waste collection scheme or renewing their agreement will have to pay the increased price. The cost of the sacks is also rising to £1.40 each. <span class="per">David Lawton</span>, from the <span class="org">Teddington Society</span>’s environment group, called the rise “insensitive. He said: “The council’s waste services are hardly viewed favourably across the borough. “With most residents already battling through the present financial crisis, this is a smack in the face for recycling too. “Does this administration really want us to recycle? This is the best deterrent the council could have dreamed up. “Rather than pay that extra £30, residents will resort to the car and drive to Townmead with their green waste. “Perhaps, at worst, they will stuff their black waste bags full, to add to the ever-increasing and overloaded landfill, or simply dump it as flytipping. “Is this the green <span class="loc">Richmond</span> we really wish to encourage?” A council spokesman said: “The £30 annual charge, set in <span class="date">2005</span>, falls far short of covering running costs. “To avoid having to subsidise the service we have elected instead to increase the charge, so it is only those who use the service who pay for it. “We have made extra effort to contact residents whose hire contracts were due for renewal during <span class="date">February</span> and <span class="date">March</span>, so they could update their contracts before the new charges come into effect on <span class="date">April 1</span>. “Residents are encouraged to consider using home composting, which is the cheapest and most sustainable way to recycle green waste. “The free garden waste service at <span class="org">Townmead Road Recycling Centre</span> in <span class="loc">Kew</span> continues to be available.”</p><br><br>
