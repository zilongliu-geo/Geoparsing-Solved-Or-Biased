<p>Newcastle is a town in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,752 at the 2010 census. The village of Newcastle is located in the western part of the town, on the <span class="loc">Damariscotta River</span>. Together with the village of <span class="loc">Damariscotta</span> linked by the Main Street bridge, they form the Twin Villages (see Damariscotta-Newcastle CDP). Originally called <span class="loc">Sheepscot Plantation</span>, <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> was first settled in the 1630s by fishermen and around 50 families. Around 1649-50, John Mason purchased a considerable tract of land from the sachems Chief Robinhood and Chief Jack Pudding. The territory was claimed in 1665 by the <span class="loc">Duke of York</span>. Renamed New Dartmouth, the plantation was attacked and destroyed in 1676 during King Philip's War. When the war was over, some of the inhabitants returned. But it was destroyed again in 1689 during King William's War, and the village was not reoccupied for about 40 years. In 1730, Colonel David Dunbar, the superintendent and governor of the <span class="loc">Province of Sagadahoc</span>, resettled it as Newcastle, named in honor of the Duke of Newcastle.</p>
