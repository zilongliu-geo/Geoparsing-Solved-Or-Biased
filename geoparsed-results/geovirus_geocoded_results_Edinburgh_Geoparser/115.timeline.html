  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Over 40 children have died in an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in <span class="loc">China</span>, and the country's capital of <span class="loc">Beijing</span> reported its first death due to the disease on <span class="date">Wednesday</span>. According to <span class="org">Xinhua</span> News Agency, <span class="org">Beijing Health Bureau</span> spokeswoman <span class="per">Deng Xiaohong</span> said that the 13-month-old boy died <span class="date">Sunday</span> while en route to the hospital. Health authorities state that 24,934 children in mainland <span class="loc">China</span> are afflicted with the disease, and 42 children have died from it. The cause of the disease has been identified as Enterovirus 71 (EV-71). HFMD can also be caused by Coxsackievirus. Another child infected with the virus died <span class="date">Monday</span>, but as he died in <span class="loc">Hebei province</span> his death was counted there. <span class="org">Xinhua</span> News Agency also reported that a 21-month-old boy died <span class="date">Monday</span> of the virus in <span class="loc">Hubei province</span>. After an order was given <span class="date">last week</span> by the <span class="org">Ministry of Health</span> of the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span> that all cases must be reported, the count of those infected has increased markedly. Eastern <span class="loc">China</span> saw a large number of cases in <span class="date">early March</span>, but this information was not made public until <span class="date">late April</span>. In March, Children under age six in <span class="loc">eastern Anhui province</span> began being admitted to hospitals with symptoms of the virus, and the outbreak spread quickly after that. The <span class="loc">city of Fuyang</span> in <span class="loc">Anhui province</span> was especially hard-hit by the outbreak. "The majority of patients who were in critical condition have recovered," said a Health Ministry official in a statement on <span class="date">Monday</span>. As of <span class="date">Monday</span>, 3,606 HFMD infections had been reported in <span class="loc">Beijing</span>. Deaths have occurred in the <span class="loc">provinces of Anhui</span>, Guangdong, Guangxi, <span class="loc">Hainan</span>, <span class="loc">Hunan</span>, <span class="loc">Zhejiang</span>, <span class="loc">Beijing</span> and <span class="loc">Hubei</span>. "What I know is the death rate has gone down drastically since <span class="date">early May</span>. There are very, very few cases with complications â€” 99 percent of these are mild cases," said World Health Organization (WHO) <span class="loc">China</span> representative <span class="per">Hans Troedsson</span> in a statement on <span class="date">Wednesday</span>. Incidents of the disease are expected to peak in <span class="date">June</span> and <span class="date">July</span>. <span class="loc">China</span> is also dealing with a magnitude-7.9 earthquake which hit the country <span class="date">Monday</span> and has killed almost 15,000. The outbreak is a concern to the government, as the country prepares for the <span class="date">2008</span> <span class="date">Summer</span> Olympics in <span class="loc">Beijing</span> <span class="date">this August</span>. "We are confident the potential outbreak will not affect the <span class="loc">Beijing</span> Olympic Games," <span class="org">China's Health Ministry</span> spokesman <span class="per">Mao Qunan</span> stated. And at a joint press conference held by <span class="org">China's Ministry of Health</span> and the WHO, he further noted that, "<span class="loc">China</span> is confident that it can control the spread of the disease with effective prevention methods."</p><br><br>
