  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lowell</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. With an estimated <span class="date">2014</span> population of 109,945, it is the fourth-largest city in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, after <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">Worcester</span>, and <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, and the second-largest in what the <span class="org">U.S. Census Bureau</span> defines as <span class="loc">Boston</span>'s metropolitan area. Incorporated in <span class="date">1826</span>, <span class="per">Lowell</span> became known as the cradle of the American Industrial Revolution, and many of the city's historic sites have been preserved by the National Park Service. <span class="per">Lowell</span> is home to the <span class="org">University of Massachusetts Lowell</span>, a <span class="loc">Carnegie</span>-classified research university and the second largest public university in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Along with <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, <span class="loc">Lowell</span> is one of <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>'s historical county seats prior to the abolition of county government in <span class="date">1997</span>. Founded in the 1820s as a planned manufacturing center for textiles, <span class="per">Lowell</span> is located along the rapids of the <span class="loc">Merrimack River</span>, 25 miles northwest of <span class="loc">Boston</span> in what was once the farming community of <span class="loc">East Chelmsford</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The so-called <span class="loc">Boston</span> Associates, including <span class="per">Nathan Appleton</span> and <span class="per">Patrick Tracy Jackson</span> of the <span class="org">Boston Manufacturing Company</span>, named the new mill town after their visionary leader, <span class="per">Francis Cabot Lowell</span>, who had died <span class="date">five years</span> before its <span class="date">1823</span> incorporation. As <span class="per">Lowell</span>'s population grew, it acquired more land from neighboring towns, and diversified into a full-fledged urban center. Many of the men who composed the labor force for constructing the canals and factories had immigrated from <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, escaping the poverty and Potato Famines of the 1830s and 1840s. The mill workers, young single women called Mill Girls, generally came from the farm families of <span class="loc">New England</span>.</p><br><br>
