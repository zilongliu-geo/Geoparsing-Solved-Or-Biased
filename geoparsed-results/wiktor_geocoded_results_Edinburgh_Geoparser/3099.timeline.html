  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Bell is a rural town and locality in the Western Downs Region, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is in the western foothills of the <span class="loc">Bunya Mountains</span>, 39 kilometres (24 mi) north of <span class="loc">Dalby</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, Bell had a population of 544. Bell is on the Bunya Highway and lies between the agricultural areas of the <span class="loc">Darling Downs</span> and the <span class="loc">South Burnett</span> with rolling hills of quilt-like patterned farmland. The area's main industry is farming of beef cattle, grain, sheep and pigs. Originally the area around Bell was part of a large land holding called <span class="loc">Jimbour</span> Station. In the 1870s the area was opened up for closer settlement and <span class="loc">Angus</span> &amp; <span class="per">Christina McPhee</span> from <span class="loc">Scotland</span> became the first settlers nearest to what would become the village of Bell. Over time other families - including <span class="per">Bellingham, Bradley</span>, <span class="loc">Edwards</span>, <span class="loc">Ensor</span>, <span class="per">Rush</span> and <span class="per">Walker</span> - settled in the vicinity of <span class="loc">Cattle Creek</span> and in <span class="date">1878</span> a school was established at <span class="loc">Maida</span> Hill to cater for these families. In <span class="date">April 1906</span> the railway line was extended from <span class="loc">Dalby</span> and the first land sales in Bell were in <span class="date">May 1906</span>. The village was named after Sir <span class="per">Joshua Peter Bell</span> who, at that time, was owner of <span class="loc">Jimbour</span> Station.</p><br><br>
