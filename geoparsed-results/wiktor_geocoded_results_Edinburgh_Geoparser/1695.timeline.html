  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Allen</span> is an affluent city in <span class="loc">Collin County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, a northern suburb of <span class="per">Dallas</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city had a total population of 84,246. The <span class="per">Allen</span> area was previously home to the <span class="loc">Caddo</span>, <span class="loc">Comanche</span>, and other indigenous peoples. The first immigrants from the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Europe</span> arrived in the early 1840s. The town was established by the <span class="loc">Houston</span> and Central <span class="loc">Texas</span> Railroad and named in <span class="date">1872</span> for <span class="per">Ebenezer Allen</span>, a state politician and railroad promoter. The railroad allowed sale of crops across the country before they rotted, causing a shift from the previous cattle-based agriculture. On <span class="date">February 22, 1878</span>, a gang led by <span class="per">Sam Bass</span> committed in <span class="per">Allen</span> what is said to be <span class="loc">Texas</span>'s first train robbery. From <span class="date">1908</span> through <span class="date">1948</span>, <span class="per">Allen</span> was a stop along the <span class="org">Texas Traction Company</span>'s interurban line from <span class="loc">Denison</span> to <span class="per">Dallas</span>. <span class="per">Allen</span> was a small town of a few hundred residents when it was incorporated in <span class="date">1953</span>. Since this time, it has grown dramatically due to the construction of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 75, the <span class="per">Dallas</span>/Fort Worth International Airport, and the development of nearby <span class="per">Dallas</span> and <span class="per">Plano</span>.</p><br><br>
