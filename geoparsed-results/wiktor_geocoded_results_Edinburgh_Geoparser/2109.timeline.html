  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lapa</span>, <span class="per">Dom João</span> and <span class="per">Montanha</span> are three islands located to the west of the <span class="loc">Macau Peninsula</span> and the <span class="loc">Macau</span> islands of <span class="loc">Taipa</span> and <span class="loc">Coloane</span>. They were inhabited by very small Chinese population in its early history. In some historical registers, the Portuguese presence on the island dates back to the end of the 17th century when a group of missionaries established themselves on this Chinese island. During the 19th century, Portuguese missionaries also began to populate and evangelize the other two islands. The <span class="loc">Macau</span> government also began to collect taxes from the populations of these three islands in exchange for protection as these islands were not protected by Chinese soldiers. The Portuguese built a leper colony on the island of <span class="per">Dom João</span> and some schools to educate the few Chinese residents on the islands. Followed by the Japanese invasion of <span class="loc">China</span> in <span class="date">1938</span>, the Portuguese officially occupied these three islands, with an excuse to better protect Portuguese missionaries residing there. In <span class="date">1941</span>, the <span class="org">Japanese Army</span> threatened the Portuguese troops to force abandonment of these sparsely populated islands. Consequently, these islands were occupied by <span class="loc">Japan</span>. At the end of World War II, <span class="loc">China</span> was able to reoccupy the three islands.</p><br><br>
