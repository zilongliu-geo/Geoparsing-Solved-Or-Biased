<p>Reading is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Nobles County</span>, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Reading is 7.5 miles (12.1 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Worthington</span>. According to A.P Rose's History of <span class="loc">Nobles County</span>, Reading is nearer to the geographic center of the county than any other community. Reading has a post office with ZIP code 56165. Main highways include: <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> State Highway 266 Discontinued in 2003 – renamed <span class="loc">Nobles County</span> Road 25 <span class="loc">Nobles County</span> Road 25 Much of the land that the community of Reading now occupies was claimed by H.H. Read in 1876. He farmed the land for 23 years until the <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, <span class="loc">Cedar Rapids</span> and Northern Railway arrived in 1899. Thomas H. Brown, <span class="loc">Burlington</span>'s right-of-way man, purchased 271⁄2 acres of land from Read for the purpose of establishing a townsite. He also purchased 20 more acres from <span class="loc">Worthington</span> banker and real estate dealer George Dayton. Dayton later went on to found the Dayton's Department Store chain. In the fall of 1899, A. J. Keller arrived on the first train and took up his duties as station agent. Early in 1900, H. H. Douglas and the Rothchild Grain Company both built grain elevators in Reading after flipping a coin to determine location. Coal and lumber yards were quickly established by James S Ramage. By the time the town was surveyed and platted in the summer of 1900, a general store, a hardware store, a blacksmith shop, and a restaurant had been added to Reading's list of businesses. The Summit Lake Presbyterian Church was moved into town from the country, and a small school house was also moved into town to educate the youth of Reading. The Reading <span class="loc">State Bank</span> was established in 1902. The Farmer's Mutual Telephone Company was established in 1905 with lines connecting to <span class="loc">Rushmore</span>, <span class="loc">Wilmont</span>, and <span class="loc">Fulda</span>.</p>
