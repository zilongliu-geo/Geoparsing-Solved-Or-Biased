<p><span class="loc">Arlington</span> is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">Wealden district</span> of <span class="loc">East Sussex</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The parish is on the River Cuckmere, and is the location for a medieval priory, a reservoir and car racetrack. The area has been settled since Anglo-Saxon times. It is suggested that the wooden church in <span class="loc">Arlington</span> built by them, having been destroyed by invaders, was later rebuilt with bricks from the nearby Roman road. Apart from the Anglo-Saxon type of quoin stones, the church shows a splayed window of Anglo-Saxon type next to the porch. Supporting an early date is the dedication of the church to <span class="loc">St Pancras</span>, the Roman martyr, relics of whom were given to one of the Anglo-Saxon kings: he was reputed to be a teenager when put to death in one of the Roman persecutions of Christians. There is a statue of this saint in the RC church at <span class="loc">Lewes</span>: it is reasonable, therefore, to suppose that the church at <span class="loc">Arlington</span> dates from early in the Anglo-Saxon period. It was enlarged in the 13th century. <span class="loc">Michelham Priory</span>, at <span class="loc">Upper Dicker</span>, was founded by the Augustinians in 1229. Today it is a tourist site.</p>
