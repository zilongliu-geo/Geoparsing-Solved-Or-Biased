  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Quinta</span> is a resort city in <span class="loc">Riverside County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>, specifically in the <span class="loc">Coachella</span> Valley between <span class="loc">Indian Wells</span> and <span class="loc">Indio</span>. The population was 37,467 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 23,694 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The Robb Report credits <span class="loc">La Quinta</span> as the leading golf destination in the <span class="loc">US</span>. Among those destinations is the <span class="org">La Quinta Resort and Club</span>, a resort dating to <span class="date">1926</span>, where director <span class="per">Frank Capra</span> wrote the screenplay for Lost Horizon. The <span class="per">Tom Fazio</span>-designed golf course at The Quarry at <span class="loc">La Quinta</span> is ranked among the top 100 golf courses in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In <span class="date">January 2008</span>, the Arnold Palmer Classic Course at the city's SilverRock Golf Resort became one of the four host golf courses for the annual <span class="per">Bob Hope Chrysler</span> Classic PGA golf tournament. In the late-19th century and early-20th century (<span class="date">1880</span>â€“<span class="date">1920</span>), agriculture developed in present-day <span class="loc">La Quinta</span> and "East Valley" by pre-modern (mountain water runoff or open water springs) and modern irrigation techniques. At the time, <span class="loc">California</span> and federal land surveyors declared the sand dunes uninhabitable, only the hard rock ground of the "Marshall Cove" held potential farming and residential development.</p><br><br>
