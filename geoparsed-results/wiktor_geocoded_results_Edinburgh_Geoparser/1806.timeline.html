  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Holbrook</span> is a small town in <span class="loc">Southern New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is on the <span class="per">Hume</span> Highway, 356 kilometres (221 mi) North-East of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> and 491 kilometres (305 mi) south-west of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> between <span class="loc">Tarcutta</span> and <span class="loc">Albury</span>. The town is in the <span class="org">Greater Hume Shire Council</span> area which was established in <span class="date">May 2004</span> from the merger of Culcairn Shire with the majority of Holbrook Shire and part of the <span class="per">Hume</span> Shire. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> had a population of 1,263 people. The district around <span class="loc">Holbrook</span> is renowned for local produce including merino wool, wheat and other grains, lucerne, fat cattle and lamb. The area was originally inhabited by the Wiradjuri people. The explorers <span class="per">Hume</span> and <span class="per">Hovell</span> were the first-known Europeans in the area. They travelled through in <span class="date">1824</span> looking for new grazing country in the south of the colony of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>. The town was originally called <span class="loc">Ten Mile Creek</span> and the first buildings were erected in <span class="date">1836</span>. A German immigrant, <span class="per">John Christopher Pabst</span>, became the publican of the Woolpack Hotel on <span class="date">29 July 1840</span> and the area became known as "the Germans". By <span class="date">1858</span> the name had evolved into the official name of <span class="loc">Germanton</span>, though the postal area retained the name <span class="loc">Ten Mile Creek</span>. In <span class="date">1876</span> the name <span class="loc">Germanton</span> was gazetted and the old name <span class="loc">Ten Mile Creek</span> consigned to history.</p><br><br>
