  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Belvedere</span> is a residential neighbourhood in <span class="loc">north east Edmonton</span>, <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is located on the west side of the <span class="org">Canadian National Railway</span> right of way close to the Belvedere LRT station. The neighbourhood is triangle shaped with the railway right of way along the south east side, 137 Avenue on the north, and 66 Avenue on the west. Fort Road cuts through the neighbourhood close to the south east boundary. The neighbourhood is surrounded by a mixture of residential neighbourhoods and industrial and commercial neighbourhoods. Residential neighbourhoods are <span class="loc">York</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Clareview</span> <span class="loc">Town Centre</span> to the northeast, <span class="per">Balwin</span> and <span class="per">Delwood</span> to the west, and <span class="loc">Kildare</span> to the northwest. Industrial and commercial neighbourhoods are Kennedale Industrial to the east, Industrial Heights to the southeast, and the <span class="loc">Yellowhead</span> Corridor to the southwest. While the <span class="loc">Yellowhead</span> Corridor is land set aside for the <span class="loc">Yellowhead</span> Trail roadway, the area on either side of 66 Street is heavily built up with commercial and industrial enterprises. Londonderry Mall is located near the north west corner of the neighbourhood, diagonally across the intersection between 137 Avenue and 66 Street, in the neighbourhood of <span class="loc">Kildare</span>.</p><br><br>
