<p><span class="loc">Brunswick</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Frederick County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,870 at the 2010 census. The area now known as <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> was originally home to the Susquehanna Indians. In 1728 the first settlement was built, and the region became known as Eel Town, because the natives would fish for eel in the <span class="loc">Potomac River</span>. A grant to the land was then given to John Hawkins by George II of <span class="loc">Great Britain</span> on August 10, 1753. The grant had the name "Hawkins Merry-Peep-o-Day". The land was sold and Leonard Smith platted it in 1787 with the name of “Berlin,” as many Germans settled in the area. The name “Berlin,” however, could not be used for mail as there was already a <span class="loc">Berlin</span> on the <span class="loc">Eastern Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, so the post office changed the name to "Barry." The town continued to grow and was incorporated April 18, 1890 with the name “Brunswick.” Established along the now-defunct <span class="loc">Chesapeake and Ohio Canal</span>, the city became a hub for the <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Railroad</span>, which built a six-mile-long rail yard along the <span class="loc">Potomac</span> from 1891 to 1912, boosting the population to over 5,000, and making <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> virtually a company town. The railroad reduced its yard operations in the 1950s.</p>
