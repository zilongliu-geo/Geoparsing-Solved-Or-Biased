<p>School district officials discuss changed in school calendar. Last day of school for <span class="loc">Laurel County</span> students scheduled for June 5; graduation set June 6 if state approves The last day of school for <span class="loc">Laurel County</span> School District students will be June 5 and graduation will be June 6, pending approval from the <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> <span class="loc">Department of Education</span>. Director of Pupil Personnel Rhonda Welch said the district will ask the <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> <span class="loc">Department of Education</span> to forgive one of its 13 missed school days this year, which will allow the June 5 end date. “We can apply for one day,” Welch said. “The lady at KDE said the same thing.” The rest of the missed days that were not covered under banked time will be made up. The last day of school was originally scheduled for May 27. Welch said muddling through the details of House Bill 322, which allows districts to apply for missed days, hasn’t been easy. “Developing the amended calendar this year has been somewhat of an adventure,” she admitted. Welch said the commissioner has 10 days to respond to the request. If it is denied, Superintendent David Young said going to school on Memorial Day is an option. “That’s the only day we can take,” he said. “If we did lose another day, it gives us another option, but still keep graduation June 6.” Motion was approved by Joe Schenkenfelder, seconded by Bud Stuber and unanimously approved. Following the motion, Hacker Brothers Construction Manager David Jackson told School Board members Phase I of the North Laurel High School renovation — which involves replacing the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems this summer — will be “severely affected” by the calendar change. Business Manager Jim Kennedy said he would speak with Jackson and Superintendent David Young to arrive at some type of arrangement. In other action, School Board members: Approved design development drawings for Phase II of North Laurel High School. The multi-million dollar renovations to the school will involve adding four classrooms to its northwest corner, upgrading bathrooms, fixing the roof, replacing the ceiling in the auditorium, fixing doors leading to the gym and enclosing the front canopy. Motion was made by Tommy Smith, seconded by Eddie Jones and unanimously approved.
