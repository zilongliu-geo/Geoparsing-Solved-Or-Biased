<p><span class="loc">Vega</span> is a municipality in <span class="loc">Nordland county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Helgeland</span> traditional region. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of <span class="loc">Gladstad</span>. Other villages include <span class="loc">Holand</span> and <span class="loc">Ylvingen</span>. The municipality comprises about 6,500 islands in the Vega Archipelago. The main island of the municipality is also called <span class="loc">Vega</span>, and it is also the largest at 163 square kilometres (63 sq mi). Bremstein Lighthouse is located in the southwestern part of the municipality. The municipality of <span class="loc">Vega</span> was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1965, the Skogsholmen area (population: 196) was transferred from Tjøtta to <span class="loc">Vega</span>. Then on 1 January 1971, the Skålvær islands (population: 32) in the northeastern part of <span class="loc">Vega</span> was transferred to <span class="loc">Alstahaug</span>. The municipality is named after the main island of <span class="loc">Vega</span> (Old Norse: <span class="loc">Veiga</span>). The name is probably derived from veig which means "liquid" or "fluid" (referring to the lakes and the marshes of the island). The name was written "Vegø" prior to 1891.</p>
