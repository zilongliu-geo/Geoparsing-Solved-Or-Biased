<p><span class="loc">Conway</span> is an unincorporated community in southwestern Jackson Township, <span class="loc">McPherson County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 56 and a <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and <span class="loc">Oklahoma Railroad</span> line, west of the <span class="loc">city of McPherson</span>, the county seat of <span class="loc">McPherson County</span>. For millennia, the land now known as <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, most of modern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> was secured by the <span class="loc">United States</span> as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory was organized, then in 1861 <span class="loc">Kansas</span> became the 34th <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state. In 1867, <span class="loc">McPherson County</span> was founded. In 1878, <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway and parties from <span class="loc">Marion County</span> and <span class="loc">McPherson County</span> chartered the <span class="loc">Marion</span> and <span class="loc">McPherson Railway</span> Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">McPherson</span>, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to <span class="loc">Ellinwood</span>. The line was leased and operated by the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway. The line from <span class="loc">Florence</span> to <span class="loc">Marion</span>, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from <span class="loc">Marion</span> to <span class="loc">McPherson</span> was sold to Central <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from <span class="loc">Marion</span> to <span class="loc">McPherson</span> was abandoned. The original branch line connected <span class="loc">Florence</span>, <span class="loc">Marion</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span>, <span class="loc">Lehigh</span>, Canton, <span class="loc">Galva</span>, <span class="loc">McPherson</span>, <span class="loc">Conway</span>, <span class="loc">Windom</span>, <span class="loc">Little River</span>, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, <span class="loc">Ellinwood</span>.</p>
