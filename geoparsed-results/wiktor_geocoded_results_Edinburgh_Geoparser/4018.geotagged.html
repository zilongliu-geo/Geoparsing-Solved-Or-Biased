<p><span class="loc">Dingli</span> (Maltese: Ħad-Dingli) is a village in the <span class="loc">Northern Region</span> of <span class="loc">Malta</span>, with a population of 3,608 as of March 2014. It is 13 kilometres (8 miles) from the capital <span class="loc">Valletta</span> and two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the nearest town, <span class="loc">Rabat</span>. The village lies on a plateau some 250 metres above sea level, which is one of the highest points of <span class="loc">Malta</span>. The area provides not only open sea views over the tiny, uninhabited isle of <span class="loc">Filfla</span>, but is also a good vantage point over <span class="loc">Malta</span>. From the cliffs there are also views of the nearby <span class="loc">Buskett Gardens</span> and <span class="loc">Verdala Palace</span>. The name <span class="loc">Dingli</span> is believed to be derived from the name of Sir Thomas Dingley, an English knight of the Order of <span class="loc">St. John</span>, who owned much of the lands in the surrounding area. Rock-cut tombs dating back to Phoenician, Carthaginian and Roman times have been found in the limits of <span class="loc">Dingli</span>. Roman baths and other remains were also found at Għajn Handful and the area of <span class="loc">Ta</span><span class="loc">'</span> <span class="loc">Baldu</span>. Until the early 16th century, a small village known as Ħal Tartarni existed, somewhere between <span class="loc">Buskett</span> and the present location of <span class="loc">Dingli</span>. The village was one of the ten original <span class="loc">parishes of Malta</span> by 1436, having a church dedicated to Saint Domenica. The original church no longer exists, but a nearby chapel built in 1669 with the same dedication is still standing.</p>
