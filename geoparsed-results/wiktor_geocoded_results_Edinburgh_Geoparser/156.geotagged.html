<p><span class="loc">San Vicente</span> is a municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Palawan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 30,919 people. <span class="loc">San Vicente</span> is located in the north-western side of the main island of <span class="loc">Palawan</span> and is 186 kilometres (116 mi) from <span class="loc">Puerto Princesa City</span>. It occupies a total land area of 146,294 hectares (361,500 acres). <span class="loc">San Vicente</span>'s 14.2 kilometres (8.8 mi) of beachfront is being converted into an emerging tourist destination that will be the beneficiary of government spending on infrastructure. In 1952, migrants from <span class="loc">Manamoc</span>, an island of the Cuyo Archipelago, arrived in a place called Malagnang ( muddy/ maputik) a sitio of Kemdeng, formerly part of <span class="loc">Puerto Princesa City</span>. The first to arrive were the Dandal brothers (<span class="loc">Anastacio</span>, <span class="loc">Ricardo</span>, and <span class="loc">Lauro</span>), Alberto Radam, and Marcelino Gadiano with their families. After sometime their relatives followed forming a small community which gave rise to the election of Anastascio Dandal as the first Barrio Lieutenant. The small ethnic group of Agutayno and Cuyuno increased in number and with the increase disputes emerged particularly in the choice of the Townâ€™s Patron Saint. The Cuyuno wanted <span class="loc">Saint Vincent Ferrer</span> while the choice of Agutayno was Saint <span class="loc">Isidro</span> <span class="loc">Labrador</span>. The group decided to resolve the issue by drawing a lot. The name of <span class="loc">Saint Vincent Ferrer</span> was drawn thus the name Malagnang was changed to <span class="loc">San Vicente</span>.</p>
