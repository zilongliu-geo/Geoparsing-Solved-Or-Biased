<p><span class="loc">Pacheco</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,685 at the 2010 census. It is located 5.5 miles (9 km) north of <span class="loc">Walnut Creek</span>.

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, <span class="loc">Pacheco</span> has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated "Csb" on climate maps. The town was laid out in 1857 by Dr. J.H. Carothers and named for Salvio Pacheco, grantee of the Rancho Monte del Diablo Mexican land grant. A post office operated at <span class="loc">Pacheco</span> from 1859 to 1913 and from 1955 to the present. <span class="loc">Pacheco</span> was briefly a prosperous commercial center. During this period, Pacheco Slough was deep enough to receive ocean-based shipping. A series of fires and floods, as well as an earthquake, destroyed the town and filled the Slough with silt during the 1860s. <span class="loc">Pacheco</span> was subsequently depopulated by the attraction of the nearby town of <span class="loc">Todos Santos</span>, later to be known as Concord.</p>
