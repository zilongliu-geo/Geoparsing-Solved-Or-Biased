<p><span class="loc">Claremont</span> is a city along the eastern border of <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, 32.5 miles (52.3 km) east of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. It is located in the eastern <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Gabriel</span> Valley, at the foothills of the <span class="loc">San Gabriel Mountains</span>. The Claremont Colleges are located in the city. The population, as of the 2014 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, is 36,054. <span class="loc">Claremont</span> is known for its many educational institutions, its tree-lined streets, and its historic buildings. In July 2007, it was rated by CNN/Money magazine as the fifth best place to live in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, and was the highest rated place in <span class="loc">California</span> on the list. Due to its large number of trees and residents with doctoral degrees, it is sometimes referred to as "The City of Trees and PhDs". The city is primarily residential, with a significant portion of its commercial activity revolving around "The Village", a popular collection of street-front small stores, boutiques, art galleries, offices, and restaurants adjacent to and west of the Claremont Colleges. The Village was expanded in 2007, adding a controversial  multi-use development that includes a cinema, a boutique hotel, retail space, offices, and a parking structure on the site of an old citrus packing plant just west of Indian Hill Boulevard. Some critics say that the expansion negatively altered the original, small-town feel of The Village.</p>
