<p><span class="loc">Bombon</span> is a fourth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 15,437 people. Like any other municipalities in the province, the town of <span class="loc">Bombon</span> also started as a mere barrio or "visita". It was dependent on the town of the ancient <span class="loc">Quipayo</span> for nearly 240 years, now a mere barangay of Calabanga town. It finally gained its independence during the arrival of the Americans on February 11, 1900. This taste of freedom was, however, momentary for after the establishment of the Civil Government occurred in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> in the year 1903, <span class="loc">Bombon</span> was ceded to the municipality of <span class="loc">Calabanga</span> . The municipality of <span class="loc">Bombon</span> also became a barrio of <span class="loc">Magarao</span>, now another town in the second district. For more than forty years of waiting, it was finally given its proclamation as a town by virtue of Executive Order (EO) 251 dated July 27, 1949 signed by the former President Elpidio Quirino.The mayor at the time was Jose Buenagua Sr, whose son Jose Buenagua Jr went on to be the Provincial Engineer of <span class="loc">Albay</span>. Jose Jr now resides in <span class="loc">Scottsdale</span> <span class="loc">AZ</span>. He had also two daughters, Irene Buenagua Fernandez and Lydia Buenagua <span class="loc">Guerrero</span>, both retired teachers, and three other sons, Salvador, <span class="loc">Melchor</span>, and Diogenes Buenagua who are all still residing in <span class="loc">Bombon</span>. The acquired independence continued permanently and it served well its constituents.</p>
