  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Burlington</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Mineral County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> located along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 50 (also known as the Northwestern Turnpike) where it crosses <span class="loc">Pattersons Creek</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, its population was 182. It is part of the <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, <span class="loc">MD-WV Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The ZIP code for <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is 26710. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is the home of the Old Fashioned Apple Harvest Festival (started in <span class="date">1973</span>), which has grown into the biggest celebration of its kind in the Eastern Panhandle of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. It is held annually on <span class="date">the first weekend of October</span>. <span class="loc">Burlington</span> is situated along the old Northwestern Turnpike (<span class="loc">US</span> 50) in southeastern <span class="loc">Mineral County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. German and English settlers began to populate the area of <span class="loc">Burlington</span> in <span class="date">the second quarter</span> of the 18th century following the surveying of <span class="loc">Patterson Creek</span> Manor by Thomas, <span class="per">Lord Fairfax</span> in <span class="date">1738</span>. The village took shape around the turn of the 19th century as several mills constructed along <span class="loc">Mill Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Patterson Creek</span> brought commerce to the region. The <span class="org">Burlington Post Office</span> was established on <span class="date">September 24, 1827</span>. (It was closed from 1844-1853 and from 1860-1867). The construction of the Northwestern Turnpike through <span class="loc">Burlington</span> in <span class="date">1831</span> helped to further its development into a regional center for commerce. Many of the houses admired for their architecture in the village <span class="date">today</span> were constructed in the first half of the 19th century during this time of economic prosperity. One of the oldest houses in <span class="loc">Burlington</span>, the Homestead, was built as a tavern to service the stage coach traffic which came through the village along the turnpike. Constructed by <span class="per">John</span> and <span class="per">Ruth</span> <span class="per">Ann Vandiver</span>, the Homestead continued to serve as an inn and restaurant well into the mid-twentieth century.</p><br><br>
