<p>200 Knucklehead's patrons brawl in <span class="loc">Chiefland</span>. Off-duty officers from three agencies were called in early Saturday to break up a <span class="loc">Chiefland</span> bar brawl that turned into a street fight involving as many as 200 people. <span class="loc">Chiefland</span> Police Chief Robert Douglas said his officers were called to Knucklehead’s Bar at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday to break up a fight that had moved to the parking lot. The first officers on the scene called for backup immediately due to the size of the brawl and then waited for additional officers from the police department, the <span class="loc">Levy County</span> Sheriff’s Office, the Florida Highway Patrol and all off-duty officers in the area to arrive. “Even with all that manpower, it took about 30 minutes to remove the crowd and break up all the fights,” Douglas said. He characterized the participants as mostly men in the 20s and 30s, with most from the <span class="loc">Chiefland</span> or <span class="loc">Cross City</span> areas. A motive for the fighting had not been established by Monday morning. “We have had some fights at that bar, but none this big,” Douglas said. “We aren’t sure what started this, but when we got there the majority of the fighting was in the parking lot where there were guys swinging bar stools. Some officers were hit in the head. It was a street fight.” One man was arrested, although others could have been charged for a variety of offenses, officials said. “As the fights were broken up, people ran off and that is something we will be addressing for future events,” Douglas said.</p>
