  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 152,021. The largest city and county seat is <span class="per">Monroe</span>. The county was established as the second county (after <span class="loc">Wayne County</span>) in the Michigan Territory in <span class="date">1817</span> and was named for then-President <span class="per">James Monroe</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Monroe</span>, <span class="loc">MI</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area and is included in the Detroit-Warren-Ann <span class="loc">Arbor</span>, <span class="loc">MI</span> Combined Statistical Area.

The small plot of land was given to the early French settlers by the Potawatomi Native Americans, and the area was claimed for New <span class="loc">France</span>. The settlement of <span class="loc">Frenchtown</span> and the slight northerly settlement of <span class="loc">Sandy Creek</span> drew in a total of about 100 inhabitants.
