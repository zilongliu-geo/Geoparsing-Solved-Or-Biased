<p><span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and is a suburb of <span class="loc">Sioux Falls</span>. The population was 4,089 by the 2010 census, having grown from 958 in 2000 census. The population of the Harrisburg zip code has grown from 2,476 in 2000 to 10,342 in 2010. Before the railroad was built through <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span>, a stagecoach brought mail to the <span class="loc">Johnson</span> <span class="loc">Harris Homestead</span> located on <span class="loc">Nine Mile Creek</span> in Dayton Township. Johnson Harris named the post office <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> in honor of himself. The history of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> started August 1, 1879, when the first train came rolling through the territory. The train went from <span class="loc">Sioux City</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, to <span class="loc">Sioux Falls</span>, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>. The post office was moved to the Emory J. Darling Homestead, 1 mile south of what is now <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>. The post office was called Salina in honor of Mrs. Jim Stillwell, an early settler and a highly respected teacher. Finally in 1890, the depot was moved to its present site. The post office took back its original name and the town of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> was born.</p>
