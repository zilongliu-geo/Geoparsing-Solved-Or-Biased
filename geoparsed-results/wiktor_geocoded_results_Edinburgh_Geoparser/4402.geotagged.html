<p><span class="loc">Mineral County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, <span class="loc">MD-WV Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. As of the 2010 census, the population was 28,212. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Keyser</span>. The county was founded in 1866. <span class="loc">Mineral County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>, <span class="loc">MD-WV Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It was not until after <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> became a state in 1863 that present-day <span class="loc">Mineral County</span> was organized. It was created in 1866 by an Act of the West Virginia Legislature from the existing <span class="loc">Hampshire County</span>. The name was selected due to its reserves of minerals, especially coal (although, technically, coal is not a true mineral). The northern terminus of the <span class="loc">Allegheny Front</span> in <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> lies in <span class="loc">Mineral County</span>, and contains the highest point in the county. Known as the Pinnacle it is 3,104 feet (946 m) above sea level. From the abandoned fire tower you can see four states on a clear day, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, and Virginia. The <span class="loc">Allegheny Front</span> is the largest mountain in the county; on the north end it is also known as <span class="loc">Green Mountain</span>. On top of the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> Plateau is located the town of <span class="loc">Elk Garden</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> in the southwestern portion of the county. The Potomac River Valley lies to west and north of the mountain, and the New Creek Valley lies to the east.</p>
