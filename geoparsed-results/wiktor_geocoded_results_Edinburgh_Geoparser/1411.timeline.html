  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Augusta</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Oneida County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,020 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The Town of <span class="loc">Augusta</span> is in the southwest part of the county. <span class="loc">Augusta</span> was settled in <span class="date">1793</span> by a man named <span class="per">Gunn</span>, whose son, <span class="per">Peter Smith Gunn</span>, was the first child born in the town. The first attempt to organize the town was in <span class="date">1797</span>. A bill was considered in the <span class="loc">New York</span> State Legislature and passed the <span class="org">Assembly</span>, but failed in <span class="org">the Senate</span> because Senator <span class="per">Samuel Jones</span> noted that town officers must be freeholders and many of the prospective town officials were lessees of <span class="per">Peter Smith</span>'s land. Organization was successful <span class="date">the next year</span> and <span class="loc">Augusta</span> was created as a town simultaneously with the creation of <span class="loc">Oneida County</span> on <span class="date">March 15, 1798</span>. It was created from part of the town of <span class="loc">Whitestown</span>. The first town meeting was held on <span class="date">April 3, 1798</span>. The following positions were filled: Town supervisor, Town Clerk, Assessors (4), Commissioner of Highways (3), <span class="org">Overseers of the Poor</span> (2), <span class="per">Constable</span> and <span class="per">Collector</span>, <span class="org">Inspectors of Schools</span> (3), Fence viewers (3).</p><br><br>
