  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">China</span> has announced a new outbreak of avian flu <span class="date">today</span> along with similar cases in <span class="loc">Russia</span>, <span class="loc">Romania</span>, and <span class="loc">Macedonia</span>. <span class="loc">China</span>'s news agency reported that 2,600 birds have died of the H5N1 strain in northern <span class="loc">China</span>, declaring that the outbreak was found in a breeding facility in <span class="loc">Hohhot</span>, the capital of <span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span>. The government maintains the epidemic is under control. <span class="loc">Russia</span> is waiting for confirmation that it was the H5N1 strain that killed several hundred ducks near <span class="loc">Moscow</span>; if the tests return positive it will be a major spread of the virus across the <span class="loc">Ural Mountains</span>, into european <span class="loc">Russia</span>. A small village in southern <span class="loc">Macedonia</span> also suspects the strain. Plans are already made to kill 10,000 birds to contain the outbreak. <span class="loc">Romania</span> confirmed that there has been another outbreak in the <span class="loc">Danube Delta</span> area. The strain was confirmed there <span class="date">last weekend</span>, whereupon 4,500 birds were destroyed. H5N1 is the strain scientists fear could be transmitted from human to human, causing a flu pandemic. So far 50 people have died of it, all having worked closely with birds. It is not easy to pass the disease from bird to human.</p><br><br>
