<p><span class="loc">Newcastle</span> is a community within the Town of <span class="loc">Drumheller</span>, <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It held village status for eight years between 1923 and 1931, and was recognized as a hamlet prior to annexation by <span class="loc">Drumheller</span> in 1967. The community is located within the <span class="loc">Red Deer River</span> valley on South Dinosaur Trail (Highway 838), approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) west of <span class="loc">Drumheller</span>'s main townsite.

Over the course of its incorporation, <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> had a population of 281 and 304 in 1926 and 1931 respectively.
