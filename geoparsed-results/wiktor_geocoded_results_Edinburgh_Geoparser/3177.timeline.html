  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fremont</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Rockingham County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,283 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Fremont</span> is crossed by the Rockingham Recreation Trail (a rail trail) and NH Route 107. Settled in the 1720s, <span class="loc">Fremont</span> was originally part of <span class="loc">Exeter</span>. The area was once famous for its heavy growth of high-quality eastern white pine trees, reserved for use as masts of the Royal Navy. But residents began to use the wood for home construction. When in <span class="date">1734</span> <span class="per">David Dunbar</span>, surveyor-general, visited the <span class="loc">Copyhold</span> Mill to inspect fallen lumber, local citizens assembled, discharged firearms, and convinced <span class="loc">Dunbar</span> to leave. Returning with 10 men, <span class="per">Dunbar</span>'s group was attacked, and dispersed to a local tavern, by citizens disguised as Indians. This insurrection would be known as the Mast Tree Riot. The town was granted in <span class="date">1764</span> by Colonial Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span> as Poplin. In <span class="date">1853</span>, Poplin petitioned the state legislature to change the name. In <span class="date">1854</span>, it became <span class="loc">Fremont</span> after General <span class="per">John C. Fr√©mont</span>, the first candidate of the Republican Party in the presidential election of <span class="date">1856</span>. <span class="loc">Benton</span> in <span class="loc">Grafton County</span> bears the name of Fremont's father-in-law, Senator <span class="per">Thomas Hart Benton</span>.</p><br><br>
