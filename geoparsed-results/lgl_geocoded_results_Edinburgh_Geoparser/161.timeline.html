  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Six <span class="loc">Clayton County</span> students honored. If you could ignore the flash of cameras, the hovering video recorders and a celebrity or two, it was just the ladies having an intimate, upscale <span class="date">Sunday</span> lunch. A bit of conversation and a little food — OK, a gourmet meal including filet mignon and crème brulée — shared by six high school seniors and a few new friends, hosted by <span class="per">Tanya Rodriguez</span> Ski in her eight-bedroom Dunwoody home. It was, she said, an awards ceremony disguised as a get-together. “We have our own legends right here in our town. I want these young ladies to get a chance to sit down and talk with people they might read about or see on television,” Ski said. In its second such event, the Frank Ski Kids Foundation was honoring six <span class="loc">Clayton County</span> high school students chosen for their leadership and academics: <span class="per">Mia Gipson</span>, <span class="per">Morgan McGhee</span>, Janeau’ Wright, Genetta Reeves, Chidinma <span class="per">Anyiwo</span> and <span class="per">Kayla</span> Swain. They represented <span class="loc">Lovejoy</span>, <span class="loc">Jonesboro</span>, Mundy’s Mill and <span class="loc">North Clayton</span> high schools. The Frank Ski Kids Foundation is named for the V-103 radio personality; <span class="per">Tanya</span> is his wife and the group’s president. As the sun streamed in, Fleming’s Steakhouse produced a steady stream of dishes. At one end of the table was Grammy winner Monica; at the other, Xernona Clayton, former assistant to the <span class="per">Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</span>, and later an executive at <span class="org">TBS</span>. Monica cautioned the teens that every person’s actions can be for good or ill. She urged them not to surrender control of their lives, saying, “I have never believed in living in somebody else’s shadow. I made my own decisions. What outside people think, you need to keep on the outside.” Clayton, founder of the Trumpet Awards Foundation, which honors accomplished African-Americans, praised <span class="date">Sunday</span>’s event. “I hope these kids will learn and pass it on. As a society, we must help each other,” she said. The high school seniors were transported to the event in a 30-foot Escalade limousine. After lunch, they were given an upscale goodie bag that included a BCBG dress, a set of fragrances, a devotion book, an overnight bag and a certificate of accomplishment. Oh — and a $1,000 scholarship. “I was pretty shocked,” said <span class="per">Kayla</span> Swain, a <span class="loc">Lovejoy</span> senior who expects to attend <span class="org">Ohio State University</span> in the fall. The money, advice and support are meant to reward talented young women but also to add to their momentum. For instance, <span class="per">Chidinma Anyiwo</span> is a Mundy’s Mill senior who is headed <span class="date">next year</span> to the <span class="org">University</span> of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>. <span class="date">Four years</span> from <span class="date">now</span>, she hopes to be ready for medical school. <span class="date">Four years ago</span>, she was in <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. “My uncle was here,” she said, “and he said if we came here, we would get more opportunity to become whatever we want to be.” It's a Southern tradition like nowhere else.</p><br><br>
