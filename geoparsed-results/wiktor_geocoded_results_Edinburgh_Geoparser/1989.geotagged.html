<p><span class="loc">Montebello</span> (Italian for beautiful mountain) is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located in the southwestern area of the <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Valley on 8.4 sq mi (22 km2) 8 mi (13 km) east of downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. It is considered part of the Gateway Cities, and is a member of the Gateway Cities Council of Governments. In the early 20th century, <span class="loc">Montebello</span> was a well-known source for oil reserves. At the 2010 census, the population was 62,500. The estimated population as of July 1, 2013 was 63,495. Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the area known today as <span class="loc">Montebello</span>, the land along the <span class="loc">Rio</span> <span class="loc">Hondo River</span> was populated by the Tongva (Gabrielino) portion of the Uto-Aztecan family of Native Americans. The Tongva occupied much of the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> basin and the southern <span class="loc">Channel Islands</span> - <span class="loc">Santa Catalina</span>, <span class="loc">San Nicolas</span>, <span class="loc">San Clemente</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Barbara</span>; when Spanish explorer Juan Rodrigues <span class="loc">Cabrillo</span> arrived off the shores of <span class="loc">Santa Catalina</span> in 1542, he was met by the Tongva people. Because the language of the Tongva was different from the neighboring tribes it was called "Gabrielino" by the Spanish. As more non-natives arrived and settlements were established, illness and disease came with them. By 1870, the area had few remaining indigenous inhabitants as disease brought by the Europeans killed many of the Tongva.</p>
