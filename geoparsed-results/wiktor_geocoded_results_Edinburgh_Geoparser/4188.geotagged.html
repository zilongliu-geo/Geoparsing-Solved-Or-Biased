<p><span class="loc">Dundee</span> (/dʌnˈdiː/; Scottish Gaelic: Dùn Dè [ˈt̪uːn tʲeː]), officially the <span class="loc">City of Dundee</span>, is <span class="loc">Scotland</span>'s fourth largest city and the 51st most populous built-up area in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. At the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Dundee</span> had a population density of 8,541.8/sq mi (3,298.0/km2), the second highest of any Scottish city. The mid-year population estimate for 2014 is 148,260. It lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Firth of Tay</span>, which feeds into the <span class="loc">North Sea</span>. Under the name of <span class="loc">Dundee City</span>, it forms one of the 32 council areas used for local government in <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. Historically part of <span class="loc">Angus</span>, the city developed into a burgh in medieval times, and expanded rapidly in the 19th century largely due to the jute industry. This, along with its other major industries gave <span class="loc">Dundee</span> its epithet as city of "jute, jam and journalism". <span class="loc">Dundee</span>'s recorded population reached a peak of 182,204 at the 1971 census. Today, <span class="loc">Dundee</span> is promoted as 'One City, Many Discoveries' in honour of <span class="loc">Dundee</span>'s history of scientific activities and of the RRS Discovery, Robert Falcon Scott's Antarctic exploration vessel, which was built in <span class="loc">Dundee</span> and is now berthed in the city harbour. Biomedical and technological industries have arrived since the 1980s, and the city now accounts for 10% of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>'s digital-entertainment industry. <span class="loc">Dundee</span> has two universities—the University of <span class="loc">Dundee</span> and the <span class="loc">Abertay</span> University. In 2014 <span class="loc">Dundee</span> was recognised by the United Nations as the <span class="loc">UK</span>'s first <span class="loc">UNESCO City</span> of Design for its diverse contributions to fields including medical research, comics and video games.</p>
