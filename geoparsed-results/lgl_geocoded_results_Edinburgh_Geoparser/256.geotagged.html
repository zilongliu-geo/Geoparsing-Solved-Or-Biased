<p>Man accused of possessing child porn. Terry Lee Jolly, 60, <span class="loc">Lebanon</span>, was arrested Thursday on a charge of possession child pornography. Jolly, who has no prior arrest record in <span class="loc">Boone County</span>, was taken into custody by <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> Police after a 5 p.m. Thursday traffic stop, LPD Lt. Brent Wheat said in a press release. He was formally arrested later Thursday after an interview with LPD detectives, Wheat said. Child pornography is a class D felony, which carries a sentence of up to three years in prison. Jolly, who gave addresses in the 700 block of <span class="loc">East Washington Street</span> and the 400 block of Elm Street, was held on $505 bond in the <span class="loc">Boone County Jail</span>. <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> Police and the <span class="loc">Boone County</span> Sheriff’s Office began an investigation after a <span class="loc">Boone County</span> 911 dispatcher said Jolly might have illegal images on a computer. Detectives from both agencies worked on the investigation, LPD Chief Tom Garoffolo said. Police confiscated “a large amount of computer equipment and other items” at three locations, Wheat said.</p>
