<p>Nelson (Sinixt: k'iya'lmup, Ktunaxa: ʔaqyamǂup) is a city located in the <span class="loc">Selkirk Mountains</span> on the extreme <span class="loc">West Arm</span> of <span class="loc">Kootenay Lake</span> in the Southern Interior of British Columbia, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Known as "The <span class="loc">Queen City</span>", and acknowledged for its impressive collection of restored heritage buildings from its glory days in a regional silver rush, Nelson is one of the three cities forming the commercial and population core of the <span class="loc">West Kootenay region</span>, the others being <span class="loc">Castlegar</span> and Trail. The city is the seat of the Regional District of Central <span class="loc">Kootenay</span>. It is represented in the provincial legislature by the riding of Nelson-Creston, and in the Parliament of <span class="loc">Canada</span> by the riding of British Columbia Southern Interior. The <span class="loc">West Kootenay region</span> of British Columbia, where the <span class="loc">city of Nelson</span> is situated, is part of the traditional territories of the Sinixt (or Lakes) and Ktunaxa (Kutenai) peoples. Gold and silver were found in the area in 1867. Following the discovery of silver at nearby <span class="loc">Toad Mountain</span> in 1886, the town boomed quickly, leading to incorporation in 1897. Two railways were built to pass through Nelson. Due to its location near transportation corridors, Nelson grew to supply the local mining activity and soon became a transportation and distribution centre for the region.</p>
