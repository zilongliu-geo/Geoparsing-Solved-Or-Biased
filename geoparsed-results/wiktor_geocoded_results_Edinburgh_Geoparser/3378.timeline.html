  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Mere is a small town and civil parish in <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies at the extreme southwestern tip of <span class="loc">Salisbury Plain</span>, close to the borders of <span class="loc">Somerset</span> and <span class="loc">Dorset</span>. The parish includes the hamlets of <span class="loc">Barrow Street</span>, <span class="loc">Burton</span>, <span class="loc">Charnage</span>, <span class="loc">Limpers Hill</span>, <span class="loc">Rook Street</span> and <span class="loc">Southbrook</span>. The A303 trunk road passed through Mere until a bypass was built on the northern edge of the town in <span class="date">1976</span>. There is an old market square (although markets have not been held for <span class="date">several years</span>), a chiming town clock and a large 15th-century parish church. The steep slope of <span class="loc">Castle Hill</span> rises from the northwestern side of Mere. Local industry and commerce includes the Hill Brush company, large wholesale plant nurseries and Yapp's wine merchants. <span class="org">Evidence</span> of prehistoric activity in the area is provided by bowl barrows, including four on <span class="loc">Long Hill</span>, overlooking the town. On the northwestern boundary of the parish is <span class="loc">Whitesheet Hill</span>, with barrows and an Iron Age hill fort, White Sheet camp. Mere had a church from the end of the 12th century. The <span class="per">Earl of Cornwall</span> built Mere Castle on <span class="loc">Long Hill</span>, overlooking the town, in the mid-13th century. The castle was abandoned in the 14th century and <span class="date">today</span> only earthworks remain. The Duchy of <span class="per">Cornwall</span> still owns much land in the area.</p><br><br>
