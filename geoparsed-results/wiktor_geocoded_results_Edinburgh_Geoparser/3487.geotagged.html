The two men were on their way from <span class="loc">Decatur</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span> back to <span class="loc">Bloomington</span> after a business trip and stopped to rest their horses on the open prairie halfway between the two cities. It occurred to them that this was an ideal location for a settlement, as there was nothing else nearby. They named the town in honor of DeWitt Clinton.</p>
