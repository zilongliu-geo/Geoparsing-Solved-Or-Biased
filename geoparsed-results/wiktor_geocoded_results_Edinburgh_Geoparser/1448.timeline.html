  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Martinez</span> (/mɑːrˈtiːnᵻs/ mar-TEE-niss or /mɑːrˈtiːnɛθ/ mar-TEE-neth; Spanish: Martínez) is a city and the county seat of Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 35,824 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The downtown is notable for its large number of preserved old buildings. <span class="per">Martinez</span> is located on the south side of the <span class="loc">Carquinez Strait</span> in the <span class="loc">San</span> Francisco Bay Area, directly facing the <span class="loc">city of Benicia</span>. In <span class="date">1824</span> the <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> Valley was included in the Rancho El Pinole Mexican land grant to <span class="per">Ygnacio</span> Martínez. In <span class="date">1847</span>, Dr. <span class="per">Robert Semple</span> contracted to provide ferry service from <span class="loc">Martinez</span> to <span class="loc">Benicia</span>, which for <span class="date">many years</span> was the only crossing on the <span class="loc">Carquinez Strait</span>. By <span class="date">1849</span>, Martínez served as a way station for the <span class="loc">California</span> Gold Rush. The town was laid out in <span class="date">1849</span> by <span class="per">Col. William M. Smith</span> and named for <span class="per">Martinez</span>. It became the county seat in <span class="date">1850</span>, but could not incorporate at the time because it lacked the 200 registered voters required, and only became a city in <span class="date">1876</span>. <span class="per">Martinez</span> was the home of <span class="per">John Muir</span> from <span class="date">1880</span> until his death in <span class="date">1914</span>. He was buried about a mile south of the building that is <span class="date">now</span> the <span class="org">John Muir National Historic Site</span>. Also nearby is the <span class="per">Vicente Martinez</span> Adobe, built in <span class="date">1849</span> by the son of <span class="per">Ygnacio Martinez</span>.</p><br><br>
