<p><span class="loc">Medina</span> (/məˈdiːnə/; Arabic: المدينة المنورة‎, al-Madīnah al-Munawwarah, "the radiant city"; or المدينة, al-Madīnah, "the city"), also transliterated as Madīnah, is a city in the <span class="loc">Hejaz</span>, and the capital of the Al Madinah Region of <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span>. The city contains al-Masjid an-Nabawi ("the Prophet's Mosque"), which is the burial place of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and is the second-holiest city in <span class="loc">Islam</span> after Mecca. <span class="loc">Medina</span> was Muhammad's destination after his Hijrah from Mecca, and became the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire, first under Muhammad's leadership, and then under the first four Rashidun caliphs, <span class="loc">Abu Bakr</span>, <span class="loc">Umar</span>, <span class="loc">Uthman</span>, and Ali. It served as the power base of <span class="loc">Islam</span> in its first century where the early Muslim community developed. <span class="loc">Medina</span> is home to the three oldest mosques, namely the Quba Mosque, al-Masjid an-Nabawi, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn ("the mosque of the two qiblas"). Muslims believe that the chronologically final surahs of the Quran were revealed to Muhammad in <span class="loc">Medina</span>, and are called Medinan surahs in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.</p>
