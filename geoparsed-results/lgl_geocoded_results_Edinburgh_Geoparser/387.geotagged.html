<p>Grand jury indicts man for fleeing traffic stop. A 24-year-old Elkhart man who allegedly fled from an officer during the course of a traffic stop this past September has been indicted by an <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> grand jury. William Lee Spafford III, 24, of <span class="loc">Elkhart</span> was indicted March 4 on the felony charge of evading arrest/detention with a vehicle, according to records released by the <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> district clerk’s office. Shortly after 9 p.m. on Sept. 21, <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> sheriff’s deputy Ronnie Howell attempted to make a stop on a 2001 Mercury Sabre for failure to yield the right of way, according to <span class="loc">Anderson County</span> Sheriff Greg Taylor. The vehicle’s driver, later identified as Spafford, turned on to CR 2202 — also known as Salt Works Road — and stopped in the general vicinity of the Westwood Elementary School, according to the sheriff. As the deputy was approaching the car, Spafford accelerated from the scene, with Howell giving pursuit, according to Taylor. Spafford drove at “unsafe speeds” at times during the ensuing pursuit of approximately eight miles until slamming on his brakes on FM 645 in the <span class="loc">Tennessee Colony</span> area, causing the deputy’s vehicle to strike the back of his Sabre, the sheriff stated. The suspect then exited his vehicle and fled on foot, but was subsequently apprehended by Howell following a short foot pursuit, according to Taylor. The sheriff said Spafford appeared “delusional” following his arrest, saying the Mexican MafiaÂ was “after him.” Â Other indictments recently handed down by the grand jury included: Joyce Glover, 22, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, date of alleged offense, Nov. 23, 2008. Michael Smith, 49, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, date of alleged offense, Dec. 18, 2008. Bruce James Hogue, 44, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, date of alleged offense, Sept. 19, 2008. Bobbie Lynn Kennemore, 37, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, date of alleged offense, Nov. 16, 2008. Ashley Lynn Turner, 23, <span class="loc">Palestine</span>, date of alleged offense, Nov. 26, 2008. Jeffery Bernard McDaniel, 41, <span class="loc">Grapeland</span>, date of alleged offense, Nov. 1, 2008. Christopher McKay Ridings, 20, <span class="loc">Tennessee Colony</span>, date of alleged offense, Dec. 19, 2008.</p>
