<p><span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is located in the Arkansas Delta in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The county is named for Andrew Jackson, a national hero during the War of 1812. By the county's formation in 1829, Jackson had become the seventh President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Jackson County</span> is home to seven incorporated towns and four incorporated cities, including <span class="loc">Newport</span>, the largest city and county seat. The county is also the site of numerous unincorporated communities and ghost towns. Occupying 633.94 square miles (164,190 ha), <span class="loc">Woodruff County</span> is the 41st largest county of the 75 in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. As of the 2010 Census, the county's population is 17,997 people in 7,601 households. Based on population, the county is the 40th-largest county in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>.

Although no Interstate highways are located in <span class="loc">Jackson County</span>, two <span class="loc">United States</span> highways (<span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 67 (<span class="loc">US</span> 67) and <span class="loc">US</span> 167) and fifteen Arkansas state highways run in the county.
