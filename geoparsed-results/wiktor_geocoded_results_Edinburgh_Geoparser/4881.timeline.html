  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Longwood</span> is a suburban city in <span class="loc">Seminole County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. The population was 13,657 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford, <span class="loc">Florida Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Longwood</span> is located at 28°42′07″N 81°20′42″W. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.6 square miles (15 km2). 5.3 square miles (14 km2) of it is land and 0.3 square miles (0.78 km2) of it (5.17%) is water. Coastal tribes used "The Senator", a 3000-year-old bald cypress which burned down in <span class="date">2012</span>, to find their way over land from the St. <span class="loc">Johns River</span> to trading grounds at Spring Hammock. Later, when Creek Indians and others from the tribes of the Southeast <span class="loc">United States</span> fled into Spanish <span class="loc">Florida</span> and settled new villages among escaped African slaves, they became the Seminoles. <span class="loc">Longwood</span>, as well as most of <span class="loc">Seminole County</span>, shares its American Colonial history with the early settlement of <span class="org">Orange</span>, Lake, <span class="loc">Brevard</span>, <span class="loc">Volusia</span> and <span class="loc">Osceola Counties</span> that make up the Greater <span class="loc">Orlando metropolitan</span> area and its surrounding environs. Central <span class="loc">Florida</span>'s development began after the Second <span class="org">Seminole War</span>. By the early 1860s, the <span class="loc">cities of Sanford and Orlando</span> were small settlements. Settlers began arriving at what would become <span class="loc">Longwood</span> during the lull between the end of the Seminole Wars in the 1850s and the beginning of the American Civil War in <span class="date">1861</span>.</p><br><br>
