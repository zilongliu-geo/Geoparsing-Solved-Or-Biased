  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mayen</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Mayen-Koblenz District</span> of the Rhineland-Palatinate Federal State of <span class="loc">Germany</span>, in the eastern part of the Volcanic <span class="loc">Eifel Region</span>. As well as the main town, additional settlements include Alzheim, Kürrenberg, Hausen-Betzing, <span class="per">Hausen</span> and <span class="per">Nitztal</span>. <span class="loc">Mayen</span> is the administrative centre of the Vordereifel ‘Collective Municipality’, although it is not part of the municipality. To the west, as well as to the north and south-west of <span class="loc">Mayen</span>, is the country landscape of the <span class="loc">Eifel</span>. To the east, the landscape flattens out, running towards the Koblenz-Neuwied Basin, which is divided into the northern section of Pellenz and the southern section of Maifeld. This area is geographically considered to be part of the <span class="loc">Eifel</span>. <span class="loc">Mayen</span> is often called ‘The Gateway to the <span class="loc">Eifel</span>’. The small river <span class="loc">Nette</span> runs through the town, flowing from the <span class="loc">Eifel</span> towards Weißenthurm on the <span class="loc">Rhine</span>. Even in Roman times, <span class="loc">Mayen</span> (Lat. Megina) was an important economic centre. From the end of the 3rd century up until the Middle Ages, potteries operated here, and their products were traded and sold across <span class="loc">Central Europe</span>. During prehistoric times, nearby quarries were the sources of basalt to make millstones and tuff used to make sarcophagi. These sarcophagi were found buried with significant glass artifacts as grave goods. (Both classes of items are displayed in the <span class="org">Genovevaburg Museum</span> in <span class="loc">Mayen</span>).</p><br><br>
