<p>Cumberland is the northeasternmost town in <span class="loc">Providence County</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, first settled in 1635 and incorporated in 1746. The population was 33,506 at the 2010 census. Cumberland was originally settled as part of <span class="loc">Rehoboth</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, which was purchased from the local Native Americans by the <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span>. It was later transferred to <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> as part of a long-running boundary dispute. The town was named in honor of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. William Blackstone (also spelled William Blaxton in colonial times) was the first European to settle and live in Cumberland. (He was also the first European to have settled in <span class="loc">Boston</span>, but left when he and the newly arrived Puritans disagreed about religion.) He preached his brand of tolerant Christianity under an oak tree that became an inspiration to Christians worldwide. He lived on a farm in the Lonsdale area of Cumberland, where he cultivated the first variety of American apples, the Yellow Sweeting. The site of his home is now occupied by the Ann &amp; Hope mill. The popular tourist destination "Nine Men's Misery" is a tomb found on the grounds of a former Trappist monastery (Abbey of Our Lady of the Valley), part of which was destroyed in a fire in 1950. The Trappists sold the monastery and grounds to the town and part of the building was converted into the Edward J. Hayden Library, aka Cumberland Public Library in 1976. This combined three smaller libraries into one.</p>
