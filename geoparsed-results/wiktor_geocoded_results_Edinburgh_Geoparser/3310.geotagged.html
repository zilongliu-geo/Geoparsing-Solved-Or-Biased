<p><span class="loc">Batavia</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. It was founded in 1833, and is the oldest city in <span class="loc">Kane County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. A small portion of <span class="loc">Batavia</span> lies in <span class="loc">DuPage County</span>. During the latter part of the 19th century, <span class="loc">Batavia</span>, home to six American-style windmill manufacturing companies, became known as "The Windmill City." Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, a federal government-sponsored high-energy physics laboratory, where both the bottom quark and the top quark were first detected, is located in the city. <span class="loc">Batavia</span> is part of a vernacular region known as the Tri-City area, along with St. Charles and <span class="loc">Geneva</span>, all western suburbs of similar size and relative socioeconomic condition. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 26,045, which was estimated to have increased to 26,318 by July 2012. <span class="loc">Batavia</span> was first settled in 1833 by Christopher Payne and his family. Originally called Big Woods for the wild growth throughout the settlement, the town was renamed by local judge and former Congressman Isaac Wilson in 1840 after his former home of <span class="loc">Batavia</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. Because Judge Wilson owned the majority of the town, he was given permission to rename the city.</p>
