  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Northampton</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Northampton County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The borough is located in the <span class="loc">Lehigh</span> Valley region of eastern <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, Northampton's population was 14,985. <span class="loc">Northampton</span> is located 8 miles (13 km) north of <span class="loc">Allentown</span> and 15 miles (24 km) west of Easton at 40°41′2″N 75°29′29″W (40.683896, -75.491353). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the borough/city has a total area of 2.7 square miles (7.0 km2); 2.6 square miles (6.7 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (3.70%), water. Northampton's elevation is 370 feet (110 m) above sea level. The <span class="loc">Lehigh River</span>, which separates <span class="loc">Northampton County</span> from <span class="loc">Lehigh County</span>, forms the city's western border. <span class="loc">Northampton</span> was once a global center for the manufacturing of cement. The <span class="org">Atlas Portland Cement Company</span> was based there, until it was closed in <span class="date">1982</span>, due largely to foreign competition. <span class="loc">Northampton</span> was created from the villages of <span class="loc">Siegfried</span>, <span class="loc">Newport</span> and <span class="loc">Stemton</span>, which together were formed into an alliance in <span class="date">1902</span>. In <span class="date">1909</span>, Atlas petitioned county courts to change the alliance into a borough, reportedly because the change would make it easier for the company to send and receive mail. The <span class="org">Atlas Portland Cement Company</span> plant closed in <span class="date">1982</span>, but city residents many of them former Atlas employees or their descendants — still identify strongly with the company and its history. The <span class="org">Atlas Portland Cement Company</span> supplied most of the cement used in the building of the <span class="loc">Panama Canal</span>.</p><br><br>
