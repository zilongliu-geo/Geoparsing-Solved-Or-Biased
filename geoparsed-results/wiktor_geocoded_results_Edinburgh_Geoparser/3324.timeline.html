  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Paradise is a northeastern suburb of Adelaide in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is bounded on the north side by the River Torrens. Amongst its neighboring suburbs are <span class="loc">Highbury</span>, <span class="loc">Dernancourt</span>, <span class="loc">Athelstone</span>, <span class="loc">Newton</span> and <span class="loc">Campbelltown</span>. Paradise is in the <span class="loc">City of Campbelltown</span> local government area. It was split across the South Australian <span class="loc">House of Assembly</span> electoral <span class="loc">districts of Morialta</span> (south-east part) and <span class="loc">Hartley</span> (north and west parts of Paradise) but has since all been incorporated into Morialta, and is in <span class="org">the Australian House of Representatives</span> Division of <span class="loc">Sturt</span>. The suburb, originally "Shepley", was named "Paradise" by <span class="per">Joseph Ind</span>, who had an orange orchard on the banks of the nearby <span class="loc">Torrens River</span>, and was named for his "Paradise Bridge Hotel" after a property called Paradise near his native <span class="loc">Tetbury</span>. The <span class="per">Ind</span> Orchards were so productive and of such quality that the area was claimed to "truly be a paradise" for fruit. The <span class="per">Ind</span> family settled the area, and built three significant properties of which only one remains in its original form. The first being <span class="org">Balmoral House</span> which was built from the "cellar up" with the original immigrant <span class="per">Joseph Ind</span> moving his family over once the cellar was complete and the ground floor was being built. Balmoral Road was the original entrance to the property. The property is <span class="date">now</span> a retirement village after <span class="per">Christopher Ind</span> and his mother sold and moved to <span class="loc">Sydney</span> with the balance of the family. At the time of the sale the property was in completely unrestored and excellent condition, containing original furnishings from its early <span class="date">days</span>. It featured original horse stables, a croquet lawn and rare trees which had been brought from around the world. The family names are still found in the street names in the area, namely <span class="per">Ind</span> and <span class="per">Christopher</span>.</p><br><br>
