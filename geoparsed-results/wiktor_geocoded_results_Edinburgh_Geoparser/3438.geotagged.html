<p>Sterling is a Home Rule Municipality that is the county seat and the most populous city of <span class="loc">Logan County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city population was 18,211 at the 2010 census. Sterling is located at 40°37′32″N 103°12′42″W (40.625430, -103.211783). It is 128 miles (206 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Denver</span>, and is located on Interstate 76, on the 'eastern plains' of northeastern <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.9 square miles (18 km2), all of it land. The original inhabitants of the <span class="loc">Colorado</span> <span class="loc">High Plains</span> near Sterling were probably paleo-Indians of the Clovis culture. The earliest known European visitors (post-Spanish exploration) to the area were primarily French fur trappers searching for fertile beaver streams in the late-1700s. By that time, the principal Indian tribes occupying the region were the Arapaho and Cheyenne, although war and hunting parties of other Plains tribes such as the <span class="loc">Sioux</span> and <span class="loc">Pawnee</span> probably passed through. Organized exploration of the area by Americans began with the visit on June 26, 1820 of the expedition of Major Stephen Harriman Long, who referred to much of the area between the <span class="loc">Missouri River</span> and the <span class="loc">Rocky Mountains</span> as "The <span class="loc">Great American Desert</span>". One of the final battles of the Indian wars in <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, the Battle of Summit Springs between Tall Bull and his Cheyenne Dog Soldiers and Colonel Eugene A. Carr and the U.S. Army took place near Sterling on July 11, 1869.</p>
