  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Gainesville</span> man gets <span class="date">15 years</span> for killing baby. <span class="per">A Gainesville</span> man cut a plea deal minutes before a jury was to be selected to determine whether he murdered an 11-month-old boy. <span class="per">Tony Servance Jr.</span>, 20, the boyfriend of the <span class="per">Markel Barton</span>’s mother, pleaded no contest to second-degree murder for <span class="per">Markel</span>’s death in <span class="date">November 2007</span>. According to court records, <span class="per">Servance</span> was alone with <span class="per">Markel</span> when the baby stopped breathing. <span class="per">Servance</span> reportedly gave police at least two versions of what happened to <span class="per">Markel</span>. An autopsy showed there was blunt-force trauma to the baby’s head, which caused the internal bleeding that resulted in death. Acting Circuit Judge Mary Day Coker sentenced <span class="per">Servance</span> to <span class="date">15 years</span> in prison to be followed by <span class="date">24 months</span> of probation and also ordered him to attend anger management classes. <span class="per">Markel</span>’s mother chose not to make a statement during sentencing.</p><br><br>
