  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Arlington</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Bureau County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 193 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the Ottawaâ€“Streator <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, located east of the <span class="loc">Quad Cities</span>, <span class="loc">north of Peoria</span> and <span class="loc">Galesburg</span>, <span class="loc">west of LaSalle</span> and <span class="loc">Peru</span>, and southwest of <span class="loc">Rockford</span> and <span class="loc">Chicago</span>. In <span class="date">the early 1900s</span>, <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, which was then called "Lost Grove", was experiencing rapid growth and development. Many companies set up shop to profit from the people flocking to the jobs at the coal mines in this area of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The businesses included a mattress factory, beer brewery, numerous restaurants, a brothel, and many others. The mayor at the time was from <span class="loc">New York</span>, and changed the town's name to <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, after the town of <span class="loc">Arlington</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was about the size of <span class="loc">Peru</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. On <span class="date">November 13, 1909</span>, a fire in a mine shaft killed 259 miners, young and old, at the <span class="org">Cherry</span> coal mine. Authorities sealed the mine to contain the fire, trapping many rescue workers inside. When the mine was opened <span class="date">a week later</span> only twenty men had survived of the hundreds involved. The <span class="date">1909</span> <span class="org">Cherry</span> Mine disaster influenced early workers' compensation laws and labor practices in the coal mining industry. At the time <span class="loc">Illinois</span> had no laws governing working conditions for miners. <span class="loc">Arlington</span>'s growth slowed drastically after this occurrence.</p><br><br>
