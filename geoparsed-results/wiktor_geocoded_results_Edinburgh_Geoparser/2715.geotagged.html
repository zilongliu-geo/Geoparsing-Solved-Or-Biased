<p><span class="loc">Gamboa</span> is a small town in the <span class="loc">Republic of Panama</span>. It was one of a handful of permanent Canal Zone townships, built to house employees of the <span class="loc">Panama Canal</span> and their dependents. The name <span class="loc">Gamboa</span> is the name of a tree of the quince family. <span class="loc">Gamboa</span> is located on a sharp bend of the <span class="loc">Chagres River</span> at the point which feeds Lake Gatun. Just south of <span class="loc">Gamboa</span>, Lake Gatun and the <span class="loc">Chagres</span> meet the <span class="loc">Culebra Cut</span> (<span class="loc">Gaillard Cut</span>) where the Canal cuts through the <span class="loc">Continental Divide</span>. Thus, though <span class="loc">Gamboa</span> is closer to the Pacific side of <span class="loc">Panama</span>, its watershed is on the Atlantic side. A single lane iron and wood bridge crosses the <span class="loc">Chagres</span> and is the only road access to <span class="loc">Gamboa</span>. This bridge is still in use today. Vehicles waiting to pass over the bridge must wait for a stoplight to enter the bridge, since it is only capable of providing space for one lane of traffic at a time. In December 2010 this bridge was the site of massive flooding and huge floating islands passing under the bridge, with trees violently hitting it, which led to the temporary closure of the <span class="loc">Panama Canal</span>.</p>
