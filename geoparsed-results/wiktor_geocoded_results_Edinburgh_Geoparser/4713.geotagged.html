<p><span class="loc">Palermo</span> (Italian: [paˈlɛrmo], Sicilian: Palermu, Latin: <span class="loc">Panormus</span>, from Greek: Πάνορμος, <span class="loc">Panormos</span>, Arabic: بَلَرْم‎, Balarm; Phoenician: זִיז, Ziz) is a city in Insular <span class="loc">Italy</span>, the capital of both the autonomous region of <span class="loc">Sicily</span> and the <span class="loc">Province of Palermo</span>. The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. <span class="loc">Palermo</span> is located in the northwest of the island of <span class="loc">Sicily</span>, right by the Gulf of <span class="loc">Palermo</span> in the <span class="loc">Tyrrhenian Sea</span>. The city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz ('flower'). <span class="loc">Palermo</span> then became a possession of <span class="loc">Carthage</span>, before becoming part of the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and eventually part of the Byzantine Empire, for over a thousand years. The Greeks named the city Panormus meaning 'complete port'. From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of <span class="loc">Sicily</span> when the city first became a capital. The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm, the root for <span class="loc">Palermo</span>'s present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, <span class="loc">Palermo</span> became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Sicily</span> and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor and Conrad IV of <span class="loc">Germany</span>, King of the Romans. Eventually <span class="loc">Sicily</span> would be united with the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Naples</span> to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies until the Italian unification of 1860.</p>
