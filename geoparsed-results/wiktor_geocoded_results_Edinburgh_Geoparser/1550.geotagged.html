<p><span class="loc">Biri</span> is a village in the municipality of Gjøvik, <span class="loc">Oppland county</span>, <span class="loc">Norway</span>. It was formerly classified as a municipality. The <span class="loc">parish of Biri</span> was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1910, the district <span class="loc">Snertingdal</span> was divided from <span class="loc">Biri</span> to form a municipality of its own, leaving <span class="loc">Biri</span> with 2,815 inhabitants. On 1 January 1964, <span class="loc">Biri</span> was incorporated into the neighboring municipality of Gjøvik. Prior to the merger, <span class="loc">Biri</span> had 3,274 inhabitants. <span class="loc">Biri</span> was the center of several small villages including Biri Øverbygd, Udahlsroa and Klomsteinroa. This has traditionally been an agricultural and forestry community. The village of <span class="loc">Biri</span> had a population of 1,389 inhabitants as of 1 January 2009. It is located at Mjøsa Bridge on the west side of Mjøsa lake, between <span class="loc">Lillehammer</span> and Gjøvik. The Vismunda river, which drains into Mjøsa, has been an important lifeline. Biri church (Biri kirke) is a cruciform church dating from 1777. Built of timber, it has 450 seats. The church was erected after the original church burned down. In 1890 there was another major fire, this time at the Biri parsonage. The fire also destroyed church records for 1789-1814 and 1854-1877. In April 2007, major damage in the church led to an extensive rehabilitation.</p>
