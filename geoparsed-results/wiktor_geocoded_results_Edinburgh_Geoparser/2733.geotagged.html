<p>Columbia is a town in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 486 at the 2010 census. Many of the major events of Columbia's past have been summarized in this section from local texts, newspaper accounts, and from the recollections of residents. The first formal record of government is a petition for a Justice of the Peace in 1770 to the Governor of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> by persons living in the <span class="loc">Pleasant River</span> valley. The town of <span class="loc">Columbia</span> was originally known as Township 12. Neighboring Township 13, now <span class="loc">Columbia Falls</span>, was joined with Township 12 and incorporated as the Town of <span class="loc">Columbia</span> in 1796. This association lasted for 67 years until <span class="loc">Columbia Falls</span> incorporated as a separate town in 1863. In the 1790s, "Lottery Townships" (including Twp 12) sold for 20 cents an acre. Alexander Baring refers to a settlement of about 30 Quaker families located near the center of Township 12. Families supported themselves with sawmills and shipbuilding. The first sawmill in <span class="loc">Columbia</span> was in <span class="loc">Epping</span>, near the present Fish and Game Club, built by Moses Worcester. It later burned, giving Burnt Mill Rips its name. Others were as follows: <span class="loc">Little River</span>, <span class="loc">Saco Falls</span>, Branch Brook, <span class="loc">Georgetown</span>, <span class="loc">Webb District</span> and on the Eastern Branch of Great Marsh Stream. Ship building also took place along Branch Brook.</p>
