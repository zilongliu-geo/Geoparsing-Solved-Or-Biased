<p><span class="loc">Mayo</span> is a municipality in the <span class="loc">Papineau</span> <span class="loc">Regional County</span> Municipality of western <span class="loc">Quebec</span>, located northeast of the <span class="loc">city of Gatineau</span> (Buckingham sector). <span class="loc">Mayo</span> is south of the hamlet of Mulgrave-et-Derry. The area which would become the municipality of <span class="loc">Mayo</span> in 1864, just north of the township of <span class="loc">Lochaber</span>, began to be settled in the nineteenth century mainly by Irish and German immigrants as well as French Canadians. The Irish settlers arrived in <span class="loc">Mayo</span> between 1820-1830, pre-famine immigrants. They would have arrived in <span class="loc">Montreal</span> and traveled along the Ottawa river and then along the <span class="loc">Blanche River</span>. The settlers would have found great comfort in their new surroundings, the hilly terrain resembling that of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, and subsequently their new home was named <span class="loc">Mayo</span> after <span class="loc">County Mayo</span> in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. The main industries which drive the economics of the municipality were, and still are, farming and forestry as well as the manufacturing of potash. The people of <span class="loc">Mayo</span> had a strong connection with their Irish roots. The <span class="loc">parish of St. Malachy</span> in <span class="loc">Mayo</span> was very important in the municipality's connection with <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. <span class="loc">In County</span> <span class="loc">Mayo</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span> there is a town called Knock where, in 1879, there were reports of an apparition of the Virgin Mary, St. Joseph and <span class="loc">St. John</span>. The story of this miracle was brought to <span class="loc">Canada</span> as early as 1882, and in 1949 the then pastor of St. Malachy, Father Braceland, was inspired to construct a replica of the Our Lady of Knock Shrine in <span class="loc">Mayo</span>.</p>
