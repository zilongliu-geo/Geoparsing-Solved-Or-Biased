  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ramsgate</span> is a seaside town in the <span class="loc">district of Thanet</span> in <span class="loc">east Kent</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It was one of the great English seaside towns of the 19th century. In <span class="date">2001</span> it had a population of around 40,000. Ramsgate’s main attraction is its coastline, and its main industries are tourism and fishing. The town has one of the largest marinas on the English south coast, and the Port of <span class="loc">Ramsgate</span> has provided cross-channel ferries for <span class="date">many years</span>. <span class="loc">Ramsgate</span> began as a fishing and farming hamlet. The Christian missionary <span class="per">St Augustine</span>, sent by <span class="per">Pope Gregory</span> the Great, landed near <span class="loc">Ramsgate</span> in 597AD. The town is home to the Shrine of <span class="per">St Augustine</span>. The earliest reference to the town is in the Kent Hundred Rolls of 1274-5, both as <span class="per">Remmesgate</span> (in the local personal name of ‘<span class="per">Christina de Remmesgate</span>’) and Remisgat (with reference to the town). The names <span class="per">Ramisgate</span> and <span class="per">Raunsgate</span> appear in the <span class="loc">parish of St. Laurence</span> records circa <span class="date">1290</span>. These are all derived from late Anglo-Saxon ‘Hremmes’ from earlier ‘Hræfnes’ (raven’s) and ‘geat’ (gate), with reference to the gap in the cliffs. In <span class="date">1357</span>, the area became known as Ramesgate.</p><br><br>
