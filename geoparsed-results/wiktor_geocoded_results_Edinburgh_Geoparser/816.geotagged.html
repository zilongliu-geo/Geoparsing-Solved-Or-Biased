<p><span class="loc">Henan</span> (Chinese: 河南) is a province of the <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, located in the central part of the country. Its one-character abbreviation is "豫" (yù), named after <span class="loc">Yuzhou</span> (豫州; Yùzhōu), a Han Dynasty state (zhou) that included parts of <span class="loc">Henan</span>. Although the name of the province (河南) means "south of the river", approximately a quarter of the province lies north of the <span class="loc">Yellow River</span>, also known as the "<span class="loc">Huang He</span>". <span class="loc">Henan</span> is often referred to as <span class="loc">Zhongyuan</span> or <span class="loc">Zhongzhou</span> (中州) which literally means "central plain land" or "midland", although the name is also applied to the entirety of <span class="loc">China</span> proper. <span class="loc">Henan</span> is the birthplace of Chinese civilization with over 3,000 years of recorded history, and remained <span class="loc">China</span>'s cultural, economical, and political center until approximately 1,000 years ago. Numerous heritages have been left behind including the ruins of Shang Dynasty capital city Yin and the Shaolin Temple. Four of the Eight Great Ancient Capitals of <span class="loc">China</span>, <span class="loc">Luoyang</span>, <span class="loc">Anyang</span>, <span class="loc">Kaifeng</span>, and <span class="loc">Zhengzhou</span> are located in <span class="loc">Henan</span>.</p>
