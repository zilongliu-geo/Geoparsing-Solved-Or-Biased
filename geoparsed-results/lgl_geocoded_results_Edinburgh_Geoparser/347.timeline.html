  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Local mayors hit streets with Meals on Wheels. FREMONT — <span class="per">Violet Stubblefield</span> had a look of surprise when she opened the door <span class="date">Wednesday morning</span>. On <span class="date">a typical day</span>, the 96-year-old Fremont woman receives a lunch delivery from <span class="per">Linda Wasserman</span>, a 16-year volunteer with <span class="loc">Fremont</span>-based LIFE ElderCare Meals on Wheels. But on <span class="date">this day</span>, <span class="per">Wasserman</span> brought along a special guest — her husband, <span class="per">Bob</span>, the city's mayor. "Hi, nice to meet you," the mayor said, extending his hand for a handshake. "It's nice to meet you, too "... I read about you all the time," said <span class="per">Stubblefield</span>, who later joked that she would have worn her Oakland A's hat had she known the mayor would be coming. <span class="per">Wasserman</span> was a big A's supporter when the team proposed moving to <span class="loc">Fremont</span>. <span class="per">Wasserman</span> was one of three local mayors to go into their communities <span class="date">Wednesday</span> to deliver meals to senior citizens as part of the annual <span class="org">Mayors for Meals Day</span>. Mayors David W. Smith of <span class="per">Newark</span> and <span class="per">Michael</span> <span class="loc">Sweeney</span> of Hayward also delivered food to their constituents, joining more than 1,000 mayors across the country in the effort. Each day, 2,200 homebound seniors in <span class="loc">Alameda County</span> receive food from one of six regionally run Meals on Wheels programs. For these seniors, the visits are more than just a meal delivery service; they're a chance to talk to someone. "It does put you in touch with reality," he said. <span class="per">Wasserman</span> said he enjoyed the experience and opportunity to get into the community. He said he also appreciates the efforts of the everyday volunteers — the 225 in the Tri-City area — who work together to deliver some 350 meals <span class="date">a day</span>, 90,000 annually.
