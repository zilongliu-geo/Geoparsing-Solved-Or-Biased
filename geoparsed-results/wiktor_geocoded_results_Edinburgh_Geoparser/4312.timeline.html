  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">King County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>. Originally a mining camp, <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> was named by <span class="per">F.X. Schreiner</span> in <span class="date">1893</span> after the Cumberland coal region of the Appalachian Mountains. <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> gained a post office on <span class="date">October 13, 1894</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, the Enumclaw post office serves this area. Although many other mining camps in the area have disappeared, <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> can still be found in the <span class="org">Cascade</span> foothills between Nolte State Park and Kanaskat-Palmer State Park. It is accessible via Southeast <span class="loc">King County</span> backroads. <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> has an all volunteer fire department and is a <span class="loc">King County</span> registered voting precinct. In <span class="date">1989</span> the county-wide transit and sewage waste municipality known as "Metro" (short for Metropolitan <span class="loc">King County</span>), planned a 25-year sewage sludge waste spraying on the 400 acres (1.6 km2) of pristine woods northwest of the town. Following grassroots community protest and objections from the <span class="org">Muckleshoot Native American</span> tribe (who are downriver on the nearby <span class="loc">Green River</span>), the county agreed to create an Environmental impact statement (EIS). The EIS showed a number of toxins present in the sludge, and the project was officially cancelled in <span class="date">1992</span>.</p><br><br>
