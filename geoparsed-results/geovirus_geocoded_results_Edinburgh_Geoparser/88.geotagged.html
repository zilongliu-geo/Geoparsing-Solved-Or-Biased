<p>An outbreak of cholera in <span class="loc">West Africa</span> has resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people, and United Nations (UN) health officials are concerned that inadequate health services in the region could result in many more deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that over 31,250 cases of cholera have been reported so far this year in nine West African countries. It has claimed 488 lives at this point. "If we look at this year's trends, the figures are still going up in many countries," said John Mulangu, a senior regional advisor for the WHO. "If cholera is not brought under control in certain regions, we will soon be talking of... 100,000 cases," he said. "And hospitals and health centres will be overwhelmed. Last year we were not on this scale. The problem is getting worse," Mulangu said. The following West African nations have all been hit by cholera epidemics: <span class="loc">Burkina Faso</span>, <span class="loc">Cote d'Ivoire</span>, <span class="loc">Guinea</span>, <span class="loc">Guinea-Bissau</span>, <span class="loc">Liberia</span>, <span class="loc">Mauritania</span>, <span class="loc">Mali</span>, <span class="loc">Niger</span>, and <span class="loc">Senegal</span>. The WHO issued a statement on Thursday that more countries were at risk. "Outbreaks are likely to spread to Central <span class="loc">Africa</span> - <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>, <span class="loc">Cameroon</span> and <span class="loc">Chad</span> - in the next weeks," it said.</p>
