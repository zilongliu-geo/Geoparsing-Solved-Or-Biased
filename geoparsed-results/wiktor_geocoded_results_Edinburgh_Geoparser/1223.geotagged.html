<p><span class="loc">Jamestown</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Russell County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is the seat of its county. The population was 1,624 at the 2000 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> census. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> is located at 36°59′5″N 85°4′1″W (36.984730, -85.066840). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.2 square miles (5.7 km2), all land. The community was established in 1826 to be the seat of the newly formed <span class="loc">Russell County</span>. It was briefly known as <span class="loc">Jacksonville</span> in honor of General Andrew Jackson, who had just won a plurality of the popular vote during the 1824 presidential election but lost the runoff in the House of Representatives, largely because of the "corrupt bargain" struck by <span class="loc">Henry Clay</span> and John Quincy Adams. However, an anti-Jacksonian party loyal to Clay came into power the same year and the post office was established in November as <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> after local landowner James Wooldridge, who (together with his brother John) had donated 110 acres of land for the town. The act of the state legislature incorporating the city in December continued this name, which the city has used since.</p>
