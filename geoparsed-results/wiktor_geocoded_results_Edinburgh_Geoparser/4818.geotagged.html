<p><span class="loc">Putnam County</span> is a county located in North Central Missouri. As of the 2010 census, the population was 4,979. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Unionville</span>. The county was organized February 28, 1845 and named for Israel Putnam, a hero in the French and Indian War and a general in the American Revolutionary War. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> was established February 28, 1845 from parts of Adair and Sullivan counties. The following year a portion of Putnam was removed to form of <span class="loc">Dodge County</span>. Both Putnam and Dodge extended nearly nine miles further north until a 18561 ruling by the <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> on a border dispute with <span class="loc">Iowa</span> assigned the contested land to <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. Both counties were left with less than the statutory minimum area for a county as set by the state legislature, so <span class="loc">Dodge County</span> was dissolved and its area added to Putnam. In its early years, the county seat changed frequently, often with contentious debate. Putnamville, Bryant Station (both no longer in existence), and <span class="loc">Hartford</span> all served until a central location called Harmony, later renamed <span class="loc">Unionville</span>, was chosen. In the 1860 <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> had 9,240 residents, with eighteen sawmills and three flour mills. Coal had been an abundant since its earliest settlement. Following the arrival of the <span class="loc">Burlington</span> &amp; Southwestern Railway in 1873, coal mining became a major industry, especially in the east of the county. At one time three railroads crossed <span class="loc">Putnam county</span>: the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Milwaukee</span> and St. Paul; the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Burlington</span> and Quincy; and the <span class="loc">Iowa</span> and St. Louis. <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> lost over two-thirds of its population between the years 1900 and 2000 (see census data below), when the <span class="loc">United States</span> changed from a rural to an urban country.</p>
