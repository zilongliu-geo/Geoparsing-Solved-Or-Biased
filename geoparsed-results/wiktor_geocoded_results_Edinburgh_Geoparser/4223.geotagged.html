<p><span class="loc">Winton</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Bournemouth</span> in <span class="loc">Dorset</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) north of <span class="loc">Bournemouth</span> town centre, along Wimborne Road (the A347). The name <span class="loc">Winton</span> derives from <span class="loc">Wintoun</span> Castle in <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, which was home to the Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton, a relative of the Talbot family: landowners who started the development of <span class="loc">Winton</span>. At the beginning of the 19th century the area was just rough heathland, with just a track linking ancient <span class="loc">Moordown</span> Village to Horseshoe Common. In 1805 this all changed when a new main road through <span class="loc">Winton</span> was put in and named Muscliff Road (today it is known as Wimborne Road). Around 1850 wealthy Scottish philanthropists <span class="loc">Georgina</span> and <span class="loc">Marianne</span> <span class="loc">Talbot</span> saw the plight of local workers and set about trying to improve their lives by purchasing land along the road and building four artisan cottages and sinking wells to provide fresh water. By 1891 the population of <span class="loc">Winton</span> had reached 4,000 and by 1894 the needs of <span class="loc">Winton</span> were so great that they were put under the care of the <span class="loc">Winton Parish</span> Council and later in 1897 <span class="loc">Winton Urban</span> District Council was formed. In 1901 <span class="loc">Bournemouth</span> (which was by then a county borough) increased its boundaries to include <span class="loc">Winton</span> and other districts.</p>
