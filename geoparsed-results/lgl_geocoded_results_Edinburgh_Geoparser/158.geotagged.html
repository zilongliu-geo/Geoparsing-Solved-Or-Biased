<p>Water main repaired in north <span class="loc">DeKalb</span>. Repairs have been completed on a water main break in north <span class="loc">DeKalb County</span>, county spokeswoman Kristie Swink said. The 16-inch main broke about 4:30 p.m. Monday. It is 23 feet below grade along the southbound I-85 access road between <span class="loc">Clairmont</span> and <span class="loc">North Druid Hills</span> roads. With workers digging to repair the pipe, one lane of the two-lane road was closed. It will remain closed until the hole in the road is repaired, Swink said. The road could take a couple days to fix, she said.</p>
