  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Taza</span> (Berber: ⵜⴰⵣⴰ, <span class="loc">Taza</span>, in Arabic: تازة) is a city in northern <span class="loc">Morocco</span>, which occupies the corridor between the Rif mountains and <span class="loc">Middle Atlas</span> mountains, about 120 km east of Fez. It is located at 150 km from <span class="loc">Nador</span>, and 210 km from <span class="loc">Oujda</span> (east). It has a population of 144,000 (<span class="date">2004</span> census) and is the capital of <span class="loc">Taza Province</span>. <span class="loc">Taza</span> is located in north-central <span class="loc">Morocco</span>, in the south of the <span class="loc">Rif region</span> right outside the mountain range on a narrow plain. The city is composed of two formerly separate towns built on separate terraces overlooking a mountain valley. The old-Taza town is at an elevation of 1,919 feet (585 m) above sea level and is surrounded by fortifications; the newer town, established by the French in <span class="date">1920</span>, is located in a fertile plain at an elevation of 1,460 feet (445 m). Fossil remains indicate that caves in the area were inhabited as early as the Paleolithic Period. One of the most important caves in <span class="loc">Morocco</span>, Rhar Chara, is close to <span class="loc">Taza</span>. This cave is over 7.6 kilometres long.</p><br><br>
