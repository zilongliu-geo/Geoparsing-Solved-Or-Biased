  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Augusta County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 832 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the Stauntonâ€“Waynesboro <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. As early as <span class="date">1794</span>, <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was platted and divided into 14 lots of 1-acre (4,000 m2) and sold by <span class="per">Thomas</span> and <span class="per">Jane</span> <span class="loc">Steele</span>. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> soon became a very busy stagecoach stop. This was because there were 3 major roads all intersecting at or near <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. One road connected <span class="loc">Greenville</span> with <span class="loc">Staunton</span>, another ran from <span class="loc">Waynesboro</span> to <span class="loc">Middlebrook</span>, and the south road led to Midway (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Steeles Tavern</span>), <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, and <span class="loc">Lexington</span>. The town slowly grew, and by <span class="date">1810</span>, the population had grown to 162, comparing to Staunton's <span class="date">1225</span>, and <span class="loc">Waynesboro</span>'s 250. An <span class="date">1835</span> account of <span class="loc">Greenville</span> said that it had an extensive manufacturing flour mill and a woolen manufactory, two physicians in the area, contained 50 dwelling houses, 3 general stores, 2 taverns, 1 academy, 2 tanyards, 2 saddlers, 2 tailors, 1 blacksmith shop, 1 cabinet maker, 1 wheelwright, 1 saddle tree maker, 3 house carpenters, 1 hatter, and 4 boot and shoe makers. The population was about 250 in <span class="date">1928</span>.</p><br><br>
