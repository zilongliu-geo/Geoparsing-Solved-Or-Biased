<p>Flores is a middle class barrio or district in the centre part of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> city, <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. Flores was considered a rural area of the Province of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> until 1888 when it was integrated into the City. The limits of the neighbourhood are marked by several streets and avenues: <span class="loc">Portela</span>, <span class="loc">Cuenca</span>, Av. <span class="loc">Gaona</span>, Av. <span class="loc">Donato Alvarez</span>, Curapaligüe, Av. Directorio, Av. <span class="loc">Carabobo</span>, Av. Castañares, Torres y <span class="loc">Tenorio</span>, Av. Riestra, Av. <span class="loc">Perito Moreno</span>, Av. Castañares, Lacarra and Av. Luis J. Dellepiane. Flores was mainly composed of country houses from the wealthy people of the City of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>. Today, remains of those houses can still be found, including the house owned by <span class="loc">Juan Manuel</span> de <span class="loc">Rosas</span>, the Governor of the Province around the 19th century. One of the most prominent of these early homeowners in Flores was the Marcó del Pont family, descendants of a former Spanish governor of <span class="loc">Chile</span>. Purchasing property facing the new railway station (one of <span class="loc">Argentina</span>'s first), they had a comfortable yet understated italianate property built in 1860. Relocating in 1929, the family sold the property and the estate fell into disrepair. Slated at one time for demolition, it eventually caught the attention of the San José de Flores Historical Society, who prevailed on the city to declare it a National Historic Monument, in 1976. Its fate now secure, as the home became the Marcó del Pont Cultural Center.</p>
