  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>There are also five <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> Townships in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Westmoreland County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It stands 45 miles (72 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the borough population was 4,454. The Borough of <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>, consisting of the town area, should not be confused with <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> Township, which is an entirely separate municipality. <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> Township is predominantly rural and adjoins the borough to the north. In <span class="date">the past</span>, <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span> was a center of an extensive coke-making industry. Other products included flour, lumber, iron, glass, foundry products, etc. The year of <span class="loc">Mount Pleasant</span>'s first non-Indian resident is not known, although one source states that at the time of the American Revolutionary War, there was a settlement of "not more than a half dozen houses." Braddock Road (Braddock expedition) passed through the western end of <span class="date">the future</span> town in <span class="date">1755</span>, opening the area to settlement. In <span class="date">1793</span> <span class="per">Michael Smith</span> was licensed to operate an inn, which would have served traffic on Glades Road (sometimes spelled Glade Road), <span class="date">now</span> Route 31. In <span class="date">1797</span>, <span class="per">Nathaniel Marshall</span> sold land to <span class="per">Andrew McCready</span>, who laid out the design of the town.</p><br><br>
