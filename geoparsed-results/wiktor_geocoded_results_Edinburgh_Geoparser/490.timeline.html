  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dover</span> is a ghost town located in <span class="loc">Sanpete County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The site lies west of <span class="loc">Fayette</span> across the <span class="loc">Sevier River</span>. The land was first settled in <span class="date">1877</span>–<span class="date">1878</span> by 45 families led by <span class="per">William Robinson</span>. They found the soil was good, but water somewhat scarce. By <span class="date">1879</span> they had a schoolhouse, also used for church and civic functions, and a post office, which operated until <span class="date">1895</span>. There were also two general stores, where residents typically paid for goods in kind with eggs. When <span class="loc">Utah</span> Territory achieved statehood on <span class="date">January 4, 1896</span>, Dover's celebrations took a tragic turn. They had no cannon to fire, instead exploding some dynamite with a well-driving hammer. The hammer, which had been through many such celebrations before, blew apart, injuring several people. In the <span class="date">years</span> <span class="date">1910</span>–<span class="date">1916</span>, irrigation companies in <span class="loc">Millard County</span> dammed the <span class="loc">Sevier River</span> some distance to the north. The resulting reservoir, <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Yuba</span> Reservoir, covered parts of Dover's farmland, driving out some of the residents. A severe drought in <span class="date">the 1930s</span> finished off the town; a few houses were moved, and most of the others were later torn down. Nothing remains but some foundations and fallen buildings, and a memorial cemetery.</p><br><br>
