<p><span class="loc">Wilson</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ellsworth County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The community promotes itself as the "Czech Capital of <span class="loc">Kansas</span>" due to the role of Czech immigrant settlers in its early history. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 781. The Butterfield Overland Despatch built a stagecoach station one-half mile south of present-day <span class="loc">Wilson</span> in 1865. Three years later, the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Pacific Railway built <span class="loc">Wilson</span> Station, named after the surrounding township, at the modern town site. In 1871, The National Land Company surveyed and planned the first town there, naming it <span class="loc">Bosland</span> in the hopes of attracting the cattle trade. Settlers from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, including some Pennsylvania Dutch, arrived over the following year. The settlement never became a center of the cattle trade, however, and continued to be known as <span class="loc">Wilson</span>, a name the U.S. Post Office officially codified in 1873. Beginning in 1874, Czech immigrants from <span class="loc">Bohemia</span> came to <span class="loc">Wilson</span> to work on the railroad, establishing the town as an area center of Czech culture. <span class="loc">Wilson</span> was incorporated as a city in 1883.</p>
