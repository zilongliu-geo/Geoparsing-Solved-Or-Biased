  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Seaforth</span> (<span class="date">2001</span> population: <span class="date">2300</span>) is a Southern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> community in the municipality of <span class="loc">Huron</span> East, in <span class="loc">Huron County</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Originally known as <span class="loc">Four Corners</span> and <span class="loc">Steene</span>'s Corners after an early settler, much of the area of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Seaforth</span> was acquired by brothers <span class="per">Christopher</span> and <span class="per">George</span> Sparling in anticipation of the construction of the Buffalo, <span class="loc">Brantford</span> and <span class="loc">Goderich Railway</span>. Developer <span class="per">James Patton</span> of <span class="loc">Barrie</span> purchased the land and laid out a townsite in <span class="date">1855</span>. In many ways, <span class="loc">Seaforth</span> is the quintessential small <span class="loc">Ontario</span> town. The Victorian streetscape stands as a testament to the town's rich history and all the image and influences that make rural <span class="loc">Ontario</span> and its hierarchy of small urban centres so unique. Seaforth's Main Street is a Provincially Designated Heritage Conservation District, and architectural critics consider it to be one of the finest late 19th century streetscapes remaining in the Province. The name 'Seaforth' may be derived from the Scottish Seaforth Highlanders regiment or <span class="loc">Loch Seaforth</span> in the <span class="loc">Outer Hebrides</span> of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. A post office was established in <span class="loc">Seaforth</span> in <span class="date">1859</span>. Incorporation as a Village followed in <span class="date">1868</span> and as a Town in <span class="date">1874</span>. In <span class="date">2001</span>, <span class="loc">Seaforth</span> was amalgamated with <span class="loc">Brussels</span>, <span class="per">Grey Township</span>, <span class="loc">McKillop</span> <span class="per">Township</span> and <span class="per">Tuckersmith</span> Township to form the Municipality of <span class="loc">Huron</span> East.</p><br><br>
