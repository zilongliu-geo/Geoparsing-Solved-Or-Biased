As of the 2010 census, the population was 101,407. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Gettysburg</span>. The county was created on January 22, 1800, from part of <span class="loc">York County</span> and named in honor of the second President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, John Adams.

This county seat community is surrounded on three sides by the <span class="loc">Gettysburg</span> National Military Park (GNMP). The Eisenhower National Historic Site adjoins GNMP on its southwest edge. Most of <span class="loc">Adams County</span>'s rural landscapes and its mid-19th century roadway pattern remain intact today. Thirteen historic roadways converge at or near <span class="loc">Gettysburg Borough</span>. Two circular rings of towns surround <span class="loc">Gettysburg</span>; the first ring is typically found at a distance of about 7 miles (11 km) from <span class="loc">Gettysburg</span>. The second ring is found at a distance of 12 to 15 miles (24 km) from the County Seat.
