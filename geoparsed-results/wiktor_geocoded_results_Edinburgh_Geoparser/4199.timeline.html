  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Alhambra</span> (/ælˈhæmbrə/ or /ɑːlˈhɑːmbrə/; Spanish: [aˈlambɾa]) is a city located in the western <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Gabriel</span> Valley region of <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, approximately eight miles from the Downtown <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> civic center. It was incorporated on <span class="date">July 11, 1903</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 83,089. The city's ZIP codes are 91801 and 91803 (plus 91802 for P.O. boxes). <span class="loc">Alhambra</span>'s roots begin with the <span class="org">San Gabriel Mission</span>, founded on <span class="date">September 8, 1771</span>, and the native people, Tongva, who inhabited the area before the arrival of the Spanish. The land that would later become <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> was part of a 300,000 acre land grant given to <span class="per">Manuel Nieto</span> by the Spanish. In <span class="date">1820</span> <span class="loc">Mexico</span> won its independence from the Spanish crown and lands once ruled by them became part of the <span class="loc">Mexican Republic</span>. These lands then transferred into the hands of the <span class="loc">United States</span> following the defeat in the Mexican-American War. A wealthy developer, <span class="per">Benjamin Davis Wilson</span>, married <span class="per">Ramona Yorba</span>, daughter of <span class="per">Bernardo Yorba</span>, who owned the land which would become <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> and with the persuasion of his daughter <span class="per">Ruth</span> named the land developed after a book she was reading. <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> is named after <span class="per">Washington Irving</span>'s book Tales of the <span class="loc">Alhambra</span>, that he was inspired to write by his extended visit to the <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> palace in <span class="loc">Granada</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>. <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> was founded as a suburb of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> that remained an unincorporated area during the mid-19th century. The first school in <span class="loc">Alhambra</span> was <span class="org">Ramona Convent Secondary School</span>, built on hillside property donated by the prominent <span class="per">James de Barth</span> Shorb family. <span class="date">Thirteen years</span> before the city was incorporated, several prominent <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Valley families interested in the Catholic education of their daughters established the school in <span class="date">1890</span>. The city's first public high school, <span class="org">Alhambra High School</span>, was established in <span class="date">1898</span>, <span class="date">five years</span> before the city's incorporation. On <span class="date">July 11, 1903</span>, the <span class="loc">City of Alhambra</span> was incorporated. The <span class="org">Alhambra Fire Department</span> was established in <span class="date">1906</span>.</p><br><br>
