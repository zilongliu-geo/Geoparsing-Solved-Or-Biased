  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Richmond</span> is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span> and the seat of Fort <span class="loc">Bend County</span>, within Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, the city population was 11,679. <span class="loc">Richmond city</span> boundaries are joined on one hand with <span class="loc">Sugar Land</span> and with the <span class="loc">city of Rosenberg</span> on the other hand. Even though it is the county seat, thus containing most of the local government offices, and the historic center of the area, it is actually one of the smaller cities in the area. Adjacent <span class="loc">Sugar Land</span> is the largest city in the county. In <span class="date">1822</span>, a group of Austin's colonists went up the <span class="loc">Brazos River</span>, stopping near present day <span class="loc">Richmond</span> where they built a fort called Fort Bend. Named after <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, the town was among the 19 cities first incorporated by the short-lived Republic of <span class="loc">Texas</span>, in <span class="date">1837</span>. Early residents of the city include many prominent figures in Texas lore such as <span class="per">Jane Long</span>, Deaf Smith, and <span class="per">Mirabeau Lamar</span>, who are all buried in <span class="loc">Richmond</span>. On <span class="date">August 16, 1889</span>, the town was the site of the "Battle of <span class="loc">Richmond</span>," an armed fight culminating the Jaybird-Woodpecker War, a violent feud over post-Reconstruction political control of Fort <span class="loc">Bend County</span>. The Mayor from <span class="date">1949</span> until his death in <span class="date">2012</span> was <span class="per">Hilmar Moore</span>.</p><br><br>
