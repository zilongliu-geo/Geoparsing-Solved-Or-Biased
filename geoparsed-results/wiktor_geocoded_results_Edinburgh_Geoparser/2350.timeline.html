  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Campbell</span> is a small town situated on the edge of the <span class="loc">Ghaap Plateau</span> in the Northern Cape province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It is located 48 km east of <span class="loc">Griquatown</span>. It was originally known as <span class="loc">Knovel</span> Valley and then <span class="loc">Groote Fontein</span>, but was renamed in honour of the Reverend <span class="per">John Campbell</span> who visited the <span class="loc">Cape Colony</span> in <span class="date">1813</span>. The history of modern settlement of <span class="per">Campbell</span> dates back to <span class="date">1805</span> when a group of Griqua, including Captain <span class="per">Andries Waterboer</span>, travelled with missionary <span class="date">Jan</span> Matthys Kok from <span class="loc">Klaarwater</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Griquatown</span>) to the territory of the Tswana near the modern town of <span class="loc">Kuruman</span>. Encountering strong springs in a valley at the edge of the <span class="loc">Ghaap Plateau</span>, they gave the place the name of <span class="loc">Knovel</span> Valley, noting its potential for future crop cultivation. It was only in <span class="date">1811</span> that the <span class="per">Reverend Lambert Jansz</span>, accompanying the traveller <span class="per">William Burchell</span>, revisited the place, taking possession of the springs, by <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Groote Fontein</span> (Great Fountain), in the name of the <span class="org">London Missionary Society</span>. Before long the name of the place would be changed again: when the Reverend <span class="per">John Campbell</span>, on a tour of inspection in <span class="date">1813</span>, reached the nascent village and asked its name, he was told it was <span class="per">Campbell</span>.</p><br><br>
