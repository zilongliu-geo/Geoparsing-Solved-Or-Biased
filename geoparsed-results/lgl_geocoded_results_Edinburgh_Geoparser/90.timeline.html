  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p> They did so at a special meeting recently, at the request of First Selectman <span class="per">Jeremy J. Shingleton</span>. <span class="per">Shingleton</span> explained that he hoped to piggyback the purchase of the bathroom with a similar project in another town — <span class="loc">Oakdale</span> — thereby reducing the overall cost. In all, <span class="per">Shingleton</span> told the board, he expects the bathroom to cost $47,837. Director of Public Works <span class="per">Eric Hood</span> said the town is purchasing the prefabricated bathroom from United Concrete Products of <span class="loc">Wallingford</span>. "We’re trying to keep it in state," he told the selectmen. The bathroom will contain one men’s bathroom and one women’s bathroom and a storage closet in between, <span class="per">Hood</span> said. Construction of the park has been a priority since <span class="per">Shingleton</span> took office in <span class="date">November 2007</span>. In addition to installing the restrooms, <span class="per">Shingleton</span> told the selectmen crews still must complete installation of a series of trails and bocce courts at the park. That, he said, will complete the first phase of the park construction. That will be followed by a second phase, which includes installation of a pavilion. "Once we have the pavilion in place, we have a park," he said. And when the work is completed, "That will be a great picnic area," <span class="per">Shingleton</span> added. But, he acknowledged, without the restrooms, picnickers "can’t stay there for <span class="date">a long time</span>. "Sylvester, the finance director, said town policy allows bid waivers if state or federal contract awards are being used or if the town is participating in a multi-town purchasing arrangement. <span class="per">Shingleton</span> sought the waiver to take advantage of "bid pricing obtained by another town," <span class="loc">Sylvester</span> explained.</p><br><br>
