  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Davenport is a city in <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,888 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. While the <span class="loc">city of Davenport</span> itself is very small, the area north of the city close to Interstate 4 and <span class="loc">US</span> 27 is experiencing explosive growth. It is part of the Lakelandâ€“Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area. The current mayor is <span class="per">Darlene Bradley</span>, who is serving from <span class="date">2015</span> to <span class="date">2017</span>. The first white settlement in the area <span class="date">now</span> known as Davenport was in <span class="date">1838</span> when the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> military set up <span class="per">Fort Davenport</span> during the Second <span class="org">Seminole War</span>, about 12 miles north of the present site of Davenport. The fort was one of a number built at 20 mile intervals along a trail from <span class="loc">Fort Brooke</span> to <span class="loc">Fort Mellon</span>. The fort only lasted <span class="date">a few years</span>. The fort was named for <span class="per">Colonel William Davenport</span>, who served as the local <span class="loc">U.S.</span> commander in the war. There is no known documentary evidence to support an alternative claim that the city was named for a railroad conductor. The modern <span class="loc">city of Davenport</span> had its start in the 1880s when the <span class="loc">South Florida Railroad</span> was extended to that point. The settlement was first known as <span class="loc">Horse Creek</span>, for the creek first recorded on a <span class="org">U.S. Army</span> survey of <span class="date">1849</span> which flows past the site to enter <span class="loc">Snell Creek</span> and eventually <span class="loc">Lake Hatchineha</span> in the <span class="loc">Kissimmee River</span> system. A post office was established at <span class="loc">Horse Creek</span> in <span class="date">1884</span>, and the name of the post office was changed to Davenport in <span class="date">1886</span>. Davenport was incorporated in <span class="date">1915</span>.</p><br><br>
