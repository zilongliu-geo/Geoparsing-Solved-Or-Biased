<p><span class="loc">Mandalay</span> (/ˌmændəˈleɪ/ or /ˈmændəleɪ/; Burmese: မန္တလေး; MLCTS: manta.le: [màɴdəlé]) is the second-largest city and the last royal capital of <span class="loc">Burma</span>. Located 716 km (445 mi) north of <span class="loc">Yangon</span> on the east bank of the <span class="loc">Irrawaddy River</span>, the city has a population of 1,225,553 (2014 census). <span class="loc">Mandalay</span> is the economic centre of Upper <span class="loc">Burma</span> and considered the centre of Burmese culture. A continuing influx of Chinese immigrants, mostly from <span class="loc">Yunnan</span>, in the past twenty years, has reshaped the city's ethnic makeup and increased commerce with <span class="loc">China</span>. Despite Naypyidaw's recent rise, <span class="loc">Mandalay</span> remains Upper <span class="loc">Burma</span>'s main commercial, educational and health center. The city gets its name from the nearby <span class="loc">Mandalay</span> Hill. The name is probably a derivative of a Pali word, although the exact word of origin remains unclear. The root word has been speculated to be mandala, referring to circular plains or <span class="loc">Mandara</span>, a mountain from <span class="loc">Hindu</span> mythology. When it was founded in 1857, the royal city was officially named Yadanabon (ရတနာပုံ, [jədənàbòʊɴ]), a loan of the Pali name Ratanapūra (ရတနပူရ) "<span class="loc">City of Gems</span>." It was also called Lay <span class="loc">Kyun</span> <span class="loc">Aung</span> <span class="loc">Myei</span> (လေးကျွန်းအောင်မြေ, [lé dʑʊ́ɴ àʊɴ mjè], "Victorious Land over the <span class="loc">Four Islands</span>") and <span class="loc">Mandalay</span> Palace (မြနန်းစံကျော်, [mja̰ náɴ sàɴ tɕɔ̀], "Famed Royal Emerald Palace").</p>
