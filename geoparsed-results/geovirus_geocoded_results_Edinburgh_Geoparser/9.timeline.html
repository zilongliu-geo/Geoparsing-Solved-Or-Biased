  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The H5N1 Avian Flu virus has been found in a dead wild Canadian Goose in <span class="loc">Abbotsbury</span> <span class="loc">Swannery</span> in <span class="loc">Dorset</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. This is the eleventh case of the virus turning up in wild birds. The goose was discovered on <span class="date">February 25, 2008</span>. "The finding of more cases in wild birds is not unexpected ... We are currently considering whether any additional restrictions are necessary in the area," said the United Kingdom's Health Ministry in a statement to the media. As a result of the finding, poultry movement has <span class="date">now</span> been restricted by the <span class="org">Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</span> (DEFRA) in the areas surrounding the swannery. The removal of all birds, dead or alive from any property <span class="date">now</span> requires a license. <span class="org">DEFRA</span> says the restrictions will expire no earlier than <span class="date">31 days</span>.</p><br><br>
