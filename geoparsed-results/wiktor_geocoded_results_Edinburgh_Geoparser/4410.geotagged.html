<p><span class="loc">Jieshi</span> (Chinese: 碣石镇) is a Town in <span class="loc">Lufeng</span>, <span class="loc">Shanwei Municipality</span>, Guangdong. The town administers 41 villages. Early in 2009 the Jieshi villages of <span class="loc">Gangkou</span> and <span class="loc">Meitian</span> began contesting the control of a road down to their common seaside. At one point, armed Meitian villagers surrounded <span class="loc">Gangkou</span> and attacked. The victims appealed to Jieshi Town executive / Party office to no avail. In April over 400 <span class="loc">Gangkou</span> residents boarded 26 fishing boats and sailed for <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span>. (The boats were turned back by <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span> police after a seven-hour protest near <span class="loc">Clear Water Bay</span>). <span class="loc">Meitian</span> also suffered assault. Some villagers posted claims on a local website that their houses had been pelted with bricks, their schoolchildren beaten, a teenager raped (in April). More violence came in October. On March 7, 2010, late in the evening, <span class="loc">Meitian</span> villagers again attacked <span class="loc">Gangkou</span>. They hurled rocks, rods, home-made grenades and petrol bombs at <span class="loc">Gangkou</span> residences through the night, destroying roofs and windows. All <span class="loc">Gangkou</span> residents fled and by morning were camped out before the Jieshi Town govt/party building.</p>
