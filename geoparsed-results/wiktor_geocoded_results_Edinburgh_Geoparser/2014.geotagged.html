<p>Lawrence is the sixth largest city in the state of <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Douglas County</span>. Located in northeastern <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, it is approximately 25 miles east of <span class="loc">Topeka</span>, and 35 miles west of the Missouri state border. Lawrence is situated along the banks of the <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and <span class="loc">Wakarusa Rivers</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city's population was 87,643. Lawrence is a college town and is the home to the University of Kansas and Haskell Indian Nations University. Lawrence was founded by the New England Emigrant Aid Company and was named for Amos Adams Lawrence who offered financial aid and support for the settlement. Lawrence was central to the Bleeding <span class="loc">Kansas</span> era and was the site of the Wakarusa War, the sacking of Lawrence, and the Lawrence Massacre. Lawrence had its beginnings as a center of <span class="loc">Kansas</span> politics. However, its economy soon diversified into many industries including agriculture, manufacturing, and ultimately education, beginning with the founding of the University of Kansas in 1866, and later Haskell Indian Nations University in 1884. Prior to <span class="loc">Kansas</span> Territory being opened to settlement in May 1854, most of <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> was part of the Shawnee Indian Reservation. The <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trail followed the <span class="loc">Kansas River</span> through what would become Lawrence and Mount Oread was used as a landmark and an outlook.</p>
