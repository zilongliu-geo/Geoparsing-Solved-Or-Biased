  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Florence</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Idaho County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. About 14 air miles (22 km) east-northeast of present-day <span class="loc">Riggins</span> in remote north central <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, it was settled as a mining camp in the <span class="date">winter of 1861</span>. Then in Washington Territory, the town at an elevation of 6,080 feet (1,850 m) quickly became the seat of a new <span class="loc">Idaho County</span> and the rich placer gold fields in the <span class="loc">Florence</span> Basin attracted thousands of prospectors to the area, contributing to the establishment of the <span class="loc">Idaho</span> Territory in <span class="date">1863</span>. However, intensive mining depleted the richest ground and the county seat moved elsewhere in <span class="date">1869</span>. The town thrived again from <span class="date">1895</span>â€“<span class="date">1900</span>, based more on lode mining. Then the town slowly faded away, having only ten inhabitants in <span class="date">1940</span>, and was totally abandoned sometime after <span class="date">1951</span>. The discovery of gold around <span class="per">Pierce</span> and <span class="per">Orofino</span> in <span class="date">1861</span> drew thousands of prospectors into the <span class="loc">Clearwater River</span> area of present-day north central <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, east of <span class="loc">Lewiston</span>. With all the best ground claimed, many newcomers began to look elsewhere. In <span class="date">late summer</span> <span class="date">1861</span>, a party of men headed south toward a local divide between the <span class="loc">Clearwater River</span> drainage and the <span class="loc">Salmon River</span> watershed. At that time, much of that area was still part of the <span class="loc">Nez Perce Indian Reservation</span>. (A new treaty in <span class="date">June 1863</span> reset the reservation boundary.) Perhaps because of Indian protests, the party split at some point. A smaller band of five made their way into a high mountain basin about thirty miles (50 km) south of <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="loc">Grangeville</span>. There, they found very rich placer gold along most of the nearby streams in <span class="date">August 1861</span>. Despite mutual promises to keep the find quiet when they returned to <span class="loc">Elk City</span> for supplies, word quickly got out.</p><br><br>
