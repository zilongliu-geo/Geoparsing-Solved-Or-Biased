<p>Angeles, officially the <span class="loc">City of Angeles</span> (Kapampangan: Lakanbalen ning Angeles; Filipino: Lungsod ng Angeles) and often referred to as <span class="loc">Angeles City</span>, is a highly urbanized city located geographically within the <span class="loc">province of Pampanga</span> in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It is bordered by <span class="loc">Mabalacat</span> to the north; <span class="loc">Mexico</span> to the east; <span class="loc">San Fernando</span> to the southeast; <span class="loc">Bacolor</span> to the south; and <span class="loc">Porac</span> to the southwest and west. The city administers itself autonomously from <span class="loc">Pampanga</span> and, as of the 2010 census, it has a population of 326,336. Angeles is served by the Clark International Airport in the Clark Freeport Zone. As the former home of <span class="loc">Clark Air Base</span> (then the largest <span class="loc">United States</span> military facility outside of the continental <span class="loc">United States</span>), it was significantly affected by the pullout brought about by the eruption of <span class="loc">Mount Pinatubo</span> in 1991. The economy of Angeles was heavily dependent on the American base at that time. In 1993, a full cleanup and removal of volcanic ash deposits began and the former <span class="loc">U.S.</span> base re-emerged as Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ). The creation of CSEZ has helped to offset the loss of income and jobs previously generated by the presence of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> base in the city. Today, Angeles and Clark form the hub for business, industry, aviation, and tourism in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> as well as a leisure, fitness, entertainment and gaming center of Central Luzon.</p>
