  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Ribera</span> (Catalan pronunciation: [ɫə riˈβeɾə], 'The Shore') is one of the areas of the quarter of <span class="loc">Sant Pere</span>, <span class="loc">Santa Caterina</span> i la <span class="loc">Ribera</span> of Ciutat Vella ("the old city") of <span class="loc">Barcelona</span>. Many of the buildings date from late Medieval times. It was <span class="date">a well-to-do quarter</span> during 13th–15th <span class="date">centuries</span>, when it really was by the sea shore, and the area that <span class="date">today</span> is named <span class="loc">Barceloneta</span> was still an island. Notable buildings are the Basilica de <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span> del <span class="date">Mar</span> and the palaces along <span class="per">Carrer de Montcada</span>, including the Museu Picasso, the Museu Barbier-Mueller d'Art Precolombí, and part of the <span class="loc">Textile Museum</span>. Another place of interest is the <span class="per">Fossar de les Moreres</span>, the site of a mass grave of Catalan soldiers fallen during the siege of <span class="date">1714</span>, which ended with the fall of <span class="loc">Barcelona</span> and the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Part of the quarter of <span class="loc">La Ribera</span> was demolished after the War of the Spanish Succession to build a military citadel to punish the defeated city. The lower section of the <span class="loc">La Ribera</span> district, just below <span class="per">Carrer de la Princesa</span>, and leading to <span class="loc">Barceloneta</span> is referred to as El Born after the 19th century market on carrer del Comerç that dominates the area. This is one of the trendiest and most touristic districts in the old city. It is a popular place for expats and contains many art boutiques, bars and cafés.</p><br><br>
