<p>Woodlands is a locality in the Southland region of <span class="loc">New</span> <span class="loc">Zealand</span>'s <span class="loc">South Island</span> on the banks of the <span class="loc">Waihopai River</span>. It is northeast of <span class="loc">Invercargill</span> between <span class="loc">Dacre</span> and <span class="loc">Longbush</span>. Other nearby settlements are <span class="loc">Rakahouka</span> to the northwest and <span class="loc">Rimu</span> and <span class="loc">Waituna</span> to the south. Woodlands' population at the time of the 2001 <span class="loc">New</span> <span class="loc">Zealand</span> Census of Population and Dwellings was 279, comprising 144 males and 135 females. This represented a decline of 6.1% or 18 people since the 1996 census. The town is located on State Highway 1 and the Main South Line portion of the <span class="loc">South Island</span> Main Trunk Railway. The railway has been freight-only since the cancellation of the Southerner passenger express on 10 February 2002. During the construction of the Main South Line, Woodlands was briefly a railway terminus. The first section of the line out of <span class="loc">Invercargill</span> was opened to Woodlands on 11 February 1874. On 7 June 1875, the next section beyond Woodlands was opened to <span class="loc">Mataura</span> via <span class="loc">Edendale</span>. A number of Woodlands residents fought overseas in World War I. A memorial to those who died stands in the town.</p>
