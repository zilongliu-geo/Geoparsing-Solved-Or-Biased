  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is a city in Southwestern <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, situated along the Quebec Cityâ€“Windsor Corridor. The city has a population of 37,754 according to the <span class="date">2011</span> Canadian census. <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is the seat of <span class="loc">Oxford County</span>, at the head of the non-navigable <span class="loc">Thames River</span>, approximately 128 km from <span class="loc">Toronto</span>, and 43 km from <span class="loc">London</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. The city is known as the Dairy Capital of <span class="loc">Canada</span> and promotes itself as "The Friendly City". <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> was first settled by European-colonists and United Empire Loyalists in <span class="date">1800</span>, starting with Zacharias <span class="per">Burtch</span> and <span class="per">Levi</span> <span class="loc">Luddington</span>, and was incorporated as a town in <span class="date">1851</span>. Since then, <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> has maintained steady growth, and is <span class="date">now</span> one of the largest cities in Southwestern <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. As a small historic city, <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is one of the few cities in <span class="loc">Ontario</span> to still have all of its original administration buildings. The city has developed a strong economic focus towards manufacturing and tourism. It is also a market city for the surrounding agricultural industry. <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> is home to a campus of <span class="org">Fanshawe College</span>. The city plays host to a number of cultural and artistic exhibits, including the <span class="org">Woodstock Museum</span>, a national historic site. Woodstock's <span class="date">summer</span> festivals contribute to its tourism industry, however, its economic activity is centred on the manufacturing centre, the city being home to a large number of auto-manufacturing factories. The city's west end has exceptionally well-preserved Victorian streetscapes, most notable of these streets is <span class="per">Vansittart</span> Avenue, named after Admiral <span class="per">Henry Vansittart</span>, one of the city's first settlers. <span class="loc">Woodstock</span> has a large community centre with a rink capable of accommodating 2,500 spectators for hockey games. The centre also has a large banquet hall and atrium which play host to a large number of social gatherings for the community.</p><br><br>
