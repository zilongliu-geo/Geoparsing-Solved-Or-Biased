<p>Prospect is a home rule-class city in Jefferson and Oldham counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> portion is a part of the <span class="loc">Louisville</span> Metro government. The population was 4,657 at the time 2000 census. It is one of the wealthiest communities in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. The area was first known as <span class="loc">Sand Hill</span> when it was settled by farmers in the late 18th Century. The present community grew up around the "Prospect" railroad station erected by the <span class="loc">Louisville</span>, <span class="loc">Harrods Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Westport Railway</span> c. 1872. The name referred either to the view from the top of the hill or the expected completion of the line (which – owing to the Long Depression – never did reach <span class="loc">Westport</span> and collapsed into bankruptcy in 1879). When the post office was established in 1886, the local postmaster named it Wilhoyte in his own honor, but the community corrected this within the month. Although a few luxury residences existed in the area from the late 19th century and the Louisville Railway Company offered hourly electrified-rail trolleys along the former LHC&amp;W line after 1904, it was largely agricultural until the mid-1960s when large, high-end subdivisions were built in the area, most notably <span class="loc">Hunting Creek</span>, which included a golf course. Prospect incorporated as a city in 1974.</p>
