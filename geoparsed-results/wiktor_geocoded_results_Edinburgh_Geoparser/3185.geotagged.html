<p>Madison is the capital of the State of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Dane County</span>. As of July 1, 2013, Madison had an estimated population of 243,344, making it the second largest city in <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, after <span class="loc">Milwaukee</span>, and the 83rd largest in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city forms the core of the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau's <span class="loc">Madison Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which includes all of <span class="loc">Dane County</span> and neighboring <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">Green</span>, and <span class="loc">Columbia</span> counties. The <span class="loc">Madison Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area had a 2010 population of 568,593. Madison's origins begin in 1829, when former federal judge James Duane Doty purchased over a thousand acres (4 kmÂ²) of swamp and forest land on the isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona, with the intention of building a city in the <span class="loc">Four Lakes</span> region. When the <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> Territory was created in 1836 the territorial legislature convened in <span class="loc">Belmont</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. One of the legislature's tasks was to select a permanent location for the territory's capital. Doty lobbied aggressively for Madison as the new capital, offering buffalo robes to the freezing legislators and promising choice Madison lots at discount prices to undecided voters. He had James Slaughter plat two cities in the area, Madison and "The City of <span class="loc">Four Lakes</span>", near present-day <span class="loc">Middleton</span>. Doty named the city Madison for James Madison, the fourth President of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> who had died on June 28, 1836 and he named the streets for the other 39 signers of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Constitution. Although the city existed only on paper, the territorial legislature voted on November 28 in favor of Madison as its capital, largely because of its location halfway between the new and growing cities around <span class="loc">Milwaukee</span> in the east and the long established strategic post of Prairie du <span class="loc">Chien</span> in the west, and between the highly populated lead mining regions in the southwest and <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>'s oldest city, <span class="loc">Green Bay</span> in the northeast. Being named for the much-admired founding father James Madison, who had just died, and having streets named for each of the 39 signers of the Constitution, may have also helped attract votes.</p>
