  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Shakhty</span> (Russian: Шахты; IPA: [ˈʂaxtɨ]) is a city in <span class="loc">Rostov Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the southeastern spur of the Donetsk mountain ridge, 75 kilometers (47 mi) northeast of Rostov-on-Don. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, its population was 239,987. In the beginning of the 19th century sergeant-major <span class="loc">Popov</span> founded on the <span class="loc">Grushevka</span> River a Cossack stanitsa of Alexandro-Grushevskaya (Александро-Грушевская). While the exact reasoning behind this name is unclear, it is possible that the name was given in honor of Emperor <span class="per">Alexander I</span>. Twelve Cossacks and fourteen peasant serfs lived in the stanitsa at that time. By the mid-19th century, fifty-seven coal mines operated in this area. In <span class="date">1867</span>, it was granted town status and renamed Gornoye Grushevskoye Poseleniye (Горное Грушевское Поселение). The name was changed to Alexandrovsk-Grushevsky (Александровск-Грушевский) in <span class="date">1881</span>. By <span class="date">1914</span>, the population had reached 54,000. The main source of income was coal mining, which had been carried out in that region since the end of the 18th century. The population was poor, but the town had rail, telegraph and telephone networks, electricity and plumbing as well as libraries, hospitals and a post office. <span class="date">1917</span> saw the city change hands three times, until it was taken on <span class="date">April 28, 1919</span>, by the Don Army, under <span class="per">General Fitskhelaurov</span>. For <span class="date">twenty months</span> it was independent of the Bolsheviks, but was ravaged by typhoid.</p><br><br>
