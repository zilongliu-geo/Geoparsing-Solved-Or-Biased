  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>The agriculture officials earlier announced that the depopulation will be carried out in a "humane" manner, following current Office international des épizooties (OIE) procedures that ensure protection of animal welfare in the Bulacan farm. According to <span class="org">Philippine Department of Health</span> (DOH) Secretary <span class="per">Francisco Duque</span>, the quarantine of the hog farm in <span class="loc">Palauig</span>, <span class="loc">Manaoag</span>, <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span> has been lifted after finding no traces of viral transmission. According to Yap, test results conducted by a joint mission of FAO, the World Animal Health Organization, WHO and their local counterparts, reveal that viral transmission continues to exist in Pandi hog farms, which is only 0.5% of the 13 million pigs raised throughout the country. DOH officials also say a pig farm worker in <span class="loc">Cabanatuan</span> in <span class="loc">Nueva Ecija</span>, who had no direct contact with sick hogs, has tested positive for Immunoglobulin G antibodies against the <span class="loc">Reston</span> ebolavirus, which is non-lethal, unlike the Zaïre, <span class="loc">Bundibugyo</span>, Côte d'<span class="loc">Ivoire</span> and <span class="loc">Sudan</span> strains, according to FAO.</p><br><br>
