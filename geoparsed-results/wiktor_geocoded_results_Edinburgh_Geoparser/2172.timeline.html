  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Sharon</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Mercer County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, 75 miles (121 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. It is part of the Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, <span class="loc">OH-PA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area and is also included in the more extensive Youngstown-Warren, OH-PA Combined Statistical Area. <span class="per">Sharon</span> was settled in <span class="date">1795</span>, incorporated as a borough on <span class="date">October 6, 1841</span>, and incorporated as a city on <span class="date">December 17, 1918</span>. The city operated under the PA third-class city charter until <span class="date">2008</span>, at which point it adopted a home rule charter under which the elected position of mayor was replaced with a hired city manager and financial officer. The founding families of <span class="per">Sharon first</span> settled on a flat plain bordering the <span class="loc">Shenango</span> River (this area is situated between two hills and is the current location of <span class="per">Sharon</span>'s downtown business district). According to local legend, the community received its name from a Bible-reading settler who likened the location to the <span class="loc">Plain of Sharon</span> in <span class="loc">Israel</span>. Initially a center of coal mining, <span class="per">Sharon</span>'s economy transitioned to steelmaking and other heavy industry following the Industrial Revolution. Following the extensive national deindustrialization of <span class="date">the 1970s and 80's</span>, the city's economy diversified and is <span class="date">now</span> based primarily on light industry, education, health care, and social services.</p><br><br>
