<p>Austin (/ˈɒstɪn, ˈɔː-/) is the capital of the <span class="loc">US</span> state of Texas and the seat of <span class="loc">Travis County</span>. Located in Central Texas, Austin is the 11th-most populous city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> and the fourth-most populous city in Texas. It is the fastest growing of the largest 50 <span class="loc">US</span> cities. Austin is also the second largest state capital in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, after Phoenix, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. As of July 1, 2014, Austin had a population of 912,791 (U.S. Census Bureau estimate). The city is the cultural and economic center of the Austin–Round Rock metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 1,943,299 as of July 1, 2014. In the 1830s, pioneers began to settle the area in central Austin along the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span>. After Republic of Texas Vice President Mirabeau B. Lamar visited the area during a buffalo-hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838, he proposed that the republic's capital, then located in Houston, be relocated to the area situated on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Colorado River</span> near the present-day Congress Avenue Bridge. In 1839, the site was officially chosen as the republic's new capital (the republic's seventh and final location) and was incorporated under the name <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. Shortly thereafter, the name was changed to Austin in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the "Father of Texas" and the republic's first secretary of state.</p>
