  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Rodeo /roʊˈdeɪ.oʊ/ is a census-designated place (CDP) located in Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> on the shore of <span class="loc">San Pablo Bay</span>. The population was 8,679 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is named for the livestock roundups common in the late 19th century. Cattle from the surrounding hills were regularly driven down through the old town to a loading dock on the shoreline of <span class="loc">San Pablo Bay</span> for shipment to slaughterhouses, a practice which continued through the early 20th century. The town of Rodeo is served by the Interstate 80 freeway and State Route 4. The Southern Pacific Railroad main line passes through Rodeo. Rodeo has not been a stop on the railroad since <span class="date">the 1950s</span>. Rodeo owes much of its history to brothers <span class="per">John</span> and <span class="per">Patrick</span> <span class="per">Tormey</span>, who purchased tracts of land from the Ygnacio Martinez <span class="loc">Rancho El Pinole</span> estate in <span class="date">1865</span> and <span class="date">1867</span>. They became successful ranchers and businessmen, amassed sizable fortunes and held public office. <span class="per">Patrick Tormey</span> (for whom the nearby town of <span class="per">Tormey</span> is named) had visions of this area of Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span> becoming the meatpacking and canning center of the Pacific coast. In partnership with the <span class="org">Union</span> <span class="org">Stockyard Co.</span> in <span class="date">1890</span>, he sold some of the land to them and began to lay out plans and make large investments for the stockyard facilities. Eventually, streets were graded and lots were prepared for homesteads, thus creating the town of Rodeo.</p><br><br>
