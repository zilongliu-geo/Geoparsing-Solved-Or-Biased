  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Walpole</span> is a town in the south-western region of Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, located approximately 430 kilometres (270 mi) south southeast of <span class="loc">Perth</span> and 66 kilometres (41 mi) west of <span class="loc">Denmark</span>. <span class="per">Walpole</span> lies very close to the northern point of the 100-hectare (250-acre) <span class="per">Walpole</span> Inlet, from which it takes its name. The inlet in turn is named for the <span class="loc">Walpole River</span>, discovered in <span class="date">1831</span> by <span class="per">Captain Thomas Bannister</span>, and named by <span class="per">Governor Stirling</span> for <span class="per">Captain W. Walpole</span>, with whom he had served aboard HMS Warspite in <span class="date">1808</span>. The first European settlers to arrive in the area were Pierre Bellanger and his family in <span class="date">1909</span>. They travelled aboard the <span class="per">Grace Darling</span> from <span class="loc">Albany</span> to take up 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land. Land in the <span class="per">Walpole</span> area was reserved for a national park in <span class="date">1910</span>, and the area subsequently became a popular holiday destination. Major development began to occur in <span class="date">the 1930s</span> as part of the land settlement scheme. The railway reached <span class="loc">Nornalup</span> in <span class="date">1929</span>, and the <span class="per">Walpole</span> town site was gazetted in <span class="date">1933</span>. <span class="per">Walpole</span> was always the preferred name, but it was believed this was already in use in <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>. So the newly gazetted township was officially named <span class="loc">Nornalup</span>, but this caused confusion with the railway terminus 13 kilometres (8 mi) east. Eventually the Post Office advised that there was no <span class="loc">Walpole</span> in <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, and in <span class="date">1934</span> the town reverted to its original name of <span class="per">Walpole</span>.</p><br><br>
