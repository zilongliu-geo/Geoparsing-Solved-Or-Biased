  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Garden City</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Glasscock County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies near the center of the county, about 27 miles south of Big Spring. <span class="loc">Garden City</span> serves as the <span class="loc">Glasscock County</span> seat, and at the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, had a population of 334. The ZIP code is 79738. <span class="loc">Garden City</span>'s history began in <span class="date">1886</span>, when what became the town's post office was established in a general store, and a settlement began to develop in the area around the business. The post office was to be named after the store proprietor, a man by the name of <span class="loc">Gardner</span>. However, after a clerical error by officials in <span class="loc">Washington</span>, the postal franchise was granted under the name "Garden" City. <span class="loc">Garden City</span> was the first <span class="loc">Texas</span> community platted by renowned surveyor <span class="per">W. D. Twichell</span>, a Minnesota native. In <span class="date">1893</span>, <span class="loc">Glasscock County</span> was organized, and <span class="loc">Garden City</span> vied for the county seat along with two other area communities, <span class="loc">New California</span> and Dixie. <span class="loc">New California</span> was ultimately chosen as the county seat; it was located in a less flood-prone region and had a readily accessible water supply. However, at the time of the county's organization, <span class="loc">New California</span> consisted of a mere two dwellings and an equally sparse population, whereas <span class="loc">Garden City</span> boasted a school, the general store/post office, and several homes. In a unique compromise, most of <span class="loc">Garden City</span>'s structures were placed on wheels and relocated to the <span class="loc">New California</span> site, and on <span class="date">April 5, 1893</span>, the settlement was renamed <span class="loc">Garden City</span>. A two-story stone courthouse was constructed later that same year, followed by a new, larger courthouse in <span class="date">1910</span> (with the former building remaining in use as the <span class="loc">Glasscock County</span> Jail).</p><br><br>
