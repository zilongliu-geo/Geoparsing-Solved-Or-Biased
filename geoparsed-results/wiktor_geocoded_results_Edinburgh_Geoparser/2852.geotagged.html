<p><span class="loc">Charleston</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Penobscot County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Bangor Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 1,409 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Charleston</span> includes the village of <span class="loc">West Charleston</span> and is home to the Higgins Classical Institute, a Christian school. <span class="loc">Charleston</span> was first settled as early as 1795 by Charles Vaughan. The land was granted on July 14, 1802, by the Massachusetts General Court to John Lowell. Known as T2 R5 NWP, or Township 2, Range 4, North of the Waldo Patent, it was incorporated on February 16, 1811, as New <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>, to distinguish it from <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, when that state included the <span class="loc">province of Maine</span>. But in 1820, <span class="loc">Maine</span> achieved statehood, so any confusion between the two ceased. Consequently, in 1827 the name was shortened to <span class="loc">Charleston</span>. Sawmills were established to operate by water power at the streams. But <span class="loc">Charleston</span> was primarily an agricultural town. Its large farms were noted for raising horses and cattle. In 1837, the Higgins Classical Institute was founded. By 1870, the community had a population of 1,191. Between 1901 and 1930, the Bangor Railway &amp; Electric Company operated trolleys on an electric railway between <span class="loc">Bangor</span> and <span class="loc">Charleston</span>.</p>
