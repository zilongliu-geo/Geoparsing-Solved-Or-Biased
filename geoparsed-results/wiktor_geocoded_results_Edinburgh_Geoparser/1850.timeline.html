  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Pisa</span> (/ˈpiːzə/; Italian pronunciation: [ˈpiːza]) is a city in <span class="loc">Tuscany</span>, Central <span class="loc">Italy</span>, straddling the River Arno just before it empties into the <span class="loc">Tyrrhenian Sea</span>. It is the capital city of the <span class="loc">Province of Pisa</span>. Although <span class="per">Pisa</span> is known worldwide for its leaning tower (the bell tower of the city's cathedral), the city of over 89,940 residents (around 200,000 with the metropolitan area) contains more than 20 other historic churches, several medieval palaces and various bridges across the River Arno. Much of the city's architecture was financed from its history as one of the Italian maritime republics. The city is also home of the <span class="org">University of Pisa</span>, which has a history going back to the 12th century and also has the mythic Napoleonic Scuola Normale Superiore di <span class="per">Pisa</span> and <span class="per">Sant'Anna</span> School of Advanced Studies as the best sanctioned Superior Graduate Schools in <span class="loc">Italy</span>. The origin of the name, <span class="per">Pisa</span>, is a mystery. While the origin of the city had remained unknown for <span class="date">centuries</span>, the Pelasgi, the Greeks, the Etruscans, and the Ligurians had variously been proposed as founders of the city (for example, a colony of the ancient <span class="loc">city of Pisa</span>, <span class="loc">Greece</span>). Archaeological remains from the <span class="date">5th century BC</span> confirmed the existence of a city at the sea, trading with Greeks and Gauls. The presence of an Etruscan necropolis, discovered during excavations in the Arena Garibaldi in <span class="date">1991</span>, confirmed its Etruscan origins.</p><br><br>
