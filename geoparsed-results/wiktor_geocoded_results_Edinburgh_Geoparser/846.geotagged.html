<p>Central (also Central District; Chinese: 中環) is the central business district of <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span>. It is located in Central and Western District, on the north shore of <span class="loc">Hong Kong Island</span>, across <span class="loc">Victoria Harbour</span> from <span class="loc">Tsim Sha Tsui</span>, the southernmost point of <span class="loc">Kowloon Peninsula</span>. The area was the heart of <span class="loc">Victoria City</span>, although that name is rarely used today. As the central business district of <span class="loc">Hong Kong</span>, it is the area where many multinational financial services corporations have their headquarters. Consulates general and consulates of many countries are also located in this area, as is Government Hill, the site of the government headquarters. The area, with its proximity to <span class="loc">Victoria Harbour</span>, has served as the centre of trade and financial activities from the earliest days of the British colonial era in 1841, and continues to flourish and serve as the place of administration after the transfer of sovereignty to <span class="loc">China</span> in 1997. The area of <span class="loc">Choong Wan</span> or <span class="loc">Chung Wan</span> (中環), officially named Central in English, was one of the districts (四環九約) in <span class="loc">Victoria City</span>. The English name Central became prevalent after the Island Line of the MTR metro system was built in the early 1980s, and the connected stations of Pedder and Chater renamed as Central. On some older maps, it and the area to its west are named <span class="loc">Kwan</span> Tai Lo (羣帶路) below Victoria Peak. It formed a channel, Chung Mun (中門), with <span class="loc">Tsim Sha Tsui</span>, on the sea route along the coast of southern <span class="loc">China</span>. The eastern part of Central District has been known as Admiralty since the completion of Admiralty Station in the early 1980s.</p>
