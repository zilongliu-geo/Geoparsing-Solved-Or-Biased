  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jordan</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Onondaga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,368 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Syracuse Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It was named from the <span class="loc">Jordan River</span>. <span class="loc">Jordan</span> is located in the northwest part of the town of <span class="loc">Elbridge</span>, west of <span class="loc">Syracuse</span>. The village bloomed with the opening of the <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal in <span class="date">1825</span>. Due to the canal, <span class="loc">Jordan</span> became larger than <span class="loc">Elbridge</span> Village, farther south. <span class="loc">Jordan</span> became an incorporated village in <span class="date">1835</span>. In <span class="date">1983</span>, much of the village was included in the <span class="loc">Jordan</span> Village Historic District and listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. On <span class="date">April 25, 1865</span>, <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span>'s black-draped funeral train slowed for the crowd lining the <span class="org">New York Central Railroad</span> tracks at the <span class="loc">Erie</span> Canal on the way west to <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. As the train passed through, some men on furlough from the 3rd <span class="org">New York Artillery Division</span> fired a cannon salute from the nearby canal. They had made arrangements with local farmer, <span class="per">Isaac C. Otis</span>, whose "land straddled" <span class="loc">Skaneateles Creek</span> just north of the canal, to shoot at a large elm tree on the east side of the creek. Their aim was true, and a 6-pound (2.7 kg) cannonball hit the tree about 20 feet (6.1 m) off the ground, burying itself about 18-inch (460 mm) into the trunk. The tree, which was cut down in <span class="date">the 1930s</span>, was referred to as the "cannonball tree" although no one knew the tale was true until the tree was chopped down and "there it was." The cannonball, about the size of a softball and still embedded in wood from the tree, is displayed at the <span class="org">Jordan Museum</span>, a storehouse of artifacts kept in a room in the rear of the <span class="org">Bramley Library</span> building.</p><br><br>
