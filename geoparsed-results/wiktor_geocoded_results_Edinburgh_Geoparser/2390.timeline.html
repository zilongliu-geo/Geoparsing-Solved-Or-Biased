  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Greenville Township</span>, <span class="loc">Floyd County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 595 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Early in <span class="loc">Floyd County</span>'s history, <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was initially to be the county seat. A <span class="loc">New Albany</span> resident offered to provide a bell for the courthouse, on the condition that the courthouse were built in <span class="loc">New Albany</span>; thus, it was built there instead. <span class="per">Captain John Baptiste Ford</span> found his way to <span class="loc">Greenville</span> as a 14-year-old runaway from <span class="loc">Danville</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. Ford began as an apprentice in the local saddle shop which led him into his first business venture. Ford purchased the <span class="loc">Old Mill</span> and saddle shop from its owner, added a grocery and began making tin pie safes which he sold throughout the country. In <span class="date">1824</span>, Ford became the first man to succeed in making plate glass in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. That success was the precursor to several glass companies, most notably the <span class="org">Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company</span> <span class="date">now</span> known as PPG. Ford became the father of American plate glass. That original business venture that housed the mill, saddle shop and grocery still stands <span class="date">today</span>. Historically referred to as the <span class="loc">Old Mill</span> and Ford's Flour Mill, the <span class="loc">Greenville</span> Station is believed to be the oldest commercial building in <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. Construction on the three-story brick structure began in <span class="date">1810</span> and finished in <span class="date">1812</span>. Besides housing Ford's grocery and the saddle shop, the <span class="loc">Old Mill</span> was the <span class="org">Greenville Post Office</span> from <span class="date">1823</span> until <span class="date">the early 1940s</span> when it was relocated to H. Miller's house at the corner of East First Street and Hwy 150. The Station was a stop for the 104-mile stagecoach route that ran from Falls Cities to the <span class="loc">Wabash</span> River. The building also served as a stop along the <span class="loc">Pony Express</span> route from <span class="date">1861</span> to <span class="date">1867</span>. The <span class="loc">Greenville</span> Station served as lodge hall for two civil organizations: the fraternal order of the Free and Accepted Masons and the International Order of Oddfellows. Through a majority of the early 20th century, the <span class="loc">Greenville</span> Station was referred to by the townspeople as the "lodge building" or the "lodge."</p><br><br>
