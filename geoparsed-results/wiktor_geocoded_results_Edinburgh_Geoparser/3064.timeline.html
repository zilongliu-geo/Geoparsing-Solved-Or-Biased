  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Trenton is a city in <span class="loc">Dade County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Founded in <span class="date">1830</span> by European Americans, the area was originally known as <span class="loc">Salem</span>. In <span class="date">1839</span> <span class="loc">Salem</span> was designated the seat of the newly formed <span class="loc">Dade County</span>. It was renamed Trenton in <span class="date">1841</span>. The population was 2,301 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the only incorporated municipality in the county, and as such it serves as the county seat. Trenton is part of the <span class="loc">Chattanooga</span>, <span class="loc">Tennesseeâ€“GA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. On <span class="date">April 27, 2011</span>, an EF-3 tornado with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) hit the city, causing significant damage and loss of life. This was historically part of Cherokee people territory before <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and the <span class="loc">United States</span> forced them to cede lands and, under Indian Removal Act, relocate to Indian Territory in the 1830s. The area was developed largely for subsistence farming. The noted Southern humorist <span class="per">George Washington Harris</span> (<span class="date">1814</span>-<span class="date">1869</span>) is buried in the Brock Cemetery in Trenton. Although he was considered one of the seminal writers of Southern humor and greatly influenced the literary works of <span class="per">Mark Twain</span>, <span class="per">William Faulkner</span>, and <span class="per">Flannery O'Connor</span>, his grave was not officially identified and marked with a monument until <span class="date">2008</span>.</p><br><br>
