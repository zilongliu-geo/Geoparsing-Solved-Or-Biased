<p><span class="loc">Rama</span> is a village in the East-Central area of <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span>. It is located 44 km west of <span class="loc">Canora</span> and 60 km east of <span class="loc">Wadena</span> at the intersection of Highway 5 and Secondary Hwy 754. <span class="loc">Rama</span> is on the banks of <span class="loc">Spirit Creek</span>, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Whitesand River</span>. The <span class="loc">Spirit Creek</span> Dam and its reservoir are located just east of the Village. <span class="loc">Rama</span> is located on the banks of <span class="loc">Spirit Creek</span> and is found at the junction of Highways 5 and 754 in Saskatchewan's aspen parkland region. This area is part of the East Central economic improvement region of the province. Canada Post provides Mail and Courier services through its local post outlet, S0A 3H0 is the postal code. The RM of <span class="loc">Invermay</span> borders the village on all sides. Prominently featured in <span class="loc">Rama</span> is the Shrine of our Lady of <span class="loc">Lourdes</span>, a homage of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of <span class="loc">Lourdes</span>, in <span class="loc">Lourdes</span>, <span class="loc">France</span>. Many of these grottoes in <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span> and eastern <span class="loc">Alberta</span> were created by Fr. Anthony Sylla and his parishioners. Sylla had arrived in <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span> in 1909 and by 1933 was in charge of the parish in <span class="loc">Rama</span>. By 1939 he began to establish the shrine and pilgrimage site. The shrine was largely completed during the next two years. Updates, landscaping changes and additions to the grounds have continued gradually until today. Every year on August 14 and 15 (since 1941) <span class="loc">St. Anthony</span>'s parish holds a 'Pilgrimage'. Mass is held in several languages, and a candlelight procession occurs. The shrine in <span class="loc">Rama</span> is located west of <span class="loc">St. Anthony</span>'s church.</p>
