  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Newport</span>, historically known as Ballyveaghan (Irish: Baile Uí Fhiacháin) - for <span class="date">many years</span> the town was also known as Newport-Pratt - is a small picturesque town in the barony of Burrishoole, <span class="loc">County Mayo</span>, <span class="loc">Ireland</span> with a population of 590 in <span class="date">2006</span>. It is located on the west coast of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, along the shore of <span class="loc">Clew Bay</span>, north of <span class="loc">Westport</span>. The N59 road passes through the town. The county town of <span class="loc">Castlebar</span> is approx 18 km east of <span class="loc">Newport</span>. The Black <span class="loc">Oak River</span> flows through the centre of the town and there are pleasant walking paths along its grassy banks. <span class="loc">Newport</span> was established in the early 18th century by the Medlycott family. <span class="per">James Moore</span>, working for the Medlycott Estate, designed the quay at <span class="loc">Newport</span> in a formal layout. The Medlycott family's land agent was a <span class="per">Captain Pratt</span>. <span class="per">Pratt</span> introduced linen manufacturing to the town under the management of immigrant Quakers who relocated to Co. <span class="loc">Mayo</span> from <span class="loc">Ulster</span>. It would appear that, although the immigrant Quakers consequently found living conditions in <span class="loc">Mayo</span> too difficult, the linen industry picked up in the mid-18th century and for <span class="date">the next forty years</span> or so the town prospered around the industry, but in the early 19th century it again fell into decline as it was superseded as a port by the town of <span class="loc">Westport</span> seven miles to the south. At the end of the 18th century, the Medlycott Estate was taken over by the O'Donel family who built <span class="org">Newport House</span>, <span class="date">now</span> a hotel, overlooking the harbour.</p><br><br>
