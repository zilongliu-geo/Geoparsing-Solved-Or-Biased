  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Middleton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Canyon County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,524 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 2,978 in <span class="date">2000</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Boise</span> Cityâ€“Nampa, <span class="loc">Idaho Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Middleton</span> was named for its location between the old fort <span class="loc">Boise</span> and <span class="loc">Keeney</span>'s Ferry; it being the midpoint between the two. It served as a rest stop for those heading for <span class="loc">Keeney</span>'s Ferry. It had a stage station in the early <span class="date">days</span> of the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trail, a post office in <span class="date">1866</span> and a water powered gist mill in <span class="date">1871</span>. The Ward Massacre occurred near the site in <span class="date">1854</span>. <span class="loc">Middleton</span> is the oldest settlement in <span class="loc">Canyon County</span>, with the land being parceled out in <span class="date">1863</span> by <span class="per">William N. Montgomery</span>. The <span class="loc">Boise River</span> flooded in <span class="date">1872</span> and cut a new channel, isolating the town on an island; as a result, the town moved to a new location in the <span class="date">years</span> after <span class="date">1880</span>. The town incorporated as a city in <span class="date">1910</span>, although the certificate was not issued until <span class="date">1971</span>. The present mayor is <span class="per">Darin Taylor</span>. On <span class="date">February 1, 2007</span>, 78% of <span class="org">Middleton High School</span> burned down, caused by the overheating of a fan above the weight room. The 42-year-old building was built when fire codes required sprinklers to be installed, but there was no provision for their functionality. To save money during the construction of the school in <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, the sprinklers were installed but were never connected to a water source.</p><br><br>
