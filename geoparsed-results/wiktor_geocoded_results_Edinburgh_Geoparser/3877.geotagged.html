<p>For the musical instrument, see viola da gamba Gamba is a small town in <span class="loc">Gabon</span> lying on the southern bay of the <span class="loc">Ndogo Lagoon</span>. Historically, the area was populated by gatherer-hunter-fishermen autochthons scattered in small villages around the <span class="loc">Ndogo Lagoon</span> and the <span class="loc">Yenzi</span> Lake. With the discovery in 1967 of a major oil field by Shell in the area, the town boomed and immigration of workers from various other parts of the country resulted in the population today of about 8000 people. Though production from the Gamba field is now only a fraction of what it once was, Gamba remains an important and strategic oil hub, being one of only two oil terminals in <span class="loc">Gabon</span> (the other one being <span class="loc">Cape Lopez</span>. Most people live in the heart of the town, divided into five blocks called “Plaines”, while most senior Shell staff live in <span class="loc">Yenzi</span>, half a dozen miles away from the heart of the city near the airport and the oil terminal. Balumbu people are known to be the autochthons of the region, even though the <span class="loc">Punu</span> and Fang people are now possibly the majority ethnic groups present. The name Gamba stands for fog in <span class="loc">Vili</span>, probably because of the foggy weather during the dry season.</p>
