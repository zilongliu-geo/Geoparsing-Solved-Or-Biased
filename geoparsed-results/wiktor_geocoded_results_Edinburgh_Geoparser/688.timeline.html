  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Alma is a town in <span class="loc">Allegany County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 842 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The source of the town name is uncertain. It may come from the Latin word for "nourishing", or it may be named for a city in <span class="loc">Germany</span>. The Town of Alma is on the southern edge of <span class="loc">Allegany County</span> and is southwest of the Village of <span class="per">Wellsville</span>. The area was first settled around <span class="date">1833</span>. The Town of Alma was established in <span class="date">1854</span> from part of <span class="org">the Town of Willing</span>. From <span class="date">1881</span> to <span class="date">January 1893</span> several of the settlements in the Township (most notably <span class="loc">Allentown</span>) were on the Wellsville-Eldred Main Line of the <span class="loc">Bradford</span>, <span class="loc">Eldred</span> &amp; <span class="loc">Cuba</span> Railroad (BE&amp;C). The BE&amp;C was a 36" narrow-gauge railroad built to serve the <span class="loc">Allegany County</span> oil boom. With the end of the boom and loss of the passenger and freight traffic therefrom the railroad entered receivership (bankruptcy) and was abandoned. <span class="date">Today</span> the railheads for Alma Township are <span class="per">Wellsville</span> and <span class="per">Friendship</span>. Remnants of the railroad bed for the BE&amp;C can be seen in the village of <span class="loc">West Clarksville</span> between the village and <span class="org">Dodge</span> Creek behind the Clarksville store.<span class="per">James E. Lewis</span>, a resident in <span class="loc">West Clarksville</span> from <span class="date">1936</span>-<span class="date">1950</span>. This railroad bed was one of my playgrounds with my bicycle. The Clarksville store was in my family for three generations: <span class="per">Frank Windsor</span>, <span class="per">James E. Windsor</span>, and my dad <span class="per">Malcolm W. Lewis</span>.</p><br><br>
