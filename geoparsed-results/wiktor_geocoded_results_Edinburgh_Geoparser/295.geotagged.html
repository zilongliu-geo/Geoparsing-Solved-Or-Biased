<p><span class="loc">Trinidad</span> is a Home Rule Municipality that is the county seat and the most populous <span class="loc">city of Las</span> <span class="loc">Animas County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 9,096 as of the 2010 census, up slightly from 9,078 in 2000. The estimate as of 2012 was 8,771. <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> lies 21 miles (33 kilometers) <span class="loc">north of Raton</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> and 195 miles (305 km) south of <span class="loc">Denver</span>. <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> was first explored by Spanish and Mexican traders, who liked its proximity to the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail. It was founded after coal was discovered in the region, in 1862; this led to an influx of immigrants, eager to capitalize on this important natural resource. By the late 1860s, the town had about 1,200 residents.  <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> was officially incorporated in 1876, just a few months before <span class="loc">Colorado</span> became a state.  An important milestone for the town occurred in 1878, when the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Railway reached <span class="loc">Trinidad</span>, making it easier for goods to be shipped from distant locations.  In the 1880s, <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> became home to a number of well-known people, including Bat Masterson, who briefly served as the town's marshal in 1882.  By 1900, the population of <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> had grown to 7,500. It was now home to two English-language newspapers, and one that was published in Spanish.</p>
