  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Clifton</span> is a neighborhood on the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Staten Island</span> in New <span class="loc">York City</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is an older waterfront neighborhood, facing Upper New <span class="loc">York Bay</span> on the east. It is bordered on the north by <span class="loc">Stapleton</span>, on the south by <span class="loc">Rosebank</span>, on the southwest by <span class="org">Concord</span>, and on the west by Van <span class="loc">Duzer</span> Street. The name "Clifton" for the area dates to <span class="date">1817</span>, when a town by the name, larger in area than the present neighborhood, was laid out along the waterfront. In its early history, much of the surrounding land was owned by the <span class="per">Vanderbilt</span> family. As a young man, <span class="per">Cornelius Vanderbilt</span> established ferry service from the waterfront to Manhattan at the foot of present <span class="per">Vanderbilt</span> Avenue. <span class="org">Bayley Seton Hospital</span>, north of <span class="loc">Vanderbilt Avenue</span>, was formerly the <span class="loc">United States</span> Public Health Service Hospital and housed the original headquarters of <span class="org">the National Institutes of Health</span> (<span class="date">now</span> located in <span class="loc">Bethesda</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>). In the 1840s the <span class="per">Townsend</span> family built a huge home that had turrets so it was called the <span class="per">Townsend Castle</span>. It was located at what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Townsend</span> <span class="per">Avenue</span> and <span class="per">Tompkins</span> Avenue. In the 1870s many roads and large homes were built near the water. The area has many Victorian houses left from the late 1800s in the area from <span class="loc">Vanderbilt</span> to <span class="loc">Norwood Avenues</span>. In <span class="date">1900</span> the Fox Hills Golf Club encompassed the entire area of where the Park Hill Apartments are <span class="date">now</span>. There was a big clubhouse on <span class="per">Vanderbilt</span> Avenue. Many tournaments were held there until <span class="date">the 1920s</span> when it closed. The land was taken over by the government and used for military barracks during World War II. By <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, it evolved into a middle-class, multi-ethnic community of civil employees including firemen, teachers, and doctors.</p><br><br>
