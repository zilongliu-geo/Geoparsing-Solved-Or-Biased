  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Paz</span> is a fifth class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Leyte</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 19,133 people. The legend of <span class="loc">La Paz</span>, bordering on fiction and history, is an interesting one. It is said that long ago, a fisherman from <span class="loc">Samar</span> named <span class="per">Capuyong</span> came to <span class="loc">Abuyog</span> to market his catch. There he met and fell in love with Casinas and they were married according to pre-Spanish customs. After marriage, they left <span class="loc">Abuyog</span> to look for a place in which to live. Coming to a river that is <span class="date">now</span> called <span class="loc">Gibuga</span>, they followed its source until they reached a tributary that was named <span class="loc">Cabadyangan</span> River where they decided to stay. They had three children: <span class="loc">Garcia</span>, <span class="per">Gabic</span> and <span class="per">Badol</span>. <span class="per">Gabic</span> left for <span class="loc">Hindang</span>, while <span class="per">Badol</span> settled in <span class="loc">Dagami</span>. <span class="loc">Garcia</span>, the eldest, stayed home. He married a certain <span class="loc">Agustina</span> of <span class="loc">Abuyog</span> with whom he had 18 children. Meanwhile, the Spaniards had settled in <span class="loc">Abuyog</span>. They found it difficult to convert <span class="per">Casinal</span> and <span class="per">Capuyong</span> to Christianity. The couple clung obstinately to their religion. Condemned to die for refusing to embrace the new religion, they were tied to a jar full of stones and flung off the coast of <span class="loc">Dulag</span>.</p><br><br>
