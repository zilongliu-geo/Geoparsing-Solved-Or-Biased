  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A cholera outbreak in the African country of <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span> has killed almost 500 people since <span class="date">August</span>, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). <span class="org">The WHO</span> said that the outbreak affected most areas of the country, and that some remote areas had seen fatality rates increase by as much as 30%. <span class="org">Zimbabwe's Ministry of Health</span> reported 484 deaths from 11,735 cases since the outbreak began. <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span> has had annual outbreaks of cholera for nearly <span class="date">a decade</span>, but this one was the most far-reaching. A report by the WHO stated that the last large outbreak was in <span class="date">1992</span>, with 3,000 cases recorded. Cholera is frequently spread by contaminated, untreated water. The spread of the disease was expedited by the collapse of <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>'s health and sanitation systems; state media reported that most of <span class="loc">Harare</span> has been left without water after the city ran out of chemicals for its treatment plant. A resident of <span class="loc">Mabvuku</span>, a suburb located east of <span class="loc">Harare</span>, told APTV that electricity is not available most of the time, so water is consumed without being boiled first. The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) said that there have been cases of cholera reported in areas of <span class="loc">Botswana</span>, <span class="loc">Mozambique</span>, and <span class="loc">South Africa</span> that border <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span>, indicating the sub-regional threat of the outbreak. The South African ministry of health confirmed that they had 160 incidents of cholera reported, as well as three deaths. The European Commission said that it was providing €9 million (US$11.4 million) in funds to assist <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span> with the crisis. "I'm shocked at the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in <span class="loc">Zimbabwe</span> and call upon the authorities there to respond quickly to this cholera outbreak by allowing full assistance from international humanitarians and regional partners," said the commissioner responsible for the European Union's humanitarian aid, <span class="per">Louis Michel</span>. Other agencies providing aid to the country include the United Nations Children's Fund, the WHO, and Doctors Without Borders.</p><br><br>
