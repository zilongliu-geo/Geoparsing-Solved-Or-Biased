  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Gordon</span> is a suburb on the Upper <span class="loc">North Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> 15 kilometres (9 mi) north-west of the <span class="org">Sydney Central Business District</span> and is the administrative centre for the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council. <span class="loc">East Gordon</span> is a locality within <span class="per">Gordon</span> and <span class="loc">West Gordon</span> within <span class="loc">West Pymble</span>. The name '<span class="per">Gordon</span>' first appears as the name of the survey parish covering most of the upper north shore, assigned by the NSW Surveyor-General Sir <span class="per">Thomas Mitchell</span>. This is believed to commemorate <span class="per">Sir Willoughby Gordon</span>, with whom he had served during the Peninsular War and who was the quartermaster-general of the regiment in which <span class="per">Mitchell</span> had served. The survey parish, and later suburb and municipality of <span class="per">Willoughby</span> also commemorates his name. Settlement of the area commenced about <span class="date">1820</span>. The early settlement at <span class="per">Gordon</span> was originally known as Lane Cove. The earliest school at 'Lane Cove', as <span class="per">Gordon</span> was then known, was established at the behest of <span class="per">Governor Macquarie</span> in <span class="date">1816</span>. The first Lane Cove Post Office opened on <span class="date">1 February 1860</span>. The name of the village and Post Office was changed to <span class="per">Gordon</span>, after the Gordondale estate of <span class="per">Robert McIntosh</span>, on <span class="date">1 June 1879</span>. <span class="per">Gordon</span> Railway Station on the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> Line was built in <span class="date">1888</span>.</p><br><br>
