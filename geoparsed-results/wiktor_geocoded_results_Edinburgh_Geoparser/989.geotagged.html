<p>Roy is a city in <span class="loc">Pierce County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 793 at the 2010 census. Roy was officially incorporated on January 16, 1908. It is a rural city outside <span class="loc">Tacoma</span> and primarily features ranch-style homes and farms. Roy was one of the early communities in the area, a prosperous boom-town and a major stop on the railroad line. But 3 major blows reduced this once-thriving town to its current form. A major fire in 1929 wiped out most of the downtown businesses just before the Depression started. The railroad eventually discontinued using Roy as a main stop. The Army annexed most of the surrounding land to the north and west, limiting expansion and the local tax base, and erasing the nearby community of <span class="loc">Loveland</span>. Major features and/or attractions in Roy and the vicinity include the Roy Pioneer Rodeo, attracting participants and spectators from several states and <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Roy is located at 47°0′12″N 122°32′39″W (47.003382, -122.544171). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.49 square miles (1.27 km2), all of it land.</p>
