  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lake County</span> is a county in the northeastern corner of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 703,462, making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Waukegan. Originally part of <span class="loc">McHenry County</span>, the townships composing <span class="loc">Lake County</span> were carved out into a separate county in <span class="date">1839</span>. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> is one of the collar counties of the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, <span class="loc">IL-IN-WI Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is located along the shore of Lake Michigan. According to the <span class="date">2000</span> census, <span class="loc">Lake County</span> is the 31st richest county by per capita income. The lakefront communities of <span class="loc">Lake Forest</span>, <span class="loc">Lake Bluff</span>, and Highland Park are part of the affluent <span class="loc">North Shore</span> area. Naval Station <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> is located in the city of <span class="loc">North Chicago</span> in <span class="loc">Lake County</span>. It is the United States Navy's Headquarters Command for training, and the Navy's only recruit training center. The county, which was primarily unsettled prairie and was still home to its native Potawatomi Indians, was created by the Illinois State Legislature in <span class="date">1839</span>. At that time, <span class="loc">Libertyville</span>, then known as Independence Grove, was the first county seat. In <span class="date">1841</span>, however, the county's residents voted to move the county government to Little Fort, <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Waukegan</span>, where the commissioners had purchased a section of land from the state. <span class="loc">Lake County</span>'s first courthouse was built on part of that land in <span class="date">1844</span> and the remainder was sold to pay for the $4,000 construction cost.</p><br><br>
