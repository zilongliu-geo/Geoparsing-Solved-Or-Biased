  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fort Smith</span> (<span class="loc">Chipewyan</span> language: Thebacha "beside the rapids") is a town in the South Slave Region of the <span class="loc">Northwest Territories</span> (NWT), <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is located in the southeastern portion of the <span class="loc">Northwest Territories</span>, on the <span class="loc">Slave River</span> and adjacent to the NWT/Alberta border. <span class="loc">Fort Smith</span> was founded around the <span class="loc">Slave River</span>. It served a vital link for water transportation between southern <span class="loc">Canada</span> and the Western Arctic. Early fur traders found an established portage route from what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Fort Fitzgerald</span>, on the western bank of the <span class="loc">Slave River</span> to <span class="loc">Fort Smith</span>. This route allowed its users to navigate the four sets of impassable rapids (Cassette Rapids, <span class="loc">Pelican Rapids</span>, <span class="loc">Mountain Rapids</span>, and Rapids of the Drowned). The portage trail had been traditionally used by local aboriginal people for <span class="date">centuries</span>. The aboriginal population of the region shifted as the fortunes of the tribes changed. By <span class="date">1870</span>, Cree had occupied the <span class="loc">Slave River</span> Valley. The Slavey had moved north by this time and the <span class="loc">Chipewyan</span> had also begun moving into the area. <span class="per">Peter Pond</span> of the North West Company was the first white trader to travel on the <span class="loc">Slave River</span> and make contact with aboriginal people in this region. He established a post on <span class="loc">Lake Athabasca</span> called <span class="loc">Fort Chipewyan</span> in the 1780s, at the head of the <span class="loc">Slave River</span>.</p><br><br>
