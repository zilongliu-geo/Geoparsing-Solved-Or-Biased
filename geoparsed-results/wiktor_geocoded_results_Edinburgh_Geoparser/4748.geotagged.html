<p><span class="loc">Cordova</span> /kɔːrˈdoʊvə/ is a small town located near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Copper River</span> in the Valdez-Cordova Census Area, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, at the head of Orca Inlet on the east side of <span class="loc">Prince William Sound</span>. The population was 2,239 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Cordova</span> was named Puerto <span class="loc">Cordova</span> by Spanish explorer Salvador Fidalgo in 1790. No roads connect <span class="loc">Cordova</span> to other Alaskan towns, so a plane or ferry is required to travel there. In the Exxon Valdez oil spill of March 1989, an oil tanker ran aground northwest of <span class="loc">Cordova</span>, heavily damaging ecology and fishing. In 1790 the inlet in front of the current <span class="loc">Cordova</span> townsite was named Puerto <span class="loc">Cordova</span> by Spanish explorer Salvador Fidalgo, after Spanish admiral Luis de Córdova y Córdova. The town of <span class="loc">Cordova</span> was named after it, although the inlet itself was later renamed the Orca Inlet. <span class="loc">Cordova</span> proper was founded as a result of the discovery of high-grade copper ore at Kennecott, north of <span class="loc">Cordova</span>. A group of surveyors from <span class="loc">Valdez</span> laid out a town site and Michael James Heney purchased half the land for the terminus of the <span class="loc">Copper River</span> and Northwestern Railway after determining that <span class="loc">Katalla</span> was a poor harbor. Heney and his crew held a brief ceremony to organize the town on March 26, 1906. A week later crews arrived to begin work on the railroad. The first lots in the new town site, which make up the heart of present-day <span class="loc">Cordova</span>, were sold at auction in May 1908. As the railroad grew, so did the town. Eventually schools, businesses, a hospital, and utilities were established. After the railroad was completed <span class="loc">Cordova</span> became the transportation hub for the ore coming out of Kennecott. In the years 1911 to 1938, more than 200 million tons of copper ore was transported through <span class="loc">Cordova</span>.</p>
