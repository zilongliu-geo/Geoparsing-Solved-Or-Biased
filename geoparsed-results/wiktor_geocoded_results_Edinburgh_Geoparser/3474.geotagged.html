<p>Hudson is a city in <span class="loc">Summit County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and an affluent suburb of <span class="loc">Akron</span>. The population was 22,262 at the 2010 census. It is a part of the <span class="loc">Akron</span>, <span class="loc">OH</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Cleveland–Akron–Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area, the 15th largest Combined Statistical Area in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city is named after its founder, David Hudson, who settled there from <span class="loc">Goshen</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> in 1799, when it was part of the <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> Western Reserve. Hudson was a stop on the Underground Railroad. On November 28, 1973, a large area of the village, "roughly bounded by College, Streetsboro, S. Main, and <span class="loc">Baldwin</span>" streets, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Hudson Historic District. The historic district was expanded on October 10, 1989, to also include the area "roughly bounded by Hudson St., Old Orchard Dr., Aurora St., Oviatt St., Streetsboro St., and College St. to Aurora (street)". In addition to the Hudson Historic District, there are several additional properties in Hudson listed on the Register.</p>
