<p><span class="loc">Louisville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was an early capital of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and is the county seat of <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>. It is located southwest of <span class="loc">Augusta</span> on the <span class="loc">Ogeechee River</span>, and its population was 2,712 at the 2000 census. Though the name is of French origin, it is pronounced "Lewis-ville." <span class="loc">Louisville</span> was laid out in 1786 as the prospective state capital. <span class="loc">Georgia</span> became a state in 1788. Savannah had served as the colonial capital; but it was considered too far from the center of the growing state. <span class="loc">Louisville</span> was named for Louis XVI, who was still the King of France and had aided the Continentals during the successful American Revolutionary War. Development of the city began later, and its state government buildings were completed in 1795. The <span class="loc">city of Louisville</span> served as the state capital of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> from 1796 to 1806. The <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> courthouse, built in 1904, stands on the site of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>'s first permanent capitol building. Louisville's historic market house still stands in the center of downtown. The original market had sections for everything from farm produce and household goods to slaves. The <span class="loc">Old Market</span> is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The market square became the hub of the transportation routes which centered on <span class="loc">Louisville</span> while the town was the state's capital.</p>
