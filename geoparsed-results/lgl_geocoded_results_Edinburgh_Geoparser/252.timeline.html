  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">CFBC</span> presents ‘gift of green’. More than $133,000 was distributed to 40 service agencies and organizations <span class="date">Tuesday</span> at the Community Foundation of <span class="loc">Boone County</span>’s annual <span class="org">Circle of Giving Breakfast</span>. “We greatly appreciate all of the work that you do,” said <span class="org">CFBC</span> chairman <span class="per">Tom Easterday</span> before coaxing representatives of 21 groups attending the event into applauding themselves. <span class="per">Easterday</span> termed the event, “the giving of the green on St. Patrick’s Day.” The presentation was of “dedicated” funds — money from specific endowments supervised by the <span class="org">CFBC</span> for specific organizations. “The foundation exists to bring people who care together with causes that matter,” <span class="per">Easterday</span> said. He said the breakfast was “a prime example of the synergy” between donors and needs in <span class="loc">Boone County</span>. “If we can continue to match up donors with items of concern to them ... we can do this for many, <span class="date">many years</span>,” <span class="per">Easterday</span> said. Public schools were the biggest beneficiaries <span class="date">Tuesday</span>. The <span class="org">Zionsville Education Foundation</span>, established in <span class="date">1995</span> by the <span class="org">Glassier Memorial Fund</span> and the ZEF’s founders, received $26,217. The <span class="org">Western Boone Education Foundation</span> received $23,101 from a fund created in <span class="date">2000</span> by its board of directors.</p><br><br>
