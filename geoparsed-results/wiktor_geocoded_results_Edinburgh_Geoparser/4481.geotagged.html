<p>Bury (/ˈbɛri/, locally also /ˈbʊrɪ/) is a town in <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, on the <span class="loc">River Irwell</span>, 5.5 miles (8.9 km) east of <span class="loc">Bolton</span>, 5.9 miles (9.5 km) west-southwest of <span class="loc">Rochdale</span>, and 7.9 miles (12.7 km) north-northwest of <span class="loc">Manchester</span>. Bury is the largest settlement and administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury and in 2011 had a population of 55,856. Historically part of <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, Bury emerged in the Industrial Revolution as a mill town manufacturing textiles. Bury is known for the open-air Bury Market and the local traditional dish, black pudding. The Manchester Metrolink tram system terminates in the town. Bury resident Sir Robert Peel was Prime Minister of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> and founded the Metropolitan Police Service and Conservative Party. The Peel Memorial is outside Bury parish church and the Peel Monument stands on <span class="loc">Holcombe</span> Hill overlooking <span class="loc">Ramsbottom</span>. The name Bury, (also earlier known as "Buri" and "Byri") comes from an Old English word, meaning "castle", "stronghold" or "fort", an early form of modern English borough.</p>
