  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Wellington</span> is a township in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> on the <span class="loc">Murray River</span> (<span class="loc">River Murray</span> in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>) just upstream of where it empties into <span class="loc">Lake Alexandrina</span>. Its postcode is 5259. <span class="per">Wellington</span> is in the Rural City of <span class="loc">Murray</span> Bridge. At the <span class="date">2006</span> census, <span class="per">Wellington</span> had a population of 295. Because of its geographical similarities, the first European colonists likened the development potential of the site of <span class="per">Wellington</span> to that of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. In <span class="date">1839</span> the <span class="loc">London</span>-based Secondary Towns <span class="org">Association</span>, represented in Adelaide by <span class="per">John Morphett</span> and <span class="per">John Hill</span>, authorised expenditure on the special survey a proposed town to be named <span class="per">Wellington</span>, with prior consent of the <span class="per">Duke of Wellington</span> himself. Despite never having seen the land except on a map, the directors of the <span class="org">Association</span> had great hopes for <span class="per">Wellington</span> becoming an important town. The survey eventually provided for 700 lots in <span class="per">Wellington</span> (west side of the <span class="loc">Murray</span>) and 300 lots in <span class="loc">Wellington East</span> (east side of the <span class="loc">Murray</span>), as well as rural sections. Messrs <span class="per">Cannan</span> and <span class="per">Henderson</span> carried out the survey in <span class="date">November 1840</span> and the first lots were sold in <span class="date">July 1841</span>.</p><br><br>
