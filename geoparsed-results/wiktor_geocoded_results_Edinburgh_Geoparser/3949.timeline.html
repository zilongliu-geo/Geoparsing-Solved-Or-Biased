  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Franca</span> is a municipality in the Brazilian state of São Paulo. The population is 342,112 (<span class="date">2015</span> est.) in an area of 606 km². Its elevation is 1040 m. It was established in <span class="date">1805</span> as a parish within the municipality of Moji Mirim, and became an independent municipality in <span class="date">1824</span>. The history of the region of <span class="loc">Franca</span> begins at the time of the <span class="loc">Bandeirantes</span> explorers. The bandeira or entrada of Anhangüera (the son) in <span class="date">1722</span> established the “way of Goiás,” a trail from São Paulo to the gold mines in Goiás. Along this and other trails settlements were made, becoming the so-called "landings" or way-stations for the gold seekers. <span class="loc">Franca</span> was known at the time of the <span class="loc">Bandeirantes</span> as the “catfish landing.” At the end of the 18th century, settlers had dispersed into the region in several of these landings. In <span class="date">1779</span>, around 1000 people lived in the area around <span class="loc">Franca</span> . To better organize the settlement, a Decree Company was created and the Portuguese Captain <span class="per">Manoel de Almeida</span> was put in charge. At the beginning of the 19th century, the sons of <span class="per">Manoel de Almeida</span> (<span class="per">Antonio Antunes</span> de <span class="loc">Almeida</span> and <span class="loc">Vicente Ferreira</span> <span class="per">de Almeida</span>) donated lands for the construction of a chapel, which in turn was blessed by the priest <span class="per">Joaquin Martins</span> <span class="loc">Rodrigues</span>. With the decline of mining activity in <span class="loc">Minas Gerais</span> and Goiás, more settlers migrated to the "Belo Sertão do <span class="loc">Rio Pardo</span>" (beautiful valley of the <span class="loc">Pardo</span> River), under the sponsorship of the governador of São Paulo, <span class="per">Antônio José</span> de Franca e <span class="loc">Horta</span>, after whom the municipality are named.</p><br><br>
