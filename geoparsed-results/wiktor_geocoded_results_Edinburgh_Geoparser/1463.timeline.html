  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rochester</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Racine County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,682 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The village was located within the old Town of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. The community of <span class="loc">Honey Lake</span> was located partially in the town of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. On <span class="date">November 4, 2008</span>, the village of <span class="loc">Rochester</span> voted to consolidate with the town of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. The first non-Native American settlers in <span class="loc">Rochester</span> were a group of five farming families, who all hailed from the town of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span> after which they gave their new settlement its name. These were "Yankee" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled <span class="loc">New England</span> during the colonial era. Correspondingly they were members of the Congregationalist Church and were staunch abolitionists. When they arrived in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Rochester</span> there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. They laid out post routes, built roads, constructed farms and government buildings all within <span class="date">the first few months</span> of settling in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. The old Union House hotel in the Village of <span class="loc">Rochester</span> was a part of the Underground Railroad. The trail started there, went under the <span class="loc">Fox River</span>, and ended at a house on the other side.</p><br><br>
