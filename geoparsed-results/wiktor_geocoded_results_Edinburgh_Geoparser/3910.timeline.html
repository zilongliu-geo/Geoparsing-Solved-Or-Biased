  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Cairo /ˈkeɪ.roʊ/ is a city in <span class="loc">Grady County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a population of 9,607. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Grady County</span>. <span class="loc">Cairo</span> was founded in <span class="date">1835</span>. It was incorporated as a town in <span class="date">1870</span> and as a city in <span class="date">1906</span>. In <span class="date">1905</span>, <span class="loc">Cairo</span> was designated seat of the newly formed <span class="loc">Grady County</span>. The city was named after <span class="loc">Cairo</span>, the capital of <span class="loc">Egypt</span>. Although <span class="loc">Cairo</span> is nicknamed the "Syrup City" it has no relationship with the Karo brand of syrup, which is pronounced like the city's name. Rather, <span class="loc">Cairo</span> earned its nickname by producing cane syrup from <span class="date">the early 1900s</span> through <span class="date">the late 1990s</span>. Of the several companies that produced cane syrup, Roddenbery's was the best known. Reflecting this "syrup" heritage, the <span class="org">Cairo High School</span> football team is nicknamed the Syrupmakers, and the school mascot is the agriculturally based sugar cane farmer/syrupmaker similar to the <span class="per">Cornhusker</span> and <span class="per">Boilermaker</span>. According to local tradition, this began during a rainy football game, when the players wore donated ponchos with "Roddenbery Syrup" printed on them. The most widely accepted tradition and the one with the most supportive evidence claims that a newspaper reporter referred to the Cairo Tigers in print as "the syrupmakers from <span class="loc">Cairo</span>."</p><br><br>
