As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city population was 996. <span class="loc">Medford</span> was founded by <span class="per">Hobart Johnstone Whitley</span>, a land developer, banker, farmer and <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> Railroad executive. The <span class="org">Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture</span> states only that the town name was for <span class="loc">Medford</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, which it says was the home town of a railroad official. Before the opening of the Cherokee Outlet to non-Indian settlement on <span class="date">September 16, 1893</span>, the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span> and Nebraska Railway (later the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> and Pacific Railroad) built a line from southern <span class="loc">Kansas</span> that passed through <span class="date">the future</span> <span class="loc">Medford</span> townsite in a north-south direction. A post office was established <span class="date">October 31, 1893</span>. The townsfolk voted to incorporate on <span class="date">March 10, 1894</span>. In <span class="date">1897</span> the Gulf Railroad (later the <span class="loc">Atchison</span>, <span class="loc">Topeka</span> and Santa Fe Railway) built a line that passed through <span class="loc">Medford</span> from northwest to southeast. Located in a wheat-growing region, <span class="loc">Medford</span> served as an agricultural trade center with a flour mill and several grain elevators. By <span class="date">1909</span> the local economy supported three banks and three weekly newspapers.</p><br><br>
