<p><span class="loc">Mansfield</span> council to vote today on $765,000 financing package. <span class="loc">MANSFIELD</span> — The Law Enforcement Center will get some parking relief and other improvements and repairs if the City Council approves a $765,000 financing package today. About $85,000 has already been used for emergency repairs to mechanical and electrical systems. Among the remaining projects is expanding parking at the center to keep up with the growing number of staff members. "We’ve been out of parking for years," Patrol Commander Kyle Lanier said. The council meeting is at 7 p.m. at City Hall, 1200 E. Broad St. Lanier said the renovations, which could begin by mid-April, would also include electrical work, fencing, gates, painting and landscaping. None of the scheduled improvements are for the patrol division, where officers are finishing their own volunteer remodeling effort. They have replaced drywall, repainted, installed cabinets and overhauled bathrooms, saving $50,000 to $100,000, they say. In other action, the council will consider authorizing staff to take advantage of lower interest rates and refinance about $10.3 million of city debt. Officials estimate savings of $450,000 over the life of the bonds. Last week, after recent action by the council, late Public Safety Director Steve Noonkester’s name was placed on the side of the Mansfield Public Safety and Municipal Court Building. The new lettering dedicates the building to Noonkester but doesn’t change its name — part of a compromise with some residents opposed to naming any city building for individuals.</p>
