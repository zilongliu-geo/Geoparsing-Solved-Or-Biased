  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Peres</span> to tell <span class="org">EU</span>: <span class="per">Netanyahu</span> will advance peace . President <span class="per">Shimon Peres</span> launched a campaign <span class="date">a few days ago</span> whose aim is to convince the international community that the "Netanyahu-Lieberman-Barak" government in the making will advance the peace process with the Palestinians. Meanwhile, senior European Union officials have sent messages to <span class="per">Benjamin Netanyahu</span> making it clear that a refusal to adopt the "two-state solution" means freezing any upgrade in relations between <span class="loc">Israel</span> and <span class="loc">Europe</span>. <span class="per">Peres</span> seeks to allay European and Arab suspicions about the <span class="per">Netanyahu</span> government and the appointment of <span class="per">Avigdor Lieberman</span> as foreign minister. The president has been helping <span class="per">Netanyahu</span> in his coalition negotiations with <span class="loc">Kadima</span> and the <span class="loc">Labor</span> Party, and was party to the secret talks between the Likud chairman and his <span class="loc">Labor</span> counterpart, <span class="per">Ehud Barak</span>. In a phone call <span class="date">late last week</span> to mark the 30th anniversary of Israeli-Egyptian peace, <span class="per">Peres</span> told Egyptian President <span class="per">Hosni Mubarak</span> that the agreements signed by <span class="loc">Israel</span> contain an obligation to promote a regional peace agreement as well as separate agreements with each of <span class="loc">Israel</span>'s neighbors. "In addition," <span class="per">Peres</span> said, "the new government will be obligated to honor all of the international agreements that have been signed." Sources close to <span class="per">Peres</span> said <span class="date">yesterday</span> that the president has transmitted similar messages in his talks with foreign leaders, which are expected to continue through <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, when the new government is to be sworn in. <span class="per">Peres</span> is to make an official visit to <span class="loc">Prague</span> on <span class="date">Monday</span>, where he is scheduled to meet with the president, prime minister and foreign minister of the <span class="loc">Czech Republic</span>. The Czechs are the current president of the European Union, and according to sources in the President's Residence in <span class="loc">Jerusalem</span>, <span class="loc">Peres</span> intends to take advantage of his visit to present the coalition agreements to his hosts and to stress the new government's commitment to the peace process. "It will be one of the main topics of the visit," the source said. In addition, immediately after the swearing-in ceremony for <span class="per">Netanyahu</span> on <span class="date">Wednesday</span>, <span class="per">Peres</span> will launch a media blitz of interviews to the foreign press to explain the policies of the new government.</p><br><br>
