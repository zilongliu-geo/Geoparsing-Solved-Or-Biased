  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>County's tornado-siren dead zones still unresolved. The county operates 157 of them, but coverage remains spotty in the southeast and southwest corners. An additional 17 sirens are scheduled to be installed in <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, Pleasant Township, <span class="per">Madison</span> Township and <span class="loc">Grove City</span> <span class="date">this year</span>. No one knows exactly how many sirens the county needs, but one planning document allows for 200, said <span class="per">Michael R. Pannell</span>, the county's director of emergency management and homeland security. Individual jurisdictions are responsible for buying the sirens, and the county handles their operation. <span class="per">Pleasant</span> and <span class="per">Madison</span> townships both used a three-year, no-interest loan program through the county to buy the $20,000 sirens. <span class="loc">Dublin</span> operates its own sirens and is fully covered with 24, said <span class="per">Michael Racey</span>, a city spokesman. <span class="date">Wednesday</span>'s statewide drill is largely meant to prepare Ohioans for tornado season, which runs from <span class="date">April</span> through <span class="date">July</span>, according to the state's Emergency Management Agency. While the sirens go off, alerts will be broadcast on television and radio. State officials say they hope that schools, businesses and families will practice their disaster plans. That's part of the reason the drill is scheduled for 9:50 a.m., said <span class="per">Kelli Blackwell</span>, a spokeswoman for the state agency. People will be at work and school, where they can practice. It also avoids conflicts with broadcasters who have news updates at the top of the hour. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> typically tests its sirens at noon on Wednesdays. If people don't have disaster plans to practice, maybe <span class="date">Wednesday</span>'s drill and the state's Severe Weather Awareness Week, which ends <span class="date">Sunday</span>, will have them thinking about one, <span class="per">Pannell</span> said. "Be aware about what you can do to be better prepared," he said.</p><br><br>
