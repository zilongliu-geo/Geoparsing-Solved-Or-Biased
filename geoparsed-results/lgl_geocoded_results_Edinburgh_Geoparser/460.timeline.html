  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Police determine details of three-vehicle crash. Law enforcement could not say for sure <span class="date">Friday night</span> how a three-vehicle injury accident on KY 52 occurred, but <span class="per">Sgt. Sam Manley</span> from the <span class="loc">Madison County</span> Sheriff’s Department confirmed <span class="date">Monday</span> the sequence of events that sent all five people involved to the hospital with injuries. A <span class="date">2005</span> black <span class="org">Ford</span> truck being driven by <span class="per">Joseph Welch</span> of <span class="loc">Richmond</span> was about to turn right (westbound) onto KY 52 heading toward <span class="loc">Richmond</span>, <span class="loc">Manley</span> said. A <span class="date">1993</span> brown <span class="org">Cadillac</span> driven by <span class="per">Larry Dunaway</span> of <span class="loc">Berea</span> was traveling westbound and struck the pickup truck in the left rear, the deputy said. That then caused the truck to do a 180-degree spin, and it was left facing east in a westbound lane, <span class="per">Manley</span> said. By that time, <span class="per">Manley</span> said the Cadallic was facing west in the eastbound lane resulting in a head-on collision between an eastbound <span class="date">1996</span> <span class="org">Chevrolet</span> driven by <span class="per">David Arvin</span> of <span class="loc">Irvine</span>. <span class="per">Arvin</span>, <span class="per">Dunaway</span> and his passenger, <span class="per">Barton Jones</span> of <span class="loc">Waco</span>, were treated at the <span class="org">University of Kentucky Medical Center</span> and were in “critical but stable” condition, according to a <span class="loc">UK</span> spokesperson who gave the statement <span class="date">Saturday afternoon</span>. Welch and his passenger <span class="per">Vickie Nguyen</span> were taken to Pattie A. Clay Medical Center where they were treated for minor injuries.</p><br><br>
