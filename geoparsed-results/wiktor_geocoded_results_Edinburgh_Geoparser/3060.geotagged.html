<p>Trenton is the capital city of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> and the county seat of <span class="loc">Mercer County</span>, as well as briefly the former capital of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city's metropolitan area is grouped with the <span class="loc">New York</span> metropolitan area by the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, but directly borders the <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> metropolitan area and is part of the Federal Communications Commission's Philadelphia Designated Market Area. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, Trenton had a population of 84,913, making it the state's 10th-largest municipality. The Census Bureau estimated that the city's population was 84,034 in 2014. Trenton dates back at least to June 3, 1719, when mention was made of a constable being appointed for Trenton, while the area was still part of <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span>. Boundaries were recorded for Trenton Township as of March 2, 1720, a courthouse and jail were constructed in Trenton around 1720 and the Freeholders of <span class="loc">Hunterdon County</span> met annually in Trenton. Trenton became <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>'s capital as of November 25, 1790, and the <span class="loc">City of Trenton</span> was formed within Trenton Township on November 13, 1792. Trenton Township was incorporated as one of <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>'s initial group of 104 townships by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on February 21, 1798. On February 22, 1834, portions of Trenton Township were taken to form <span class="loc">Ewing Township</span>. The remaining portion of Trenton Township was absorbed by the <span class="loc">City of Trenton</span> on April 10, 1837. A series of annexations took place over a 50-year period, with the city absorbing <span class="loc">South Trenton</span> borough (April 14, 1851), portions of Nottingham Township (April 14, 1856), both the <span class="loc">Borough of Chambersburg Township and Millham Township</span> (both on March 30, 1888), as well as <span class="loc">Wilbur Borough</span> (February 28, 1898). Portions of <span class="loc">Ewing Township</span> and <span class="loc">Hamilton Township</span> were annexed to <span class="loc">Trenton</span> on March 23, 1900.</p>
