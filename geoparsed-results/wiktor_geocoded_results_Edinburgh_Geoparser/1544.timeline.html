  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Elizabeth was an incorporated municipality in central <span class="loc">Cobb County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, that existed de jure from <span class="date">1885</span> to <span class="date">1995</span>. Originally incorporated by an act of the <span class="org">Georgia General Assembly</span> on <span class="date">October 5, 1885</span>, as the town of Elizabeth, it never began functioning as a municipality; in particular, no historical evidence exists that the town held any elections for mayor and the city council. In a new law passed in <span class="date">1964</span>, the General Assembly renamed the town as the <span class="loc">City of Elizabeth</span>, and on <span class="date">October 6</span> of <span class="date">that year</span> the residents voted 3 to 1 in an election to approve the city's charter, yet still never elected a mayor or city council. Finally, in <span class="date">1995</span>, the city's charter was revoked along with dozens of others, pursuant to a <span class="date">1994</span> law requiring that cities provide at least three services from a list defined in the law. The town's initial boundary was defined in the <span class="date">1885</span> incorporating act as a radius of one-half mile from the center of the engine house of the American Marble Cutting Company. The <span class="date">1964</span> law specified the city's boundary as "onehalf mile from the center of the engine house of Frank G. North Chemical Company in <span class="loc">Cobb County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, being the same point as the center of the engine house of the former American Marble Cutting Company, i.e., said corporate limits shall commence at the center thereof and extend one-half mile north, south, east and west in a circular fashion so as to include all the territories in all directions within one-half mile of the center of said engine house."</p><br><br>
