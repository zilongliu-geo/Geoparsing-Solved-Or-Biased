<p><span class="loc">Palacios</span> (/pəˈlæʃəs/ pə-LASH-əs) is a city in <span class="loc">Matagorda County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,153 at the 2000 census. Popular local legend states that the area was named <span class="loc">Tres Palacios</span> ("Three Palaces") several centuries ago by shipwrecked Spanish sailors who claimed they saw a vision of three palaces on the bay. Historians believe it was more likely named for José Félix Trespalacios, an early Mexican governor of <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The town was originally called Trespalacios, but shortened its name due to a nearby post office already using the longer version. The name is pronounced to rhyme with "splashes," unlike the original Spanish pronunciation. The native inhabitants of the region were the <span class="loc">Karankawa</span> people, whose initial contact with Europeans came in the 16th century when Spanish expeditions first traversed their territory. In 1685, the area was explored by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de <span class="loc">La Salle</span>, the leader of an ill-fated French settlement attempt whose flagship <span class="loc">La Belle</span> was wrecked in the bay the following year. In the 1820s, English-speaking settlers arrived and came into frequent conflict with the <span class="loc">Karankawa</span>, who were eventually driven out of the area.</p>
