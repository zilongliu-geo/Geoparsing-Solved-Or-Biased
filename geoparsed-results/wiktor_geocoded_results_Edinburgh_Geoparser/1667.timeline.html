  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Clark County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Nevada</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 1,951,269, with an estimated population of 2,000,759 in <span class="date">2012</span>. It is by far the most populous county in <span class="loc">Nevada</span>, accounting for nearly three-quarters of its residents. <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>, <span class="loc">Nevada</span>'s most populous city, has been the county seat since the county was established. The county was formed by the <span class="loc">Nevada</span> Legislature by splitting off a portion of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> on <span class="date">February 5, 1909</span>, and came into existence on <span class="date">July 1, 1909</span>. The <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> Valley, a 600 sq mi (1,600 km2) basin, includes <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> as well as the other primary population center, the unincorporated community of Paradise. Much of the county was originally part of <span class="loc">Pah-Ute County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Territory before <span class="loc">Nevada</span> became a state. The county was named for <span class="per">William Andrews Clark</span>, a Montana copper magnate and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senator. <span class="per">Clark</span> was largely responsible for the construction of the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and Salt Lake Railroad through the area, a factor heavily contributing to the region's early development.</p><br><br>
