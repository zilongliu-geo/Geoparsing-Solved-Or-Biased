<p>Belvedere /ˈbɛlvədɪər/ is a district of <span class="loc">south east London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> within the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Bexley</span>. It is located south east of <span class="loc">Thamesmead</span> and 12 miles (19 km) ESE of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. The area which is today known as <span class="loc">Belvedere</span> was for centuries part of <span class="loc">Lesness</span> Heath, the eastern parts of a narrow high ridge which stretches from the area of <span class="loc">Lesnes</span> Abbey to <span class="loc">Erith</span>. The northern stretch is industrial and environmental and was common meadow. In 1847 this largely uncultivated, wooded estate, almost undivided was given by operation of the will of last Lord Saye and Sele to his cousin Sir Culling Eardley, who built properties in <span class="loc">Belvedere</span> until his death in 1863. Eardley constructed a large wooden tower (see <span class="loc">Belvedere</span> (structure)) on the heath to gain views over his estate to the river <span class="loc">Thames</span>, giving the area its name from the Italian "beautiful view". The name can also be applied today, as the ridge of the area, and parts of its southern uplands, have commanding views towards <span class="loc">Canary Wharf</span> and Central London. Eardley was persuaded to allow the construction on his property, of a Dissenters' chapel, which was built so that the original wooden belvedere became its tower. In order that the public were able to attend this chapel, he constructed paths to it across <span class="loc">Lesness</span> Heath. Eardley had finished in 1861, after nearly 8 years of building, his chapel, now <span class="loc">All Saints</span>' Church, after the earlier chapel with belvedere burned down on the same site. At the same time Eardley constructed Villa Houses and reinforced the heath path to become Erith Road. The village of <span class="loc">Belvedere</span> soon grew up along the path which became Nuxley Road as Eardley gradually sold off the land.</p>
