<p><span class="loc">Bagani</span> (1.093 m above sea level) is a town on the south-western banks of the <span class="loc">Okavango River</span> in the <span class="loc">Kavango East Region</span>, <span class="loc">Namibia</span>, 200 km east of <span class="loc">Rundu</span> and near the <span class="loc">Popa Falls</span> on the <span class="loc">Okavango River</span>. <span class="loc">Bagani</span> has a population of around 2.000 inhabitants and is homestead of the local Mbukushu kings. On the opposite, north-eastern banks of the river lies <span class="loc">Bufalo</span> in <span class="loc">Caprivi</span> and the two towns are linked via a nearby border post. The history of <span class="loc">Bagani</span> (Mbukushu: "the old place") is closely linked with the history of the Mbukushu people, the easternmost of the five kingdoms of the Kavango people. Successor of king Mayavero I. became fumu <span class="loc">Mbambo</span>. <span class="loc">Bagani</span> was founded in 1820 and 1880. Since independence of <span class="loc">Namibia</span> in 1990 and in particularly since an ongoing decentralisation policy, <span class="loc">Bagani</span> has gained some investments. Compared to many other Villages in <span class="loc">Namibia</span>, <span class="loc">Bagani</span> is still underdeveloped. Like many Villages in <span class="loc">Northern Namibia</span>, <span class="loc">Bagani</span> suffered from a bad infrastructure and the political unrest in neighboring <span class="loc">Angola</span>. Until then, the economy of <span class="loc">Bagani</span> was characterized by small farmers with only few general services: next to a school, a small clinic and <span class="loc">Bagani</span> had no other shops.</p>
