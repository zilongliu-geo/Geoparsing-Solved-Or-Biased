  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Matala</span> (Greek Μάταλα) is a village located 75 km south-west of <span class="loc">Heraklion</span>, <span class="loc">Crete</span>, <span class="loc">Greece</span>. <span class="loc">Matala</span> is part of the community of Pitsidia within the municipal unit of <span class="loc">Festos</span>, <span class="loc">Heraklion</span> regional unit. The artificial caves in the cliff of the Matala bay were created in the Neolithic Age. <span class="loc">Matala</span> was the port of <span class="loc">Phaistos</span> during the Minoan period. In the <span class="date">year 220</span> BC., <span class="loc">Matala</span> was occupied by the Gortynians, and during the Roman period, <span class="loc">Matala</span> became the port of Gortys. In the 1st and 2nd <span class="date">centuries</span>, the caves were used as tombs. One of the caves is called "Brutospeliana" because according to the legend it was frequented by the Roman <span class="per">general Brutus</span>. <span class="loc">Matala</span> was then a fishing village. In <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, the caves were occupied by hippies who were later driven out by the church and the military junta. <span class="date">Now</span> <span class="loc">Matala</span> is a small village living mainly from tourism. Canadian folk singer <span class="per">Joni Mitchell</span>'s experiences with the Matala hippies were immortalised in her <span class="date">1971</span> song "Carey". When <span class="loc">Zeus</span> seduced the princess <span class="loc">Europa</span> in the form of a white bull, he crossed the sea and brought her to the beach of <span class="loc">Matala</span>. There he changed into an eagle and flew her to Gortys where he had sex with her.</p><br><br>
