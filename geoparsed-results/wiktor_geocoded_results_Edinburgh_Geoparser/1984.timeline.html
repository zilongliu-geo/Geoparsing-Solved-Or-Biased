  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cortes</span> is a rural settlement in the <span class="loc">Banff</span> and <span class="loc">Buchan</span> area of <span class="loc">Aberdeenshire</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, situated in the <span class="loc">parish of Rathen</span>, 7.8 kilometres (4.8 mi) south of <span class="loc">Fraserburgh</span>. The area stretches from the grounds of <span class="org">Cortes House</span> in the west to <span class="loc">Cortes</span> Village in the east on the border with the adjacent <span class="loc">parish of Lonmay</span>. <span class="loc">Cortes</span> lies at the northern end of the A952 road at its junction with the A90 road. Regular bus services connect the area to <span class="loc">Fraserburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Peterhead</span> and <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span>, and an on-demand Dial-a-bus service is also available. The nearby Lonmay railway station closed in <span class="date">1979</span>, and <span class="date">now</span> offers an access point to the <span class="loc">Formartine and Buchan Way</span>, the long-distance path that follows the route of the former railway. To the south lies <span class="loc">Mormond Hill</span>, on the slopes of which a hill figure known as the White Stag of Mormond, marked with quartz stones, was first laid out by <span class="per">Mr F. W. Cordiner of Cortes</span> to mark his wedding in <span class="date">1870</span>. The name <span class="loc">Cortes</span> is said to derive from a Gaelic word meaning circle, in reference to a structure that was described as a Druid temple in the New Statistical Account of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> (<span class="date">1845</span>), but is <span class="date">now</span> believed to be the remains of a recumbent stone circle.</p><br><br>
