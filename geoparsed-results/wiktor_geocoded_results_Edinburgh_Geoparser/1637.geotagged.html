<p><span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Miguel County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Once two separate municipalities (one a city and the other a town) both named <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>, west <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> ("<span class="loc">Old Town</span>") and east <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> ("New Town"), separated by the <span class="loc">Gallinas River</span>, retain distinct characters and separate, rival school districts. The population was 14,565 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span>, <span class="loc">NM</span> is located 110 miles (180 km) <span class="loc">south of Raton</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, 65 miles (105 km) <span class="loc">east of Santa Fe</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, 122 miles (196 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Albuquerque</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, 257 miles (414 km) <span class="loc">south of Colorado Springs</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, and 326 miles (525 km) <span class="loc">south of Denver</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> was established in 1835 after a group of settlers received a land grant from the Mexican government. The town was laid out in the traditional Spanish Colonial style, with a central plaza surrounded by buildings which could serve as fortifications in case of attack. <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> soon prospered as a stop on the <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> Trail. During the Mexican-American War in 1846, Stephen W. Kearny delivered an address at the Plaza of <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> claiming <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> for the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In 1877 Las Vegas College, the precursor to Regis University, was founded in <span class="loc">Las Vegas</span> by a group of exiled Italian Jesuits. In 1887, Las Vegas College moved to <span class="loc">Denver</span> whereupon the name was changed.</p>
