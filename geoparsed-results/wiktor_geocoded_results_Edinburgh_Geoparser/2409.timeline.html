  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Jefferson</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Ashtabula County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,120 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Ashtabula County</span>. Modern-day <span class="per">Jefferson</span> sports the world's only perambulator museum and a historical complex including several restored 19th-century buildings. <span class="per">Joshua Giddings</span>' law office has also been restored as a museum. Annual village events include the <span class="loc">Ashtabula County</span> Fair, the Strawberry Festival, <span class="per">Jefferson</span> <span class="date">Days</span>, and the Covered Bridge Festival. <span class="per">Jefferson</span> was officially founded by Gideon Granger—U.S. Postmaster General during <span class="per">Thomas Jefferson</span>'s administration—in <span class="date">1803</span>. He envisioned the new settlement as a "Philadelphia of the West," and early plans for the village were based upon the layout of that city. A cabin was erected by Granger's agent in <span class="date">1804</span>, but the settlement's first permanent residents arrived only in <span class="date">1805</span>: the <span class="per">Samuel Wilson</span> family. <span class="per">Wilson</span>, misled by land agents, moved to <span class="loc">Ohio</span> in <span class="date">late autumn</span> expecting to find a thriving <span class="loc">city on Granger</span>'s land. Instead, he found a wilderness, broken only by trees emblazoned with Philadelphian street names, marking where future streets would be built. <span class="per">Wilson</span> himself died after <span class="date">two weeks</span> of herculean effort to prepare for the <span class="date">winter</span>, but his family stayed on as the first citizens of <span class="per">Jefferson</span>.</p><br><br>
