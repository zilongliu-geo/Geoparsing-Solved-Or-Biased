<p><span class="loc">Sori</span> is a comune (municipality) in the <span class="loc">Province of Genoa</span> in the Italian region <span class="loc">Liguria</span>, located about 17 kilometres (11 mi) southeast of <span class="loc">Genoa</span>. Together with <span class="loc">Camogli</span>, <span class="loc">Pieve Ligure</span>, <span class="loc">Bogliasco</span> and <span class="loc">Recco</span>, it is part of the so-called <span class="loc">Golfo Paradiso</span> in the <span class="loc">Riviera di Levante</span>. Economy is based on tourism and production of olives. The municipality of <span class="loc">Sori</span> contains the frazioni (subdivisions, mainly villages and hamlets) <span class="loc">Canepa</span>, Capreno, <span class="loc">Lago</span>, Levà, <span class="loc">Polanesi</span>, <span class="loc">San Bartolomeo</span> di <span class="loc">Busonengo</span>, <span class="loc">Sant</span>’Apollinare, Sussisa, and Teriasca.

According to some theories, <span class="loc">Sori</span> was founded by Greek emigrants around the 7th century BC. Most likely, the small port was also used by the Romans, although the first mention of the town dates to the early Middle Ages, when it was a possession of the bishops of <span class="loc">Milan</span>; later it was part of the Republic of <span class="loc">Genoa</span>. In 1548 the town was sacked and ravagaed by 1500 pirates from <span class="loc">North Africa</span>. After the French domination, in 1815 <span class="loc">Sori</span> became part of the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Sardinia</span>, and from 1861 of the unified Kingdom of <span class="loc">Italy</span>.</p>
