  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Miguel</span>, <span class="loc">Bulacan</span> (Filipino: Bayan ng <span class="loc">San Miguel</span>; Kapampangan: <span class="loc">Balen</span> ning <span class="loc">Mayumu</span>) is a first class, urban municipality located in the third district of the <span class="loc">province of Bulacan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It was the 2nd largest municipality (area) in <span class="loc">Bulacan</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 142,854 people. The municipality of <span class="loc">San Miguel</span> de <span class="per">Mayumo</span> was established in <span class="date">1763</span> with <span class="per">Carlos Agustin Maniquiz</span>, <span class="per">Maria Juana</span> <span class="loc">Puno</span> - wife of <span class="per">Carlos Agustin Maniquiz</span> and <span class="per">Miguel Pineda</span> as the first town mayor of <span class="loc">San Miguel</span>. <span class="per">Miguel Pineda</span> was a native of <span class="loc">Angat</span>, <span class="loc">Bulacan</span> who decided to settle permanently in the barrio of <span class="loc">San Bartolome</span> (<span class="date">now</span> named Barangay Tartaro). He found the place ideal for hunting and was later chosen as the leader of other settlers. He formed an alliance with Mariano Puno, the recognized leader of the adjacent prosperous village called <span class="loc">Sto</span>. <span class="loc">Rosario</span> (<span class="date">now</span> named Barangay Mandile). The two leaders decided to form a town named <span class="per">Miguel De</span> <span class="per">Mayumo</span> after the name of <span class="per">Miguel Pineda</span> and <span class="per">Mayumo</span>, a Kapampangan word for sweets, for the goodwill and generosity of Mariano Puno.
