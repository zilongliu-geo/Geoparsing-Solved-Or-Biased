  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Newton is a suburban city in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is approximately 7 miles (11 km) west of downtown <span class="loc">Boston</span> and is bordered by Boston's <span class="loc">Brighton</span> and <span class="loc">West Roxbury</span> neighborhoods to the east and south, respectively, and by the suburb of <span class="loc">Brookline</span> to the east, the suburbs of <span class="loc">Watertown</span> and <span class="loc">Waltham</span> to the north, and <span class="loc">Wellesley</span> and <span class="loc">Needham</span> to the west. Rather than having a single city center, Newton is a patchwork of thirteen villages. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census, the population of Newton was 85,146, making it the eleventh largest city in the state. Newton's proximity to <span class="loc">Boston</span> along with its historic homes, good public schools, and safe and quiet neighborhoods make it a desirable community for those who commute to <span class="loc">Boston</span>. Newton is served by three modes of mass transit run by the MBTA: light rail, commuter rail, and bus service. Newton has consistently ranked as one of the best cities to live in in the country. In <span class="date">August 2012</span>, Money magazine named Newton fourth best small city among places to live in <span class="loc">America</span>.</p><br><br>
