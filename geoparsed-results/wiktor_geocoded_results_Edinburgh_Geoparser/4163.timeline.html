  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Woodlands (Chinese: 兀兰新镇, <span class="loc">Tamil</span>: ஊட்லண்ட்ஸ்), officially Woodlands Town, is an urban planning area and residential town located in the North Region of <span class="loc">Singapore</span>. It connects <span class="loc">Singapore</span> with <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>'s southernmost city, Johor Bahru, via the Johor-Singapore Causeway. The area consisting of modern-day Woodlands Town first witnessed the opening of the Johor-Singapore Causeway in <span class="date">1923</span>. Early Woodlands consisted of villages and squatters where residents made their living mostly as small-time shopkeepers and vegetable farmers in the Marsiling area, while rubber plantations and poultry farms dot the landscape in <span class="loc">Jalan</span> <span class="loc">Ulu</span> <span class="loc">Sembawang</span> where modern-day Admiralty is located. The first HDB flats were built from <span class="date">1972</span> in the northern part of <span class="loc">Marsiling</span>, and the Woodlands Bus interchange located at Woodlands Centre Road was built in <span class="date">1980</span>. <span class="org">Development of Woodlands</span> began in <span class="date">1981</span>. This compromises of the building of HDB flats in the Neighbourhood 1, which was completed in <span class="date">1985</span>; well after the Marsiling Estate. The Neighbourhood 8 were completed in <span class="date">1987</span>, together with the Neighbourhood 3 in <span class="date">1989</span>. Because of the saturation of HDB flats, the numbering system added 'A', 'B' and 'C'. Blocks 6xx in Admiralty begun to be completed in <span class="date">1996</span>, together with the 7xx in <span class="date">1997</span>.
