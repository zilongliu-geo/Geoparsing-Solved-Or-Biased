<p>Mitchell is a city in <span class="loc">Wheeler County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 130 at the 2010 census. It was founded in 1873 and was named after John H. Mitchell, a politician. The <span class="loc">Painted Hills</span> unit of the <span class="loc">John Day Fossil Beds National Monument</span> is about 9 miles (14 km) northwest of Mitchell. Mitchell School, a public school with an enrollment of about 70 students, is in Mitchell. At the request of William "Brawdie" <span class="loc">Johnson</span>, a blacksmith, a post office was established at Mitchell in 1873. <span class="loc">Johnson</span>, the first postmaster, suggested the name Mitchell after John Hipple Mitchell, a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Senator from <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. Senator Mitchell held the office in 1873−79, 1885−97, and 1901−05. Platted in 1885, the community was incorporated in 1893. In 1872 the first school in <span class="loc">Wheeler County</span> was established near Mitchell, and in 1874 it was relocated to the town itself. Over the next two decades, Mitchell grew to include a store, assay office, two churches, two hotels, livery stable, three houses of ill-repute (one of which is still standing), five saloons, a flour mill, a livery stable, and an apothecary. There were also two newspapers, The Sentinel and The News. The business district, including the saloons, grew up along <span class="loc">Bridge Creek</span> and became known locally as "Tiger Town". The church and most of the city's homes were built at higher elevation on a bench overlooking the creek; this part of town was known locally as "Piety Hill". About half the town was destroyed by fire in 1899, but it was later rebuilt.</p>
