<p>Dalton is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">Hambleton district</span> of <span class="loc">North Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is about 4 miles south of <span class="loc">Thirsk</span> and near the A168 road.It mainly consists of farmland as well as an industrial estate. It has a population of 518. In 1870, John Marius Wilson's said that: Dalton, a township in <span class="loc">Topcliffe parish</span>, N. R. <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span>; on the <span class="loc">Great North</span> of <span class="loc">England</span> railway, 4¼ miles S of <span class="loc">Thirsk</span>. Acres, 1, 247. Real property, £1, 709. Pop., 307. Houses, 77. There are chapels for Wesleyans and Primitive Methodists. . In 1890 Dalton was made up of 2,649 acres of land and 177 acres were covered in plantations. Some of it was elevated moorland and the rest was fertile land. A small ‘chapel of ease’ was created here in 1839 in which a service used to be held every second Sunday morning of the month, and every evening on all the other <span class="loc">Sundays</span>. In 1855 the <span class="loc">Wesleyan Methodist</span> Chapel was created which was described as “a very small and plain building”. To the South of Dalton there are the remains of a camp called ‘<span class="loc">Castle Steads</span>’, if you continue further South there is a block of stone called ‘<span class="loc">Stone Man</span>’ which used to be a large landmark. However, these stones were taken away to make fences. A mile South-east of the <span class="loc">Stone Man</span> a stone chest was found which had a ‘kale pot’ which is said to have contained money. Dalton is mentioned in the Domesday book. Dalton had 10.2 households in 1066 which is quite a small amount in comparison to other parishes according to the Domesday book. The total tax assessed is 5.2 geld units, which is quite large for a parish. The Lord in 1066 was called Bernwulf and the value to the lord was £4. The Lord as well as tenant-in-chief in 1086 was William of <span class="loc">Percy</span> and the value was £5. Dalton had 15 ploughlands, one mill, one church and four furlongs worth of woodland. During the Second World War, RAF Dalton was used as an airfield by RAF Bomber Command. It was home to No.102 Squadron in November 1941. In 1943 it was allocated to No.6 Group Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF).</p>
