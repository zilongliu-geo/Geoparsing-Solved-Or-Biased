  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Mum denies making up child death story in deportation battle. Nigerian woman <span class="per">Pamela Izevbekhai</span> <span class="date">yesterday</span> insisted she had not fabricated a story about the death of her baby daughter in order to be allowed to remain in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. <span class="per">Ms Izevbekhai</span> "totally rejected" allegations that she manufactured the story to bolster her case against deportation. "I did have a daughter <span class="per">Elizabeth</span> and she did die as I said," said the <span class="loc">Sligo</span>-based mother who has been fighting a long-running legal battle against deportation. She has consistently maintained that her first daughter died at the age of <span class="date">17 months</span> after being subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) and has argued that if the family is sent back to <span class="loc">Nigeria</span> her two younger daughters would be subjected to the same procedure. The mayor of <span class="per">Sligo, Veronica</span> Cawley, <span class="date">yesterday</span> stood by her decision to hold a civic reception for <span class="per">Ms Izevbekhai</span> <span class="date">last year</span> while a spokesman for the <span class="loc">Sligo</span>-based Let Them Stay organisation said <span class="date">yesterday</span>'s reports raised more questions than they answered. <span class="per">Cllr Cawley</span> said some people had suggested that she should apologise for holding the civic reception but she insisted: "I have nothing to apologise for." At that function in <span class="per">Sligo</span> Town Hall, <span class="per">Pamela</span> wept as she said that <span class="per">Elizabeth</span> would always be with the family and was a guardian angel for her sisters <span class="per">Naomi</span> and <span class="per">Jemima</span>. Cllr Cawley urged people not to jump to conclusions until all the facts come out. "I have always said that the purpose of the civic reception was to highlight the barbaric practice of female genital mutilation and <span class="date">today</span> I repeat my call for a worldwide ban on this torture," said Cllr Cawley. "Before <span class="per">Pamela</span> came to live in the north west, most us had never heard of FGM but there is a huge awareness <span class="date">now</span>.'' "These reports are only a snap shot in a long-running investigation which is not over yet," said Cllr Cawley. <span class="per">Cllr Cawley</span> said that while a number of people had gone on local radio <span class="date">yesterday</span> saying she should apologise for holding a civic reception for <span class="per">Ms Izevbekhai</span> "everyone who phoned me <span class="date">today</span> was supportive". Supporters of <span class="per">Ms Izevbekhai</span> pointed out that while <span class="loc">Lagos</span>-based obstetrician <span class="per">Dr Joseph Unokanjo</span> was <span class="date">now</span> claiming that he had never delivered a baby called <span class="per">Elizabeth Izevbekhai</span>, and that he had never treated her for post-FGM blood loss, a doctor of the same name has in <span class="date">the past</span> given interviews to RTE and Ocean FM in <span class="per">Sligo</span> saying the opposite and supporting <span class="per">Pamela</span>'s account. They also pointed out that he is <span class="date">now</span> saying that the baby he delivered for <span class="per">Pamela</span> in <span class="date">2000</span> was her first baby but she has a teenage son <span class="per">Adrian</span> who lives with his father Tony in <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>. A spokesman for Let Them Stay questioned why this material had been leaked <span class="date">now</span> and whether there was an agenda behind it. "The safety of these two little girls should still be the main issue and I wonder is the Irish government saying that it is safe to send them back to <span class="loc">Nigeria</span>?" he said. "We would like to see <span class="per">Dr Unokanjo</span> come on Irish radio again and see what he has to say <span class="date">now</span>." He said supporters were concerned about why these claims were being made <span class="date">now</span>, <span class="date">four years</span> after <span class="per">Ms Izevbekhai</span> first outlined her fears.</p><br><br>
