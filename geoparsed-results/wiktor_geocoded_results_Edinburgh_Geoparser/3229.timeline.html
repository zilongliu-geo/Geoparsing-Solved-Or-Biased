  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Piran</span> (Italian: <span class="loc">Pirano</span>) is a town in southwestern <span class="loc">Slovenia</span> on the Gulf of <span class="loc">Piran</span> on the <span class="loc">Adriatic Sea</span>. It is one of the three major towns of <span class="loc">Slovenian Istria</span>. The town has much medieval architecture, with narrow streets and compact houses. <span class="loc">Piran</span> is the administrative centre of the local area and one of <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>'s major tourist attractions. Until the mid-20th century, Italian was the dominant language, but was replaced by Slovene as demographics shifted. In the pre-Roman era, the hills in the Piran area were inhabited by Illyrian Histri tribes who were farmers, hunters and fishermen. They were also pirates who disrupted Roman trade in the northern Adriatic. The Piran peninsula was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 178 and <span class="date">177 BC</span> and settled in the following <span class="date">years</span> with rural homes (villae rusticae). The decline of the Roman Empire, from the <span class="date">5th century AD</span> onward, and incursions by the <span class="per">Avars</span> and <span class="per">Slavs</span> at the end of the 6th century, prompted the Roman population to withdraw into easily defensible locations such as islands or peninsulas. This started local urbanisation and by the 7th century, under Byzantine rule, <span class="loc">Piran</span> had become heavily fortified. Despite the defences, the Franks conquered <span class="loc">Istria</span> in 788 and <span class="per">Slavs</span> settled in the region. By 952, <span class="loc">Piran</span> had become a part of the Holy Roman Empire.</p><br><br>
