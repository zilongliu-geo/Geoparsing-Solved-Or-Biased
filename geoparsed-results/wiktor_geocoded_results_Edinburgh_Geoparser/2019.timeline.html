  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Burton is a city in <span class="loc">Genesee County</span> in the state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span> and a suburb of Flint. The population was 29,999 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, making Burton the second largest city in <span class="loc">Genesee County</span>. Although there were Native Americans and trappers whom lived on land earlier, and even some who attempted to settle by there, many of the original settlers of Burton came from the towns of <span class="loc">Adams</span> and <span class="loc">Henderson</span> in <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. For <span class="date">20 years</span>, this area was known as the <span class="loc">Atherton</span> settlement, after brothers <span class="per">Shubael</span> and <span class="per">Perus</span> <span class="loc">Atherton</span> and nephew <span class="loc">Pliny</span> <span class="loc">Atherton</span> <span class="loc">Skinner</span> (and later joined by another brother, <span class="per">Adonijah</span>), who settled on the <span class="loc">Thread Creek</span> in <span class="date">1835</span>. <span class="loc">Atherton</span> descendants still live in Burton in <span class="date">2014</span>. The <span class="loc">City of Burton</span> was organized as Burton Township, in <span class="date">1855</span>. Burton Township had first been a part of who got what taxable land. The North part of Burton was part of Kearsley Township along with the Southern part of Genesee Township from <span class="date">1839</span> until <span class="date">1843</span> when the township was merged back (for school purposes) into Flint Township. When <span class="org">the City of Flint</span> incorporated, Burton Township was separated from Flint Township by the <span class="org">Genesee County Board</span> of Supervisors on <span class="date">October 12, 1855</span>, although the first township meeting did not take place until <span class="date">April 7, 1856</span>, which is sometimes taken as the actual date of organization. Over the <span class="date">years</span>, large portions of the northern and western sides of the township were annexed by <span class="org">the City of Flint</span> for revenues. On <span class="date">May 16, 1972</span>, township residents voted to incorporate and the <span class="loc">City of Burton</span> was officially formed <span class="date">July 1</span> of <span class="date">that year</span>.</p><br><br>
