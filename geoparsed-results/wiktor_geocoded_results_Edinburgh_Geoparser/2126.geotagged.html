<p>Troy is a city in the <span class="loc">US</span> State of <span class="loc">New York</span> and the seat of <span class="loc">Rensselaer County</span>. The city is located on the western edge of <span class="loc">Rensselaer County</span> and on the eastern bank of the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>. Troy has close ties to the nearby <span class="loc">cities of Albany and Schenectady</span>, forming a region popularly called the Capital District. The city is one of the three major centers for the <span class="loc">Albany Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area (MSA), which has a population of 1,170,483. At the 2010 census, the population of Troy was 50,129. Troy's motto is Ilium fuit, Troja est, which means "Ilium was, Troy is". Before European arrival, the area was settled by the Mahican Indian tribe. The Dutch began settling in the mid 17th century; the patroon Kiliaen van Rensselaer called the area Pafraets <span class="loc">Dael</span>, after his mother. Control of <span class="loc">New York</span> passed to the English in 1664 and in 1707 Derick Van der Heyden purchased a farm near today's downtown area. In 1771 Abraham Lansing had his farm in today's <span class="loc">Lansingburgh</span> laid out into lots. Responding to Lansing's success to the north, in 1787, Van der Heyden's grandson Jacob had his extensive holdings surveyed and laid out into lots as well, calling the new village Vanderheyden.</p>
