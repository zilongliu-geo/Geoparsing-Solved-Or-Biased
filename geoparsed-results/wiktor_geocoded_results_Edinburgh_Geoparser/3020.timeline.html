  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Stanton</span> is a city located in <span class="loc">western Orange County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The population was 38,186 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 37,403 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The city was incorporated in <span class="date">1956</span> and operates under the Council-Manager form of government, providing a full range of municipal services. <span class="org">Stanton</span> is bounded by Cypress on the west, <span class="loc">Anaheim</span> on the north, and east, and Garden Grove on the east and south. On <span class="date">November 6, 1905</span>, the <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> Interurban Railway started service on the <span class="per">Santa Ana Line</span>. It ran along an almost perfectly straight line between Watts and <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span>. Access to transportation allowed the population of the rural area which is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="org">Stanton</span> and <span class="loc">West Anaheim</span> to grow. In <span class="date">1908</span>, the privately owned Pacific Electric Railway leased the <span class="per">Santa Ana Line</span> and took over the service which extended its regional light-rail system. By <span class="date">1928</span>, the impressive thousand mile system allowed residents convenient travel throughout <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> and <span class="org">Orange</span> Counties. See <span class="date">1928</span> Map. The passenger service to <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> was discontinued in <span class="date">1950</span>, shortly after the railway was taken over by the Metropolitan Transportation Agency. The easement still runs through town and is empty or used for parking. It intersects Beach/<span class="per">Pacific</span> and <span class="per">Cerritos</span>/Western.</p><br><br>
