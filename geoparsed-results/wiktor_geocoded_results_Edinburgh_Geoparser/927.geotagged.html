<p><span class="loc">Albany</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,033 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Clinton County</span>. It is located on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 127, about 6 miles (10 km) north of the Tennessee border. The community of <span class="loc">Albany</span> grew up around a tavern established by Benjamin Dowell in the early 19th century. In 1837, residents voted to make the location the seat of county government. It is generally accepted that the town, formally incorporated on January 27, 1838, was named after <span class="loc">Albany</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, but a local legend holds that, during the vote to determine the location of the county seat, patrons of Dowell's tavern shouted "All for Benny!", then "all Benny," which led to the town being called <span class="loc">Albany</span>. During the Civil War, <span class="loc">Albany</span> was attacked by Confederate forces, and many buildings, including the courthouse, were burned. A marker in the courthouse square notes that Clinton was the native <span class="loc">county of Civil War</span> terrorist Champion "Champ" Ferguson, hanged after the war for atrocities.</p>
