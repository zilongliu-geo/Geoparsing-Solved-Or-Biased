  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bagan</span> (Burmese: ပုဂံ; MLCTS: pu.gam, IPA: [bəɡàɴ]; formerly Pagan) is an ancient city located in the <span class="loc">Mandalay Region</span> of <span class="loc">Myanmar</span> . From the 9th to 13th <span class="date">centuries</span>, the city was the capital of <span class="org">the Kingdom of Pagan</span>, the first kingdom to unify the regions that would later constitute modern <span class="loc">Myanmar</span>. During the kingdom's height between the 11th and 13th <span class="date">centuries</span>, over 10,000 Buddhist temples, pagodas and monasteries were constructed in the Bagan plains alone, of which the remains of over 2200 temples and pagodas still survive to the present day. The Bagan Archaeological Zone is a main draw for the country's nascent tourism industry. It is seen by many as equal in attraction to <span class="loc">Angkor Wat</span> in <span class="loc">Cambodia</span>. <span class="loc">Bagan</span> is the present-day standard Burmese pronunciation of the Burmese word <span class="loc">Pugan</span> (ပုဂံ), derived from Old Burmese Pukam (ပုကမ်). Its classical Pali name is Arimaddana-pura (အရိမဒ္ဒနာပူရ, lit. "the City that Tramples on Enemies"). Its other names in <span class="loc">Pali</span> are in reference to its extreme dry zone climate: Tattadesa (တတ္တဒေသ, "parched land"), and Tampadipa (တမ္ပဒီပ, "bronzed country"). The Burmese chronicles also report other classical names of Thiri Pyissaya (သီရိပစ္စယာ) and Tampawaddy (တမ္ပဝတီ).</p><br><br>
