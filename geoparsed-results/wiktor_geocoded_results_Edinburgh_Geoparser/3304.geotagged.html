<p>Dawei (Burmese: ထားဝယ်မြို့; MLCTS: hta: wai mrui., pronounced: [dəwɛ̀ mjo̰]; <span class="loc">Mon</span>: ဓဝဲါ, [həwài]; Thai: ทวาย, RTGS: Thawai, pronounced [tʰā.wāːj]; formerly known as <span class="loc">Tavoy</span>), is a city in south-eastern <span class="loc">Myanmar</span> and capital of <span class="loc">Tanintharyi Region</span>, formerly <span class="loc">Tenasserim Division</span>, about 614.3 km (381.7 mi) south of <span class="loc">Yangon</span> on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Dawei</span> River. Population (2004 estimate), 139,900. It is at 14.09°N 98.20°E. Dawei is a port at the head of the <span class="loc">Dawei</span> River estuary, 30 km (18.6 mi). from the <span class="loc">Andaman Sea</span>. As a result, the city is prone to flooding during the monsoon season. "Dawei" is also the name of one of <span class="loc">Myanmar</span>'s 135 ethnic minorities. The area around the <span class="loc">Dawei</span> River estuary has been inhabited for centuries by <span class="loc">Dawei</span>, <span class="loc">Mon</span>, <span class="loc">Kayin</span>, and Thai mariners. From the 11th to 13th centuries, Dawei was part of the Pagan Empire. From 1287 to 1564, Dawei became part of the Sukhothai Kingdom and its successor <span class="loc">Ayutthaya Kingdom</span> (<span class="loc">Siam</span>). From 1564 to 1594, Dawei was part of the Toungoo Kingdom of <span class="loc">Burma</span>. <span class="loc">Siam</span> temporarily regained the city between 1594 and 1614. From 1614 to the 1740s, Dawei was the southernmost city under Burmese authority, and was defended by a Burmese garrison. In the late 1740s during the Burmese civil war of 1740–1757, Dawei, along with the northern <span class="loc">Tenasserim</span> coast, was taken over by <span class="loc">Siam</span>. <span class="loc">Burma</span> regained the city in 1760, and extended its control over the entire <span class="loc">Tenasserim</span> coast in 1765. The <span class="loc">Tenasserim</span> coast was ceded to the British after the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826).</p>
