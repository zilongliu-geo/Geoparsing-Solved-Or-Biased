The population was 1,314 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. Students in <span class="per">Houston</span> and neighboring Chartiers Township attend school in the Chartiers-Houston School District. <span class="per">Houston</span> is located at 40°14′59″N 80°12′37″W (40.249790, -80.210275). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2), all of it land. The land on which this town stands was part of a tract purchased from John Haft on <span class="date">January 24, 1827</span>, by <span class="per">Daniel Houston</span>, a near relative of Gen. <span class="loc">Sam Houston</span>, leader of the <span class="loc">Texans</span> in their war for independence from <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. After the Chartiers Valley Railroad was completed through that section in <span class="date">1871</span>, <span class="per">David C. Houston</span>, a son of <span class="per">Daniel Houston</span>, saw the possibilities of a town at that point and laid out the present plan of <span class="loc">Houstonville</span>. The first house in the new town was completed in the <span class="date">summer of 1871</span> by A. T. Haft and the second by <span class="per">J. C. Johnson</span>. <span class="date">A few years later</span> <span class="per">H. E. Riggle</span> laid out a plan adjoining which was called Riggletown until the <span class="loc">Borough of Houstonville</span> was incorporated on <span class="date">May 13, 1901</span>.</p><br><br>
