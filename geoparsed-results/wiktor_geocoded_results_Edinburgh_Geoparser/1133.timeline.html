  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Brighton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Northumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, approximately 150 kilometres (93 mi) east of <span class="loc">Toronto</span> and 100 km (62 mi) west of Kingston. It is traversed by both Highway 401 and the former Highway 2. The west end of the <span class="loc">Murray</span> Canal that leads east to the <span class="loc">Bay of Quinte</span> is at the east end of the town. <span class="loc">Brighton</span> was primarily an agricultural community, specializing in the farming of apples and production of new apple types. However, in <span class="date">recent years</span>, many of the original orchards in the area have been partially removed, to make way for the steadily growing population, and more profitable agricultural produce, such as: wheat, corn and soybeans. In <span class="date">late September</span>, <span class="loc">Brighton</span> is host to Applefest, its largest yearly festival. The Municipality of <span class="loc">Brighton</span> (formed on <span class="date">January 1, 2001</span>, through an amalgamation of the former Town of <span class="loc">Brighton</span> and <span class="loc">Brighton Township</span>) is home to nearly 11,000 inhabitants, with a higher than average percentage of those retired. This is common, as the quiet, clean and friendly atmosphere of many smaller towns near lake <span class="loc">Ontario</span> tend to draw the elderly as popular places for retirement living. Many small hamlets surround the town, including <span class="loc">Codrington</span>, <span class="loc">Carman</span>, <span class="loc">Hilton</span>, <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> and <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>.</p><br><br>
