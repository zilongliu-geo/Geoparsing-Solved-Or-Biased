<p><span class="loc">Knox County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 432,226, making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Knoxville</span>, the third-most populous city in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. <span class="loc">Knox County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Knoxville</span>, <span class="loc">TN</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county is at the geographical center of the Great Valley of East <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. Near the heart of the county is the origin of the <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> River at the union of the <span class="loc">Holston</span> and <span class="loc">French Broad</span> rivers. <span class="loc">Knox County</span> was created on June 11, 1792, by Governor William Blount from parts of <span class="loc">Greene</span> and <span class="loc">Hawkins</span> counties, one of the few counties created when the state was still known as the Southwest Territory. It is one of nine <span class="loc">United States</span> counties named for American Revolutionary War general and first <span class="loc">United States</span> Secretary of War Henry Knox. Parts of <span class="loc">Knox County</span> later became Blount (1795), Anderson (1801), <span class="loc">Roane</span> (1801), and Union (1850) counties. In 1783, an expedition into the Upper <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> Valley led by James White and Francis Alexander Ramsey explored what is now <span class="loc">Knox County</span>. White moved to what is now the <span class="loc">Riverdale</span> community in the eastern part of the county in 1785, and the following year constructed a fort a few miles to the west that would evolve into the <span class="loc">city of Knoxville</span>. Blount chose the fort as the capital of the Southwest Territory in 1790, and gave the new town the name "<span class="loc">Knoxville</span>" after his superior, Henry Knox.</p>
