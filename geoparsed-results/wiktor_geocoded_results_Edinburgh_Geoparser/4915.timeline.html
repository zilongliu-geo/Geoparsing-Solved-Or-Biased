  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 5,368, making it the least populous county in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The county seat is <span class="loc">Hampton</span>. <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> is Arkansas's 55th county, formed on <span class="date">December 6, 1850</span>, and named for <span class="per">John C. Calhoun</span>, a Vice President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The county is part of the <span class="loc">Camden</span>, <span class="loc">AR</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. Note: Unlike most counties, <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> has numbered townships instead of named townships. Townships in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> are the divisions of a county. Each township includes unincorporated areas; some may have incorporated cities or towns within part of their boundaries. Arkansas townships have limited purposes in modern times. However, the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census does list Arkansas population based on townships (sometimes referred to as "county subdivisions" or "minor civil divisions"). Townships are also of value for historical purposes in terms of genealogical research. Each town or city is within one or more townships in an <span class="loc">Arkansas county</span> based on census maps and publications. The townships of <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> are listed below; listed in parentheses are the cities, towns, and/or census-designated places that are fully or partially inside the township.</p><br><br>
