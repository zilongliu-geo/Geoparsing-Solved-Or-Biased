<p>Weston is a neighbourhood and former village in <span class="loc">Toronto</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The neighbourhood is situated in the northwest of the city, south of Highway 401, east of the <span class="loc">Humber River</span>, north of <span class="loc">Eglinton Avenue</span>, and west of Jane Street. Weston Road just north of Lawrence Avenue is the commercial core of Weston, with many small businesses and services. Weston was incorporated as a village in the 19th century and was absorbed into the <span class="loc">Borough of York</span> in the late 1960s. <span class="loc">York</span> itself was amalgamated into <span class="loc">Toronto</span> in 1998. Weston's building stock consists mostly of Victorian homes east of the railway with apartment and condominium towers on Weston Road overlooking the <span class="loc">Humber River</span> valley. Weston's main shopping district is located on Weston Road between <span class="loc">Church Street</span> in the north and Wilby Crescent (just south of Lawrence Avenue) in the south. Most buildings in this area reflect early-mid-20th century <span class="loc">Ontario</span> town architecture, brick buildings with decorative masonry. The town has a noteworthy library (previously a Mechanics' Institute and <span class="loc">Carnegie</span> library). The community is dotted with grand old churches with architectural significance. There has been a recent move in Weston to designate certain areas as a historical district. Most streets in Weston are lined with tall mature trees, some well over 100 years old. This is more common east of the railway tracks. Recently, there has been some infill development on former industrial and commercial lands bringing some new housing stock to the area. On April 26, 2013, a fire was accidentally started at 2304 Weston Road, due to tar during roof construction.</p>
