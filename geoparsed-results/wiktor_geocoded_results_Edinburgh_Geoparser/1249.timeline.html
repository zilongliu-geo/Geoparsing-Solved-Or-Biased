  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Hartford</span> is a neighborhood located along the western edge of Providence, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. Route 6 and the <span class="loc">Woonasquatucket River</span> separates it from <span class="loc">Olneyville</span>. Prior to the arrival of white settlers, the area had been used as a soapstone quarry by the Narragansett natives. The first white settlers were farmers. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth <span class="date">centuries</span>, settlers built dwellings intended for temporary stays, though later, attracted by the country atmosphere, they adopted permanent residence. In the early nineteenth century, the proximity of the <span class="loc">Woonasquatucket River</span> allowed the area to begin industrialization. In <span class="date">1812</span> the Mill Merino became the second textile establishment in the general area, producing a soft material called "merino cloth". Merino Village, consisting of stone houses, a general store, and water supply, was built by the company to support its workers. As the area began to develop further, its economic opportunities attracted immigrants. Though initially primarily Irish, later waves of immigration brought Polish and later Italian immigrants to the neighborhood. In <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, massive housing projects altered the fabric of <span class="loc">Hartford</span>. The construction of Route 6 meant the demolition of a swath of working-class housing, while two large low-income housing projects (Hartford Park Public Housing Project and Manton Heights Housing Projects) visually demonstrated a shift in the neighborhood's demographics. As with much public housing in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, both fell victim to neglect and vandalism, with the demolition of a significant number of units occurring in <span class="date">the 1980s</span>.</p><br><br>
