The population was 1,362 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 1,686 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. The town is named after Plácido <span class="loc">Benavides</span> (<span class="date">1837</span>–<span class="date">1919</span>), namesake nephew of Plácido <span class="loc">Benavides</span> (<span class="date">1810</span>–<span class="date">1837</span>), Tejano <span class="date">1832</span> alcalde of Victoria, who served under <span class="per">Stephen F. Austin</span> with <span class="per">Juan Seguin</span>, in the Siege of Béxar. Plácido <span class="loc">Benavides</span> whom the town is named after served in the Confederate States Army. After the war, he built his "<span class="loc">Rancho Palo Alto</span>" into one of the largest ranches in <span class="loc">Duval County</span>. In <span class="date">1880</span>, he agreed to let the county locate a railroad station on his property. In <span class="date">1881</span>, he donated 80 acres (32 ha) to establish the community that grew up around the station on the <span class="loc">Texas</span> Mexican Railway. In <span class="date">1882</span> Archie Parr arrived to manage the <span class="loc">Sweden</span> Ranch for the <span class="loc">Lott</span> &amp; Nielson Pasture Company. The former schoolteacher and ranch hand was later a rancher, <span class="loc">Texas</span> state senator, and the first "<span class="per">Duke of Duval</span>", political boss of the county. His middle son, <span class="per">George Berham Parr</span>, succeeded him as El Patrón and <span class="per">Duke of Duval</span>. Other descendants of <span class="loc">Archie</span> also figured prominently in county politics. In <span class="date">1911</span>, <span class="loc">Archie</span> campaigned unsuccessfully to move the county courthouse from <span class="loc">San Diego</span> to <span class="loc">Benavides</span>.</p><br><br>
