  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Pablo</span> is a city in Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Richmond</span> surrounds nearly the whole city. The population was 29,139 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The current Mayor is Rich Kinney, and the current Vice Mayor is <span class="per">Paul V. Morris</span>. Current Council members include <span class="per">Cecilia Valdez</span>, <span class="per">Kathy Chao</span> <span class="loc">Rothberg</span>, and Rich Kinney. The area in which <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="loc">San Pablo</span> is situated was originally occupied by the Cuchiyun band of the Ohlone indigenous people. The area was claimed for the king of <span class="loc">Spain</span> in the late 18th century and was granted for grazing purposes to the <span class="loc">Mission Dolores</span> located in <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>. Upon <span class="loc">Mexico</span>'s independence from <span class="loc">Spain</span>, church properties were secularized and in <span class="date">1823</span>, the area became part of a large grant to an ex-soldier stationed at the <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> <span class="per">Presidio, Francisco</span> <span class="per">Mar√≠a Castro</span>. The grant was given the name <span class="loc">Rancho San Pablo</span>, thus originating the name for <span class="date">today</span>'s city as well as for one of the <span class="loc">East Bay</span>'s oldest principal roads, <span class="date">today</span>'s <span class="loc">San Pablo</span> Avenue (called in the prior Spanish era "<span class="loc">El Camino Real</span> de la <span class="loc">Contra Costa</span>").</p><br><br>
