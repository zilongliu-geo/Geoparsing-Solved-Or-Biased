<p><span class="loc">Dora</span> (also al-Dura, or ad-Durah, Arabic,الدورة) is a neighborhood in <span class="loc">Al Rashid</span> administrative district, <span class="loc">southern Baghdad</span>, <span class="loc">Iraq</span>. Although this was a majority Assyrian Christian neighborhood, it became controlled by Sunni Muslim Extremists during the Iraq War. They started ethnic cleansing of the neighborhood in 2006-2007, driving out or forcing conversions and confiscating or attacking property. Hundreds of Christian, Shia and Mandeans families have fled since late 2006 due to de facto Islamist Sunni control of the area. It became an al-Qaeda stronghold as affiliated foreign Islamic fighters entered the country after 2004. <span class="loc">United States</span> soldiers once called it "the most dangerous place in <span class="loc">Iraq</span>" until they were driven out. In the early morning of March 19, 2003, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> forces initiated the invasion of <span class="loc">Iraq</span> by attacking a "buried command post" believed to be occupied by Saddam Hussein and his sons Uday and Qusay. In fact, the target did not exist; the strike on a disused above-ground regime leadership compound killed one civilian and injured fourteen others, including one child.
