<p>Dillon is a village in the boreal forest of <span class="loc">northern Saskatchewan</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It is located on the western shore of <span class="loc">Peter Pond Lake</span> at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Dillon River</span>. The village is the administrative headquarters of the <span class="loc">Buffalo River</span> Dene First Nations band government and is accessed by Highway 925 from Highway 155. The North West Company had a post near Dillon in 1790. It was called Lac des Boeufs Post (<span class="loc">Buffalo Lake</span> Post). The Hudson's Bay Company had a post nearby in 1791. In 1819-1820 Sir <span class="loc">John Franklin</span> noted the position of the North West Company Post on <span class="loc">Buffalo Lake</span> (<span class="loc">Peter Pond Lake</span>) where <span class="loc">Buffalo River</span> (<span class="loc">Dillon River</span>) is located. (see map) The first post office opened under the name of <span class="loc">Buffalo River</span> in 1926 and closed in 1929. In 1954 the post office was re-opened under the name of Dillon. In 1932 the name of the village of <span class="loc">Buffalo River</span> was officially changed to Dillon, the name of the river was changed from <span class="loc">Buffalo River</span> to <span class="loc">Dillon River</span> and <span class="loc">Buffalo Lake</span> was renamed <span class="loc">Peter Pond Lake</span>. A lake on the <span class="loc">Dillon River</span> just west of <span class="loc">Vermette Lake</span> also received its official name of <span class="loc">Dillon Lake</span> in 1932.</p>
