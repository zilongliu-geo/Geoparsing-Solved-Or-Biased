<p>Carmen is a first class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Cotabato</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 82,469 people. Carmen derived its name from a certain Surveyor del Carmen, chief of the Cadastral Survey Party, who in 1924 conducted a survey in the area. During the American period, Carmen and Kabacan belonged to one municipal district under <span class="loc">Pikit</span>. It was by virtue of Presidential Proclamation NO. 46 and, was reinforced by Executive Order No. 214 issued by the then President <span class="loc">Ramon Magsaysay</span> last November 15, 1956 when Carmen was created as a separate and distinct town of Kabacan. When created a municipality, it was composed of Thirty Eight (38) barangays. Ten barangays were either claimed or ceded to the two adjacent municipalities, <span class="loc">Banisilan</span> and <span class="loc">President Roxas</span>. Six by the municipality of <span class="loc">Banisilan</span> and four to the municipality of <span class="loc">President Roxas</span>. Now, only twenty eight (28) barangays remain in which are presently inhabited by the so-called Tri-people composed of the Christians, the Muslims and Indigenous Peoples belonging to the Manobo-Aromanon ethnic group.</p>
