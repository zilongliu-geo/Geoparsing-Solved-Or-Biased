  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Waterford</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Erie County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,449 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is part of the <span class="loc">Erie Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> is an independent municipality located entirely within (and completely surrounded by) <span class="loc">Waterford</span> Township and is located near the geographic center of the township. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> is located at 41°56′37″N 79°59′2″W (41.943648, -79.984012).

In <span class="date">December 1753</span>, at age 21, <span class="loc">Washington</span> was asked by <span class="per">Governor Dinwiddie</span> to carry a British ultimatum to the French Canadians on the Ohio frontier. <span class="loc">Washington</span> delivered the message to the French Canadians at <span class="loc">Fort Le Boeuf</span> in present-day <span class="loc">Waterford</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. The message, which went unheeded because he delivered it to the wrong person, called for the French Canadians to abandon their development of the Ohio country to the south. The two colonial powers were heading toward worldwide conflict, <span class="date">the Seven Years</span>' War, or the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span>.</p><br><br>
