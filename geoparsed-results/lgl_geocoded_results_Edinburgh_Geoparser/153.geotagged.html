Va.</span>, is currently being held in the North Central Regional Jail in Greenwood, W. Va., on a parole violation and will be returned to <span class="loc">Meigs County</span>, Prosecutor Colleen Williams said in a news release. Williams, along with James Lee Garnes, 39, of <span class="loc">Pomeroy</span> in <span class="loc">Meigs County</span>, also has been charged with receiving stolen property and tampering with evidence. Garnes appeared in Meigs County Court Friday and is being held on $50,000 bond. Williams is accused of killing Doris Jackson, whose strangled body was found inside her home Feb. 26. Local police recovered her stolen 1989 Mercury Marquis in <span class="loc">Athens</span> two days later. Jackson, who lived alone, hoarded packages, clothing, boxes and other items, county Sheriff Robert Beegle said, and her body was found beneath a three-foot pile of belongings. The prosecutor said she may seek additional charges against Williams when she presents the case to grand jury.</p>
