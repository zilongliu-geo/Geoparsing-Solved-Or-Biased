<p><span class="loc">Dungu</span> /ˈdʊŋɡuː/ DUUNG-goo is a town in <span class="loc">Haut-Uele District</span> located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Dungu</span> and <span class="loc">Kibali Rivers</span> where they join to form the <span class="loc">Uele</span> River, south of the Garamba National Park. <span class="loc">Dungu</span>'s terrain is wooded savannah, and its climate is tropical. It is the principal town in <span class="loc">Dungu</span> Territory. It has a hospital, nursing school, high school, Internet cafe, and a cathedral—as it is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Doruma–Dungu. The town is divided into four main neighbourhoods: <span class="loc">Uye</span> (south), <span class="loc">Mussa</span> (south center), <span class="loc">Ngilima</span> (center) and Bamokandi (north). There is an airport (ICAO code FZJC)  in Dungu-Uye with an unpaved runway. In 2004 its population was estimated at over 23,000. The major tribe is the <span class="loc">Azande</span>, and the national language used locally is <span class="loc">Lingala</span>. Some people speak a dialect of <span class="loc">Lingala</span> called <span class="loc">Bangala</span>, which contains many words from <span class="loc">Zande</span>, Swahili, and other languages. In 1942, the Belgian territorial administrator Schollaert was given the task of building a bridge across the <span class="loc">Dungu</span> River. Instead of building a two-lane bridge as ordered, he built a one-lane bridge. With the remaining bricks he built a medieval style castle with 40 rooms between the <span class="loc">Dungu</span> and <span class="loc">Kibali</span> rivers.</p>
