<p><span class="loc">San Andres</span> is a third class municipality on the island of and in the <span class="loc">province of Catanduanes</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 35,779 people. In 1964, a bill was presented to the Philippine Congress to rename the town <span class="loc">San Andres</span> in honor of its patron, <span class="loc">Saint Andrew</span> the Apostle. This bill was approved as Republic Act No. 3948 on June 18 that same year. Many Calolbonganons loved the old name, a name used since time immemorial and unique to the entire archipelago. They were upset that there had never been a referendum vote. "The change of <span class="loc">Calolbon</span> to <span class="loc">San Andres</span> without consulting the townspeople," said one outspoken native, "is a rape of democracy." But for those who were deeply religious and very much devoted to St. Andrew, the change from <span class="loc">Calolbon</span> to <span class="loc">San Andres</span> was no different from changing a pagan name to a Christian one. In 1989, according to the Catholic Directory of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> published by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span> (CBCP), the town of <span class="loc">San Andres</span> had a total population of 18,369, the majority of which were Roman Catholic. Others belonged to diverse religious denominations that include Jehovah's Witness, the Iglesia ni <span class="loc">Cristo</span>, the LDS Church and Born-Again or Fundamentalist sects.</p>
