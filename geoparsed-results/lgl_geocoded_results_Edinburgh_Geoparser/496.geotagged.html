The victim, who was not identified, sustained a gunshot wound to the back and one in the leg in an early morning incident at Orange and White streets, said Capt. Eugene C. Dexheimer. Officers were dispatched to the intersection at 12:20 a.m. after receiving word of the shooting which is believed to have occurred about midnight. The victim told authorities a man approached him, attempted to rob him and shot him in the leg with a revolver. As he attempted to run away, he was shot a second time in the back. "He somehow managed to get into a vehicle and drive himself to Mercy Medical Center," said Dexheimer. His condition is not considered life-threatening. The suspect is described as a black male, 180 pounds, bald andwearing a white shirt and jeans. Dexheimer said officers scoured the scene but were unable to locate the gun and there were no witnesses.</p>
