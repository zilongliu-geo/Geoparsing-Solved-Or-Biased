<p>Queenstown is a town in the West Coast region of the island of <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>. It is in a valley on the western slopes of <span class="loc">Mount Owen</span> on the West Coast Range. At the 2011 census, Queenstown had a population of 1,975 people. Queenstown's history has long been tied to the mining industry. This mountainous area was first explored in 1862. It was long after that when alluvial gold was discovered at <span class="loc">Mount Lyell</span>, prompting the formation of the Mount Lyell Gold Mining Company in 1881. In 1892, the mine began searching for copper. The final name of the <span class="loc">Mount Lyell</span> company was the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company. Queenstown Post Office opened on 21 November 1896. A Queenstown South office opened in 1949 and closed in 1973. In the 1900s, Queenstown was the centre of the <span class="loc">Mount Lyell</span> mining district and had numerous smelting works, brick-works, and sawmills. The area at the time was finely wooded. The population in 1900 was 5051; the district, 10,451. The town was the base of the Queenstown council up until amalgamation with other west coast councils in the 1990s. The town in its heyday had a collection of hotels, churches and schools that have all significantly reduced since the demise of the <span class="loc">Mount Lyell</span> company.</p>
