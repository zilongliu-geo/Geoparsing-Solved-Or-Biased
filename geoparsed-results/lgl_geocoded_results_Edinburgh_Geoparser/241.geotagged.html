<p><span class="loc">Henderson</span>, <span class="loc">Boulder City</span> to weigh police, fire facility. The <span class="loc">Boulder City</span> Council on Tuesday will consider continuing plans to build a public safety training facility for police and firefighters in the <span class="loc">Eldorado</span> Valley. If the council approves a memorandum of understanding with <span class="loc">Henderson</span>, the cities will move forward with joint development of the 720-acre training grounds, a project nearly 10 years in the works. <span class="loc">Henderson</span> has $1 million set aside for the $6 million project, said Keith Paul, a spokesman for the Henderson Police Department. The agreement wouldn't place any timelines for construction, but it would mean the cities would continue looking for funding in future appropriation bills, <span class="loc">Boulder City</span> Manager Vicki Mayes said. "It's the first step in the process," she said. In 2007, <span class="loc">Boulder City</span> dedicated $150,000 for the master plan of the training grounds to be built near Silver State Materials off <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 95, just north of the dry lake bed, <span class="loc">Mayes</span> said. At the council meeting, Poggemeyer Design Group will present that master plan. The facility would have pistol, rifle and shotgun ranges, repelling towers, and a track for emergency vehicle operators to train, <span class="loc">Boulder City</span> Police Chief Thomas Finn said. <span class="loc">Boulder City</span> and <span class="loc">Henderson</span> would allow other police and fire agencies to use the facility for a fee, he said. <span class="loc">Mayes</span> said $600,000 for the project recently was recently approved through the Legislature's omnibus bill. Finn said pairing with <span class="loc">Henderson</span> on the project is ideal. "Henderson has money and we have land," he said. "It's a perfect location because it will probably be surrounded some day by solar energy plants, never homes and businesses, so no one will ever complain about the shooting ranges."</p>
