<p>Wellington is a city in Palm <span class="loc">Beach County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of 2014, the city had a population of 61,485 according to the U.S. Census Bureau, making it the most populous village in the state. It is the fifth largest municipality in Palm <span class="loc">Beach County</span> by population. Wellington is part of the <span class="loc">South Florida Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Wellington was named Money Magazine's "Top 100" Best Places to Live in 2010. Although Wellington is not a village under any standard definition of the term village in the <span class="loc">US</span>, it is referred to officially as the "Village of Wellington". Wellington was originally the world's largest strawberry patch on land called the Flying Cow Ranch; "Flying" because the founder was an aviator, and "Cow" stood for the initials for Charles Oliver Wellington (C.O.W.) In the 1950s, Mr. Wellington bought 18,000 acres (73 km2) of central Palm <span class="loc">Beach County</span> swampland, which would eventually become the Village of Wellington. Wellington began as a planned unit development approved by Palm <span class="loc">Beach County</span> in 1972, and up until 1990, it functioned as a sprawling bedroom community with few shopping centers or restaurants until it was incorporated in December 1995. It has now become known as an international center for equestrian sports.</p>
