<p><span class="loc">Guayabal</span> is a municipality (municipio) of the <span class="loc">Azua province</span> in the <span class="loc">Dominican Republic</span>. The people speak with a heavy "Sureño" accent, meaning Southern, typical of Southern Dominicans. That is, an „o“ sounds almost like an „u“. So you hear <span class="loc">Riu</span> or <span class="loc">Tiu</span> (uncle) instead of <span class="loc">Rio</span> or <span class="loc">Tio</span>. <span class="loc">Guayabal</span> lies 725 meters above sea level at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Arroyo Guayabal</span> in the <span class="loc">Rio Cueva</span>. The coordinates are 18°44'56 N 70°50'11 W (from Google Earth). A trail goes through the <span class="loc">Arroyo Guayabal</span> to <span class="loc">Constanza</span>. <span class="loc">Constanza</span> is about a two-hour drive, yet the roads require the use of sports utility vehicles. <span class="loc">Guayabal</span> is about 20 km (50 minutes if using the public minibus, <span class="loc">Guagua</span>) north-east of Padre las Casas, and about another 2 hours, in the <span class="loc">Guagua</span>, away from the province capital <span class="loc">Azua de Compostela</span>. <span class="loc">Guayabal</span> administrates some smaller villages alongside the <span class="loc">Rio Cueva</span>. These villages are accessible solely with offroad capable vehicles. Some include: <span class="loc">Periquito</span> (20 min. west), <span class="loc">Arroyo Corozo</span> (15 min. east), <span class="loc">La Guama</span> (30 min. south-east) and <span class="loc">El Recodo</span> (2 hr.'s south-east). Being that <span class="loc">Guayabal</span> is difficult to access its residents are very dependent on Padre las Casas for many goods and services.</p>
