<p>Colton is a district of <span class="loc">east Leeds</span>, <span class="loc">West Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, situated between <span class="loc">Cross Gates</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Halton</span> and <span class="loc">Halton Moor</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Whitkirk</span> to the north-west and Austhorpe to the north-east. <span class="loc">Temple Newsam</span> lies directly south of the estate. The district falls within the <span class="loc">Temple Newsam</span> ward of the <span class="loc">Leeds City</span> Council. The small <span class="loc">Whitkirk</span> <span class="loc">Lane End</span> estate (which is situated between <span class="loc">Colton Road</span> and <span class="loc">Colton Roundabout</span>) is often considered more part of the <span class="loc">Colton district</span> than <span class="loc">Whitkirk</span>, because of its separation from <span class="loc">Whitkirk</span> via Selby Road, and its proximity to <span class="loc">Colton Road</span>. Colton was mentioned in the Domesday Book as 'Coletun', and was originally a medieval farming village. It consists mainly of cul-de-sacs, with inter-linking ginnels, back alleys and housing ranges from detached houses, semi-detached houses, terraced houses, and flats. The area is 4 miles to the east of <span class="loc">Leeds</span> city centre, and is close to the A63 dual carriageway and M1 motorway. Colton is also the area of <span class="loc">Leeds</span>, where the <span class="loc">Leeds</span> Outer Ring Road terminates. The area is well served by buses, with the numbers 19 and 19A going to and from the city centre, and the number 9 going to and from <span class="loc">Seacroft</span>.</p>
