  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="org">McDonald's</span> is asking everyone who ate at a <span class="org">McDonald's</span> restaurant located in <span class="loc">Greenlane</span>, <span class="loc">Auckland</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, in <span class="date">December 15, 2006</span>, to go to their doctor after a worker tested positive for Hepatitis A. <span class="per">Doctor Greg Simmons</span>, medical officer of health in <span class="loc">Auckland</span>, said that it is possible for the food handler worker to have passed on the disease during 7:00 p.m. (NZDT) and 2:00 a.m. as he would have been in the most infectious stage of Hepatitis A and was not wearing gloves. According to a spokeswoman from <span class="org">McDonald's</span>, <span class="per">Joanna Redfern-Hardisty</span>, food handlers are not required to wear gloves but are required to have thoroughly washed their hands with antimicrobial soap. However <span class="per">Dr Simmons</span> says that the infected worker usually wore gloves. The shift the worker worked was the only one the worker handled food when he was infectious with Hepatitis A. It is unknown how many people could have come into contact with food that the infected worker had prepared as <span class="date">Friday night</span> is usually a busy night, according to <span class="per">Ms Redfern-Hardisty</span>. <span class="per">Dr Simmons</span> says that if someone has been infected with Hepatitis A then they will currently be showing early symptoms. Those symptoms include being tired, no appetite, nausea and skin and eyes will show a yellowish colour. <span class="per">Ms Redfern-Hardisty</span>, spokeswoman for <span class="org">McDonald's</span>, confirmed that no more risk is being posed to customers. She said that it is currently unknown where the worker caught Hepatitis A but has stated that it was from an external source. The worker has been suspended from work. If you ate at the <span class="loc">McDonalds</span> located in <span class="loc">Greenlane</span>, <span class="loc">Auckland</span>, on <span class="date">late December</span> 15, <span class="date">early December</span> 16, then please either visit your doctor or ring the <span class="org">Auckland Regional Public Health Service</span> on 096234600.</p><br><br>
