<p><span class="loc">Ivanovo</span> (Russian: Иваново; IPA: [ɪˈvanəvə]) is a city and the administrative center of <span class="loc">Ivanovo Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located 254 kilometers (158 mi) from <span class="loc">Moscow</span> and approximately 100 kilometers (62 mi) from Yaroslavl, <span class="loc">Vladimir</span>, and <span class="loc">Kostroma</span>. Population: 408,330 (2010 Census); 431,721 (2002 Census); 481,042 (1989 Census). The <span class="loc">Uvod</span> River, a tributary of the Klyazma, flows from north to south, dividing the city in to two halves. There are also two rivers in <span class="loc">Ivanovo</span>: the <span class="loc">Talka</span> and the <span class="loc">Kharinka</span>. The city is first mentioned in 1561, when it was given to the Cherkassky princely family by Ivan IV, after the latter's marriage to Maria Cherkasskaya. However, the relevant document has since been lost. The modern city was created by merging the old flax-processing village <span class="loc">Ivanovo</span> with the industrial Voznesensky Posad in 1871. Yakov Garelin—a patron of arts, historian, manufacturer, and public figure—is considered to be the founder of the city and its first head. Under his government, the city began to develop, industrialise, and grow.</p>
