  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Candelaria</span> is a third class municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Zambales</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it had a population of 25,020 people. <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> is approximately 42 km (26 mi) from the capital town of <span class="loc">Iba</span>. It is nestled at the foot of the <span class="loc">Zambales Mountains</span> in the east and lies along coastline of the <span class="loc">South China Sea</span> in the west, with a total land area of 33,359 hectares (82,430 acres), making it the third-largest town in terms of land area in <span class="loc">Zambales</span>. This municipality is known for <span class="loc">Uacon</span> Lake, the cleanest lake in Central Luzon, and for its numerous beach resorts. During the pre-Spanish era, <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> was unsettled forest land. It was then a sitio of <span class="loc">Masinloc</span>, one of the oldest towns of <span class="loc">Zambales</span>. Settlement by <span class="loc">Sambal</span> from other parts of <span class="loc">Masinloc</span>, who found <span class="loc">Candelaria</span> an ideal location to live, played an important role in how this sitio became a town separate from <span class="loc">Masinloc</span> in <span class="date">1870</span>. The name of the town could have come from the name of the wife of the first Alcalde Mayor, who named the town after her as a birthday gift. There was also a story that the Spanish first saw many candles in this place and called it Candle-Area, a place of many candles; this story is anachronistic, however, as "Candle-Area" would have been an English rather than a Spanish name. It should also be noted that candelaria is also the Spanish word for Candlemas. As the <span class="date">years</span> passed, it was customarily called <span class="loc">Candelaria</span>.</p><br><br>
