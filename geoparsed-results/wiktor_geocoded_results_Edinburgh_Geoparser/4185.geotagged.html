<p><span class="loc">Vila Velha</span> ([ˈvilɐ ˈvɛʎɐ]; Portuguese for "<span class="loc">Old Town</span>") is a coastal town in Espírito Santo, <span class="loc">Brazil</span>. It lies across from Vitória, the state capital. Its population was 396,323 (2005) and its area is 208.82 km². <span class="loc">Vila Velha</span> forms part of the Greater <span class="loc">Vitória metropolitan</span> area. To the north is Vitória, to the <span class="loc">west Cariacica</span> and <span class="loc">Viana</span>, to the south <span class="loc">Guarapari</span>, and to the east the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>. Notable corporations in <span class="loc">Vila Velha</span> include Garoto, one of <span class="loc">Brazil</span>'s largest chocolate manufacturers. <span class="loc">Vila Velha</span> has been through several years of intense real estate development and several luxury buildings are now a common sight in all of its main beaches. Some critics argue that this practice can be considered excess urbanization of a previously low-profile area, despite the economic benefits. The Deputy Darcy Castelo de Mendonça Bridge, known as Third Bridge (Portuguese: Terceira Ponte), is the second tallest bridge in <span class="loc">Brazil</span>, connecting and reducing the distance between the cities of <span class="loc">Vila Velha</span> and Vitória. <span class="loc">Vila Velha</span> is the oldest township in Espírito Santo. It was founded as Vila do Espírito Santo ("Village of the Holy Spirit") on 23 May 1535 by <span class="loc">Vasco</span> <span class="loc">Fernandes</span> <span class="loc">Coutinho</span>, the first captain of Espírito Santo. (The nickname "Green Shins" given to people from <span class="loc">Vila Velha</span> originated from the green algae that stuck to the legs of sailors returning from shore to <span class="loc">Coutinho</span>'s ship.) He was forced to return to <span class="loc">Portugal</span> around 1550 in order to recruit new colonists, as there were not enough to sustain the colony. Upon his return, however, he discovered that there had been violent disputes between the colonists, slaves, and Indians, which had forced most inhabitants to flee to the island of Vitória. In response, <span class="loc">Coutinho</span> relocated the capital to Vitória. Afterward, <span class="loc">Vila Velha</span> remained a quiet town until quite recently; the 1828 census, for example, showed only 1,250 people in the town. Today, however, <span class="loc">Vila Velha</span> is the biggest city in the entire state of Espírito Santo and has approximately 500,000 inhabitants.</p>
