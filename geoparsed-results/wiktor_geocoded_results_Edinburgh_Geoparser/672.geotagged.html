<p><span class="loc">Lancaster</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Lancaster Township</span>, <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> was platted on Oct. 5, 1815 by David Hillis and William McFarland. The plat established 128 lots, reserving some for the construction of a courthouse, market house and place of public worship. They probably wanted to get the county seat moved from Madison. McFarland was a county judge and Hillis, a popular local politician, later became lieutenant government of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. The Lancaster Post Office operated from March 16, 1830 through August 30, 1839. Service went to <span class="loc">Dupont</span>, then to Republican and Franklin Mills, before returning to <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> on August 19, 1841. It closed on March 15, 1907. Before the Civil War, the area was a center of anti-slavery activity. The Neal's Creek Anti-Slavery Baptist Church, founded in 1846, moved to <span class="loc">Lancaster</span> in 1847. It later became known as the College Hill Baptist Church and disappeared by 1879. The Eleutherian College, founded in 1848, was the second co-educational, integrated college to open in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It accepted black and white students until the Civil War when it stopped accepting blacks. It closed and in 1874 then reopened as a private high school and normal school that same year. It operated until 1888 when it was purchased by <span class="loc">Lancaster Township</span> and the stone college building was used as an elementary school until 1937.</p>
