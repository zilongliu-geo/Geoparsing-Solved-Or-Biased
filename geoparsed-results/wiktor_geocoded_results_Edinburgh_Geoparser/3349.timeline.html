  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rockville</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Hanover County</span> in the <span class="loc">Central Region</span> of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of Virginia. <span class="loc">Rockville</span> was named after early 19th century postmaster, <span class="per">William Rock</span>. Prior to the name "Rockville," the community was named "Dentonsville," after postmaster <span class="per">Allen Denton</span>, the descendent of colonial settler <span class="per">Thomas Denton</span>, whose tavern ("<span class="per">Denton</span>'s Tavern") exists <span class="date">today</span> as a private residence. When <span class="per">Allen Denton</span> sold the tavern to <span class="per">William Rock</span>, the name of the community also changed to reflect the new postmaster. The community formerly consisted primarily of farmland. <span class="date">Today</span> many <span class="loc">Rockville</span> residents commute to jobs in <span class="loc">Richmond</span>. Additional information on the early history of <span class="loc">Rockville</span> is available from <span class="per">Gary L. Denton</span>, Attorney at Law, 14453 <span class="loc">Riverside Drive</span>, <span class="loc">Ashland</span>, VA 23005. While most of the land in the area is still farmland, some of the land has been developed into subdivisions. One example of this is <span class="loc">Carrington</span> Glen, a rural conservation development (meaning 70% of the land remains undeveloped and undisturbed by development) of new homes on an old farm tract. Other large neighborhoods in the area include <span class="loc">Shop Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Willoughby</span>.</p><br><br>
