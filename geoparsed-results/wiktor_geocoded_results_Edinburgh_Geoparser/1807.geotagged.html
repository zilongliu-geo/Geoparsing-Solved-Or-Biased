<p><span class="loc">Nuri</span> is a place in modern <span class="loc">Sudan</span> on the south (east) side of the <span class="loc">Nile</span>. Close to it, there are pyramids belonging to Nubian kings. <span class="loc">Nuri</span> is situated about 15 km north of <span class="loc">Sanam</span>, and 10 km from <span class="loc">Jebel</span> <span class="loc">Barkal</span>. All these remains belonged to the ancient city <span class="loc">Napata</span>, the first capital of the Nubian kingdom of <span class="loc">Kush</span>. The earliest pyramid (Nu. 1) at <span class="loc">Nuri</span> belongs to king Taharqa which measures 51.75 metres square by 40 or by 50 metres high. His successor Tantamani was buried in el-Kurru, but all following Nubian kings and many of their wives till Nastasen (Nu. 15) (about 330 BC) were buried here. The pyramids at <span class="loc">Nuri</span> are in general smaller than the Egyptian ones and are today often heavily destroyed, but they often still contained substantial parts of the funerary equipment of the Kushite rulers who were buried here. During the Christian era, a church was erected here. The church was built of many old stones, including several stelae originally coming from the pyramids. The pyramids were systematically excavated by George Reisner.</p>
