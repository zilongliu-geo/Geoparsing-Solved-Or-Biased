<p>According to the Azerbaijani historians, the name of the town goes back to the ethnonym of the <span class="loc">Sakas</span>, who reached the territory of modern-day <span class="loc">Azerbaijan</span> in the 7th century BC and populated it for several centuries. In the medieval sources, the name of the town is found in various forms such as <span class="loc">Sheke</span>, <span class="loc">Sheki</span>, <span class="loc">Shaka</span>, Shakki, Shakne, Shaken, Shakkan, Shekin. There are traces of large-scale settlements in <span class="loc">Shaki</span> dating back to more than 2700 years ago. The <span class="loc">Sakas</span> were an Iranian people that wandered from the north side of the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> through Derbend passage and to the South Caucasus and from there to Asia Minor in the 7th century B.C. They occupied a good deal of the fertile lands in South Caucasus in an area called Sakasena. The <span class="loc">city of Shaki</span> was one of the areas occupied by the <span class="loc">Sakas</span>. The original settlement dates back to the late Bronze Age. <span class="loc">Sheki</span> was one of the biggest cities of the Albanian states in the 1st century. The main temple of the ancient Albanians was located there. The kingdom of <span class="loc">Shaki</span> was divided into 11 administrative provinces. <span class="loc">Shaki</span> was one of the important political and economic cities before the Arab invasion. But as a result of the invasion, <span class="loc">Shaki</span> was annexed to the third emirate. An independent <span class="loc">Georgia</span> principality, Hereti, was established in times when the Arab caliphate was weak. The city was also ruled by the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, the Atabegs of <span class="loc">Azerbaijan</span> and the Khwarazmian Empire, before the Mongol invasion.</p>
