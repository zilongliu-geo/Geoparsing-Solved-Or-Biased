<p>Nelson is an unincorporated community in northwestern <span class="loc">Choctaw County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. It is six miles <span class="loc">north of Soper</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. Spencer Academy, a Choctaw Nation school, was moved here from <span class="loc">Spencerville</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>. A United States Post Office was established at Nelson, Indian Territory on March 10, 1881 and operated until November 30, 1954. Until September 15, 1881, the official name of this post office was Nelsons. Nelson is named for Cole E. Nelson, prominent Choctaw Indian and National Attorney of the Choctaw Nation. Until the advent of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>'s statehood Nelson was located in <span class="loc">Kiamitia County</span> (<span class="loc">Kiamichi County</span>), Choctaw Nation. Nelson’s livelihood as a commercial and population center was threatened after the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway built its tracks east of Nelson, passing instead through the communities of Antlers, <span class="loc">Hamden</span>, <span class="loc">Speer</span> and Hugo. Although it retained a lively community for decades following the railroad’s construction in the 1880s, the towns along the railroad sapped it of potential commercial success. Nelson continues to be home to several families, and as such remains the area’s oldest settlement.</p>
