<p><span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is a town in the far northwestern portion of <span class="loc">Grant Parish</span>. The parish itself is located in north central <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> was 787 at the 2000 census but dropped by 6 percent to 730 in 2010. The town has a poverty rate of 37 percent and a median household income of just under $22,000. The median age is just under forty; the population in 2010 was 78 percent white. <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Alexandria Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area though it is forty miles north of Alexandria. Founded in 1712, even before <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>, <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> is situated on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 71 close to the boundary with Natchitoches and Winn parishes. It is located on the eastern bank of the <span class="loc">Red River</span>. In the 1950s, <span class="loc">Montgomery</span> was known as one of the smaller communities in the state which could draw considerable crowds to political gatherings. William J. "Bill" <span class="loc">Dodd</span>, veteran <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> politician, in his memoirs Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> Politics, recalls a 1955 gathering in which he "eulogized" Huey Long, Earl Long, and attorney general candidate Jack P.F. Gremillion. Dodd satirized Gremillion's World War II record: "Why he almost got killed himself when an enemy shell plowed into one of his most vital organs; if you don't believe Jack Gremillion earned his Purple Heart, he will show you the scars he has to prove it." The scars were on Gremillion's rear end, much to the embarrassment of the successful candidate. From <span class="loc">Montgomery</span>, the Long train headed to the parish seat of <span class="loc">Colfax</span>.</p>
