  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Waterford</span> is an unincorporated village in the <span class="loc">Catoctin</span> Valley of <span class="loc">Loudoun County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, located along <span class="loc">Catoctin</span> Creek. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> is 47 miles (76 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span>, and 7 miles (11 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Leesburg</span>. The entire village and surrounding countryside is a National Historic Landmark district. In the <span class="date">1810</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the population center of the <span class="loc">United States</span> was recorded as being just northwest of the village. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> was established around <span class="date">1733</span> by Amos Janney, a <span class="loc">Quaker</span> from <span class="loc">Bucks County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. <span class="loc">Janney</span> purchased 400 acres (1.6 km2) on the south fork of <span class="loc">Catoctin</span> Creek and established a grist mill and saw mill in the area in the 1740s. Due to the success of the mills, the settlement became known as "Janney's Mill". The town grew quickly as a center of commerce for growers of grain. Amos Janney died in <span class="date">1747</span>, leaving his estate to his sixteen-year-old son, <span class="per">Mahlon</span>. <span class="per">Mahlon</span> replaced the original log mill with a two-story structure. The village continued to grow, and in <span class="date">1780</span>, 12 acres (49,000 m2) on the south side of Main Street were subdivided into 15 lots, upon which shops and homes were built. By the 1790s, the village was known as <span class="loc">Waterford</span>, named after the <span class="loc">city of Waterford</span>, in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>, where some of its founders had once lived before immigrating to the <span class="loc">United States</span>. New residents continued to come from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, as Quakers were followed by Presbyterians, Lutherans, Baptists, and Methodists. <span class="loc">Waterford</span> was also populated by African-Americans, both free and enslaved.</p><br><br>
