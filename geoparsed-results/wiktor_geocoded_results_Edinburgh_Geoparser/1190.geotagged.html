<p>Milan /ˈmaɪlən/ is a town in Franklin and Washington townships, <span class="loc">Ripley County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,899 at the 2010 census. Milan High School won the <span class="loc">Indiana</span> state basketball championship against Muncie Central High School in 1954, the victory being significant as <span class="loc">Milan</span> was the smallest town to win a state championship in the <span class="loc">United States</span> at that time. The 1986 film Hoosiers is based on the story of the 1954 Milan Team.

The town, like its predecessor <span class="loc">Old Milan</span>, was named after <span class="loc">Milan</span>, in <span class="loc">Italy</span>. <span class="loc">Milan</span> is located at 39°7′22″N 85°7′50″W (39.122730, -85.130653).
