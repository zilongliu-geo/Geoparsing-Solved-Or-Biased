<p><span class="loc">Fremont</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Dodge County</span> in the eastern portion of the state of <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> in the Midwestern <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 26,397 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Fremont</span> is the county seat. From the 1830s to the 1860s, the area saw a great deal of traffic due to the <span class="loc">Mormon</span> Trail, which passed along the north bank of the <span class="loc">Platte River</span>. A ferry connected the two banks of the <span class="loc">Elkhorn River</span> near <span class="loc">Fremont</span>. It was a major overland route for emigrant settlers going to the West, the military and hunters. <span class="loc">Fremont</span> was laid out in 1856 in anticipation that the railroad would be extended to that site. It was named after the American explorer, politician and military official General John C. Fr√©mont. Due to the town's geographically central location, the First Transcontinental Telegraph line (1861), railroad (1866) and highway (1913) passed through or very near <span class="loc">Fremont</span>. Original brick portions of the "Old Lincoln Highway" located east of <span class="loc">Fremont</span>, on the way to <span class="loc">Omaha</span>. On January 10, 1976, in downtown <span class="loc">Fremont</span>, the Pathfinder Hotel exploded due to a natural gas leak in the basement. At the time the hotel was being used as apartments, mostly occupied by senior citizens. It also was a meeting place for philanthropic and business organizations, and had a drug store on the northwest corner. The explosion shattered windows around the city, and the ensuing fire killed 23 people and destroyed most of the city block of the hotel.</p>
