  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Santa Clara Valley Water District calls for mandatory rationing. Silicon Valley's largest water supplier voted unanimously <span class="date">today</span> to call for mandatory rationing, asking residents and businesses to cut back 15 percent <span class="date">this summer</span>. Santa Clara Valley Water District directors voted 7-0 for the rationing measure after more than two hours of discussion. The move comes after three consecutive dry <span class="date">years</span>. Directors indicated they will spend $2 million on an outreach campaign encouraging people to conserve. The district — which provides drinking water for 1.8 million people in Santa <span class="loc">Clara County</span> from <span class="loc">Los Altos</span> to <span class="loc">Gilroy</span> — has no enforcement powers because it is a wholesale provider of water. But the board can ask the district's 13 retail suppliers, such as the <span class="loc">San Jose</span> Water Company and the <span class="loc">cities of Sunnyvale and Morgan Hill</span>, to set up new pricing rules that charge customers a premium if they use more than a set amount of water. The district will also ask every city in Santa <span class="loc">Clara County</span> to approve an ordinance that would ban lawn watering during daytime hours, require nozzles on garden hoses and limit watering to odd-even <span class="date">days</span>, with fines for violators. In <span class="date">late May</span>, the city of <span class="loc">San Jose</span> will vote on its ordinance, which would take effect in <span class="date">June</span>. City officials said <span class="date">today</span> they were unsure if that would include fines. reduced pumping for the portion of the delta it controls to 20 percent of contracted amounts, and federal officials, who control another portion, have reduced it to 50 percent. Despite <span class="date">February</span> rains, large reservoirs that feed the delta are only half full from two dry <span class="date">years</span>.</p><br><br>
