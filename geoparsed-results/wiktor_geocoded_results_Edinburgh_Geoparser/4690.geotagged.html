<p><span class="loc">Alberton</span> is a small town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is located along the <span class="loc">South Gippsland Highway</span>, 6 kilometres south of <span class="loc">Yarram</span> and 216 kilometres east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>. <span class="loc">Albert River</span> passes through the town. At the 2006 census, <span class="loc">Alberton</span> had a population of 162. The township was surveyed in 1842 and named after Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria. Initially the township consisted of two settlements, one named <span class="loc">Alberton</span> and the other named Victoria, which were separated by Victoria Street (renamed Brewery Road in 1847). Alberton Post Office opened on 10 January 1856. An earlier Alberton office opened in 1842 was renamed <span class="loc">Port Albert</span> some days earlier. The town's population grew steadily. Stores, hotels, and churches were built, as well as the Police Magistrate and Court of Petty Sessions. By the 1880s the town's growth stagnated. The announcement of new railway line increased growth, with new houses and factories being built. Shire Offices were planned for the town, but in 1897 the location was changed to nearby <span class="loc">Yarram</span>. This led to many businesses moving to <span class="loc">Yarram</span>, and by 1921 the railway had been extended there.</p>
