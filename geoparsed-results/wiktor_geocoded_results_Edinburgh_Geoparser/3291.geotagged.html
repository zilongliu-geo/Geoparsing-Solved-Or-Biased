<p><span class="loc">El Rio</span> is a small unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Ventura County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, on the northeast side of the 101 Freeway and Oxnard, and south of the Santa <span class="loc">Clara River</span>. The town was founded in 1875 and named <span class="loc">New Jerusalem</span>, <span class="loc">California</span> by the owner of general store who became the first postmaster in 1882. In 1885, a school and Santa Clara Catholic Church were built. Located near where the coastal railroad line crosses the Santa <span class="loc">Clara River</span>, the town's name was changed to <span class="loc">El Rio</span> around 1900. The former wagon river crossing route became the Ventura Freeway which separates the community from the commercial developments that grew up on the southwest side of the freeway. That portion of the historic community and sections closer to the river have been annexed to the <span class="loc">city of Oxnard</span>. Vineyard Avenue (State Route 232) is the central business district for the largely residential community. The population was 7,198 at the 2010 census, up from 6,193 at the time the 2000 census was enumerated. For statistical purposes, the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau has defined an <span class="loc">El Rio</span> census-designated place (CDP) which does not precisely correspond to the historical community as portions have been annexed to the <span class="loc">city of Oxnard</span>.</p>
