<p><span class="loc">La Porte</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Harris County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, within the Bay Area of the Houston–Sugar <span class="loc">Land–Baytown metropolitan</span> area. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 33,800. <span class="loc">La Porte</span> is the fourth-largest incorporated city in <span class="loc">Harris County</span>. When <span class="loc">La Porte</span> celebrated its centennial in 1992, it was the home of Barbours Cut Terminal, operated by the Port of Houston Authority since 1977. Fifteen years later, the Port of Houston's newest addition, Bayport Terminal, was established just south of <span class="loc">La Porte</span>. The area around <span class="loc">La Porte</span> has served an increasingly important role in international trade since the 1970s. The area around modern <span class="loc">La Porte</span> gained fame early in <span class="loc">Texas</span> history as the location of the Battle of <span class="loc">San Jacinto</span> on April 21, 1836, which ended the <span class="loc">Texas</span> Revolution, establishing the independence of the Republic of <span class="loc">Texas</span> from <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The <span class="loc">San Jacinto Monument</span>, in the unincorporated area of <span class="loc">La Porte</span>, commemorates the battle. During the early 20th century, particularly the 1920s and 1930s, <span class="loc">La Porte</span>'s Sylvan Beach became a nationally known tourist destination attracting some of the nation's most well-known entertainers. As a result of changing economics in the Houston area and beach erosion, the tourist business declined while industrial development in the area grew. During World War II and afterward, <span class="loc">La Porte</span>'s economy rapidly shifted toward petroleum/petrochemicals and shipping, which developed as the dominant industries in the Pasadena-Baytown area.</p>
