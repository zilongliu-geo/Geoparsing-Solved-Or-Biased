<p>The <span class="loc">Eastern Province</span> (Tamil: கிழக்கு மாகாணம் Kil̮akku Mākāṇam; Sinhalese: නැගෙනහිර පළාත Næ̆gĕnahira Paḷāta) is one of the nine provinces of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span>, the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of <span class="loc">Sri Lanka</span> established provincial councils. Between 1988 and 2006 the province was temporarily merged with the <span class="loc">Northern Province</span> to form the <span class="loc">North Eastern Province</span>. The capital of the province is <span class="loc">Trincomalee</span>. In 1815 the British gained control of the entire island of <span class="loc">Ceylon</span>. They divided the island into three ethnic based administrative structures: Low Country Sinhalese, Kandyan Sinhalese and Tamil. The <span class="loc">Eastern Province</span> was part of the Tamil administration. In 1833, in accordance with the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, the ethnic based administrative structures were unified into a single administration divided into five geographic provinces. The <span class="loc">districts of Batticaloa</span>, Bintenna (part of present day <span class="loc">Badulla District</span>), Tamankaduva (present day <span class="loc">Polonnaruwa District</span>) and <span class="loc">Trincomalee</span> formed the new <span class="loc">Eastern Province</span>. Tamankaduva was transferred to the newly created <span class="loc">North Central Province</span> in 1873 and Bintenna was transferred to the newly created <span class="loc">Uva Province</span> in 1886.</p>
