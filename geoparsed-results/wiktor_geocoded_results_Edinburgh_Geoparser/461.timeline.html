  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is an inner-city suburb of <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is located 4 kilometres south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district and is part of the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Sydney</span>. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> took its name from the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> in <span class="date">1815</span>, when Allied and Prussian forces under the <span class="per">Duke of Wellington</span> and <span class="per">Bl√ºcher</span> defeated the French forces under Napoleon Bonaparte. In the 1820s <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> began supporting industrial operations including the <span class="per">Fisher</span> and <span class="per">Duncan</span> <span class="loc">Paper Mill</span> and the Waterloo Flour Mills owned by <span class="per">William Hutchinson</span> and <span class="per">Daniel Cooper</span>. <span class="per">William Hutchinson</span>, superindendent of convicts and public works, had been granted 1,400 acres (5.7 km2) of land in <span class="date">1823</span>. He sold <span class="loc">Waterloo Farm</span> to <span class="per">Daniel Cooper</span> (<span class="date">1785</span>-<span class="date">1853</span>) and <span class="per">Solomon Levey</span> (<span class="date">1794</span>-<span class="date">1833</span>). <span class="per">Cooper</span> later bought out <span class="per">Levey</span>'s share and on his death the Waterloo Estate passed onto his son, also named <span class="per">Daniel Cooper</span>, who was the first speaker of the New South <span class="org">Wales Legislative Assembly</span>. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is historically a working class region. Since early 2000s, the region has undergone some degree of gentrification with a rising business district focusing on technology-oriented firms and the development of more green space such as parks. By <span class="date">2006</span>, median individual income in <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> was slightly higher than <span class="org">the Australian</span> average. The suburb maintains numerous public housing apartments.</p><br><br>
