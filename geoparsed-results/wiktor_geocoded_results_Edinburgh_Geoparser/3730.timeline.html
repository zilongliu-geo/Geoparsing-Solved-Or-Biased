  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Nora</span> is an ancient Roman and pre-Roman town placed on a peninsula near <span class="loc">Pula</span>, near to <span class="loc">Cagliari</span> in <span class="loc">Sardinia</span>. According to legend, <span class="per">Nora</span> was founded by a group of Iberians from Tartessus led by Norax, a mythological hero (the son of <span class="per">Eriteide</span> and the god <span class="loc">Hermes</span>). It is believed to be the first town founded in <span class="loc">Sardinia</span> and to have been settled by the ancient Sherden or the Nuraghi people, and later colonized by Phoenicians. The <span class="per">Nora Stone</span>, a Phoenician inscription found at <span class="per">Nora</span> in <span class="date">1773</span>, has been dated by palaeographic methods to between the late 9th century and early 8th century BCE, and has been interpreted as referring to a Phoenician military victory and conquest of the area. After a period of domination by <span class="loc">Carthage</span> the town came under Roman control after the conquest of <span class="loc">Sardinia</span> in <span class="date">238 BC</span>. It went into decline from the <span class="date">4th century AD</span> and appears to have been abandoned during the 8th century. <span class="per">Nora</span> was an important trading town in its time, with two protected harbours, one on each side of the peninsula. Several different building styles can be seen in the excavated buildings.</p><br><br>
