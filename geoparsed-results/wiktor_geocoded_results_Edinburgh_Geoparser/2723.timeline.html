  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Gibraltar /dʒᵻˈbrɔːltər/ is a British Overseas Territory located on the southern end of the <span class="loc">Iberian Peninsula</span> at the entrance of the Mediterranean. It has an area of 6.7 km2 (2.6 sq mi) and shares its northern border with the <span class="loc">Province of Cádiz</span> in <span class="loc">Andalusia</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>. The <span class="loc">Rock of Gibraltar</span> is the major landmark of the region. At its foot is a densely populated city area, home to over 30,000 Gibraltarians and other nationalities. An Anglo-Dutch force captured <span class="loc">Gibraltar</span> from <span class="loc">Spain</span> in <span class="date">1704</span> during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of the Habsburg pretender to the Spanish throne. The territory was subsequently ceded to <span class="loc">Britain</span> "in perpetuity" under the Treaty of <span class="loc">Utrecht</span> in <span class="date">1713</span>. During World War II it was an important base for the Royal Navy as it controlled the entrance and exit to the <span class="loc">Mediterranean Sea</span>, which is only eight miles (13 km) wide at this point. <span class="date">Today</span> Gibraltar's economy is based largely on tourism, online gambling, financial services, and shipping. The sovereignty of <span class="loc">Gibraltar</span> is a major point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations as <span class="loc">Spain</span> asserts a claim to the territory. Gibraltarians overwhelmingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a <span class="date">1967</span> referendum and again in <span class="date">2002</span>. Under the Gibraltar constitution of <span class="date">2006</span>, <span class="loc">Gibraltar</span> governs its own affairs, though some powers, such as defence and foreign relations, remain the responsibility of the Government of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>.</p><br><br>
