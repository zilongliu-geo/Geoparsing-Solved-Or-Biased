  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wawa</span> is an unincorporated community located in <span class="loc">Delaware County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> in Greater <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>, partially in Middletown Township and partially in Chester Heights Borough. In the 1700s people from <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> settled <span class="loc">Wawa</span> due to the community's abundance of water. Various mills, including gristmills and paper mills, opened on area creeks. <span class="loc">Wawa</span> was originally known as <span class="per">Pennellton</span> and <span class="per">Grubb</span>'s Bridge. When Edward Worth built an estate here, he named it "Wawa", the Ojibwe word for "wild goose", because of the flocks of geese attracted to the still water behind Lenni milldam. The name had been transferred to the town by <span class="date">1884</span>. Forge Hill was added to <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> on <span class="date">March 7, 1973</span>. <span class="per">Cynthia Mayer</span> of the <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span> Inquirer said in <span class="date">1989</span> that there was "the indignity of being from a town <span class="date">now</span> associated with a convenience store. Unlike, say, <span class="loc">Hershey</span>, <span class="loc">Pa</span>. - or Wawa's cherished dairying past - outsiders <span class="date">now</span> tend to associate <span class="loc">Wawa</span> with Chee-tos, emergency toilet paper errands and Super Squeezers." <span class="date">Eight weeks</span> before <span class="date">June 15, 1989</span>, <span class="org">Wawa Inc.</span> announced that it planned to expand its Wawa dairy, which is located in Middletown Township. <span class="per">Walter Kirby</span>, head of the Wawa Farms Association, alerted residents of the Wawa community, and they appeared in large numbers at a meeting. <span class="per">Kirby</span> said that residents did not want the dairy to expand, but they preferred having a dairy to other types of development.</p><br><br>
