<p><span class="loc">Union County</span> is the northeasternmost county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 4,549, making it the fourth-least populous county in <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Clayton. The county was formed in 1894. <span class="loc">Union County</span> borders <span class="loc">Colorado</span> to the north, and <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> and <span class="loc">Texas</span> to the east. <span class="loc">Union County</span>, was created by an act of the territorial legislation in 1893 and was officially recognized on January 1, 1894, when the first slate of elected county officials received their oaths of office. The county is named “Union” because the citizens were united in their desire for the creation of a new county out of three existing <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> counties. <span class="loc">Union County</span> was subsequently “carved up” by the creation of additional counties, Quay in 1903 and <span class="loc">Harding</span> in 1920. At one time, <span class="loc">Union County</span> had a population of over 20,000. There were a number of bustling communities such as Amistad, Hayden, Sedan, <span class="loc">Pasamonte</span>, <span class="loc">Gladstone</span>, Mt Dora, <span class="loc">Grenville</span>, <span class="loc">Des Moines</span>, <span class="loc">Folsom</span> and <span class="loc">Dedman</span> (now known as <span class="loc">Capulin</span>).</p>
