  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Tia, (pronounced ‘tie ah’) is a settlement and parish located approximately 30 kilometres east of <span class="loc">Walcha</span>, on the <span class="loc">Northern Tablelands region</span> of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Tia River Station was first settled by <span class="per">Richard</span> and <span class="per">William</span> <span class="loc">Denne</span> in <span class="date">1840</span>, then comprising an area of 100 square miles (260 km2). It was later purchased by <span class="per">Augustus Hooke</span> in <span class="date">1882</span>. It was on this station that <span class="loc">Blue Spec</span>, a brown stallion foaled in <span class="date">1899</span>, was bred and who later won the <span class="loc">Kalgoorlie Cup</span>, <span class="loc">Perth Cup</span> and the <span class="date">1905</span> <span class="date">Melbourne Cup</span> in record time. The first gold mining activity was recorded at Tia in <span class="date">1866</span>. In <span class="date">1873</span> a reef was discovered at McLeod’s Creek, when a rush occurred. In <span class="date">1877</span> two Scotsmen, <span class="per">Matheson</span> and <span class="per">Mclntyre</span> spent considerable effort tunnelling and digging shafts. In <span class="date">1879</span> they erected a machine for crushing rock and constructed a race half a mile long to bring water to work the machine. After yields slightly over an ounce to the ton they sold out in <span class="date">1887</span> to the <span class="org">Tia Gold Mining Company</span>, which deepened shafts, and spent money on their operations, but with poor results. Large scale mining petered out, although fossicking continued for some <span class="date">years</span> to come.</p><br><br>
