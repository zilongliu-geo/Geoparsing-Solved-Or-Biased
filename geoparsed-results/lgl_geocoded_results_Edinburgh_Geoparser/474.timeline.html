  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Cold winters may be new trend. After enduring the coldest <span class="date">winter</span> in <span class="date">16 years</span> and <span class="date">now</span> persistent below-normal temperatures that are chilling what should be spring, Richmondites can be excused for asking what gives. Meteorologists suspect coastal B.C. is <span class="date">now</span> being nipped by a trend of colder than normal <span class="date">winter</span> temperatures that could last <span class="date">a decade</span>. Or two. Or three. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation is a phenomenon of alternating phases in which offshore ocean temperatures tend to run warmer and then colder—for 20 to <span class="date">30 years</span> at a stretch. “There’s some debate as to whether we’ve slipped into a cold phase or not,” said Environment <span class="loc">Canada</span> meteorologist <span class="per">Gabor Fricska</span>. “It may be too early to say definitively.” A warm Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase was measured from <span class="date">1920</span>-<span class="date">1945</span> followed by a cold phase that lasted until <span class="date">1975</span>, bringing the Lower Mainland many severe winters. Since then it’s been a mixed bag: three cold <span class="date">years</span> until <span class="date">2002</span>, then four more warmer <span class="date">years</span>. But <span class="per">Fricska</span> says some meteorologists think the recent spate of cold weather may be the onset of a new cold phase. “It is cold right <span class="date">now</span>,” he said. “The sea surface temperatures immediately off of our coast are one to two degrees below normal.” Three out of <span class="date">the last four seasons</span> (except <span class="date">last fall</span>) have been colder than seasonal, he added. When a cold Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase is prevalent, <span class="date">winter</span> low pressure systems in the <span class="loc">Gulf of Alaska</span> are often weaker than usual, allowing more cold air to come down to the coast from northern B.C. For anyone wanting proof of the hardship endured in the <span class="date">winter</span> of 2008-09, <span class="per">Fricska</span> offers these Metro Vancouver stats for December-January-February, from the airport weather station: It was the coldest <span class="date">winter</span> since 1992-93 and the 10th coldest since record keeping began in <span class="date">1937</span>. Mean temperatures for <span class="date">the three months</span> averaged 2.4 C, down from a normal of 3.6 degrees. Snowfall was more than two and a half times normal—109 cms versus 42.5—while rainfall was 35 per cent below normal. “People aren’t imagining things if they think it’s colder,” <span class="per">Fricska</span> said. How could this be happening in an era of global warming? <span class="per">Fricska</span> said Pacific Decadal Oscillations and shorter duration weather variations like <span class="loc">El Nino</span> are regional shifts that don’t reflect what’s happening at the planetary level. He noted B.C. experienced many of its coldest winters in recent memory during the cold oscillation cycle from <span class="date">1945</span> to <span class="date">1975</span>—even though global air temperatures climbed steadily during that period. Yet more snow fell <span class="date">this week</span> at some higher elevations around the Lower Mainland. “Our seasonal forecast for the spring is for continuing below normal temperatures on the coast,” <span class="per">Fricska</span> said.</p><br><br>
