<p>For the village in <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, see Aurora, <span class="loc">Cayuga County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> Aurora is a town in <span class="loc">Erie County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,782 at the 2010 census. It is one of the "Southtowns" of <span class="loc">Erie County</span> and is also erroneously called "<span class="loc">East Aurora</span>", the name of its principal village. The town is centrally located in the county, southeast of Buffalo. <span class="loc">Christ the King Seminary</span> is located in the north part of the town. The town was created in 1818 from the (now defunct) town of Willink, which once contained all the southern part of <span class="loc">Erie County</span>. By a close vote, citizens voted to change the name to "Aurora" in a display of their growing dissatisfaction with the Holland Land Company and its stockholders, which included Willem Willink. Horace Boies, Governor of <span class="loc">Iowa</span> Millard Fillmore, <span class="loc">US</span> President, practiced law in Aurora and lived in a house on Main Street (now a National Historic Landmark on Shearer Avenue) before he became president. Millard Powers Fillmore, son of President Fillmore</p>
