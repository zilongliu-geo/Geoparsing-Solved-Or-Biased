  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> (/ˈpɔərtsməθ/) is the second largest city in the ceremonial <span class="loc">county of Hampshire</span> on the south coast of <span class="loc">England</span>. Located mainly on <span class="loc">Portsea Island</span>, it is the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>'s only island city. <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> is situated 64 miles (103 km) south west of <span class="loc">London</span> and 19 miles (31 km) south east of <span class="loc">Southampton</span>. The city has a population of 205,400 and is the only city in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> with a greater population density than <span class="loc">London</span>. The <span class="loc">City of Portsmouth and Portsmouth Football Club</span> are both nicknamed "Pompey". As a significant naval port for <span class="date">centuries</span>, <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> has the world's oldest continuously used dry dock and is home to some noted ships, including HMS Warrior, the Tudor carrack <span class="per">Mary Rose</span> and <span class="per">Lord Nelson</span>'s flagship, HMS Victory (the world's oldest naval ship still in commission). By the 19th century, <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> was one of the most fortified cities in the world. During the Second World War, the city served as a pivotal embarkation point for the D-Day landings and was also chosen as the headquarters for the Supreme Allied Commander, <span class="per">Dwight D. Eisenhower</span>. The city was bombed extensively during what was known as the Portsmouth Blitz, which resulted in the deaths of 930 people. Although smaller than in its heyday, the naval base at HMNB <span class="loc">Portsmouth</span> remains the largest dockyard for the Royal Navy and is home to two-thirds of the entire surface fleet.</p><br><br>
