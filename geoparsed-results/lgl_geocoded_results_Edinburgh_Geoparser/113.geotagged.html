<p>Police say man pulled a gun on another man at motel. Police say they found drugs on a Charleston man who had been accused of pulling a gun on another man. Charleston police were called Tuesday to a report of a disturbance at the Knights Inn motel on <span class="loc">MacCorkle Avenue</span> in <span class="loc">Kanawha City</span>. A man there, identified as Rick Smith, told police he'd been trying to break up a fight between Jason Terrell Jones, 23, of Central Avenue and Jones' girlfriend, who was not identified, according to a complaint filed in Kanawha Magistrate Court. Witnesses told police Jones got upset, went into the motel room where he was staying, retrieved a gun and put it to Smith's head, the complaint said. Jones fled on foot when officers arrived but was picked up a short distance away, according to the complaint. Police wrote in the complaint that they found a gun in a creek bed along the route Jones took to evade arrest. While searching Jones at police headquarters, officers retrieved two baggies of white rocks, believed to be crack cocaine, from Jones' underwear, the complaint said. The substance in the bags, which totaled about 8.6 grams, later tested positive as cocaine, according to the complaint. Police discovered that Jones had been convicted in 2004 of selling controlled substances in <span class="loc">Bronx County</span>, <span class="loc">N.Y</span>, which makes him ineligible to possess a gun, the complaint said. Jones was charged with brandishing, possessing a firearm when prohibited by law and possession of crack cocaine with intent to deliver.</p>
