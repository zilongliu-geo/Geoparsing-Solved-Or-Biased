  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Arlington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, six miles (10 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Boston</span>. The population was 42,844 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The Town of <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was settled by European colonists in <span class="date">1635</span> as a village within the boundaries of <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> under the name <span class="loc">Menotomy</span>, an Algonquian word meaning "swift running water". A larger area, including land that was later to become the town of <span class="loc">Belmont</span>, and outwards to the shore of the <span class="loc">Mystic River</span>, which had previously been part of <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>, was incorporated on <span class="date">February 27, 1807</span> as <span class="loc">West Cambridge</span>. In <span class="date">1867</span>, the name "Arlington" was chosen in honor of those buried in <span class="org">Arlington National Cemetery</span>; the name change took effect that <span class="date">April 30</span>. The Massachusett tribe, part of the Algonquian group of Native Americans, lived around the <span class="loc">Mystic Lakes</span>, the <span class="loc">Mystic River</span> and <span class="loc">Alewife Brook</span>. By the time Europeans arrived, the local Indians had been devastated by disease; also, the tribal chief, <span class="per">Nanepashemet</span>, had been killed by a rival tribe in about <span class="date">1619</span>. <span class="per">Nanepashemet</span>'s widow, known to history only as "Squaw Sachem", sold the land of her tribe to the colonists for ten pounds, with provisions that she and her tribe could remain on her homestead land around the <span class="loc">Mystic Lakes</span> and continue hunting and farming. She also was to be given a new <span class="date">winter</span> coat of wool each year for the rest of her life. She is thought to have lived until about <span class="date">1650</span>.</p><br><br>
