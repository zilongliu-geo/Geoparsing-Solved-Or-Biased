  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Augusta native had a 'distinguished career'. <span class="per">Joyce Shelby</span>, an award-winning New York Daily News reporter who began her professional career in her hometown at the Augusta Herald, died <span class="date">March 19</span>. She was 62. <span class="per">Keith Claussen</span>, a longtime friend and a onetime co-worker at the former Augusta afternoon newspaper, called her "one of the brightest, funniest, most down-to-earth people I've ever had the privilege of knowing." "<span class="per">Joyce</span> had a distinguished career in journalism. She taught journalism at <span class="org">Columbia University</span>, but she told me her first love was being a reporter -- getting the story and making a difference in people's lives," <span class="per">Ms. Claussen</span> said. She said <span class="per">Ms. Shelby</span>, the first black reporter hired by <span class="org">the Herald</span> in <span class="date">the late 1960s</span>, was always popular. "She had a wonderful, easy-going personality, and she could make connections with people," <span class="per">Ms. Claussen</span> said. "That's what earned her the respect of her colleagues, her friends and the people she wrote about." <span class="per">Ms. Shelby</span>'s career accomplishments were considerable, friends said. She was the editor of <span class="org">Georgetown University</span>'s alumni magazine from 1974-75, adjunct professor at <span class="org">Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism</span> from 1975-81 and an assistant professor there from 1981-87. She was a reporter for the New York Daily News from <span class="date">1987</span> until her death, according to the newspaper. Mallory <span class="per">Millender</span>, a longtime Augusta educator, met <span class="per">Ms. Shelby</span> at <span class="org">Columbia University</span>. "She was extremely competent in her field and respected by the students and the professors," <span class="per">Dr. Millender</span> said. "She was also well-liked and a fun person. She liked to joke. "At the same time, she was a very real person. Even if you didn't know her, the first time you met her she treated you as if she'd known you all her life." <span class="per">Ms. Shelby</span> is survived by her mother, <span class="per">Prudence Young</span>, formerly of <span class="loc">Augusta</span>; and her children, <span class="per">Gail Shelby</span> and <span class="per">Clayborn</span> <span class="per">Shelby III</span>, both of New <span class="loc">York City</span>.</p><br><br>
