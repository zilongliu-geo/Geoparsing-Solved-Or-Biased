  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Columbia</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, which was formed <span class="date">six years</span> before <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> was admitted to statehood. <span class="org">Columbia</span> was named for <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, from which many of the early settlers had migrated. The population was 6,603 as of the <span class="date">2000</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Marion County</span>. The site was first settled by <span class="per">John</span> and <span class="per">William</span> <span class="loc">Lott</span> in the early 19th century, giving the town its original name, Lott's Bluff. It was incorporated as <span class="loc">Columbia</span> on <span class="date">June 25, 1819</span>, becoming the fourth municipality in the state of <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>. It served as the temporary capital of <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> from <span class="date">November, 1821</span>, when the 5th session of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Legislature first met there, until <span class="date">1822</span>. In <span class="date">that year</span>, a special session of the legislature met in <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, inaugurating Governor <span class="per">Walter Leake</span>, and selecting LeFleur's Bluff (<span class="date">now</span> Jackson) as the permanent capital.[1] Former <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> governor and <span class="org">Columbia</span> native Hugh L. White introduced white squirrels to the area, and they are still common in <span class="loc">Columbia City</span> Park.[2] On <span class="date">December 23rd, 2014</span>, an EF3 tornado ripped through areas around <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, killing four people and causing widespread damage.</p><br><br>
