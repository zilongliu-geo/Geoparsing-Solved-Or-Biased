  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Spring is a census-designated place (CDP) within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Houston in <span class="loc">Harris County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, part of the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area. The population was 54,298 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. While the name "Spring" is applied to a large area of northern <span class="loc">Harris County</span> and a smaller area of southern <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, the original town of Spring, <span class="date">now</span> known as Old Town Spring, is located at the intersection of Spring-Cypress and Hardy roads and encompasses a relatively small area of perhaps 1 km2. The large geographic area <span class="date">now</span> known as Spring was originally inhabited by the Orcoquiza Native Americans. In <span class="date">1836</span>, the <span class="org">Texas General Council</span> of the Provisional Government placed what is <span class="date">now</span> the town of Spring in the Harrisburg municipality. In <span class="date">1838</span>, <span class="per">William Pierpont</span> placed a trading post on <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span>. In <span class="date">1840</span>, the town of Spring had 153 residents. By the mid-1840s, many German immigrants, including <span class="loc">Gus</span> <span class="per">Bayer</span> and <span class="per">Carl</span> Wunsche, moved to the area and began farming. People from <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> and other parts of the post-Civil War <span class="per">Southern U.S.</span> settled in Spring. The main cash crops in Spring were sugar cane and cotton; area residents also grew vegetables.</p><br><br>
