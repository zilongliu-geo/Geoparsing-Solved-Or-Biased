  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Call her a Recessionista. Tight times are putting the squeeze on <span class="per">Antonella Bruno</span>'s spending, but she won't scrimp on putting her best face forward. Call her a recessionista, <span class="per">Bruno</span>, 54, has cut back on clothing purchases, facials and eating out so she can keep up appearances -- and her <span class="per">Botox</span> injections. "I'm cutting back on treats so I can treat my face," says the attractive master colourist and makeup artist. <span class="per">Bruno</span> figures she's getting a big boost for her buck -- she works in the ultra-competitive and youthful beauty industry, and believes in looking her best in order to attract and keep clients. "It makes me feel good and when I feel good I'm more creative, successful," says <span class="per">Bruno</span>, adding that <span class="per">Botox</span> is an instant pick-me-up, physically and mentally, and its benefits last far longer than any facial or expensive meal out. <span class="per">Bruno</span> isn't the only one refusing to forfeit a facial fix. <span class="per">Dr. David Ellis</span> reports an increase in patients getting non-invasive "touchie-uppies" in <span class="date">the past month</span>. "It gives people an emotional and physical perk -- it's an affordable luxury." Expensive surgical procedures are down, he says, but not demand for treatments like injectable fillers, <span class="per">Botox</span> and laser. "Five patients cancelled surgery in <span class="date">January</span>," says the <span class="loc">Toronto</span> facial plastic surgeon. Most can't afford time off work to recover and are postponing costly invasive surgery -- up to $20,000 plus -- until the economy stabilizes. Cheaper and cheerful non-surgical "liquid facelifts," combining <span class="per">Botox</span> and <span class="per">Juvederm</span> dermal filler, are popular and can offer "instantaneous results, a real wow factor," says <span class="per">Ellis</span>. In a poll by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, 73% of surgeons report an increased or stable demand for <span class="per">Botox</span>, chemical peels and fillers, while 62% report a decrease in surgical procedures. <span class="per">Dr. Wayne Perron</span>, a <span class="loc">Calgary</span> plastic surgeon, reports business is steady on all fronts. In this hyped-up doom and gloom, <span class="per">Botox</span> is "one of the things that we soothe ourselves with." <span class="date">Today</span>, cosmetic procedures are viewed as an investment in staying competitive in a cut-throat job market. Freshening up a resume just isn't enough -- many seek an injection of freshness, a glow and a boost of confidence too. <span class="per">Bruno</span>, owner of Decree in Colour salon, says she got tired of feeling and looking withered and weary, so in <span class="date">2007</span> she opted for an injectable filler to add volume to her cheeks and <span class="per">Botox</span> on her forehead. She plans to do around her eyes on her next quarterly visit to <span class="per">Ellis</span>. She says that her clients look to her for inspiration. "You have to be the power of example," says <span class="per">Bruno</span>, who embraces a healthy and active lifestyle. <span class="per">Dr. Barry Lycka</span> isn't surprised people aren't giving up their <span class="per">Botox</span>. "Once people have it done, it becomes terribly addictive." People value looking good and <span class="per">Botox</span> offers instant results with no downtime -- "you look fresh, like you've been on a vacation for <span class="date">six weeks</span>," says the <span class="loc">Edmonton</span> cosmetic dermatologist, adding business is at 100% capacity. Invasive cosmetic surgery has been on the decline for <span class="date">the past 10 years</span> "as people are looking for quicker, better and easier procedures, and <span class="date">now</span> the economy is forcing that even more," he says. Many women view cosmetic procedures as a way to get a competitive edge in the workplace, reveals a survey by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. 13% would consider having a cosmetic medical procedure specifically to make them more confident and more competitive in the job market. 3% say they've already had a cosmetic procedure to increase their perceived value in the workplace. 73% believe youthful appearance plays a part in getting hired, getting a promotion or getting new clients. 80% think having a cosmetic procedure can boost a person's confidence. <span class="per">Antonella Bruno</span> would prefer to spend money on <span class="per">Botox</span> injections than spend it on other areas of her life.</p><br><br>
