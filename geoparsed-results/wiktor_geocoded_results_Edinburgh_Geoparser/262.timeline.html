  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Marcos</span> is a city in <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>. It is located in a small valley, 5 miles (8 km) southeast of downtown <span class="loc">San Salvador</span>. Its population is 63,209 inhabitants[1]. <span class="loc">San Marcos</span> is one of the 14 municipalities which make up the Metropolitan Area of <span class="loc">San Salvador</span>, also known as Greater <span class="loc">San Salvador</span>. The city's geography is characterized by numerous small hills, as well as its proximity to Mount <span class="loc">San Jacinto</span> to the north and <span class="loc">Planes de Renderos</span> hills to the south. Most of <span class="loc">San Marcos</span> is a residential suburb with many middle-income and low-income dwellings. The city is the main gateway for air travelers because it is bordered by the Comalapa Highway (RN-5_(Autopista_Comalapa)), the freeway that connects <span class="org">El Salvador International Airport</span> with <span class="loc">San Salvador</span>. Not much commerce exists outside the municipal public market and the southeast bus station, however, there is a significant textile industry in the <span class="org">San Marcos Free Trade Zone</span>, and logistic/distribution companies along the Comalapa Highway. The city's per capita GDP(PPP) is US $5,480 and it has a Human Development Index of 0.759 as of <span class="date">2002</span> [2].</p><br><br>
