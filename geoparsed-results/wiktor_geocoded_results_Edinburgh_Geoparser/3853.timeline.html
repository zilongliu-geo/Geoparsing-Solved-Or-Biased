  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Providence is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Webster County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,193 at the time of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. In <span class="date">1820</span>, Richard B. Savage arrived from Virginia with his wife and his elder sister <span class="per">Mary Savage Settler</span> and opened a general store on the site of the present city. The community that grew up was known as <span class="loc">Savageville</span>, until the post office was established in <span class="date">1828</span>, when it was renamed "Providence". Though sometimes said to honor the <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> city of that name, local history records that an old trader who had been helped by nearby farmers suggested the name to honor divine Providence. On <span class="date">February 18, 1840</span>, the town had a population of 150; there were three physicians, five stores, two hotels, a school, a Baptist church, a Masonic lodge, and three tobacco stemmeries. Located in the heart of the state's Black Patch tobacco-growing region, Providence eventually became the 3rd-largest stemming market in all of <span class="loc">America</span>. Providence was incorporated in <span class="date">1860</span>, when <span class="loc">Webster County</span> was formed. The onset of the Civil War slowed the economic growth, though no major battles took place in the largely pro-Confederate region. A Confederate reconnaissance and foraging party led by then Lieutenant Colonel <span class="per">Nathan Bedford Forrest</span> passed through <span class="loc">Webster County</span> between <span class="date">November</span> and <span class="date">December 1861</span>, and <span class="per">Forrest</span> reported that he had been welcomed by the inhabitants. Limited guerrilla warfare also took place near the city in <span class="date">1862</span>.</p><br><br>
