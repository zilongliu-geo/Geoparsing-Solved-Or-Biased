<p><span class="loc">Oneida County</span> is a county located in the state of <span class="loc">New York</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 234,878. The county seat is <span class="loc">Utica</span>. The name is in honor of the <span class="loc">Oneida</span>, an Iroquoian tribe that had this territory at the time of European encounter and has a reservation in the region. <span class="loc">Oneida County</span> is part of the Utica-Rome, <span class="loc">NY Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. When colonial counties were established by <span class="loc">England</span> in <span class="loc">New York</span> State in 1683, the territory of present <span class="loc">Oneida County</span> was included in a very large, mostly undeveloped <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of <span class="loc">New York</span> State as well as all of the present state of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> and, in theory, extending westward to the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of <span class="loc">Gloucester County</span>, both containing territory now in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. On March 12, 1772, what was left of <span class="loc">Albany County</span> was split into three parts, one remaining under the name <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. One of the other sections, <span class="loc">Tryon County</span>, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of <span class="loc">Tryon County</span> was approximately five miles west of the present <span class="loc">city of Schenectady</span>, and the county included the western part of the <span class="loc">Adirondack Mountains</span> and the area west of the <span class="loc">West Branch of the Delaware River</span>. The area then designated as <span class="loc">Tryon County</span> included what are now 37 individual <span class="loc">counties of New York State</span>. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of <span class="loc">New York</span>.</p>
