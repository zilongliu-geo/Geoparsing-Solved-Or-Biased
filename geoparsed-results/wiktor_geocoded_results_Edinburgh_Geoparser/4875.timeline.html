  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ferndale</span> is a southeastern suburb of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>. Its local government area is <span class="org">the City of Canning</span>. It is approximately 15 kilometres (9 mi) from Perth's central business district. The name <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> originated from developers who decided not to proceed with <span class="org">the City of Canning</span>'s choice of Shearnstead. In <span class="date">1965</span>, the name change was approved. The eastern section of <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> Crescent was once Menzies Road. Low scrub forest covered most of the suburb until developed in <span class="date">the late sixties</span> and seventies. <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> is bounded by Metcalfe Road to the south-east, the <span class="loc">Canning River</span> to the north and north-west, and Bannister Creek to the south-west. Its main street is <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> Crescent, which runs like an inverted U-shape from <span class="loc">Metcalfe</span> Road - the eastern leg of the street serves as a "centre line" to divide south-west and north-east <span class="loc">Ferndale</span>. Prominent features of the suburb also include <span class="loc">Ferndale</span> Reserve, a large sports ground; and the small <span class="org">Ferndale Shopping Centre</span>. The <span class="loc">Canning River</span> Regional Park, located in <span class="loc">Ferndale</span>'s north, is a popular route for cycling and walking as it is the parkland of the <span class="loc">Canning River</span>.</p><br><br>
