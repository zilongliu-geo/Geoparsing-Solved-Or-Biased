  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Kobe</span> (神戸市, Kōbe-shi, Japanese pronunciation: [koːꜜbe]) is the sixth-largest city in <span class="loc">Japan</span> and is the capital <span class="loc">city of Hyōgo Prefecture</span>. It is located on the southern side of the main island of Honshū, on the north shore of <span class="loc">Osaka Bay</span> and about 30 km (19 mi) west of <span class="loc">Osaka</span>. With a population around 1.5 million, the city is part of the <span class="loc">Keihanshin metropolitan</span> area along with <span class="loc">Osaka</span> and <span class="loc">Kyoto</span>. The earliest written records regarding the region come from the Nihon Shoki, which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jingū in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa Period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa Shogunate. <span class="org">Kobe</span> did not exist in its current form until its founding in <span class="date">1889</span>. Its name comes from "kanbe" (神戸), an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine. <span class="org">Kobe</span> became one of <span class="loc">Japan</span>'s 17 designated cities in <span class="date">1956</span>. <span class="org">Kobe</span> was one of the cities to open for trade with the West following the <span class="date">1853</span> end of the policy of seclusion and has since been known as a cosmopolitan port city. While the <span class="date">1995</span> Great Hanshin earthquake diminished much of <span class="org">Kobe</span>'s prominence as a port city, it remains <span class="loc">Japan</span>'s fourth busiest container port. Companies headquartered in <span class="org">Kobe</span> include <span class="org">ASICS</span>, <span class="loc">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</span>, and <span class="loc">Kobe Steel</span>, as well as over 100 international corporations with Asian or Japanese headquarters in the city such as <span class="per">Eli Lilly</span> and Company, <span class="loc">Procter</span> &amp; Gamble, Boehringer Ingelheim, and <span class="org">Nestlé</span>. The city is the point of origin and namesake of <span class="org">Kobe</span> beef, as well as the site of one of <span class="loc">Japan</span>'s most famous hot spring resorts, Arima Onsen.</p><br><br>
