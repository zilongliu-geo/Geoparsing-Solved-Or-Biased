(AP) &#x97; Police in <span class="loc">Sevierville</span> say an <span class="loc">Ohio</span> man has died after being found floating in a <span class="loc">Smoky Mountains</span> resort swimming pool. A spokesman for the <span class="loc">city of Sevierville</span> said 65-year-old Ronald Drocy of <span class="loc">Swanton</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, had been playing in the pool at <span class="loc">Wyndham</span> <span class="loc">Smoky Mountains</span> with his granddaughter. He was found floating about 9:30 p.m. Saturday and was pronounced dead at Fort Sanders Medical Center in nearby <span class="loc">Knoxville</span>. The Knoxville News Sentinel quoted city spokesman Bob Stahlke as saying firefighters administered CPR when Drocy was pulled from the pool. He was unsure whether an autopsy would be performed. <span class="loc">Swanton</span> is about 20 miles west of <span class="loc">Toledo</span> in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s northwestern corner.</p>
