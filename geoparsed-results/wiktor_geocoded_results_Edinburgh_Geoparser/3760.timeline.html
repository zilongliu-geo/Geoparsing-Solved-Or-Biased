  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 172,331. The county seat is <span class="loc">Clarksville</span>. The county was created in <span class="date">1836</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Clarksville</span>, <span class="loc">TNâ€“KY Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The county was named for <span class="per">John Montgomery</span>, a soldier in the American Revolutionary War and an early settler who founded the <span class="loc">city of Clarksville</span>. It was formed when <span class="loc">Tennessee County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, was split in <span class="date">1796</span>, when <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> became a state, to reduce confusion. The same year, much of the eastern portion of the county was combined with land taken from <span class="loc">Sumner County</span> to form <span class="loc">Robertson County</span>. Later acts of the <span class="org">Tennessee General Assembly</span> further reduced the county to its current size and boundaries by <span class="date">1871</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> was the site of several early saltpeter mines. <span class="loc">Saltpeter</span> is the main ingredient of gunpowder and was obtained by leaching the earth from several local caves. <span class="loc">Bellamy</span> Cave, located near <span class="loc">Stringtown</span>, still contains the remains of two dozen saltpeter leaching vats and apparently was a large operation. Cooper Creek Cave also shows evidence of extensive mining and contains the remains of "many saltpeter hoppers". Both were probably mined during the War of <span class="date">1812</span>. <span class="loc">Dunbar Cave</span> is reported to have been mined for saltpeter during the <span class="org">Mexican War</span>, but commercial development has destroyed any evidence of this. Little mining is likely to have happened here during the Civil War, since the <span class="org">Union Army</span> captured this part of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> in <span class="date">early 1862</span>.</p><br><br>
