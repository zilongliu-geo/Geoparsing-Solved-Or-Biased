  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kettering</span> is a coastal town on the D'Entrecasteaux Channel (37 km south of <span class="loc">Hobart</span>) opposite <span class="loc">Bruny Island</span>, <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. At the <span class="date">2011</span> census, <span class="loc">Kettering</span> had a population of 984. The area was first explored by Bruni D'Entrecasteaux in <span class="date">1792</span> and was settled in the early 19th century by timber cutters, whalers and sealers. Life was hard and the people who lived in the area rarely settled for long preferring the life in <span class="loc">Hobart</span> Town to the whaling stations and logging camps. It was just north of <span class="loc">Kettering</span> in Oyster Cove that the last Tasmanian Aboriginal settlement was established in <span class="date">1847</span>. Aborigines from all over <span class="loc">Van Diemen's Land</span> had been rounded up some <span class="date">years</span> earlier and isolated on <span class="loc">Flinders Island</span>. In <span class="date">1847</span> the remnants, <span class="date">now</span> only 44 people, were taken to a reserve at Oyster Cove. By <span class="date">1855</span> there were only 16 people left and by <span class="date">1869</span> only Truganini remained. She died in <span class="date">1876</span> but it was not until <span class="date">1976</span> that her ashes were thrown to the winds on the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Little Oyster Cove Post Office opened on <span class="date">19 October 1868</span> and was renamed <span class="loc">Kettering</span> in <span class="date">1892</span>.</p><br><br>
