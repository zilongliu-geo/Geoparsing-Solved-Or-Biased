  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Brewster</span> is a village within the town of Southeast in <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Its population was 2,390 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The village is the most densely populated portion of the county. The village is named for two early farmer landowners, <span class="per">Walter</span> and <span class="per">James Brewster</span>. The village of <span class="per">Brewster</span> derives its name from the landowner, <span class="per">Walter Brewster</span>, who invited <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">Harlem Railroad</span> to build a depot on his property. <span class="per">Brewster</span>'s Station, <span class="loc">New York</span>, (sometimes just "<span class="per">Brewster</span>'s") appeared on maps, on postcards and in directories of <span class="loc">Putnam County</span> throughout the second half of the 19th century. Although referred to as a village since it formed in <span class="date">1849</span>, it officially incorporated as the Village of <span class="loc">Brewster</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, in <span class="date">1894</span>. In <span class="date">1886</span>, historian <span class="per">William Smith Pelletreau</span> published The History of <span class="loc">Putnam County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. In his second chapter on the town of Southeast, he wrote: "The land <span class="date">now</span> [<span class="date">1886</span>] embraced within the limits of the village of <span class="per">Brewster</span> consists of a farm which was sold by the commissioners of forfeiture to <span class="per">Peleg Bailey</span>, in <span class="date">1781</span>. A portion of it afterward passed into the possession of <span class="per">Bailey</span> <span class="loc">Howes</span>, his grandson, who sold 98 acres to <span class="per">Gilbert Bailey</span>, <span class="date">April 1st 1833</span>. Two other tracts containing 39 acres were sold to <span class="per">Gilbert Bailey</span>, by <span class="per">William</span> P. Downs and <span class="per">Frederick Parks</span> in <span class="date">1838</span>. On the <span class="date">17th of February, 1848</span>, <span class="per">Gilbert Bailey</span> sold the whole tracts, estimated at 134 acres, to <span class="per">James</span> and <span class="per">Walter</span> <span class="per">F. Brewster</span>, for the sum of $8,000."</p><br><br>
