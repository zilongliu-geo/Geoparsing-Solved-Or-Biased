  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The town of <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is located in <span class="loc">Providence County</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It includes the historic villages of <span class="loc">Esmond</span>, <span class="loc">Georgiaville</span>, <span class="loc">Mountaindale</span>, <span class="loc">Hanton City</span>, <span class="loc">Stillwater</span> and <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. The population was 21,430 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is the home of <span class="org">Bryant University</span>, a private <span class="date">four year</span> college. The area comprising modern-day <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> was first settled in <span class="date">1636</span> by several British colonists, including <span class="per">John Steere</span> as a farming community and named after <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>, <span class="loc">London</span>. The area was within the boundaries of Providence until <span class="date">1731</span> when <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> was incorporated as a separate town. <span class="per">Chief Justice Peleg Arnold</span> lived in early <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>, and his <span class="date">1690</span> home stands <span class="date">today</span>. There was an active Quaker community in early 18th century <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> that extended along the Great Road, from what is <span class="date">today</span> <span class="loc">Woonsocket</span>, north into <span class="loc">south Uxbridge</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. This Quaker community, and its members, became influential in the abolition movement, with members such as <span class="loc">Effingham</span> <span class="per">Capron</span> and <span class="per">Abby</span> <span class="per">Kelley Foster</span>, and also gave rise to other Quaker settlements including one at <span class="loc">Adams</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> where <span class="per">Susan B. Anthony</span> was born as an early member. <span class="per">Elizabeth Buffum Chace</span> is a well-known person from <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> who was influential in both abolition of slavery, and the women's rights movement. In the 19th century several mills were built in the town. In the mid-19th century the towns of <span class="loc">North Smithfield</span>, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, and Lincoln, <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>, became separate towns. The colonial ghost town of <span class="loc">Hanton City</span> is located within the boundaries of present-day <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>, but was a completely separate community in the eighteenth century. A Revolutionary war soldier, from the <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> side of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> border, <span class="per">Captain James Buxton</span>, ended up as a <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> militiaman and Continental Army veteran, who was deeded 300 acres in <span class="loc">Worcester County</span> by Governor <span class="per">John Hancock</span>. For this reason <span class="per">Buxton</span> was lost to the history of <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> Revolutionary soldiers.(see <span class="loc">South Uxbridge</span> history). <span class="per">Buxton</span> served at <span class="loc">Valley Forge</span> among other battles.</p><br><br>
