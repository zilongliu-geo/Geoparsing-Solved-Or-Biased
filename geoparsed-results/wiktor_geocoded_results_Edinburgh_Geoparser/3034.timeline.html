  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Glasgow</span> (/ˈɡlɑːzɡoʊ, ˈɡlæ-, -s-/ GLA(H)Z-goh, GLA(H)S-goh; Scots: Glesga; Scottish Gaelic: Glaschu [ˈkl̪ˠas̪xu]) is the largest city in <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, and the third largest in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> (after <span class="loc">London</span> and <span class="loc">Birmingham</span>). Historically part of <span class="loc">Lanarkshire</span>, it is situated on the <span class="loc">River Clyde</span> in the country's <span class="loc">West Central Lowlands</span>. Inhabitants of the city are often referred to as Glaswegians and have the lowest life expectancy of any <span class="loc">UK city</span>. <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> grew from a small rural settlement on the <span class="loc">River Clyde</span> to become the largest seaport in <span class="loc">Britain</span>. Expanding from the medieval bishopric and royal burgh, and the later establishment of the <span class="org">University of Glasgow</span> in the 15th century, it became a major centre of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century. From the 18th century the city also grew as one of <span class="loc">Great Britain</span>'s main hubs of transatlantic trade with <span class="loc">North America</span> and the <span class="loc">West Indies</span>. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the population and economy of <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> was the "Second City of the British Empire" for much of the Victorian era and Edwardian period, although many cities argue the title was theirs.</p><br><br>
