He emigrated to Virginia in 1785 and from there came to <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. Cameron died February 28, 1846, having lived forty-eight years in the same log house. He and his second wife, Mary, are buried in the old City Cemetery. His descendants have lived in Franklin continuously since 1798 when his son Duncan was born.</p>
