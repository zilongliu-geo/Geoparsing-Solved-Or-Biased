<p>Candela is a city in the central region (Región Centro) of the northern Mexican state of <span class="loc">Coahuila</span>. It is the municipal seat of the surrounding municipality of Candela. There were 1,669 inhabitants in 2000. In 2011, according to Wolfram Alpha, it had a population of 1,672. It was founded in 1690 by General Alonso de León as a mission called <span class="loc">San Bernardino</span> de la Candela. Candela attracts people with its beautiful mountainous features and gaping deserts. There are three aquatic recreational areas in Candela: Los Carrisitos, <span class="loc">Las Lajitas</span> and <span class="loc">El Ojo de Agua</span>. Los Carrisitos is made up of pools that are filled with clean mountain water. It is also a great place to go on a carne asada (term for a Mexican-style barbecue). <span class="loc">Las Lajitas</span> is part of the Candela river which leads downstream to the town. It is notable for the shape of its rocks, hence the name "<span class="loc">Las Lajitas</span>". <span class="loc">El Ojo de Agua</span> is a spring of thermoheated waters. One can enjoy a skin renewal bath there. Another noteworthy asset of Candela is that it boasts several vast ranch-estates in its vicinity, such as the <span class="loc">Santa Lucia</span> de Sanmiguel - one of a few hidden jewels amongst the mountains. Like other isolated mountain towns, Candela is a religiously cultured place. One well-known chapel that is near the previously mentioned ranch, a tiny, open-air structure erected in the honor of the <span class="loc">Virgen</span> of Guadalupe, is a place in which many ranchers and townspeople alike use as a sanctuary to lay roses and rosaries and to pray for their loved ones.</p>
