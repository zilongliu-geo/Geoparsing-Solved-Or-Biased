  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> is a ghost town in Jefferson <span class="loc">Davis County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Once a thriving 19th-century community, little remains <span class="date">today</span> of <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> but a museum located within a historic home. <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> is one of the oldest settlements in Jefferson <span class="loc">Davis County</span>. Mt. Zion Methodist Church was established near <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> in <span class="date">1817</span>. <span class="per">John Ragan</span>, a Revolutionary soldier from Virginia, laid out the town in <span class="date">1819</span>, in what was then <span class="loc">Covington County</span>. The plan provided for lots, streets, and a large central square with two springs. <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> incorporated in <span class="date">1835</span>, and had two or three stores, and two churches. The town also had a well-regarded co-educational school, <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> Academy, which opened prior to <span class="date">1830</span>. At one point it had 70 to 80 students. The school moved in <span class="date">1845</span>. <span class="per">Benjamin L.C. Wailes</span> traveled through the community in <span class="date">1852</span> and wrote in his journal: After crossing [the] Bouie over a bridge (passing through the bottom land in which there is a good deal of large oak &amp; gum mixed with some Shortleaf pine) ascended a considerable eminence to a level table land of Oak and hickory, on which the village of <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> is situated. About 70 inhabitants. Two or three considerable Country Stores. More business [is] done [here] than at <span class="loc">Williamsburg</span>, and the situation is much handsomer, &amp; the buildings (tho' plain frame) [are] better.</p><br><br>
