<p><span class="loc">Washington County</span>, known locally as <span class="loc">South County</span>, is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 126,979. <span class="loc">Rhode Island</span> counties, including <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, have no governmental functions other than as court administrative and sheriff corrections boundaries, which are part of the state government. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is included in the Providence-Warwick, <span class="loc">RI-MA Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which is also included in the Boston-Worcester-Providence, MA-RI-NH-CT Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> was created from Providence Plantations in 1729 as <span class="loc">Kings County</span>. It was renamed <span class="loc">Washington County</span> on October 29, 1781, in honor of General and President Washington. At the earliest stage of colonial settlement, the area was called "The Narragansett Country", named after the Algonquin tribe of the same name and its tributary tribe the (Eastern) Niantics, whose territory it was, and these held power in the area long after the Wampanoags to the east had lost most of their territory to the <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span>. (The Algonquin Nipmucs may have held a piece of what is today the westernmost part of the town of <span class="loc">Hopkinton</span>.)</p>
