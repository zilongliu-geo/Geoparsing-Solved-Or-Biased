<p><span class="loc">Gedi</span> is a village near <span class="loc">Rapar</span> of <span class="loc">Kutch district</span> of <span class="loc">Gujarat</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>. <span class="loc">Gedi</span> appears to be a corruption of Ghritaghadya winch is found in two inscriptions : one near Rav, dated 1271 (Samvat 1323), where it is mentioned as a large district under <span class="loc">Maldev</span>, a Viceroy of Arjundev king of Anhilwad Patan; and the other in the inscription on the <span class="loc">Malan</span> well). This name would seem to mean the land, ghadya or padya, of butter, ghrit or ghee. The legend is that a merchant of Anhilwad in want of clarified butter, ghee stole it by magic from Malav's warehouse, and afterwards offered the value. This Malav refused as the stolen butter had been replaced by means of Malav's magic ring. On being assured that butter had been filched, he took the money, and with it built the temple, the well, and the pond. <span class="loc">Gedi</span> is believed to be one of the oldest towns in <span class="loc">Kutch</span>. One of the many towns that claim to be the Viratnagar that gave shelter to the Pandavas, it is also said to be the capital of the mythical Raja Gadhesingh, who, though for a time forced to wear the form of an ass, succeeded in marrying the chief's daughter and surrounding the city with a wall of brass. Some of the ass, Gadhaya, coins have been found in the ruins. In course of time the town passed into the hands of a Muslim named Madam. From him it was wrested by Padariya Rajputs, and from them by Vaghelas. This Vaghela chief seems at one time to have been very powerful and to have held the title of Maharana as late as 1476 (Samvat 1533}. Though afterwards subdued by the Jadejas, the head of the family had the title of <span class="loc">Rana</span> of <span class="loc">Gedi</span> until 1947.</p>
