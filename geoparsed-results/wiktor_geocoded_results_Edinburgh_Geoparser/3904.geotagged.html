<p><span class="loc">Rivas</span> is a modern hamlet located in the General River Valley of <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span> near the city of <span class="loc">San Isidro</span>. The town is positioned 1 kilometer north of where the <span class="loc">Rio Buenavista</span> and the <span class="loc">Rio</span> Chirripò Pacífico converge to form the <span class="loc">Rio General</span>. <span class="loc">Rivas</span> is located in the cantón of Pérez Zeledón in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">José Province</span>. This town lies south of a mountain chain <span class="loc">Cordillera de Talamanca</span> result of tectonic uplift between Cocos Plate and Caribbean Plate. This town is on the way to the Chirripó National Park Originally discovered in the 1980s through archaeological surveys of the region by Robert Drolet, the Rivas site is one of 15 Chiriquí Period (AD 750-1500) archaeological sites known within the river valley. Although the site is covered with agricultural plots, numerous cobble house foundations and upright boulders are present throughout the area indicating the presence of an archaeological site. Excavations at <span class="loc">Rivas</span> began in 1992 under the direction of Jeffrey Quilter of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University. His excavations identified structures similar to those found by Drolet at the site of Murciélago, <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span>. Throughout the 6-year project at <span class="loc">Rivas</span>, Quilter identified several residential areas. Construction of these structures consisted of river cobbles aligned in circular patterns of various sizes, typically with adjoining rectangular patios. The smallest structures measured 10m in diameter and the largest were up to 30m in diameter. Additional architectural features including paths, causeways, plazas, and stairways were also recorded throughout the site.</p>
