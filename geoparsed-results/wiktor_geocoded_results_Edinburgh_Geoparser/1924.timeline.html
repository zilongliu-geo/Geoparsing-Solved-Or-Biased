  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Thornton</span> is a village within the metropolitan borough of the <span class="loc">City of Bradford</span>, in <span class="loc">West Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It lies to the west of <span class="loc">Bradford</span>, and together with neighbouring <span class="loc">Allerton</span>, has total resident population of 15,003, increasing to 17,276 at the <span class="date">2011</span> Census. [1] Its most famous residents were the BrontÃ«s. The preserved centre of the village retains the character of a typical Pennine village, with stone built houses with stone flagged roofs. The surrounding areas consist of more modern housing, still isolated from the rest of the city by green fields. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> was incorporated into the <span class="loc">city of Bradford</span> in <span class="date">1899</span>. It was mentioned in the Domesday Book of the 11th century, when it had been laid waste by William the Conqueror's harrying of the North, punishment for an uprising against the Norman invaders of <span class="date">1066</span>. <span class="loc">Thornton</span> has been within the boundaries of the <span class="loc">City of Bradford</span> metropolitan borough since <span class="date">1974</span>, in which it comprises part of the <span class="loc">Thornton</span> and <span class="loc">Allerton</span> ward. It falls within the parliamentary constituency of <span class="per">Bradford West</span>. Its elevation, poor soils, isolation from major transport routes, and rainfall of over 34 inches <span class="date">a year</span> limited farm production. Resources such as coal, iron and sandstone, the development of turnpike roads, and the coming of the railways enabled <span class="loc">Thornton</span> to share in the prosperity generated by the 19th-century wool worsted trade. The increasing use of steam-powered mills (at the expense of the former cottage-industry production methods) concentrated production in the valleys of the city centre. Foreign imports, the Second World War, and closure of the railways, all contributed to the decline in manufacturing. <span class="date">Today</span> <span class="loc">Thornton</span> is a residential suburb of <span class="per">Bradford</span>.</p><br><br>
