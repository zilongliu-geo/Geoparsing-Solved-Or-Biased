  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">La Libertad</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [la liβerˈtað]) is a municipality in the El Petén department of <span class="loc">Guatemala</span>. It contains 79,416 people and has abundant oil reserves that have been commercialized by international oil companies since <span class="date">the 1980s</span>. Concession contract # 2-85 refers to "Xan field" (47 drilled wells), whose exploration started in the <span class="date">mid 1950s</span>. This contract was initially subscribed with the Basic Resources company, founded in <span class="date">the 1960s</span> by John D. Park, one of the lawyers that worked in the <span class="org">Guatemalan Oil Code</span> after the counter-revolution in <span class="date">1954</span>. Basic Resources started exploring possible oil wells during <span class="date">the 1970s</span> and began the commercial production in <span class="date">the 1980s</span>, in the middle of the <span class="org">Guatemala Civil War</span>. During <span class="date">the 1970s</span>, Basic Resources joins "Operación Conjunta", which is a combined effort led by the French public company Elf Aquitaine. By <span class="date">1993</span>, Basic Resources had a refinery setup in <span class="loc">La Libertad</span>, and an oil pipeline all the way to the Xan wells in <span class="loc">Laguna del Tigre</span>. In <span class="date">1985</span>, <span class="per">Basic Resources</span> had signed contract 2-85 with the Guatemalan government for <span class="date">25 years</span>. However, in the <span class="date">mid 1990s</span>, the new environmental laws and civilian groups start complaining that there is negative impacts from the oil activity in <span class="loc">Laguna del Tigre</span>. Basic Resources tries to calm the protests by creating environmental and conscience projects, but it is unable to do so.</p><br><br>
