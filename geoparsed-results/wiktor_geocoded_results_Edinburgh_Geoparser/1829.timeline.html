  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Amherst</span> a town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span> is <span class="date">now</span> located in what is known as <span class="org">the Shire of Central</span> Goldfields, northwest of <span class="loc">Talbot</span>. The town's location <span class="date">now</span> resembles an uneven paddock of some 10 acres (40,000 m2), but has little showing of its startling and significant historical prevalence. The town began as a mining settlement which was referred to as <span class="loc">Daisy Hill</span>, or sometimes <span class="org">Daisy</span> <span class="loc">Hill Creek</span>, and extended throughout the village. After a discovery of gold during the Gold Rush of <span class="date">1853</span>, the location became known as an extremely rich goldfield soon thereafter. Prior to this discovery, <span class="loc">Daisy Hill</span> had gained a particular notoriety, due to an illegal gold rush in <span class="date">February 1849</span>, that was based solely upon the spurious claims made by on <span class="per">Thomas</span> "Tommy" Chapman, a shepherd and former <span class="loc">Parkhurst</span> prison delinquent. It has been said that Chapman sold a gold nugget substantial in size, and relative to that of an adult hand, to a Melbourne Jeweller, <span class="per">Mr. Bretani</span> from <span class="per">Collins Street</span>. Soon after this alleged sale, Chapman mysteriously vanished. Much confusion surrounds where Chapman actually found the nugget, or if in fact, he stole it, according to the <span class="date">March 1849</span> issue of the Maitland Chronicle newspaper. As for his disappearance, a number of shepherds used the alias of <span class="per">Thomas Chapman</span>.</p><br><br>
