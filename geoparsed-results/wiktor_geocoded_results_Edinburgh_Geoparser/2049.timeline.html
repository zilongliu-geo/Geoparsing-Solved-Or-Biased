  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bandera</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Bandera County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, in the <span class="loc">Texas</span> Hill Country, which is part of the <span class="loc">Edwards Plateau</span>. The population was 857 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the <span class="org">San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Bandera</span> calls itself the "Cowboy Capital of the World". The Frontier Times Museum, founded by <span class="per">J. Marvin</span> Hunter and named for Hunter's Frontier Times magazine, is located in <span class="loc">Bandera</span> across from the First Baptist Church. <span class="loc">Bandera</span> also has a large presence in biker culture. A visitor to <span class="loc">Bandera</span> can see a sign on Main Street, in front of the Fire Department, which states that <span class="loc">Bandera</span> was founded by Roman Catholic immigrants from <span class="loc">Poland</span>. St. <span class="org">Stanislaus Catholic Church</span> was built by those immigrants, and the church is one of the oldest in <span class="loc">Texas</span>. Many of the residents are descended from those original Polish immigrants. There are many stories regarding the origin of the name "Bandera." One says that back in the 19th century, a flag was placed at the top of a path that came to be called <span class="loc">Bandera Pass</span>, due to bandera being the Spanish word for flag.</p><br><br>
