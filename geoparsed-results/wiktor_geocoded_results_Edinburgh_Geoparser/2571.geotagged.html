<p>Hammond is the largest city in <span class="loc">Tangipahoa Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is forty-five miles east of <span class="loc">Baton Rouge</span>. The population was 20,019 in the 2010 census and is home to Southeastern Louisiana University. Hammond is the principal city of the Hammond Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of <span class="loc">Tangipahoa Parish</span>. The city is named for Peter Hammond (1798–1870) — the surname anglicized from Peter av <span class="loc">Hammerdal</span> (Peter of <span class="loc">Hammerdal</span>) — a Swedish immigrant who first settled the area around 1818. Peter, a sailor, had been briefly imprisoned by the British at Dartmoor Prison during the Napoleonic Wars. He escaped during a prison riot, made his way back to sea, and later on arrived in <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. Hammond used his savings to buy then-inexpensive land northwest of <span class="loc">Lake Pontchartrain</span>. There he started a plantation to cultivate trees, which he made into masts, charcoal, and other products for the maritime industry in <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>. He transported the goods by oxcart to the head of navigation on the <span class="loc">Natalbany River</span> at <span class="loc">Springfield</span>. He owned at least thirty slaves before the Civil War. Peter Hammond lost his wealth during the war, as Union soldiers raided his property.</p>
