<p><span class="loc">San Lorenzo</span>, also known as <span class="loc">San Lorenzo</span> Village is a census-designated place (CDP) located in the San Francisco Bay Area in <span class="loc">Alameda County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 23,452 at the 2010 census. In 1944, under contract to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Navy, David D. Bohannon's Greenwood Company began construction of <span class="loc">San Lorenzo</span> Village, which was one of the nation's first planned communities, with parcels designated for schools, churches, parks, and several retail centers. Bohannon's pioneering pre-cutting techniques, referred to as the "<span class="loc">California</span> method," were used in later developments, such as the more famous <span class="loc">Levittown</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), of which, 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2) is land and 0.24% is water. <span class="loc">San Lorenzo Creek</span> runs partly through the town. It is located between the incorporated cities of <span class="loc">San Leandro</span> to the north and Hayward to the south. <span class="loc">San Lorenzo</span> is an unincorporated community and thus is governed directly by the <span class="loc">County of Alameda</span>. The area is policed by the Alameda County Sheriff's Office.</p>
