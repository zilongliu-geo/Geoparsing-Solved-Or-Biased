  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Glasgow</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Coos County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. For statistical purposes, the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau has defined <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> as a census-designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census the <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> CDP had a population of 763. The place name for <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> in the Coos language is Kdet. <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> is located on the north side of <span class="loc">Coos Bay</span>, about 6 miles (10 km) north of the city of <span class="loc">Coos Bay</span>, just east of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 101. The community was founded by real estate speculators in the 1890s, including <span class="per">Henry L. Pittock</span>, Phil Metschan, and Admiral Schley of the Pacific Coal &amp; Transportation Company. The community did not flourish until <span class="date">30 years</span> after its founding, when construction of Route 101 made <span class="loc">Glasgow</span> the northern terminus of the ferry from <span class="loc">North Bend</span>, which was used to cross the bay prior to the completion of the Coos <span class="loc">Bay Bridge</span>. The place was supposedly named by a Scot because it reminded him of <span class="loc">Glasgow</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>, but the authors of <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Geographic Names were unable to verify this.</p><br><br>
