  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Belvedere /ˈbɛlvədɪər/ is a district of <span class="loc">south east London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> within the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Bexley</span>. It is located south east of <span class="loc">Thamesmead</span> and 12 miles (19 km) ESE of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. The area which is <span class="date">today</span> known as <span class="loc">Belvedere</span> was for <span class="date">centuries</span> part of <span class="loc">Lesness</span> Heath, the eastern parts of a narrow high ridge which stretches from the area of <span class="loc">Lesnes</span> Abbey to <span class="loc">Erith</span>. The northern stretch is industrial and environmental and was common meadow. In <span class="date">1847</span> this largely uncultivated, wooded estate, almost undivided was given by operation of the will of last <span class="per">Lord Saye</span> and <span class="per">Sele</span> to his cousin <span class="per">Sir Culling Eardley</span>, who built properties in <span class="loc">Belvedere</span> until his death in <span class="date">1863</span>. <span class="per">Eardley</span> constructed a large wooden tower (see <span class="loc">Belvedere</span> (structure)) on the heath to gain views over his estate to the river <span class="loc">Thames</span>, giving the area its name from the Italian "beautiful view". The name can also be applied <span class="date">today</span>, as the ridge of the area, and parts of its southern uplands, have commanding views towards <span class="loc">Canary Wharf</span> and Central London. <span class="per">Eardley</span> was persuaded to allow the construction on his property, of a Dissenters' chapel, which was built so that the original wooden belvedere became its tower. In order that the public were able to attend this chapel, he constructed paths to it across <span class="loc">Lesness</span> Heath. <span class="per">Eardley</span> had finished in <span class="date">1861</span>, after <span class="date">nearly 8 years</span> of building, his chapel, <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">All Saints</span>' Church, after the earlier chapel with belvedere burned down on the same site. At the same time <span class="per">Eardley</span> constructed Villa Houses and reinforced the heath path to become Erith Road. The village of <span class="loc">Belvedere</span> soon grew up along the path which became Nuxley Road as <span class="per">Eardley</span> gradually sold off the land.</p><br><br>
