Initially called <span class="loc">Congreve</span> Station, this location was a stop on the <span class="loc">Texas</span> and New Orleans Railroad in the early 1860s. The name for the town came from the influx of people due to the discovery of oil in the early 1900s (similar to the gold strikes at <span class="loc">Nome</span>, <span class="loc">Alaska</span>), hence the name became <span class="loc">Nome</span> in 1903. Although rice farming would still be the foremost activity of the town, the discovery of natural gas and oil would create a new industry for the region in 1936. Many years later, <span class="loc">Nome</span> would become incorporated in 1971.</p>
