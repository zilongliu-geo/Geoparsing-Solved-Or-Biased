  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Nuri</span> is a place in modern <span class="loc">Sudan</span> on the south (east) side of the <span class="loc">Nile</span>. Close to it, there are pyramids belonging to Nubian kings. <span class="loc">Nuri</span> is situated about 15 km north of <span class="loc">Sanam</span>, and 10 km from <span class="loc">Jebel</span> <span class="loc">Barkal</span>. All these remains belonged to the ancient city <span class="loc">Napata</span>, the first capital of the Nubian kingdom of <span class="loc">Kush</span>. The earliest pyramid (Nu. 1) at <span class="loc">Nuri</span> belongs to king Taharqa which measures 51.75 metres square by 40 or by 50 metres high. His successor Tantamani was buried in el-Kurru, but all following Nubian kings and many of their wives till Nastasen (Nu. 15) (about <span class="date">330 BC</span>) were buried here. The pyramids at <span class="loc">Nuri</span> are in general smaller than the Egyptian ones and are <span class="date">today</span> often heavily destroyed, but they often still contained substantial parts of the funerary equipment of the Kushite rulers who were buried here. During the Christian era, a church was erected here. The church was built of many old stones, including several stelae originally coming from the pyramids. The pyramids were systematically excavated by <span class="per">George Reisner</span>.</p><br><br>
