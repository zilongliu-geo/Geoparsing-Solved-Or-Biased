<p>Knights blanked in <span class="loc">Erie</span>. <span class="loc">London</span> head coach Dale Hunter said the series wouldn’t be any different in <span class="loc">Erie</span> if the Knights stuck to “just playing hockey." But the Otters clearly aren’t playing the same hockey they did in the first two games of this OHL Western Conference quarterfinal series. Erie captain Zack Torquato struck on a tip-in on the power play that resulted from the penalty against Aarssen. Then, <span class="loc">Sarnia</span> native Brandon Biggers beat <span class="loc">London</span> goalie Trevor Cann through the wickets with a backhand on a shorthanded breakaway late in the first period to give the Otters a 2-0 lead. “On Saturdays, we don’t have to compete with anybody around here,” Erie GM Sherry Bassin said. “During the week, there are a lot of high school events going on. That’s why we wanted Saturdays. If we could’ve got our ice, we wouldn’t have played two-two (two in <span class="loc">London</span>, then two in <span class="loc">Erie</span>). We would’ve played the first in <span class="loc">London</span> on the Friday, then come home to play on the Saturday.” “That was a team that set a lot of records and it was a really great group to be around,” the 20-year-old from <span class="loc">Brampton</span> said. “But this is a great feeling, too. When we missed the playoffs all those years in <span class="loc">Erie</span>, you’re just thinking about when you’re going to get that chance and for us, this is it.”</p>
