<p><span class="loc">Roma</span> is a settlement under the Manonyane Community Council in the <span class="loc">Maseru District</span> of <span class="loc">Lesotho</span>, some 34 kilometers southeast of <span class="loc">Maseru</span>, the capital of <span class="loc">Lesotho</span>. The <span class="loc">Roma</span> valley is broad and fertile, and is surrounded by sandstone cliffs topped to the East by basalt mountains which provide magnificent scenery. Founded in 1862 by Roman Catholic missionaries in the valley known as Tloutle, <span class="loc">Roma</span> now has three seminaries and various novitiates, and they began the institution that became the National University of <span class="loc">Lesotho</span>. The surrounding area has become quite densely populated and is a significant residential area, recently gaining street lights on the main road. There are many dinosaur footprints in the area, some within the National University of <span class="loc">Lesotho</span>, and others on <span class="loc">Roma</span> Plateau. Some years ago the US Peace Corps ran its training programmes in <span class="loc">Roma</span>, and a local steep prominent mountain, Makhetha, is still referred to as Peace Corps Mountain, as an ascent was traditionally part of their programme. There are a number of schools situated around <span class="loc">Roma</span>, including three high schools. Christ the King High School, a boys school, was initially an early teacher training college, set up by the Marist Brothers, and from 1937 was run by the Brothers of The <span class="loc">Sacred Heart</span>. In 1961 CKHS became a high school only. Nearby there is St. Marys High School, which is a girls school, started by the Holy Family Sisters. The third is the NUL International School, situated within the university campus.</p>
