  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Marlborough</span> (/ˈmɔːlbrə/ MAWL-brə or /ˈmɑːlbərə/ MARL-brə) is a market town and civil parish in the English <span class="loc">county of Wiltshire</span> on the Old Bath Road, the old main road from <span class="loc">London</span> to Bath. It boasts the second widest high street in <span class="loc">Britain</span>, after <span class="loc">Stockton-on-Tees</span>. The town is on the <span class="loc">River Kennet</span>. The earliest sign of human habitation is a 62 feet (19 m) high prehistoric tumulus in the grounds of <span class="org">Marlborough College</span>. Recent radiocarbon dating has found it to date from about <span class="date">2400 BC</span>. It is of similar age to the larger <span class="loc">Silbury Hill</span> about 5 miles (8.0 km) west of the town. Legend has it that the Mound is the burial site of Merlin and that the name of the town, <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> comes from Merlin's Barrow. On John Speed's map of <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span> (<span class="date">1611</span>), the town's name is recorded as Marlinges boroe. The town's motto is <span class="loc">Ubi</span> nunc sapientis ossa Merlini - Where <span class="date">now</span> are the bones of wise Merlin. More plausibly, the town's name probably derives from the medieval term for chalky ground "marl" – thus "town on chalk".</p><br><br>
