<p><span class="loc">Richland</span> was a town in southeastern <span class="loc">Shawnee County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. It is notable for being the birthplace of Georgia Neese Clark Gray, the first female Treasurer of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In October 1854, Charles Matney settled in the area that was to become <span class="loc">Richland</span>, near the confluence of <span class="loc">Camp Creek</span> with the <span class="loc">Wakarusa River</span>. In 1857 a post office was opened north of town and a schoolhouse was constructed, out of logs, on the northeast corner of Matney's land. <span class="loc">Richland</span> eventually became the center of a rich agricultural region and its businesses included a bank, a barber shop, a church, two blacksmiths, two doctors, a pharmacy, several lodges, a hotel and a general store. in the early 1870s, <span class="loc">Richland</span> became a station on the St. Louis, Lawrence and Denver Railroad however the railroad would be short lived and the railroad stopped running in 1894. By the 1890s the population had come close to 300 with more businesses including a lumber yard, two millinery shops and an ice cream parlor, among others. <span class="loc">Richland</span> also established a newspaper, <span class="loc">Argosy</span>, in 1893 and it included local news but also news about nearby communities including <span class="loc">Twin Mound</span>, <span class="loc">Overbrook</span> and Clinton. In the summer of 1894, Laura Ingalls Wilder passed through <span class="loc">Richland</span> with her husband and daughter. Wilder noted in her diary, based on the friendliness of the townspeople, that "[we] may come back here if we do not like it there [in Missouri]."</p>
