<p><span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is a county located in the southwest corner of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 802,374. making it the third-most populous county in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The county seat is <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>. The county is named for the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> is part of the Cincinnati-Middletown, <span class="loc">OH-KY-IN Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Most of <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> was originally owned and surveyed by John Cleves Symmes, and the region was a part of the Symmes Purchase. The first European-American settlers rafted down the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> in 1788 following the American Revolutionary War. They established the towns of <span class="loc">Losantiville</span> (later <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>) and <span class="loc">Cleves</span>. <span class="loc">Hamilton County</span> was organized in 1790, as the second county in the Northwest Territory. Its area then included about one-eighth of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, and had about 2,000 inhabitants (not including the remaining Native Americans). The <span class="loc">United States</span> persuaded most of the <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> and other Indian peoples to remove in the 1820s to locations west of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. Since then, other counties were created from Hamilton, reducing the county to its present size. Rapid growth occurred during the 1830s and 1840s as the area attracted many German and Irish immigrants, especially after the Great Famine in <span class="loc">Ireland</span> and the revolutions in <span class="loc">Germany</span> in 1848.</p>
