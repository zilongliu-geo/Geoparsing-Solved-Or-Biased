  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Wilson</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Lynn County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city was established in <span class="date">1912</span> by <span class="per">William Green</span> of Shiner. Green intended to settle this part of <span class="per">Texas</span> with German emigrant farmers on old <span class="org">Wilson County School</span> lands located in <span class="loc">Lynn County</span>, hence the city's name. <span class="per">Wilson</span> is the birthplace of Jerry "Bo" Coleman, a radio disc jockey in Lubbock who was a friend and associate of <span class="per">Buddy Holly</span> and <span class="per">Waylon Jennings</span>. In <span class="date">1923</span>, <span class="per">Wilson</span>, with only twenty residents, was among thirty-seven communities that applied to become the home of the new <span class="org">Texas Tech University</span>, which was instead located to the north in Lubbock. <span class="per">Wilson</span> offered the choice of six thousand acres for the institution, three times the amount required in the legislation authored by State Senator <span class="per">William H. Bledsoe</span> of Lubbock, whose district included <span class="loc">Lynn County</span>. The institution could have picked any arrangement of land <span class="per">I Wilson</span> without disturbing any individual or even moving a fence. <span class="per">Wilson</span> lies on the level high plains of the <span class="loc">Llano Estacado</span> in <span class="per">West Texas</span>. It is located at 33°19′01″N 101°43′27″W (33.3170352 -101.7240454).</p><br><br>
