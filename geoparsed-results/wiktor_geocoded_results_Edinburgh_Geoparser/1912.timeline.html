  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Safi</span> (Maltese: Ħal <span class="loc">Safi</span>) is a village in the <span class="loc">Southern Region</span> of <span class="loc">Malta</span>, located close to Żurrieq and the <span class="org">Malta International Airport</span>. It has a population of 2,126 people as of <span class="date">March 2014</span>. The formation of the village as known <span class="date">today</span> goes back to <span class="date">about seven hundred years</span>. The village of Ħal <span class="loc">Safi</span> was surrounded by four other major villages. Farmers and peasants used to meet there for a chat on their way back home from work. Later a niche was erected there,and in time,as people began to settle in the vicinity, a new village started taking shape. In <span class="date">1417</span>, the village was already known as Ħal <span class="loc">Safi</span>. According to the <span class="date">1419</span> records of the Standing Army (id-Dejma), between eighty and ninety people were considered as village residents. The main occupation of the major part of the residents was farming - breeding of sheep and goats and agriculture. The origin of the village's name cannot be determined conclusively. Some historians have concluded that the name was derived from the PURE (Safi) AIR of the village. Others insisted that it is similar to <span class="loc">Ksour Essaf</span> in <span class="loc">Tunisia</span> or that the village was named Ħal <span class="loc">Safi</span> since none of its residents was contaminated when an epidemic infected the whole country. Both its coat of arms (a horizontal light-blue stripe on a silver background) and its motto (Sine Macula) emphasize the meaning of its name.</p><br><br>
