<p><span class="loc">Kostroma</span> (Russian: Кострома; IPA: [kəstrɐˈma]) is a historic city and the administrative center of <span class="loc">Kostroma Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>. A part of the <span class="loc">Golden Ring</span> of Russian towns, it is located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Volga</span> and <span class="loc">Kostroma Rivers</span>. Population: 268,742 (2010 Census); 278,750 (2002 Census); 278,414 (1989 Census). The city was first recorded in the chronicles for the year 1213, but historians believe it could have been founded by Yury Dolgoruky more than half a century earlier, in 1152. Like other towns of the <span class="loc">Eastern Rus</span>, <span class="loc">Kostroma</span> was sacked by the Mongols in 1238. It then constituted a small principality, under leadership of Prince Vasily the Drunkard, a younger brother of the famous Alexander Nevsky. Upon inheriting the grand ducal title in 1271, Vasily didn't leave the town for <span class="loc">Vladimir</span>, and his descendants ruled <span class="loc">Kostroma</span> for another half a century, until the town was bought by Ivan I of <span class="loc">Moscow</span>. As one of the northernmost towns of the Grand Duchy of <span class="loc">Moscow</span>, <span class="loc">Kostroma</span> served for grand dukes as a place of retreat when enemies besieged <span class="loc">Moscow</span> in 1382, 1408, and 1433. In 1375, the town was looted by Novgorod pirates (ushkuiniks). The spectacular growth of the city in the 16th century may be attributed to the establishment of trade connections with English and Dutch merchants (Muscovy Company) through the northern port of Archangel. Boris Godunov had the Ipatiev and Epiphany monasteries rebuilt in stone. The construction works were finished just in time for the city to witness some of the most dramatic events of the Time of Troubles.</p>
