  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hamilton</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Butler County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, in the state's southwestern corner. The population was 62,447 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city is part of the <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span> metropolitan area. Its neighborhood of <span class="loc">Lindenwald</span>, settled by German immigrants in the mid-19th century and later, is one of three designated National Historic Districts. The city has a council-manager form of government. Its mayor is <span class="per">Patrick Moeller</span> and the City Manager is <span class="per">Joshua Smith</span>. Most of the city is in the <span class="loc">Hamilton City</span> School District. The industrial city is seeking to revitalize through the arts; it was officially declared the "<span class="loc">City of Sculpture</span>" in <span class="date">2000</span>. Its initiative has attracted many sculpture installations to the city, which founded the Pyramid Hill Sculpture Park. <span class="per">Hamilton</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, was founded by European Americans in <span class="date">1791</span> as <span class="loc">Fort Hamilton</span> (named to honor <span class="per">Alexander Hamilton</span>). The northwest frontier military fort was built to serve as a supply station for the troops of generals <span class="per">Arthur St. Clair</span> and later <span class="per">Anthony Wayne</span>. Their armies entered the <span class="loc">Miami</span> Valley to drive out the <span class="loc">Shawnee</span> and <span class="loc">Miami</span> during the <span class="org">Northwest Indian War</span> of the 1790s. The Indians hoped to maintain their territory here, but, following the American Revolutionary War, the <span class="loc">United States</span> wanted to open it for European-American settlement and succeeded in pushing out the indigenous peoples.</p><br><br>
