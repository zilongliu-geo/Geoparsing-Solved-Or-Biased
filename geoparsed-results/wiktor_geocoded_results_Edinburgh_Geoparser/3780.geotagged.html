<p><span class="loc">Elgin</span> (/ˈɛlɡɪn/; Scottish Gaelic: Eilginn, Scots: Ailgin) is a former cathedral city and Royal Burgh in <span class="loc">Moray</span>, <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It is the administrative and commercial centre for Moray. The town originated to the south of the <span class="loc">River Lossie</span> on the higher ground above the floodplain. <span class="loc">Elgin</span> is first documented in the Cartulary of Moray in 1190 AD. It was created a Royal Burgh in the 12th century by King David I of <span class="loc">Scotland</span> and by that time had a castle on top of the present day <span class="loc">Lady Hill</span> to the west of the town. In August 1040, MacBeth's army defeated and killed Duncan I at Bothganowan (Pitgaveny), near <span class="loc">Elgin</span>. <span class="loc">Elgin</span> is first recorded in a charter of David I in 1151 in which he granted an annuity to the Priory of <span class="loc">Urquhart</span>. David had made <span class="loc">Elgin</span> a royal burgh around 1130, after his defeat of Óengus of Moray. During David's reign the castle was established at the top of what is now <span class="loc">Lady Hill</span>. The town received a royal charter from Alexander II in 1224 when he granted the land for a new cathedral to Andrew, Bishop of Moray. This finally settled the episcopal see which had been at various times at <span class="loc">Kinneddar</span>, <span class="loc">Birnie</span> and <span class="loc">Spynie</span>. <span class="loc">Elgin</span> was a popular residence for the early Scottish monarchs: David I, William I, Alexander II and Alexander III all held court there and hunted in the royal forests.</p>
