<p>Easton is a village and civil parish in <span class="loc">Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Easton lies approximately 6 miles (10 km) west of <span class="loc">Huntingdon</span>, between the villages of <span class="loc">Ellington</span> and <span class="loc">Spaldwick</span>. Easton is situated within <span class="loc">Huntingdonshire</span> which is a non-metropolitan <span class="loc">district of Cambridgeshire</span> as well as being a historic <span class="loc">county of England</span>. There is a church and a small park. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish's population was 162: 80 males and 82 females in 60 households.  However, by 2011, the population had increased only slightly to 169 people. Easton was mentioned in the Domesday Book. Easton is a hamlet which the Anglo Saxons settled in and the church was erected in the 14th century. In 1085 William the Conqueror ordered that a survey should be carried out across his kingdom to discover who owned which parts and what it was worth. The survey took place in 1086 and the results were recorded in what, since the 12th century, has become known as the Domesday Book. Starting with the king himself, for each landholder within a county there is a list of their estates or manors; and, for each manor, there is a summary of the resources of the manor, the amount of annual rent that was collected by the lord of the manor both in 1066 and in 1086, together with the taxable value.</p>
