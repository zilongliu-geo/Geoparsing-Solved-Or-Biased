  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Bethany</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Harrison County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,292 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The settlement of <span class="loc">Harrison County</span> began around <span class="date">1838</span>, although the land was not surveyed and opened for entry until <span class="date">1842</span>. The county is named after <span class="per">Albert C. Harrison</span>, a 19th-century <span class="loc">Missouri</span> political figure. Many of the early settlers to the area homesteaded along <span class="loc">Sugar Creek</span> and in the <span class="per">Bethany</span> area. Three commissioners deliberated for <span class="date">several days</span> to determine a site for the county seat, and voted to site it in the southern part of the county. The original name of the community was Dallas. In <span class="date">June 1845</span>, <span class="per">John S. Allen</span> was appointed to survey the town into lots and offer the same for sale. The plat, covering 19 acres (7.7 hectare), was completed on <span class="date">27 June 1845</span>. The name Dallas apparently did not meet with the general approval of the residents of the community and the issue was brought before the county court. It was decided that the court and county officials present would select a new name by ballot. The names of <span class="per">Bethany</span> and <span class="per">Carthage</span> were proposed. The vote favored "<span class="per">Bethany</span>"; accordingly the town's name was changed. It was incorporated as a city by an act of the General Assembly dated <span class="date">6 January 1860</span>. The first mayor was <span class="per">T.H. Templeman</span>.</p><br><br>
