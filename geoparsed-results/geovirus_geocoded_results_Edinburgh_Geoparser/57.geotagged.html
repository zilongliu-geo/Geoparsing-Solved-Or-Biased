<p>New research findings from <span class="loc">South Africa</span> on an extremely drug-resistant (XDR) strain of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB) alarm experts. XDR-TB is defined as resistance to three or more second line antibiotics for TB. The condition remains treatable with other types of medications, but those are less effective, costlier and toxic. Dr. Tony Moll discovered the Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region KwaZulu-Natal. In an interview, he said the new variant was "very highly troubling and alarming because of the very high fatality rate." Some patients might have contracted the bug in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were hospital health workers. These distressing findings urged a two-day meeting in <span class="loc">Johannesburg</span> to discuss the situation. Experts like Dr. Moll believe the new strain is also present in other provinces than KwaZulu-Natal. Conference organizers report cases in <span class="loc">Mozambique</span> and <span class="loc">Botswana</span> too. The World Health Organization has called for renewed efforts to combat the disease. Meanwhile, officials of the Health Ministry are suspected to be enforcing a media ban on the topics of AIDS and possibly TB. During the 1990s, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin, emerged as a threat to TB control, both in the <span class="loc">United States</span> and worldwide.</p>
