  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bayang</span> is a fifth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Lanao del Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 21,472 people. In <span class="date">May 1902</span>, during the Moro Rebellion (also known as the Moroâ€“American War), <span class="loc">Bayang</span> was the site of a clash between Moro rebels and American troops that became known as the Battle of <span class="loc">Bayang</span>. The American troops, three infantry battalions and a battery of artillery totaling some 1200 men, were led to <span class="loc">Bayang</span> by colonel <span class="per">Frank Baldwin</span> to demand the extradition of the <span class="loc">Moros</span> responsible for the ambushing and killing of two American soldiers at the construction of a road from <span class="loc">Iligan</span> to <span class="loc">Lake Lanao</span>, <span class="date">two months earlier</span>. When the sultan of <span class="loc">Bayang</span> refused, <span class="per">Baldwin</span>'s troops attacked and captured the nearby cotta (fortress; "small, castle-like structures with thick, high walls") of <span class="loc">Binidayan</span> on <span class="date">2 May</span>. They subsequently attempted to capture the cotta of Pandapatan, which resisted the artillery fire and was only subdued <span class="date">the next day</span> after hand-to-hand combat between <span class="loc">Moros</span> and Americans. The number of Moro casualties is estimated at 300 to 400, including the sultan of <span class="loc">Bayang</span> and his brother. On the American side, ten soldiers were killed and some forty wounded.</p><br><br>
