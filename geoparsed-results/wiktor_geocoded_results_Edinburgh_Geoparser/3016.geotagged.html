<p><span class="loc">Larino</span> (Latin: Larinum, Campobassan dialect: Lar√¨ne) is a town and comune of approximately 8,100 inhabitants in <span class="loc">Molise</span>, <span class="loc">province of Campobasso</span>, southern <span class="loc">Italy</span>. It is located in the fertile valley of the <span class="loc">Biferno</span> River. The old town, seen from the mountains, is shaped like a bird's wing. The new town, called Piano <span class="loc">San Leonardo</span>, is built on a mountainside. The <span class="loc">city of Larino</span> has been continuously inhabited for millennia. Originally settled by the Samnite and Frentani tribes of Southern <span class="loc">Italy</span>, the city came under the control of the Oscan civilization. In 217 BC, the Romans defeated <span class="loc">Hannibal</span> here, and it was later incorporated into the Roman Empire, where it was classified as a municipium, and added to the <span class="loc">Secunda</span> <span class="loc">Regio</span> (<span class="loc">Apulia</span>). When Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great fought for the power in <span class="loc">Rome</span>, the latter is said to have joined two of his legions who were encamped at Larinum. Earlier the consul Claudius marched through Larinum on his way to attack the Carthaginian Hasdrubal. The city's name appears in the works of the ancient historians Livy and Pliny. An important senatus consultum restricting public performances by members of the Roman upper classes was found nearby.</p>
