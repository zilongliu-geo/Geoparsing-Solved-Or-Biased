<p><span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 33,361. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat and largest city is <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span>. The county is named for Major General Benjamin Lincoln, an officer in the American Revolutionary War. <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> was created in 1809 from parts of <span class="loc">Bedford County</span>. The land occupied by the county was part of a land session obtained from the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> and <span class="loc">Chickasaw</span> in 1806. The <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> Process, used in the distillation of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> whiskey, is named for this county, as Jack Daniel's distillery was originally located there. However, a subsequent redrawing of county lines resulted in the establishment of adjacent <span class="loc">Moore County</span>, where it is now located, so no current <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> business uses its namesake process. The governing body of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is the Lincoln County Commission, which is divided into eight districts and 24 commissioners, three from each district. The body is chaired by the County Mayor. The government center of <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> is the <span class="loc">Lincoln County</span> Courthouse in <span class="loc">Fayetteville</span>.
