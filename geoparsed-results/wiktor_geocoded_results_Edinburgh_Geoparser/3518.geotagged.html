<p><span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">Saddleworth parish</span> of the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Oldham</span> in <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is 4 miles (6.4 km) east of <span class="loc">Oldham</span>, and 13 miles (21 km) east-northeast of the <span class="loc">city of Manchester</span>. It lies in a broad rural area amongst the <span class="loc">South Pennines</span>. To the east of the village <span class="loc">Dovestone</span> Reservoir, Chew Reservoir and <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> Reservoir lie within the Peak District National Park, though no part of the village itself lies within the Peak Park boundary. Lying within the ancient county boundaries of the <span class="loc">West Riding</span> of <span class="loc">Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is mainly situated on and around two roads in the Chew Valley in the <span class="loc">Pennines</span>. One of these roads is the main A635 road from Ashton-under-Lyne to <span class="loc">Holmfirth</span>. A Roman road passes along the <span class="loc">Saddleworth</span> hills, from the fort of Ardotalia in <span class="loc">Glossop</span> to Castleshaw Roman fort. The route of the Roman road passes through <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> and crosses the <span class="loc">Chew Brook</span> at <span class="loc">Packhorse Bridge</span>. The old stone houses of <span class="loc">Saddleworth</span> date from the 17th century and were home to farmers and hand-loom weavers in the woollen trade. The first industrial looms were also designed and built in <span class="loc">Saddleworth</span>. <span class="loc">England</span>'s highest church 'The Heights' and canal tunnel 'Standedge Tunnel' are also here, the latter dating from the end of the 18th century and being a Thomas Telford project.</p>
