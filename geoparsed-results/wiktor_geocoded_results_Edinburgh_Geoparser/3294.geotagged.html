<p>Barbara (Arabic: برْبره‎) was a Palestinian Arab village in the <span class="loc">Gaza</span> Subdistrict located 17 km northeast of <span class="loc">Gaza city</span>, in the vicinity of modern <span class="loc">Ashkelon</span>. It had an entirely Arab population of 2,410 in 1945. The village consisted of nearly 14,000 dunums of which approximately 12,700 dunums was able to be cultivated. It was captured by <span class="loc">Israel</span> during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Barbara received its modern name from the Romans. After the Roman rule the village was under the control of a number of empires and dynasties ranging from the Byzantines, various Islamic Arab dynasties, the Crusaders, the Turkish Mamluks and Ottomans and <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>. A winepress, dating from the Byzantine period has been found. According to the Arab geographer Mujir al-Din (1456–1522), the village was home to the Muslim scholar sheikh Yusuf al-Barbarawi, a local sage and a student of renowned scolar Ahmad ibn <span class="loc">Dawud</span>, who died in 1323. During the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Murad III (1574-1596), Barbara's only mosque was built. It contained the tomb of Yusuf al-Barbarawi. In 1596, Barbara was part of the nahiya (subdistrict) of <span class="loc">Gaza</span> under the liwa' (district) of <span class="loc">Gaza</span> with a population of 402. The village appeared under the name of <span class="loc">Hababeh</span> on the map that Pierre Jacotin compiled in 1799.</p>
