<p><span class="loc">San Gabriel</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> is a town located in northwest <span class="loc">Milam County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> approximately 10 miles north of <span class="loc">Thorndale</span> on Ranch Road 486, or about 50 miles northeast of the <span class="loc">Austin metropolitan</span> area. <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span>'s latitude is 30.694 North by longitude -97.196 West and has an elevation of 417 feet above sea level. <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> appears on the San Gabriel U.S. Geological Survey Map and is in the Central Time Zone (UTC/GMT -6 hours - UTC/GMT -5 hours during Daylight Saving Time). <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> is named after the <span class="loc">San Gabriel River</span> in Central <span class="loc">Texas</span>. <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> is located about 30 miles downstream from the site of the Battle of the San <span class="loc">Gabriels</span> in 1839, a battle fought during the Texas-Indian Wars that followed the <span class="loc">Texas</span> Republic's successful Revolution after the suspension of the 1824 Constitution of the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> in favor of a centralist oriented constitution that led to the dictatorship of President Antonio LÃ³pez de <span class="loc">Santa Anna</span>. Several Spanish missions were established near the site in an effort to Christianize the Indian tribes living in the area, but these projects were abandoned by the mid-1750s. The mission buildings soon fell into ruin, and by the end of the 19th century little trace of them remained. The town of <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> was formally established in 1843 or 1844, when Jesse and Peter Mercer built cabins on the <span class="loc">San Gabriel River</span>. Peter Mercer was killed by Indians on June 17, 1844, and was buried in Locklin Cemetery at <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span>, not far from where he was killed. The area on the <span class="loc">San Gabriel River</span> where he was killed is still called Mercer's Bluff. The community was granted a post office in 1850. By the mid-1880s <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> had a steam gristmill-cotton gin, a church, two schools, and 130 residents. Cotton, corn, and oats were the principal crops grown by area farmers. Population estimates for <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> ranged from a low of twenty-five in 1890 to a high of 350 in 1929. The number of residents fell to 200 by the early 1940s, and to seventy-five by the late 1950s. <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> served as the center of a common-school district until 1960, when the school was consolidated with the nearby and academically well respected Thorndale Independent School District. The <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> post office was discontinued in the late 1960s. Two churches, a business, and a community hall were in the 1980s. The population in 1990 was 100. The population remained the same in the 2000 Census.</p>
