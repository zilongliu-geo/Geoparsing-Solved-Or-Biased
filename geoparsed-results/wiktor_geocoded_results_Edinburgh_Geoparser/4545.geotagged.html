<p><span class="loc">Murray County</span> was one of the original Nineteen Counties in <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> and is now one of the 141 Lands administrative divisions of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>. It included the area which is now part of <span class="loc">Canberra</span> and as far north as <span class="loc">Lake George</span> and <span class="loc">Yass</span>. It was originally bounded on the west by the <span class="loc">Murrumbidgee River</span>, on the east by the <span class="loc">Shoalhaven River</span> and on the north by the <span class="loc">Yass River</span>. A large area of the county was transferred to the Commonwealth government in 1909 in the Seat of Government Acceptance Act to make part of the <span class="loc">Australian Capital Territory</span>, along with land in <span class="loc">Cowley County</span>. Since then, the ACT border is now part of the western boundary. Part of the ACT border is determined by property boundaries in the <span class="loc">Parish of Keewong</span>, in the <span class="loc">County of Murray</span>; specifically the southern end of portions 177, 218, 211, 36, and 38. This is mentioned in the Seat of Government Acceptance Act of 1909. <span class="loc">Murray County</span> is named in honour of Lieutenant-Governor, Sir George Murray (1772â€“1846). The electoral <span class="loc">district of United</span> <span class="loc">Counties of Murray</span> and <span class="loc">St Vincent</span> was the first electoral district for the area, between 1856 and 1859.</p>
