<p><span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 50,219. The county seat is <span class="loc">Fonda</span>. The county was named in honor of Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 at the Battle of <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. It was created in 1772 as <span class="loc">Tryon County</span> and in 1784 was renamed <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>. <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Amsterdam</span>, <span class="loc">NY</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area. The county borders the north and south banks of the Mohawk River. In 1784, following end of the American Revolutionary War, the name of <span class="loc">Tryon County</span> was changed to <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>. This change was to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in <span class="loc">Canada</span> and died in 1775 attempting to capture the <span class="loc">city of Quebec</span> during the Revolutionary War. It replaced the name formerly honoring the last provincial governor of <span class="loc">New York</span>. In 1789, <span class="loc">Ontario County</span> was split off from Montgomery. The area split off from <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span> was much larger than the present county, as it also included the present <span class="loc">Allegany</span>, <span class="loc">Cattaraugus</span>, <span class="loc">Chautauqua</span>, <span class="loc">Erie</span>, <span class="loc">Genesee</span>, <span class="loc">Livingston</span>, <span class="loc">Monroe</span>, <span class="loc">Niagara</span>, <span class="loc">Orleans</span>, <span class="loc">Steuben</span>, <span class="loc">Wyoming</span>, <span class="loc">Yates</span>, and part of Schuyler and Wayne counties.</p>
