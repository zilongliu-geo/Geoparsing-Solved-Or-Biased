  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Aguada</span> (/əˈɡwɑːdə/; Spanish: [aˈɣwaða]) is a municipality of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span>, located in the western coastal valley region bordering the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>, east of Rincón, <span class="loc">west of Aguadilla</span> and <span class="loc">Moca</span>; and <span class="loc">north of Anasco</span> and <span class="loc">Mayaguez</span>. It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San <span class="loc">Sebastián Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. Aguada's population is spread over 17 wards and Aguada Pueblo, which is the downtown area and the administrative center of the city. According to sources, a Taíno settlement called Aymamón was located close to the <span class="loc">Culebrinas</span> River. Although there is dispute to it, some sources believe that <span class="per">Christopher Columbus</span> entered the island of <span class="loc">Puerto Rico</span> through <span class="loc">Aguada</span> on his second voyage in <span class="date">November 1493</span>. The nearby <span class="loc">city of Aguadilla</span> also claims to be the site of <span class="per">Columbus</span>' arrival. While there is no specific historical proof, it is known that many of the first attempts to set up a town on the island were in <span class="loc">Aguada</span>. In <span class="date">July 1510</span>, Cristóbal <span class="per">de Sotomayor</span> received control of the area from <span class="loc">Juan Ponce</span> de León and renamed the town <span class="per">Villa de Sotomayor</span>.  However, in <span class="date">1511</span> the settlement was attacked and burned by the local Taínos. That same year, the King ordered a monastery established in the island, and the <span class="per">Ermita de Espinar</span> was founded. The name of the region was then changed to <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> de Asís de la <span class="loc">Aguada</span>, since the friars were Franciscan. The monastery was finished in <span class="date">1516</span>. In <span class="date">1526</span>, <span class="per">King Charles I</span> of <span class="loc">Spain</span> officially founded the Aguada settlement. However, in <span class="date">1529</span>, Taínos attacked the monastery killing the friars and burning the settlement.</p><br><br>
