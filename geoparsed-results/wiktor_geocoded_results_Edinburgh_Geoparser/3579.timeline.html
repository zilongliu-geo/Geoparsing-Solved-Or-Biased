  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Loka</span> (pronounced [ˈloːka]; Italian: <span class="loc">Lonche</span>) is a small village in the City Municipality of <span class="loc">Koper</span> in the Littoral region of <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. The toponym <span class="loc">Loka</span> is relatively common in <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. It is derived from the Slovene noun loka 'swampy meadow', from Proto-Slavic *lǫka 'swampy, flood-prone meadow', semantically derived from 'meander'. Toponyms of the same origin are also found in other Slavic countries (e.g., Polish Łąka, Serbian Luka, Bulgarian Shiroka Laka, etc.) The Italian name <span class="loc">Lonche</span> reflects the early Slavic nasal vowel. During the Second World War, from <span class="date">March</span> to <span class="date">September 1943</span> the first regional committee of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation was headquartered at the house of Ivan Žigante (a.k.a. Peter) in the hamlet of Žgani. <span class="loc">Loka</span> was burned by German forces on <span class="date">12 October 1943</span>. The local church is dedicated to <span class="per">Saint Cecilia</span> and belongs to the <span class="loc">Parish of Predloka</span>. The medieval church was burned by German forces on <span class="date">12 October 1943</span> and its ruins were registered as cultural heritage. The parish archive, which had been transferred from Predloka to <span class="loc">Loka</span> for safekeeping, was also destroyed in the fire. The church was rebuilt by the villagers in <span class="date">2005</span>.</p><br><br>
