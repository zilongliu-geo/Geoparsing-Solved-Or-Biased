  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hanover</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Plymouth County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 13,879 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The area of <span class="loc">Hanover</span> was first settled by English settlers in <span class="date">1649</span> when <span class="per">William Barstow</span>, a farmer, built a bridge along the <span class="loc">North River</span> at what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="per">Washington Street</span>. The land was the westernmost portion of the town of <span class="loc">Scituate</span>, and it would officially separate and be incorporated as a town <span class="date">June 14, 1727</span>. The name "Hanover" is probably a tribute to <span class="per">King George I</span>, the first Hanoverian <span class="per">King of Great Britain</span>. (While <span class="per">George I</span> died on <span class="date">June 11, 1727</span>, the reports would not have reached the colonies until after the town's incorporation.) Hanover's early industry revolved around farming, small mills and a shipbuilding area along the <span class="loc">North River</span>. Later industries would include tack factories and shoe factories along the smaller waterways in the town. The town was the site of the invention of the first tack-making machine, and making tacks and fireworks were among the industries of the later 19th century for <span class="loc">Hanover</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Hanover</span> is mostly residential. The Hanover Mall and other shops are located near the intersection of Routes 3 and 53. In <span class="date">2008</span> <span class="org">Hanover American Legion Post</span> 149 baseball team won the state title. In the <span class="date">Summer of 2012</span> - <span class="loc">Hanover</span> became home to the <span class="org">New England Football League</span> (NEFL)'s newest expansion, Semi-Professional Football Team - The South Shore Chiefs. Home games are played at <span class="org">Hanover High School</span>.</p><br><br>
