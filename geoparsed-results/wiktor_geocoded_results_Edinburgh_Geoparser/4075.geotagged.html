<p><span class="loc">Kew</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> is a small town in the <span class="loc">Mid North Coast</span> region of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> in the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council local government area. <span class="loc">Kew</span> is one of the communities that make up the <span class="loc">Camden Haven</span> <span class="loc">district of Port Macquarie-Hastings</span>. <span class="loc">Kew</span> is located at the intersection of Nancy Bird Walton Drive (the former Pacific Highway) and <span class="loc">Ocean Drive</span>, the road to the larger town of <span class="loc">Laurieton</span>. <span class="loc">Kew</span> has a visitor information centre, a pub, a post office, a small police station, a motel, a roadhouse and a general store.

Construction commenced in November 2007 and was completed in December 2009. The largest school in the district, <span class="loc">Camden Haven</span> High School, is located 2 km east of <span class="loc">Kew</span> on <span class="loc">Ocean Drive</span>. <span class="loc">Kew</span> is home to the Big Axe. Kew Bowling Club is located on <span class="loc">Camden Haven</span> Golf Course, 100 metres west of the Pacific Highway traffic lights. <span class="loc">Kew</span> is served by several daily coaches along the Pacific Highway, and three NSW TrainLink XPT services at Kendall railway station on the North Coast Line 2 km to the west.</p>
