<p>Chico Sometimes called "<span class="loc">Old Chico</span>" to distinguish it from the nearby Chico Hot springs Resort. Chico is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Park County</span>, <span class="loc">Montana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population of Chico was 15 as of 2010. Chico currently shares a postal ZIP code 59027 with nearby Emigrant. <span class="loc">Old Chico</span> or Chico City was established as a town in 1874 but had grown into a permanently populated community much earlier, making it one of <span class="loc">Montana</span>'s oldest surviving settlements. It is situated in the mouth of Emigrant Gulch, and sits at the foot of Mt. <span class="loc">Baldy</span>, which has an elevation of 3115 m / 10220 ft. The Chico post office was open from 1874 until 1919. Gold was discovered in the Chico area in 1863. Mining in the Curry Mining District was begun in the spring of 1894. During this period, miners working in the area lived in a settlement called <span class="loc">Yellowstone City</span>. Due to harassment by Crow Indians, <span class="loc">Yellowstone City</span> was abandoned by 1865. After <span class="loc">Yellowstone City</span>'s demise, a new settlement was built at Chico. The Chico townsite was closer to Emigrant Gulch and the mining activity. Chico's population in 1874 was 300. Eventually a school, general store and two boarding houses were built at the site. The town never had a saloon. As the threat from the Crow abated, houses were built further up Emigrant Gulch and closer to the mines. The St. Julian Mine was opened in 1887. Ore from the St. Julian assayed out at $360 in gold and $40 in silver per ton of ore. A ten stamp mill was built in the late 1890s and a 12 stamp mill in 1904. The 1904 mill also had a Blake Crusher and 6 Frue Venners.</p>
