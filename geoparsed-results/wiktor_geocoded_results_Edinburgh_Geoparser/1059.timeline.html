  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Portland</span> /ˈpɔːrtlənd/ is a city in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, and is the oldest European settlement in the state. It's also the main urban centre in the Shire of <span class="loc">Glenelg</span> and is located on <span class="loc">Portland Bay</span>. The bay was named in <span class="date">1800</span> by the British navigator <span class="per">James Grant</span>, who sailed in the <span class="per">Lady Nelson</span> along the Victorian coast. "I also distinguished the Bay by the name of <span class="loc">Portland Bay</span>, in honour of His Grace the <span class="per">Duke of Portland</span>," wrote <span class="per">Grant</span>. The bay, the only deep sea port between <span class="per">Adelaide</span> and <span class="per">Melbourne</span>, offers a sheltered anchorage against the often wild weather of <span class="loc">Bass Strait</span>. By the early 19th century, whalers and sealers were working the treacherous waters of <span class="loc">Bass Strait</span> and <span class="loc">Portland Bay</span> provided good shelter and fresh water which enabled them to establish the first white settlement in the area. Whaling captain <span class="per">William Dutton</span> is known to have been resident in the <span class="loc">Portland Bay</span> area when the <span class="per">Henty</span> clan arrived and is said to have provided seed potatoes for the <span class="per">Henty</span> garden. In <span class="date">1834</span>, <span class="per">Edward Henty</span> and his family, who had migrated from <span class="loc">England</span> to Western <span class="loc">Australia</span> in <span class="date">1829</span>, then moved to <span class="loc">Van Diemen's Land</span>, ferried some of their stock across the Strait in search of the fine grazing land of the Western District.</p><br><br>
