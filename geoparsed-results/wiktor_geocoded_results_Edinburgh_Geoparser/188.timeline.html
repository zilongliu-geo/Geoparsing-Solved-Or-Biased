  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Rafael</span> is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira. It is one of the farthest municipalities of the Lempira department of <span class="loc">Honduras</span>. The best way to get to the municipality capital is via <span class="per">Santa B치rbara</span> department, passing by <span class="loc">El Nispero</span> and <span class="loc">San Jeronimo</span> municipalities of this department. In the case of <span class="loc">San Rafael</span>, the cross-breed take the 80% of the population, with many people showing white skin. The rest is occupied for Indian descendants. Population:For the <span class="date">year 2001</span> this municipality had 10,468 people, this figure was the base for an estimate, and the result for <span class="date">2015</span> is the figure of 13,769 people. Villages: 9 Settlements: 53 It takes about 2.5 hours to get there from the city of <span class="loc">Santa Barbara</span> and the road is in much better conditions. The other way is via the <span class="loc">city of Gracias</span>, and it is about 60 km from it. It is necessary to take the common road to <span class="loc">La Iguala</span> and La Uni칩n, first passing by the "Puca" mountain and then some other steep mountains. The main disadvantage of this 2nd way is that the road needs to be repaired.The views of the coffee plantations are just awesome, and so are the rest of the landscapes provided by the big and steep mountains mentioned earlier in this article, this includes the views to <span class="per">Santa B치rbara</span> department. The hospitality of its inhabitants is another feature, a proof of this is the sign that says: "En <span class="loc">San Rafael</span>, Nadie es Extra침o", meaning: "In <span class="loc">San Rafael</span>, Nobody is a stranger". There are some groceries stores and one hostel, but it is not a recommendable place to stay in.</p><br><br>
