  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Lunenburg County</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, at the navigable limit of the <span class="per">LaHave</span> River. It is the largest town in the <span class="loc">South Shore</span> region. While a good deal of the <span class="loc">South Shore</span>'s economy is reliant on tourism, <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> is a commercial and industrial centre that attracts far fewer visitors. One of the primary employers is a <span class="org">Michelin</span> tire plant. The first European settlers of the town came from the nearby settlements of <span class="loc">Lunenburg</span>, <span class="per">Riverport</span> and <span class="per">LaHave</span>, constructing the first house in <span class="date">1812</span> on the west bank of the river (although the first house in what is <span class="date">now</span> the town was built before <span class="date">1803</span>). The town was named after the bridge built over the <span class="per">LaHave</span> River. The commissioners for the construction of the first bridge were three brothers-in-law, <span class="per">George Heb</span>, <span class="per">John Weil</span> and <span class="per">John Vienot</span>. The town was incorporated on <span class="date">February 13, 1899</span>, shortly after suffering a fire which devastated the entire downtown area. For much of the 20th century, the town's economy depended on forestry and a large wood mill in the center of town, as well as the <span class="org">Nova Scotia Central Railway</span> and later the <span class="loc">Halifax</span> and Southwestern Railway, for which the town acted as a central hub for the <span class="loc">South Shore</span> region. The <span class="org">Acadia Marine Engine Company</span> was based in <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> and it made fishboat and coaster engines.</p><br><br>
