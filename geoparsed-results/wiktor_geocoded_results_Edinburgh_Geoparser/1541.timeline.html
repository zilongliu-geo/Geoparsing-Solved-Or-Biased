  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Elizabeth is an outer northern suburb of Adelaide, <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is located in the <span class="loc">City of Playford</span>. Before <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, most of the area surrounding <span class="date">today</span>'s suburb of Elizabeth was farming land. After the end of the Second World War with its shortage of materials, the state government decided that <span class="loc">South Australia</span> needed to grow and become industrialised. A "satellite city" was planned for the Elizabeth area, and the South <span class="org">Australian Housing Trust</span> initiated a housing development program in the area, with a purchase of 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres) of rural land between the older "country towns" (<span class="date">now</span> Adelaide suburbs) of <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> and <span class="loc">Smithfield</span>. The Suburb of Elizabeth was formed on <span class="date">16 November 1955</span>, being named after <span class="per">Queen Elizabeth II</span>, who visited the suburb in <span class="date">1963</span>. As well as the <span class="loc">Town Centre</span>, originally with open air shopping malls there was a theatre (named "The Octagon"), Elizabeth is the seat of the <span class="loc">Playford</span> local government area and thus acts as a central business district for the surrounding suburbs. It lies between the <span class="org">Gawler Central</span> railway line and Main North Road. DSTO <span class="loc">Edinburgh</span> is located to the west of Elizabeth.</p><br><br>
