<p><span class="loc">Bathurst</span> is about 12 kilometres inland from <span class="loc">Port Alfred</span>, on the R67, in the Eastern Cape province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. Its chief claim to fame is that it was the early administrative centre established by the British Government for the 1820 British Settlers who were sent to the district as a buffer between the <span class="loc">Cape Colony</span> and the Xhosa pastoralists who were migrating southwards and westwards along the coast. <span class="loc">Bathurst</span> is now part of the Ndlambe Local Municipality in the Sarah Baartman District Municipality of the Eastern Cape. Many of the original settler houses and other buildings have been preserved, and there remains much of the look and feel of an English village of the early 19th Century. The Pig and Whistle Inn, at the heart of the village, is reputedly the oldest extant pub in the country. Built in 1821 by Thomas Hartley, a blacksmith who came from <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span> with the Settlers. Later accommodation was added and it became known as the Bathurst Inn. Legend has it that it was nicknamed "The Pig &amp; Whistle" by the men at the nearby 43 Air School in WWII.</p>
