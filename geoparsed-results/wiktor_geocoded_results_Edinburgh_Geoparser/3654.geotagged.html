<p><span class="loc">Caro</span> is a city in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Tuscola County</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,229 at the 2010 census and 4,145 at the 2000 census (an increase of about 2%). <span class="loc">Caro</span> is located northeast of Flint and east of <span class="loc">Saginaw</span> in <span class="loc">Michigan</span>'s Thumb region. <span class="loc">Caro</span> began as a logging camp on the <span class="loc">Cass River</span> established by Curtis Emerson in 1847. Later Samuel P. Sherman, who purchased 63 acres (250,000 m2) in the north half of the northwest quarter of section 3 in Indianfields Township on September 8, 1852. Prior to this, only two land sales had been recorded, both for lumbering or speculative purposes. His son, William E. Sherman, had worked in the lumber industry nearby on the <span class="loc">Cass River</span> for some time prior to 1852 and William's favorable report persuaded his father to visit in 1851 and afterwards purchased several tracts of land in addition to his initial purchase. In the 1856-57 session of the <span class="loc">Michigan</span> Legislature, construction of a road was authorized from <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span> in <span class="loc">Saginaw County</span> northeast to <span class="loc">Forestville</span> in <span class="loc">Sanilac County</span>, with a route that would pass through what is now <span class="loc">Caro</span>. Once the road was cleared, commercial interests began to locate here. Melvin Gibbs, who had been keeping a hotel in an old log house, in 1858 put up a new frame building, known as the Gibbs House. In 1859, William E. Sherman built another hotel, which he named the Centerville House, based on the location being near the center of the county. The name <span class="loc">Centerville</span> became associated with the developing community.</p>
