<p>Milton is a city in <span class="loc">Rock County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,546 at the 2010 census. The city was formed as a result of the 1967 merger of the villages of Milton and Milton Junction. In November of that year, ballots were cast by 1,093 voters from both villages (Milton: 515 to 47 in favor of the merge; <span class="loc">Milton</span> Junction: 322 to 201 in favor of the merge), and the referendum to merge the two was approved by 77%. Originally named Prairie du Lac, Milton was settled in 1838 by Joseph Goodrich, who built an inn, the Milton House, at the intersection of two trade routes. The Milton House is today one of the oldest poured grout structures in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. A noted abolitionist, Goodrich is known to have aided fugitive slaves escape to freedom via the Underground Railroad. It is believed that Milton is named after poet John Milton, author of "Paradise Lost", after a settler remarked that the town was his "Paradise Regained" after leaving his previous home, which he thought of as a paradise lost.</p>
