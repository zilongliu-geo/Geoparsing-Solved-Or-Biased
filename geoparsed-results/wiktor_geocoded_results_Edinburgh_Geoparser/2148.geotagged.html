<p><span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is a small town in the foothills of the Victorian Alps in the Australian state of Victoria. It is approximately 180 kilometres (110 mi) north-east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span> by road. The population of <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> was 4,360 as at the 2011 census. <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> is the seat of the <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> local government area. <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> was formerly heavily dependent on farming and logging, but is now a tourist-centre. It is the support town for the large <span class="loc">Australia</span> ski resort <span class="loc">Mount Buller</span>. It is associated with the high country tradition of alpine grazing, celebrated in the film made around <span class="loc">Mansfield</span>, near the now famous Craigs Hut, called The Man from <span class="loc">Snowy River</span> (based on a poem by Banjo Paterson). <span class="loc">Mansfield</span>, originally known as <span class="loc">Mount Battery</span>, was at the boundary of a number of pastoral runs, and a township was surveyed in 1851 and named after <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> in <span class="loc">Nottinghamshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Settlement came after the discovery of gold nearby and the Post Office opened on 1 January 1858. The railway to <span class="loc">Mansfield</span> arrived in the town from <span class="loc">Tallarook</span> in 1891, being closed on November 18, 1978. The last passenger service was on May 28, 1977.</p>
