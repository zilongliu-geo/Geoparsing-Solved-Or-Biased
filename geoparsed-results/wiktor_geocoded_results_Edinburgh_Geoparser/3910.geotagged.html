<p>Cairo /ˈkeɪ.roʊ/ is a city in <span class="loc">Grady County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 9,607. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Grady County</span>. <span class="loc">Cairo</span> was founded in 1835. It was incorporated as a town in 1870 and as a city in 1906. In 1905, <span class="loc">Cairo</span> was designated seat of the newly formed <span class="loc">Grady County</span>. The city was named after <span class="loc">Cairo</span>, the capital of <span class="loc">Egypt</span>. Although <span class="loc">Cairo</span> is nicknamed the "Syrup City" it has no relationship with the Karo brand of syrup, which is pronounced like the city's name. Rather, <span class="loc">Cairo</span> earned its nickname by producing cane syrup from the early 1900s through the late 1990s. Of the several companies that produced cane syrup, Roddenbery's was the best known. Reflecting this "syrup" heritage, the Cairo High School football team is nicknamed the Syrupmakers, and the school mascot is the agriculturally based sugar cane farmer/syrupmaker similar to the Cornhusker and Boilermaker. According to local tradition, this began during a rainy football game, when the players wore donated ponchos with "Roddenbery Syrup" printed on them. The most widely accepted tradition and the one with the most supportive evidence claims that a newspaper reporter referred to the Cairo Tigers in print as "the syrupmakers from <span class="loc">Cairo</span>."</p>
