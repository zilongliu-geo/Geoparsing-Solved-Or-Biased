<p><span class="loc">Miami</span> (/maɪˈæmə/ my-AM-ə) is a city in and county seat of <span class="loc">Ottawa County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 13,570, a decline of one percent from 13,704 at the 2000 census. The city is named after the Miami tribe. <span class="loc">Miami</span> is the capital of the Miami Tribe of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Modoc Tribe</span> of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Ottawa Tribe</span> of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Peoria Tribe</span> of Indians and Shawnee Tribe. <span class="loc">Miami</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Joplin</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> metropolitan area. <span class="loc">Miami</span> began in a rather unique way, compared to other towns in Indian Territory. The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture quotes Velma Nieberding, author of the History of <span class="loc">Ottawa County</span>, as saying, "... it was settled in a business-like way by men of vision who looked into the future and saw possibilities. It didn't just grow. It was carefully planned." W.C. Lykins is credited as the driving force for the creation of the town. He petitioned the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Congress to pass legislation on March 3, 1891 to establish the town. He met with Thomas F. Richardville, chief of the Miami tribe, who agreed to meet in turn with the U.S. Indian Commission and the <span class="loc">Ottawa</span> tribe. That meeting resulted in Congress authorizing the secretary of the <span class="loc">Interior Department</span> to approve the townsite purchase from the Ottawas. Lykins, Richardville and Manford <span class="loc">Pooler</span>, chief of the <span class="loc">Ottawa</span>, are identified in historical accounts as "fathers of <span class="loc">Miami</span>."</p>
