<p><span class="loc">Dongxing</span> (simplified Chinese: 东兴; traditional Chinese: 東興; pinyin: Dōngxīng,Vietnamese: Đông Hưng) is a county-level <span class="loc">city of Guangxi</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>, on the border with <span class="loc">Mong Cai</span> of <span class="loc">Vietnam</span>. In the summer of 1978, the Friendship Bridge that connected <span class="loc">Dongxing</span> and <span class="loc">Mong Cai</span> in <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> became a makeshift refugee camp for thousands of ethnic Chinese fleeing <span class="loc">Vietnam</span>. Ethnic Chinese had lived in Northern <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> for decades under Communist rule, but after the North and South unified in April 1975, the Communist government saw the Chinese in the South, many of whom were successful capitalists, as a threat to their socialist system and began persecuting the Chinese, forcing many to flee by boat. This became known as the Boat People. The Chinese in the North, who were mostly farmers, were also persecuted as part of an nationwide 'ethnic cleansing' that <span class="loc">Hanoi</span> instituted. This caused an exodus of over 250,000 Chinese from <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> to flee to <span class="loc">China</span>, mainly to <span class="loc">Dongxing</span>. <span class="loc">Dongxing</span> has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen <span class="loc">Cwa</span>), with mild to warm winters and long, hot (but not especially) summers, and very humid conditions year-round. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) in January to 28.0 °C (82.4 °F) in July, while extremes have ranged from 3.3 to 37.1 °C (38 to 99 °F). Rain is both the heaviest and most frequent from June to September, when 70% of the annual rainfall also occurs. This is in contrast to the autumn and winter months, where only 30 to 50 millimetres (1.2 to 2.0 in) of rain falls per month.</p>
