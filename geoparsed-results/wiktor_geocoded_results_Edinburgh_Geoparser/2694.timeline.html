  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Winchester</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Lewis County</span>, <span class="loc">Idaho</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Camas Prairie</span> in the north central part of the state. The population was 340 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, up from 308 in <span class="date">2000</span>. <span class="loc">Winchester</span> is within the <span class="loc">Nez Perce Indian Reservation</span>, and similar to the opening of lands in <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> government opened the reservation for white settlement in <span class="date">November 1895</span>. The proclamation had been signed <span class="date">less than two weeks earlier</span> by <span class="per">President Cleveland</span>. The city was named in <span class="date">1900</span> during a meeting to establish a school district. While considering the possibilities, an individual looked at the stack of Winchester rifles at the door and suggested the name, which was approved. The sawmill closed in <span class="date">May 1965</span> after the mature timber in the area had been cut. The mill was operated by Boise Cascade for its final <span class="date">five years</span>; its closure followed a fire which destroyed much of downtown <span class="loc">Winchester</span> in <span class="date">November 1964</span>. A half mile (1 km) outside of town is Winchester Lake State Park, planned in <span class="date">1966</span> and established in <span class="date">1969</span>. Originally it was a mill pond, created in <span class="date">1910</span> by damming <span class="loc">Lapwai Creek</span>. Water quality issues at the lake were addressed with the installation of aeration units in <span class="date">2002</span>.</p><br><br>
