  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Bury</span> is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">District of Chichester</span> in <span class="loc">West Sussex</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> located eight kilometres (5 miles) south west of <span class="loc">Pulborough</span> on the A29 road. The villages of <span class="org">Bury</span> and nearby <span class="loc">West Burton</span> are sited at the foot of the scarp slope of the <span class="loc">South Downs</span>, where springs from the chalk strata provided a constant supply of clean water. The <span class="loc">Anglican parish</span> church of <span class="loc">St. John</span> the Evangelist lies east of the village centre on the west bank of the <span class="loc">River Arun</span>. The church is dominated by <span class="date">a 12th Century</span> tower with a cedar-shingled spire. There was formerly a passenger ferry by rowing boat to <span class="loc">Amberley</span> on the east bank. There are many old houses in the village and a large modern village hall. There is one pub, the <span class="per">Squire</span> and <span class="per">Horse</span>, beside the A29 road. <span class="org">Bury House</span> close to the pub was the home of author <span class="per">John Galsworthy</span> for the final <span class="date">seven years</span> of his life. <span class="loc">West Burton</span>, across some fields to the west, is smaller than <span class="org">Bury</span> and has many interesting old houses. The parish has a land area of 1315 hectares (3247 acres). In the <span class="date">2001</span> census 691 people lived in 264 households, of whom 319 were economically active.</p><br><br>
