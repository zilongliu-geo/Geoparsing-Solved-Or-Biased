  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Antioch</span> on the Orontes (/ˈæntiˌɒk/; also Syrian <span class="loc">Antioch</span>) was an ancient Greek - Roman city on the eastern side of the <span class="loc">Orontes River</span>. Its ruins lie near the modern <span class="loc">city of Antakya</span>, <span class="loc">Turkey</span>, and lends the modern city its name. <span class="loc">Antioch</span> was founded near the end of the <span class="date">4th century BC</span> by Seleucus <span class="per">I Nicator</span>, one of Alexander the Great's generals. The city's geographical, military, and economic location benefited its occupants, particularly such features as the spice trade, the Silk Road, and the <span class="org">Persian Royal Road</span>. It eventually rivaled Alexandria as the chief city of the Near East. It was also the main center of <span class="per">Hellenistic Judaism</span> at the end of the Second Temple period. Most of the urban development of <span class="loc">Antioch</span> was done during the Roman empire, when the city was one of the most important in the eastern Mediterranean area of Rome's dominions. <span class="loc">Antioch</span> was called "the cradle of Christianity" as a result of its longevity and the pivotal role that it played in the emergence of both Hellenistic <span class="per">Judaism</span> and <span class="per">Early</span> Christianity. The Christian New Testament asserts that the name Christian first emerged in <span class="loc">Antioch</span>. It was one of the four cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, and its residents were known as Antiochenes. The city was once a great metropolis of half a million people during Augustan times, but it declined to insignificance during the Middle Ages because of warfare, repeated earthquakes, and a change in trade routes, which no longer passed through <span class="loc">Antioch</span> from the far east, following the Mongol conquests.</p><br><br>
