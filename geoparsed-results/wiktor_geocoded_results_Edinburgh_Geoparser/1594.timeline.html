  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Newton, officially the Town of Newton, is an incorporated municipality located in <span class="loc">Sussex County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is one of fifteen municipalities in the state organized as a town, and the municipal government operates under a council-manager structure provided by the Faulkner Act, or Optional Municipal Charter Law. As the location of the county's administrative offices and court system, Newton is the county seat of <span class="loc">Sussex County</span>. Newton was incorporated by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on <span class="date">April 11, 1864</span>, from portions of Newton Township, which was also partitioned to create <span class="loc">Andover Township</span> and <span class="loc">Hampton Township</span>, and was then dissolved. Additional land was acquired from <span class="loc">Andover Township</span> in <span class="date">1869</span> and <span class="date">1927</span>, and from <span class="loc">Fredon</span> Township in <span class="date">1920</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the town's population was 7,997, reflecting a decline of 247 (-3.0%) from the 8,244 counted in the <span class="date">2000</span> Census, which had in turn increased by 723 (+9.6%) from the 7,521 counted in the <span class="date">1990</span> Census. Newton is located near the headwaters of the east branch of the <span class="loc">Paulins Kill</span>, a 41.6-mile (66.9 km) tributary of the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River. In <span class="date">October 1715</span>, Colonial surveyor <span class="per">Samuel Green</span> plotted a tract of 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) at the head of the <span class="loc">Paulins Kill</span>, then known as the <span class="loc">Tohokenetcunck</span> River, on behalf of <span class="loc">William Penn</span>. This tract, which would not be settled for approximately 30â€“<span class="date">35 years</span>, was part of the survey and division of the Last Indian Purchase by the West Jersey Board of Proprietors. At the time of Green's survey, northwestern <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> was populated with bands of the Munsee, the northern branch of the Lenni Lenape peoples.</p><br><br>
