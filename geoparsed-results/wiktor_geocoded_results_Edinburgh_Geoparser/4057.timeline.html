  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bexley</span> is a suburb in southern <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, in the state of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. <span class="loc">Bexley</span> is located 14 kilometres south of the <span class="loc">Sydney</span> central business district, in the local government area of the <span class="loc">City of Rockdale</span> and is part of the <span class="loc">St George</span> area. <span class="per">James Chandler</span> named the suburb after his birthplace, <span class="loc">Bexley</span> in the south-east of <span class="loc">London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. <span class="per">Chandler</span> bought <span class="per">Sylvester</span>â€™s Farm in <span class="date">1822</span>, from <span class="per">Thomas Sylvester</span> who had been granted the land <span class="date">about ten years earlier</span>. <span class="date">That year</span> he was also granted 1,200 acres (490 ha) of land which stretched from what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Bexley</span> North to most of <span class="loc">Rockdale</span> and <span class="loc">Kogarah</span>. The estate was heavily timbered and a track through the centre, used by timber-getters, is <span class="date">today</span> called Forest Road. <span class="per">Queen Victoria</span> Street, <span class="loc">Gladstone Street</span> and <span class="loc">Beaconsfield Street</span> commemorate the British Queen and two of her prime ministers. <span class="per">Chandler</span> was a well-respected citizen and became known locally as the Squire of <span class="loc">Bexley</span>, but his property attracted bushrangers, escaped convicts and other odd types. <span class="per">Chandler</span> was not happy with his ill-assortment of neighbours and sold the land to <span class="per">Charles Thompson</span> in <span class="date">1836</span>. Later it was bought by <span class="per">Charles Tindell</span>, who began subdividing the land by <span class="date">1856</span> for home sites.</p><br><br>
