  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Belmont</span> is a formerly separate village in <span class="loc">County Durham</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> that is <span class="date">now</span> incorporated into, and a suburb of, <span class="loc">Durham City</span>. It was initially a coal mining village and is situated to the north-east of the city centre, just east of the A1(M) motorway. The village forms the nucleus of the <span class="loc">Belmont parish</span>. The flats at Minster Court (at the south side of Buckinghamshire Road) were built on land formerly belonging to <span class="loc">Ravensflatt</span> Farm. The secondary school located here <span class="org">Belmont Community School</span> was originally planned to be turned into an academy. However, a large portion of the staff protested against this, causing the school to stay the same. The Church was bombed in the Second World War because the German pilots mistook it for <span class="loc">Durham</span> Cathedral (in the fog). The village is on the bus route from <span class="loc">Sunderland</span> to <span class="loc">Durham</span>. There are three pubs, two school sites and a church, <span class="per">St. Mary</span> Magdelene. Since <span class="date">1994</span> <span class="loc">Belmont</span> has been the site of New <span class="loc">Ferens</span> Park, home of <span class="org">Unibond League</span> (and former Football League) club <span class="loc">Durham City</span> AFC. It also contains <span class="loc">Chevely</span> Park shopping centre which includes shops such as Spar, Cooplands and other food establishments.</p><br><br>
