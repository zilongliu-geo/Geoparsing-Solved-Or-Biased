The administrative centre is the village of Langevåg.

The municipality encompasses the island of <span class="loc">Sula</span> and the many small surrounding islets. Originally, most of the island of <span class="loc">Sula</span> was part of the old Borgund Municipality and the small southwestern part of the island was part of Ulstein Municipality (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 July 1958, the southwestern part of <span class="loc">Sula</span> island was transferred to Borgund Municipality. In 1968, Borgund Municipality (including all of the island of <span class="loc">Sula</span>) was merged with the town of Ålesund to form the large Ålesund Municipality. On 1 January 1977, the entire island of <span class="loc">Sula</span> and the many small islets around it were separated from Ålesund Municipality to become a separate municipality. The initial population of the new Sula Municipality was 6,302.</p>
