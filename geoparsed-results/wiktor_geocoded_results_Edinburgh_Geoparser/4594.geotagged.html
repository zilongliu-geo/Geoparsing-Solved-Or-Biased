<p><span class="loc">Butler County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 20,947. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. Its name is in honor of Captain William Butler, who was born in Virginia and fought in the Creek War, and who was killed in May 1818. <span class="loc">Butler County</span> was formed from <span class="loc">Conecuh County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, and <span class="loc">Monroe County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, by an act passed December 13, 1819, by the Legislature while in session at <span class="loc">Huntsville</span>. This was the first session of the Legislature of <span class="loc">Alabama</span> as a State. The name of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> was first proposed for this county, but was changed on the passage of the bill to Butler, in honor of Captain William Butler. The exact date of the first settlement made by white people in the limits of <span class="loc">Butler County</span> is not exactly known. Some records have it as early as 1814, but the earliest settler of no dispute is James K. Benson, who settled in the Flat in 1815, and built the first house ever erected in <span class="loc">Butler County</span>. It was built near where <span class="loc">Pine Flat</span> Methodist Church now stands, and was made of logs. Shortly after, William Ogly and John Dickerson came with their families and made a settlement on the Federal Road, about three miles (5 km) south of where <span class="loc">Fort Dale</span> was later erected. In the fall of 1816, a party from the state of <span class="loc">Georgia</span> came to settle in <span class="loc">Pine Flat</span>, including <span class="loc">Thomas Hill</span>, Warren A. Thompson, Captain John Watts, and Benjamin Hill. In 1817, many more settlers arrived, since the hardest work had already been done by these brave original souls.</p>
