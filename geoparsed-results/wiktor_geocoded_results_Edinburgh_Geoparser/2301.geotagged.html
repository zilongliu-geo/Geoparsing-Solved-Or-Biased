<p>Billings is a town in northwest <span class="loc">Noble County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 509 at the 2010 census, an increase from 436 at the 2000 census. It was the childhood home of <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span> governor Henry Bellmon. Billings was called "<span class="loc">White Rock</span>", when it was founded in 1893, at the time of the Cherokee Strip Land Run. It was then 3 miles (4.8 km) east and 2 miles (3.2 km)south of its present site. Its economy was based on agriculture in the surrounding area. The <span class="loc">Enid</span> and Tonkawa Railway (acquired by the <span class="loc">Chicago</span>, <span class="loc">Rock Island</span> and Pacific Railway in 1900) built a spur line out from <span class="loc">North Enid</span> in 1899. The railroad, however, did not go through <span class="loc">White Rock</span>, so the residents soon moved to the present location. The new town opened October 23, 1899. The town was renamed for M. O. Billings, a director of the Billings Town Company. Billings is located at 36°32′06″N 97°25′46″W. It is 35 miles (56 km) from <span class="loc">Enid</span> and <span class="loc">Ponca City</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2), all of it land.</p>
