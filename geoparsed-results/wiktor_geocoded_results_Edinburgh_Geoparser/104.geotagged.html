<p>Santiago is a fourth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Agusan del Norte</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 20,955 people. Santiago is politically subdivided into 9 barangays. <span class="loc">Curva</span> <span class="loc">Jagupit</span> <span class="loc">Lapaz</span> <span class="loc">Poblacion</span> I San Isidro Tagbuyacan Estanislao Morgado <span class="loc">Poblacion</span> II Pangaylan IP In the later part of 1898, a group of natives fleeing from the municipality of <span class="loc">Jabonga</span> settled in a place recognized by the municipality of <span class="loc">Cabadbaran</span> as barrio Santiago, However, in 1924 the <span class="loc">Aciga</span> River swelled its banks, destroying all properties, crops and animals along it. This forced the inhabitants of Santiago, <span class="loc">Cabadbaran</span> to transfer to barrio <span class="loc">Jagupit</span>. In 1936, the same <span class="loc">Aciga</span> River wrought damage which made the inhabitants decide to transfer at the foot of the hill, particularly at Sitio Paypay, which was inhabited by two groups of natives-the Manobos and the Mamanwas, then. The construction of the national highway, which passes thru sitio <span class="loc">Paypay</span>, lured more people to settle in the place. Towards the end of 1936, thru a bill sponsored by the late Congressman Calo, the name <span class="loc">Paypay</span> was changed to Santiago in honor of Senior Santiago or <span class="loc">Saint James</span>.</p>
