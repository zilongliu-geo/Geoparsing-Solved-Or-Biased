  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Clifton</span> is an affluent suburb of Cape Town, <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It is an exclusive residential area and is home to some of the most expensive real estate in <span class="loc">South Africa</span>, with dwellings nestled on cliffs that have sweeping views of the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>. <span class="per">Clifton</span> was rated as one of the Top Ten Beaches by the cable and satellite television network Discovery Travel Channel in <span class="date">2003</span> and <span class="date">2004</span> and has received Blue Flag status. In <span class="date">2005</span> and <span class="date">2006</span> it was rated by Forbes.com at number 8 in the Top 10 Topless beaches in the World. <span class="per">Clifton</span> is neighbored by the suburbs of <span class="loc">Camps Bay</span> and <span class="loc">Bantry Bay</span>. The area has a set of 4 beaches which are frequently used destinations for both locals and tourists. The beaches, which are named from 1st to 4th, are separated by falls of granite boulders and have almost pure white granitic sand. The four beaches of <span class="per">Clifton</span> are one of the few areas well protected from the notorious south-easterly wind, which has a great deal to do with its popularity with bathers. A fifth beach, before <span class="per">First Beach</span>, called <span class="per">Moses Beach</span> (so-called because of the papyrus plants that grow along it), appears and disappears as the sand is washed in and out with the <span class="date">seasons</span>. The water, although chilly (12–16 °C), plays host to many watersports, mostly surfing, both board and body. The strongest surf is at First, diminishing to Fourth, where it is the weakest. Fourth beach (to the South), is the most populated and glamorous venue; attracting families. Yachts anchor off Fourth beach, especially on <span class="date">summer</span> <span class="date">weekends</span>. Third beach is known as a venue for gay culture. Second beach is populated by students playing beach volleyball and beach bats. First beach, to the north, the smallest beach, draws a mixed crowd of locals and surfers. <span class="per">Clifton Beach</span> was noted as one of Discovery.com's best beaches by region.</p><br><br>
