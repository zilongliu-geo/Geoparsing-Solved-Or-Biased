  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Douglas County</span> (county code DG) is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the county population was 110,826, making it the fifth-most populous county in <span class="loc">Kansas</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat and most populous city is Lawrence. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> comprises the Lawrence, <span class="loc">KS Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, which is also included in the Kansas City-Overland <span class="loc">Park-Kansas City</span>, MO-KS Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> was opened for settlement on <span class="date">May 15, 1854</span>, and was named for <span class="per">Stephen A. Douglas</span>, a senator from <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. The county was practically at the center of the Bleeding Kansas <span class="date">years</span> as leaders in <span class="loc">Lecompton</span>, the territorial capital, wanted <span class="loc">Kansas</span> to be a slave state and leaders in Lawrence wanted <span class="loc">Kansas</span> to be a free state. Because of this, multiple events took place, including the drafting of the Lecompton Constitution admitting <span class="loc">Kansas</span> as a slave state, the sacking of Lawrence, and the Battle of <span class="loc">Black Jack</span>. The first railroad in <span class="loc">Douglas County</span>, the <span class="org">Union</span> Pacific, was built through that territory in <span class="date">1864</span>. <span class="loc">Douglas County</span> is currently served by county commissioners <span class="per">Mike Gaughan</span>, <span class="per">Nancy Thellman</span>, and <span class="per">Jim Flory</span>.</p><br><br>
