    "We've been getting donations throughout the year and discarding throughout the year, and we had a book drive about a month ago," library staffer Mary Middleton said.

    The books that don't sell by the time the event ends Saturday will either be set out on tables for students to take for free or will be sent to an online used book distributor for sale, she said.
