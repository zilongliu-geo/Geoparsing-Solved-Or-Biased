<p><span class="loc">Trinidad</span> (Chetco-Tolowa: tvm-sray-me’; <span class="loc">Karuk</span>: áas uyâahitihirak; Yurok: Chuerew; <span class="loc">Wiyot</span>: Da'guchwayawik, "land is curved") is a seaside city in <span class="loc">Humboldt County</span>, located on the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> 8 miles (13 km) north of the Arcata-Eureka Airport and 15 miles (24 km) north of the college town of Arcata. Situated at an elevation of 174 feet (53 m) above its own <span class="loc">North Coast</span> harbor, <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> is one of California's smallest incorporated cities by population (367 residents in 2010, up from 311 residents in 2000). <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> is noted for its spectacular coastline with ten public beaches and offshore rocks, part of the California Coastal National Monument, of which <span class="loc">Trinidad</span> is a Gateway City. Fishing operations related to Trinidad Harbor are vital to both local tourism and commercial fishery interests in the region. Before 1700 AD, Yurok people established the village of <span class="loc">Tsurai</span> on bluffs overlooking <span class="loc">Trinidad Bay</span>. The first European sighting of Trinidad Harbor was by the Manila galleon captain Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeño, who did not make landfall. The next visit was by Bruno de Heceta and <span class="loc">Juan Francisco</span> de la Bodega y Quadra of the Spanish Navy. Their two ships anchored in <span class="loc">Trinidad Bay</span> on June 9, 1775. On 11 June, which was Trinity Sunday, a formal act of possession was conducted. At the place where a wooden cross was erected stands a carved stone cross bearing the inscription. Carolus III Dei G. Hyspaniorum Rex., in the name of King Carlos of <span class="loc">Spain</span>. The area was named "la <span class="loc">Santisima Trinidad</span>".</p>
