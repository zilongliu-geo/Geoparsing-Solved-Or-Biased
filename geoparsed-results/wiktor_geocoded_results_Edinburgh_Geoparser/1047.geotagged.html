<p>Marion is a city in <span class="loc">Marion County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,042 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Marion County</span>. It is named for Francis Marion, a Brigadier General from <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> in the American Revolutionary War. The Marion High School, <span class="loc">Marion County</span> <span class="loc">Court House</span>, Marion County Library, Marion County Museum and Marion Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Some sixty years after the first permanent settlement in <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, a group of English settlers sent out by the Lords Proprietors landed in <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> and moved up the <span class="loc">Pee Dee River</span> to the junction of the <span class="loc">Little Pee Dee River</span> about half way between <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> and the present town of Marion. Among these families were Brittons, Davis, Flaglers, Giles, Graves and Tyler. At about the same time, and maybe on the same ship from <span class="loc">England</span>, came Captain John Godbold, a retired English sea captain. He moved farther up the Big <span class="loc">Pee Dee</span> and settled on <span class="loc">Catfish Creek</span>. The creek is southwest of and very near to the present city limits of Marion.</p>
