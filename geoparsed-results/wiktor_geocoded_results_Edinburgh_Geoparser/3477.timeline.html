  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Hudson is a city in St. <span class="loc">Croix County</span>, <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> census, its population was 12,719. It is part of the Minneapolis–St. <span class="loc">Paul Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area (MSA). The village of <span class="loc">North Hudson</span> is located directly to the north of Hudson. Hudson was settled in the <span class="date">summer of 1840</span> by <span class="per">Louis Massey</span> and his brother in-law, <span class="per">Peter Bouchea</span>. <span class="per">William Steets</span> arrived at about the same time. Later that same year, <span class="per">Joseph Sauperson</span> (commonly known as <span class="per">Joe LaGrue</span>) took up residence. These four are considered Hudson's original inhabitants. <span class="per">Massey</span> and <span class="per">Bouchea</span> settled at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Willow River</span>, near the present-day First and St. Croix Streets. They had been part of the group who lived for some time along the river below Fort Snelling, which appears on some old maps as "<span class="per">Massey</span>'s Landing". The 1840s saw a few settlers making their appearance here — Captain <span class="per">John Page</span>, the <span class="org">Nobles brothers</span>, <span class="per">Dr. Philip Aldrich</span>, Ammah <span class="per">Andrews, Moses</span> <span class="loc">Perrin</span>, Colonel <span class="per">James Hughes</span>, <span class="per">Daniel Anderson</span>, and others.</p><br><br>
