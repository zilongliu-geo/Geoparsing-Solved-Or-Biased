<p><span class="loc">Yulin</span> (Chinese: 榆林; pinyin: Yúlín) is a prefecture-level city in the <span class="loc">Shanbei region</span> of <span class="loc">Shaanxi province</span>, <span class="loc">China</span>, bordering <span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Shanxi</span> to the east, and Ningxia to the west. It has an administrative area of 43,578 km2 (16,826 sq mi) and a population of 3,380,000. <span class="loc">Yulin</span> is the northernmost prefecture-level <span class="loc">city of Shaanxi</span>, and borders <span class="loc">Ordos City</span> (<span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span>) to the north, <span class="loc">Xinzhou</span> and Lüliang (Shanxi) to the east, <span class="loc">Yan</span><span class="loc">'</span><span class="loc">an</span> to the south, and <span class="loc">Wuzhong</span> (Ningxia) to the west. To the north and northwest of the city lies the <span class="loc">Ordos Desert</span>, though the countryside is very green due to the many small shrubs which have been planted to slow the process of desertification. The city is based in a valley which extends north-south, which rises to a very large vantage point to the north east, where a spectacular view of the west and northwest is seen. Lake Hongjiannao lies on the border of <span class="loc">Yulin</span> and <span class="loc">Ordos City</span>, <span class="loc">Inner Mongolia</span> (39°06′N, 109°53′E). It is <span class="loc">China</span>'s largest "desert freshwater lake". The lake is relatively recent, formed around 1929 due to increased rainfall in the early 20th century; before, the basin was a wetland. The lake is supplied by four rivers, but there is no outflow. When its surface area was about 60 km2 (23 sq mi), its maximum depth was 10.5 m (34 ft) and the average depth 8.2 m (27 ft). However, the lake has been shrinking sharply over the past decade, to 32 km2 (12 sq mi) at the present. The shrinking has been attributed to reservoir construction, mining, and agricultural irrigation.</p>
