  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">San Marcos</span> is a town and municipality, in <span class="loc">Jalisco</span> in central-western <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The municipality covers an area of 292.85 km². As of <span class="date">2005</span>, the municipality had a total population of 3,533. The area <span class="date">now</span> incorporating the settlement of <span class="loc">San Marcos</span> was originally called Chistic or Xistic and was originally inhabited by the Toltec tribe under the rule of the Tonallan kings. Francisco Cortés de <span class="loc">San Buenaventura</span> arrived followed in <span class="date">1530</span> by Nuño de <span class="loc">Guzman</span>, and Juan de Escárcena. In <span class="date">1542</span> <span class="loc">San Marcos</span> was visited by the Viceroy <span class="per">D. Antonio</span> de <span class="loc">Mendoza</span> on his way to put down a large indigenous rebellion. The town itself was founded in <span class="date">Jun 28, 1740</span>, by <span class="per">Fray Antonio</span> de Jesus who was instrumental in construction of the church. As late as <span class="date">1825</span> the town had no city hall and was subordinate to Etzatlán Township. The city was officially founded by decree on <span class="date">April 17, 1907</span>, which became effective the following <span class="date">April</span>. In <span class="date">the early 1900s</span>, during the rule of Mexican dictator <span class="loc">Porfirio Diaz</span>, the Mexican government forcibly marched thousands of Yaquis some 200 miles over the mountains from <span class="loc">San Blas</span> to <span class="loc">San Marcos</span> and its train station. There, the Yaqui survivors were sold at sixty pesos a head to the owners of sugar cane plantations in <span class="loc">Oaxaca</span> and the tobacco planters of the <span class="loc">Valle Nacional</span>, while thousands more were sold to the henequen plantation owners of the Yucatán. By <span class="date">1908</span>, at least five thousand <span class="loc">Yaqui</span> had been sold into forced slavery. Most died within the first year of their captivity.</p><br><br>
