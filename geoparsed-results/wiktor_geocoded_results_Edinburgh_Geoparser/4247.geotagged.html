<p>Compton or Compton Gifford is a suburb of <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> in the English <span class="loc">county of Devon</span>. Once a small village, it was developed in the 1930s and now lies between the suburbs of <span class="loc">Mannamead</span> and <span class="loc">Efford</span>. There are two parts, Higher and Lower Compton named after two farms and now distinguished by their respective public houses. Although essentially infill development between older larger areas, Compton is distinctive in character. House prices have recently declined due to a recent influx of 'undesirables'. The earliest evidence of man in Compton, is from around 3000 BC. At this time, Neolithic stone axes which have been found in Compton, were being made in <span class="loc">Penzance</span>, <span class="loc">Callington</span> and <span class="loc">Cambourne</span>. They may have been used by farmers, or dropped on route to other settlements. Around 800 AD, the Manor of Compton was appearing on maps, <span class="loc">Coombe</span> (a wooded valley) Ton (the Saxon word for farm). In 1086 the Doomsday book had this entry for Compton; "Stephen holds Compton from Iudhael. Oswulf held it before 1066. It paid tax for 1 hide and 1 virgate of land. Land for 4 ploughs, which are there; 2 slaves, 6 villagers, and 4 smallholders.</p>
