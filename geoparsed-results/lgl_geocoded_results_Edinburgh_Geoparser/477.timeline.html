  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Council of <span class="loc">Europe</span> Doesn’t Envisage Use of Sanctions. <span class="loc">MOSCOW</span> — <span class="loc">Russia</span>’s membership in the <span class="org">Council of Europe</span> is not threatened by sanctions, despite Moscow’s continued refusal to ratify two key human rights protocols, two of the council’s top politicians said <span class="date">Wednesday</span>. <span class="per">Luc van den Brande</span> and <span class="per">Theodoros Pangalos</span>, who monitor <span class="loc">Russia</span>’s compliance with its commitments to the council, said talk of sanctions against <span class="loc">Moscow</span> was groundless and that they hoped that the State <span class="loc">Duma</span> would soon ratify the outstanding protocols. “I do not like sanctions. It is important that <span class="loc">Russia</span> is not marginalized,” <span class="per">van den Brande</span> told reporters after <span class="date">two days</span> of talks with government officials and <span class="loc">Duma</span> deputies. <span class="loc">Russia</span> has irked many in the 47-member council by being the only country that has not ratified two amendments to the European Convention on Human Rights. Protocol 6 requires signatories to restrict the use of the death penalty to times of war. Protocol 14 stipulates reforms for the European Court of Human Rights. <span class="per">Pangalos</span>, a former Greek foreign minister and Socialist member of parliament, complained that <span class="loc">Russia</span>’s obstinacy was hampering the development of the whole council. He questioned arguments by Russian officials that public opinion was not ready for a formal abolition of capital punishment by pointing out that it was no longer carried out. “Why do you not apply it and at the same time say it is approved by the population?” he asked. <span class="loc">Russia</span> has maintained a moratorium on the death penalty since <span class="date">1996</span>, when it joined the <span class="org">Council of Europe</span>. <span class="per">Pangalos</span> said the nonratification of the protocol for reforming the European Court of Human Rights was even stranger given that officials in the Justice Ministry told him that they were in favor of ratification. “The ball is in the field of the <span class="loc">Duma</span>,” he said. The proposed reforms seek to improve the court’s efficiency by filtering out cases that have less chance of succeeding. <span class="per">Konstantin Kosachyov</span>, chairman of the <span class="loc">Duma</span>’s International Relations Committee, criticized the protocol as ineffective. “It has many shortcomings and won’t lead to real reform,” he said <span class="date">late Tuesday</span>, Interfax reported.</p><br><br>
