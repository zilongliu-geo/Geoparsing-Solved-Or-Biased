<p><span class="loc">Waterford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Oxford County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,553 at the 2010 census. It is a recreation area noted for historic architecture and scenic beauty. The township was granted on February 24, 1774 by the Massachusetts General Court to Captain Andrew Gardner and his company of soldiers for services under Sir William Phipps during the 1690 expedition against <span class="loc">Canada</span>. It replaced a 1735 grant called <span class="loc">Toddstown</span> or Township No. 6 (now <span class="loc">Henniker</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>), which was ruled invalid when the state line was redrawn between <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> in 1741. The land was surveyed in 1774; in spring of 1775, David McWain of <span class="loc">Bolton</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> arrived with his dog at a lot he bought for $40. He cleared land and built a log cabin, returning to <span class="loc">Bolton</span> for 2 winters until he settled permanently at <span class="loc">Waterford</span> in spring of 1777. McWain preferred solitude, and was deeply annoyed when he first saw smoke rising about 12 miles (19 km) away at Paris Hill. "Humph," he said, "I would like to know who is settling over there right under my nose!" Other grantees arrived nevertheless, most from the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> towns of <span class="loc">Bolton</span>, <span class="loc">Harvard</span>, <span class="loc">Stow</span>, <span class="loc">Northborough</span> and <span class="loc">Rowley</span>. Indeed, the northwestern part of the plantation was once known as <span class="loc">Rowley</span> after the inhabitants' former hometown.</p>
