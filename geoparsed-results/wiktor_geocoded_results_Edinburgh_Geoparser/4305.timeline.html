  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Barron County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span>. The population was 2,170 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city is located partially within the Town of <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>. It was incorporated in <span class="date">1885</span>. <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is often called the “<span class="loc">Island City</span>” and the main part of the city, including the original settlement, is located on land surrounded by <span class="loc">Beaver Dam Lake</span>, originally settled by Chippewa Indian Tribe. <span class="loc">Beaver Dam Lake</span> was referred to as Che-wa-cum-ma-towangok or “Lake Made by the Beavers,” by the local tribe. The Chief of the Chippewa Tribe was Pon-gee Rau-gen, or “Little Pipe”. He continued to live in the area even after it was settled by European settlers and drowned in a canoe on <span class="loc">Beaver Dam Lake</span> in <span class="date">1895</span>. In <span class="date">1874</span>, <span class="per">A. Ritan</span> and <span class="per">R. H. Clothier</span> explored the area with the intention of settling in there. While exploring, they came across surveyors that informed them of the upcoming railroad line that the <span class="loc">North Wisconsin Railway</span> Company planned to lay in the area. <span class="per">A. Ritan</span>, who lived near what is <span class="date">today</span> <span class="loc">Turtle Lake</span> and the <span class="org">Dahlby Family</span>, originally of Norwegian descent, from the town of <span class="loc">New Richmond</span>, both filed a homestead near the proposed railroad and built two log cabins, 300 feet north of the present high school location. In <span class="date">1878</span>, the <span class="loc">North Wisconsin Railroad</span> Company extended the rail lines through the area. Prior to the railroad, settlers were required to get provisions in <span class="loc">Rice Lake</span>, <span class="loc">Barron</span> or Clayton. In <span class="date">1880</span>, the <span class="org">Dahlby Family</span> sold their cabin and moved to Chandler (<span class="date">now</span> known as Spooner) and open a store. <span class="per">A. Ritan</span>, also originally from <span class="loc">Norway</span>, lived in <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> for <span class="date">many years</span> and helped develop the city before moving to <span class="loc">Portland</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>.</p><br><br>
