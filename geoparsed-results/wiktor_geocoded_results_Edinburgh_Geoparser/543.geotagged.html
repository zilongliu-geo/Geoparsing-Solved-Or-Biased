<p><span class="loc">La Trinidad</span> is a first class and capital municipality of the <span class="loc">province of Benguet</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 107,188 people.

The town currently holds the Guinness World Record for baking the world's largest strawberry shortcake in March 20, 2004. The valley encompassing <span class="loc">La Trinidad</span> was originally called "Benguet", a thriving community of Ibaloi migrants from Tinek. Colonial influence reached the area upon Spanish explorers Don M. Quirante's discovery of the valley in 1642, and Lt. Col. Guillermo Galvey's expedition to <span class="loc">Benguet</span> in 1829. The valley was later renamed to "<span class="loc">La Trinidad</span>" in honor of Galvey's wife. Together with 40 other smaller surrounding rancher√≠as, <span class="loc">La Trinidad</span> was placed under the jurisdiction of the newly established Benguet commandancia politico-militar in 1846. <span class="loc">La Trinidad</span> was established as the administrative headquarters of the Benguet commandancia during the Spanish Conquest of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. With the establishment of <span class="loc">Benguet</span> as a province under the <span class="loc">Republic of the Philippines</span> in 1899, <span class="loc">La Trinidad</span> was made as its capital.</p>
