  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Milford</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Oakland County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The population was 6,175 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The village is located within Milford Township. The village of <span class="loc">Milford</span> began with the building of a sawmill by <span class="per">Elizur</span> and <span class="per">Stanley</span> <span class="loc">Ruggles</span> in <span class="date">1832</span>. <span class="loc">Early county</span> records indicate that the mill was erected in the "Township" at that time, and that formal organization would occur in <span class="date">1834</span>. That same year, the first gristmill was erected by <span class="per">Luman Fuller</span>. In <span class="date">1835</span>, the first post office was established with <span class="per">Aaron Phelps</span> as postmaster. The Lower <span class="loc">Mill Pond</span> was created in <span class="date">1836</span> to provide waterpower for the various types of mills and factories. The Upper <span class="loc">Mill Pond</span> followed in <span class="date">1845</span>. In <span class="date">1911</span>, the <span class="loc">Hubbell</span> Pond was created by a dam built on the <span class="loc">Huron</span> River to generate electricity. The village was incorporated in <span class="date">1869</span>. Hydropower made it possible for <span class="loc">Milford</span> to become one of the first communities to have electric lights, in <span class="date">1892</span>. <span class="date">A year later</span>, telephone service was available in the Village. As a point of reference, nearby <span class="loc">South Lyon</span> did not have electric lights until <span class="date">1932</span>.</p><br><br>
