  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kular</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Firozpur District</span>, <span class="loc">Punjab</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>. It is located in south western <span class="loc">Punjab</span>, lying in close proximity with the <span class="per">Rajasthan</span> State's <span class="loc">Hanumangarh</span> and <span class="loc">Sri Ganganagar</span> districts. Many farmers of the village own land in both <span class="per">Punjab</span> and <span class="per">Rajasthan</span>. The village, unlike its other counterparts of <span class="per">Punjab</span>, including neighboring villages, has a very low population of Sikh community. This is one of the bases on which neighboring <span class="loc">Haryana</span> lays its claim on the region, repeatedly denied by the <span class="per">Punjab</span> government. The land here is very productive and though the average holding size is small-except for a few landlords holding huge estates with an annual turnover of crores of rupees-people in general are prosperous. <span class="loc">Kular</span> has a number of social amenities including a middle school by <span class="per">Punjab</span> government, 3 private schools, a primary health center, a veterinary care center and a grain market. A community centre for the scheduled caste members has also been constructed. <span class="loc">Kular</span> has a prosperous agriculture with an elaborate irrigation structure, good water supply and good connectivity with the neighboring ago-markets. The soil is good enough to support 3 crops <span class="date">a year</span>, which typically are- wheat and mustard in Rabi season, Cotton in Kharif season and another crop of maize or chickpea. Besides some vegetable farms are also there. <span class="loc">Kular</span> is a hub of Kinnow farming, specially taken up by large farmers.</p><br><br>
