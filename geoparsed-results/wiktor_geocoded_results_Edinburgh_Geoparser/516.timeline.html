  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Jackson</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Carroll County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 816 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Jackson</span> is an elegant resort area in the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span>. <span class="org">Parts of the White Mountain National Forest</span> are in the west, north and east. Once consisting of several large land grants by Colonial Governor <span class="per">John Wentworth</span>, the town was first named New Madbury, after the seacoast town of <span class="loc">Madbury</span>. In <span class="date">1772</span>, a road was built through <span class="loc">Pinkham Notch</span>, and the area was first settled in <span class="date">1778</span> by <span class="per">Benjamin Copp</span> and his family. In <span class="date">1800</span>, the community was renamed in honor of President <span class="per">John Adams</span>, who was then in office. The name <span class="per">Adams</span> stuck until the town was incorporated in <span class="date">1829</span>, when <span class="per">Andrew Jackson</span>, the hero of the Battle of <span class="loc">New Orleans</span>, was inaugurated president. <span class="per">Governor Benjamin Pierce</span>, a staunch backer of <span class="per">President Jackson</span>, was influential in changing the name to <span class="per">Jackson</span>. Only one vote was cast against the switch. In <span class="date">1847</span>, artists of the White Mountain School began arriving in <span class="per">Jackson</span> to paint the scenic beauty of the <span class="loc">White Mountains</span>. Others would follow, and in <span class="date">1858</span>, <span class="per">Joshua B. Trickey</span> opened the <span class="per">Jackson</span> Falls House. The <span class="loc">Portland</span> &amp; Ogdensburg Railroad began service to Glen station at nearby <span class="loc">Bartlett</span> in the early 1870s, and several hotels were built to accommodate a growing infusion of tourists. <span class="org">Thorn</span> Mountain House, built by <span class="per">Trickey</span> in <span class="date">1869</span>, would evolve during the 1880s into <span class="per">Wentworth Hall</span>, still in business <span class="date">today</span>. Designed as a grouping of cottages around a main service building, the hotel included such amenities as a casino, built in <span class="date">1886</span>, and a hydroelectric plant, built in the 1890s. By <span class="date">the 1920s</span>, 40 trains <span class="date">a day</span> delivered passengers to <span class="per">Jackson</span>.</p><br><br>
