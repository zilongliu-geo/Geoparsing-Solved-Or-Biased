<p><span class="loc">Matanzas</span> is a coastal village famous for its beach, located in the commune of Navidad in the <span class="loc">O'Higgins Region</span> of <span class="loc">Chile</span>. <span class="loc">Matanzas</span> is located in the north west of <span class="loc">Cardenal</span> <span class="loc">Caro Province</span>, <span class="loc">O'Higgins Region</span>, and forms part of the commune of Navidad, <span class="loc">Chile</span>. Is located 160 kilometres south of Santiago and 58 kilometres north of <span class="loc">Pichilemu</span>. <span class="loc">Matanzas</span> was a famous harbour during the time of the colonization of <span class="loc">Chile</span>, and was the place where part of the Spanish army responsible for the occupation of <span class="loc">Chile</span>’s <span class="loc">Zona Central</span> disembarked. The place was also frequented by pirates. The name "Matanzas" (Spanish for “slaughter” or “killing”) comes from the sea lion hunting and processing industry, which were used to provide oil and other goods. A local story tells of a visit from Sir Francis Drake, who disembarked and was well received in <span class="loc">Matanzas</span>. Another tells of a sunken Spanish galleon out off the coast. The beach at <span class="loc">Matanzas</span> is known for its fine grey sand and year-round windy weather, making it an ideal place to practice surfing, boogyboarding, stand up paddling, windsurfing and kitesurfing. <span class="loc">Matanzas</span> is also known for its rich fauna. The islets of <span class="loc">Lobos</span> and <span class="loc">Pajaros</span> provide a nesting ground for several species and the English scientist Charles Darwin discovered 31 species around <span class="loc">Matanzas</span> in his 1846 analysis of the Navidad Formation. The area includes many species of molluscs that were last reviewed extensively by <span class="loc">Philippi</span> (1887).</p>
