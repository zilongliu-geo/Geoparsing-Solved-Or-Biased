<p><span class="loc">Kozlovo</span> (Russian: Козлово) is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) in <span class="loc">Konakovsky District</span> of <span class="loc">Tver Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located close the right bank of the <span class="loc">Shosha</span> River (the <span class="loc">Ivankovo</span> Reservoir). Population: 3,884 (2010 Census); 4,388 (2002 Census); 4,368 (1989 Census). The village of <span class="loc">Kozlovo</span> was first mentioned in the 16th century. After 1781, it belonged to Klinsky Uyezd of Moscow Governorate. In 1857, a carpet factory was open by merchant Flanden. The factory served for a long time as the main employer in <span class="loc">Kozlovo</span>. On July 12 1929, Moscow Governorate was abolished, and the area was transferred to <span class="loc">Moscow Oblast</span>. Uyezds were abolished as well, and <span class="loc">Zavidovsky District</span>, with the administrative center in Novozavidovsky, was established within Tver Okrug of <span class="loc">Moscow Oblast</span>. <span class="loc">Kozlovo</span> was included into <span class="loc">Zavidovsky District</span>. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 <span class="loc">Kalinin Oblast</span> was established, and <span class="loc">Zavidovsky District</span> was transferred to <span class="loc">Kalinin Oblast</span>. In November and December 1941, during World War II, <span class="loc">Kozlovo</span> was occupied by German troops. In 1958, <span class="loc">Kozlovo</span> was granted urban-type settlement status. On November 14, 1960 the district was abolished and merged into <span class="loc">Konakovsky District</span>. On February 13, 1963, during the abortive Khrushchyov administrative reform, <span class="loc">Konakovsky District</span> was merged into <span class="loc">Kalininsky District</span>, but on January  12, 1965 it was re-established. In 1990, <span class="loc">Kalinin Oblast</span> was renamed <span class="loc">Tver Oblast</span>.</p>
