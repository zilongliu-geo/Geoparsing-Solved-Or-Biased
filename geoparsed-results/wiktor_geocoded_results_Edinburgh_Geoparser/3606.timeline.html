  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Huntington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Baker County</span>, on the eastern border of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located on the <span class="loc">Snake River</span> and along Interstate 84 and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 30. The population was 440 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 515 in <span class="date">2000</span>. <span class="per">Henry Miller</span> settled in the area in <span class="date">August 1862</span>. In <span class="date">1870</span>, Miller's Stagecoach Station was established before the coming of the <span class="org">Oregon Railway and Navigation Company</span> rail line in <span class="date">1884</span>, and was platted in <span class="date">1885</span> or <span class="date">1886</span>. It soon became the primary shipping point for the cattle country to the south. Miller built the Stage Tavern, known for <span class="date">many years</span> as "Miller Station". It was on the overland route that had been established in the valley, and had become well known to all who traveled in pioneer <span class="date">days</span>. According to <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Geographic Names, <span class="per">Huntington</span> was named for J.B. and <span class="org">J.M. Huntington, brothers</span> who purchased Miller's holdings in <span class="date">1882</span>. The Huntingtons maintained a small trading post on their land. In <span class="date">1884</span>, the rails of the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> <span class="loc">Short Line</span> and the <span class="org">Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company</span> line were joined in <span class="per">Huntington</span>. Since that time, <span class="per">Huntington</span> has been an important railway division point. With the advent of the railroad came <span class="per">J.T. Fifer</span>, who had been selling general merchandise to the construction crews moving his goods from town to town as the work progressed. Shortly after <span class="per">Fifer</span> arrived, the Huntingtons closed up, leaving him alone in the general merchandise business. The <span class="org">Oregon Construction Company</span> followed soon, with a stock of general merchandise, a blacksmith shop, the Pacific Hotel, several boarding houses and restaurants and a number of saloons.</p><br><br>
