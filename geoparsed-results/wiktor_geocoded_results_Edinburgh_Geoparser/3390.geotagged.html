<p><span class="loc">Kanna</span> (神流町, Kanna-machi) is a town located in <span class="loc">Tano District</span> of southwestern Gunma Prefecture in the <span class="loc">northern Kantō region</span> of <span class="loc">Japan</span>. As of February 2015, the town had an estimated population of 2,007 and a population density of 17.5 persons per km2. Its total area was 114.6 km2. The town has seen a precipitous drop in population, to only one third of its population in 1970, with the remaining population having the second oldest median age in <span class="loc">Japan</span> after Nanmoku, <span class="loc">Gunma</span> and is thus classified as a Genkai shūraku. A footprint of <span class="loc">Japan</span>'s first dinosaurs was discovered in former <span class="loc">Nakasato</span> village, now part of <span class="loc">Kanna</span>. <span class="loc">Kanna</span> is located in the southwestern portion of Gunma Prefecture, bordered by Saitama Prefecture to the south. During the Edo period, the area of present-day <span class="loc">Kanna</span> was part of the tenryō territory administered directly by the Tokugawa shogunate in <span class="loc">Kōzuke Province</span>. Kamikawa village and <span class="loc">Nakasato</span> village were established within <span class="loc">Minamikanra District</span>, Gunma Prefecture on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the municipalities system after the Meiji Restoration. In 1896 <span class="loc">Minamikanra District</span> was united with <span class="loc">Midono</span> and <span class="loc">Tago Districts</span> to create <span class="loc">Tano District</span>. Kamikawa village was elevated to town status in 1926 and renamed <span class="loc">Manba</span> town. On April 1, 2003, <span class="loc">Manba</span> and <span class="loc">Nakasato</span> merged, forming the town of <span class="loc">Kanna</span>.</p>
