  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Duma (Arabic: دوما‎, also spelled as <span class="loc">Douma</span>) is Palestinian town in the Nablus Governorate in the northern <span class="loc">West Bank</span>, located 25 kilometers southeast of <span class="loc">Nablus</span>. According to the <span class="org">Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics</span>, the town had a population of 2,220 inhabitants in mid-year <span class="date">2006</span>. Duma's total land area consists of 17,351 dunams, about 200 of which are designated as built-up area. On <span class="date">31 July, 2015</span>, suspected Israeli settlers firebombed two homes in Duma, killing 18-month-old <span class="per">Ali Saad</span> Dawabsha and critically injuring his parents and 4-year-old brother. The boy, <span class="per">Ali</span>, died in the attack; his father, 32, died later of second-degree burns over most of his body, followed by the death of his wife, from her injuries, <span class="date">about 5 weeks later</span>. The attack is believed to be a price tag attack by Israeli settlers, who were seen fleeing towards Ma'ale Efrayim. Pottery sherds from the Hellenistic, Hellenistic/Roman and Roman era have been found. South–southwest of the village is a spring called <span class="loc">Ayn Duma</span>, where water has been collected in ancient small pools, some hollowed out of rock.</p><br><br>
