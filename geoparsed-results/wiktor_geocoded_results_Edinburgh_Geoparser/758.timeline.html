  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Anda</span> is a third class island-municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Pangasinan</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. The people of <span class="loc">Anda</span> generally speak <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>, <span class="loc">Bolinao</span>, and <span class="loc">Ilocano</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 37,011 people. The municipality consists primarily of <span class="loc">Cabarruyan Island</span> (also known as <span class="loc">Anda</span> Island), as well as minor surrounding islets. Because of <span class="loc">Anda</span>'s proximity near the <span class="loc">Hundred Islands</span>, a popular tourist destination for its caves and beaches, it is the so-called "Mother of the <span class="loc">Hundred Islands</span>." <span class="loc">Anda</span> is politically subdivided into 18 barangays. On the north-west portion of <span class="loc">Lingayen Gulf</span> lies a group of islands which comprise the territory of <span class="loc">Anda</span>. Before the middle of the nineteenth century, the islands which comprise the municipality were uninhabited. Only occasionally did seafarers and fishermen use the coast as havens. <span class="per">Andres de la Cruz</span> <span class="loc">Cacho</span>, fondly called in <span class="loc">Bolinao</span> as Andales Kulayo, discovered a vast tract of land suitable for grazing and fertile lowlands, and an abundant spring for agriculture. It was he who brought families from the town of <span class="loc">Bolinao</span> aboard a big boat and dispersed them on the island of Cabarruyan in <span class="date">1842</span>. The spread of population was rapid.</p><br><br>
