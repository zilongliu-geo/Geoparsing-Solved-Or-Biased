<p><span class="loc">Kozan</span> (formerly Sis Armenian: Սիս) is a city in <span class="loc">Adana Province</span>, <span class="loc">Turkey</span>, 68 kilometres (42 miles) northeast of <span class="loc">Adana</span>, in the northern section of the Çukurova plain. The city is the capital of the ilçe (district) of <span class="loc">Kozan</span>. The <span class="loc">Kilgen</span> River, a tributary of the <span class="loc">Ceyhan</span>, flows through <span class="loc">Kozan</span> and crosses the plain south into the Mediterranean. The <span class="loc">Taurus Mountains</span> rise up sharply behind the town. Sis was the capital of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and Sis Castle, now called Kozan Kalesi, was build on a long rocky ridge in the center of the modern city. The population of the city has grown rapidly in recent years, from 15,159 in 1960, to 54,451 in 1990, to 72,463 in 2007 and to 74,521 in 2009 (census figures). The oldest known name is Sis or Siskia. Under the Roman Empire, it was for a time named Flavias or <span class="loc">Flaviopolis</span>. The Greek version of the older name, Σίσιον <span class="loc">Sision</span>, came back into use in the later Byzantine period. In Armenian, it is called Sis Սիս or <span class="loc">Sissu</span>.</p>
