<p><span class="loc">Peterborough</span> /ˈpiːtərbɔːroʊ/ PEE-tər-bur-oh is a city on the <span class="loc">Otonabee River</span> in Central Ontario, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, 125 kilometres (78 mi) northeast of <span class="loc">Toronto</span>. According to the 2011 Census, the population of the <span class="loc">City of Peterborough</span> was 78,698. The population of the Peterborough Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), which includes the surrounding Townships of <span class="loc">Selwyn</span>, Cavan Monaghan, Otonabee-South Monaghan, and Douro-Dummer, was estimated in 2014 at 123,270. It presently has the 33rd largest CMA in <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The current mayor of <span class="loc">Peterborough</span> is Daryl Bennett. Peterborough's nickname is "The <span class="loc">Electric City</span>" as it was the first town in <span class="loc">Canada</span> to use electric streetlights. It also underscores the historical and present-day importance of technology and manufacturing as an economic base of the city, which has operations from large multi-national companies such as Siemens, Rolls Royce, and General Electric, and more local technology businesses such as Fisher Gauge and Bryston. Electricity was one of the reasons Quaker Oats moved to the city, and as part of PepsiCo, remains a major fixture in the downtown area to this day. <span class="loc">Peterborough</span> is known as the gateway to the Kawarthas, "cottage country", a large recreational region of the province. It is named in honour of Peter Robinson, an early Canadian politician who oversaw the first major immigration to the area. The city is the seat of <span class="loc">Peterborough County</span>.</p>
