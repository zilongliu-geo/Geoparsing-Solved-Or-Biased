  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Clifton</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">York</span> in the unitary authority of the <span class="loc">City of York</span>, in the north of <span class="loc">England</span> about 1Â½ miles from the city centre. The A19, passes north out of <span class="loc">York</span> through <span class="per">Clifton</span>. The old village area was made a Conservation Area in <span class="date">1968</span>. It is the location of <span class="org">Nestle</span> Foods Factory and the Public Schools of St Peter's and the former <span class="per">Queen Anne</span>'s. The origin of the name is derived from the Olde English pre-7th century clif, meaning a gentle slope, or more usually a riverbank, with tun, an enclosure or settlement. During Roman times there was a road through <span class="per">Clifton</span> that approached the Roman fortress from the north-west and headed towards the river crossing. There was a second road that also left the north-west gate and may eventually have joined the other. The evidence from early timber buildings from the <span class="org">Museum</span> gardens and early burials from <span class="per">Bootham</span> and <span class="per">Clifton</span> suggest the roads existed from the 1st century. Sporadic 2nd century Roman occupation material and fragments of streets indicate that by that time expansion may have begun in <span class="per">Clifton</span>. This development was not sustained and evidence indicates that from the 3rd century onwards the area beyond St. Mary's was given over to cemeteries.</p><br><br>
