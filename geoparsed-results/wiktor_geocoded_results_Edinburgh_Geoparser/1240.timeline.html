  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Hartford</span> is the capital of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> and the historic seat of <span class="loc">Hartford County</span> until <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> disbanded county government in <span class="date">1960</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, <span class="loc">Hartford</span>'s population was 124,775, making it Connecticut's fourth-largest city after the coastal <span class="loc">cities of Bridgeport</span>, <span class="loc">New Haven</span>, and <span class="loc">Stamford</span>. Nicknamed the "Insurance Capital of the World", <span class="loc">Hartford</span> houses many insurance company headquarters, and insurance remains the region's major industry. Founded in <span class="date">1637</span>, <span class="loc">Hartford</span> is among the oldest cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Hartford</span> is home to the nation's oldest public art museum, the Wadsworth Atheneum; the oldest publicly funded park, <span class="loc">Bushnell</span> Park; the oldest continuously published newspaper, The <span class="loc">Hartford</span> Courant; the second-oldest secondary school, <span class="org">Hartford Public</span>; Trinity College, an elite, private liberal arts college, and the <span class="per">Mark Twain</span> House where the author wrote his most famous works and raised his family, among other historically significant attractions. In <span class="date">1868</span>, resident <span class="per">Mark Twain</span> wrote, "Of all the beautiful towns it has been my fortune to see this is the chief." Following the American Civil War, <span class="loc">Hartford</span> was the richest city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> for <span class="date">several decades</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Hartford</span> is one of the poorest cities in the nation with 3 out of every 10 families living below the poverty line.
