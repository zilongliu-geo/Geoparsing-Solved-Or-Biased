<p>Greenwich (/ˈɡrɛnɪtʃ/, /ˈɡrɪnɪdʒ/, /ˈɡrɪnɪtʃ/ or /ˈɡrɛnɪdʒ/) is an early-established district of today's <span class="loc">London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, centred 5.5 miles (8.9 km) east south-east of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. The town lends its name to the Royal Borough of Greenwich. Greenwich is generally described as being part of South-east <span class="loc">London</span> and sometimes as being part of <span class="loc">East London</span>. It is also one of the five boroughs of the <span class="loc">London</span> Docklands, connected to areas with docks of <span class="loc">London</span> historically by river and today to <span class="loc">Canary Wharf</span> and other buildings by the <span class="loc">East London Line</span>. Greenwich is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. The town became the site of a royal palace, the Palace of <span class="loc">Placentia</span> from the 15th century, and was the birthplace of many Tudors, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was rebuilt as the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor. These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873, and they remained an establishment for military education until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation. The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public; other buildings are used by University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance.</p>
