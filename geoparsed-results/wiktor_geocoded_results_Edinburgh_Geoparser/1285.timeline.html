  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>This article is about the settlement in <span class="loc">Otago</span>. For the <span class="loc">Canterbury</span> locality, see <span class="loc">Longbeach</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. Long Beach, known in MƒÅori as Warauwerawera, is a small coastal settlement in <span class="loc">Otago</span>, <span class="loc">New Zealand</span> comprising approximately 100 homes. Many of the sections were initially auctioned in <span class="date">October 1922</span> for a pound deposit. It is located within the city limits of <span class="loc">Dunedin</span>, and lies 15 kilometres northeast of the city centre, between <span class="loc">Blueskin Bay</span> and the mouth of the <span class="loc">Otago Harbour</span>. The small settlement of Purakaunui is located nearby. Long Beach township is near a sandy beach that stretches 2.4 kilometres between coastal rock formations. Bird life in the beach and lagoon area includes blue penguins, seals, terns, pukeko, herons, spoonbills, and ducks. Because the beach lies within a bay and is seldom affected by swells, it is a common swimming location. Rock-climbing cliffs and caves at the beach's western end also attract many visitors. The <span class="org">Mopanui Ecological Society</span>, a Long Beach community group, has been extensively beautifying the area through mass planting of native flora in reserve areas.</p><br><br>
