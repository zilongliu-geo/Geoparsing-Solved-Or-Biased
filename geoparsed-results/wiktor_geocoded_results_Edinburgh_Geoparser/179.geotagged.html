<p><span class="loc">San Andres</span> (also <span class="loc">San</span> Andres Bukid, bukid being the <span class="loc">Tagalog</span> for "farm" or "[rice] field") is a <span class="loc">district of Manila</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. <span class="loc">San Andres</span> shares its northeastern border with the districts of <span class="loc">Santa Ana</span> and <span class="loc">Paco</span>, while to its south lies <span class="loc">Pasay</span> and <span class="loc">Makati</span>. The area is under the jurisdiction of the Fifth Congressional District of Manila, and includes the Manila South Cemetery, an exclave of the city. Although <span class="loc">San Andres</span> only has a small land area, it is the second most densely populated district in Manila after <span class="loc">Tondo</span>. <span class="loc">San Andres</span> is divided into its eastern and western sectors by the Sergio Osme√±a Highway. Mostly residential, <span class="loc">San Andres</span> also has some sections classified as commercial. The majority of the district's population live just above the poverty line, mostly composed of post-World War II settlers from various provinces while the original inhabitants were middle or lower-class migrant families who had formerly settled in <span class="loc">Tondo</span> but found the rough working-class lifestyle less suitable for raising children. The influx of settlers into the district was unregulated, resulting in a lack of urban planning as evidenced by irregular buildings, narrow roadways, and large blocks of houses accessible only through metre-wide alleyways.</p>
