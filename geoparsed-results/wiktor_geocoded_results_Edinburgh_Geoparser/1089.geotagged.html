<p>Union is a city in <span class="loc">Boone County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,379 in the 2010 Census. The area was rural until mass residential growth in 1990's and 2000's The City of Union grew from a small settlement that may have existed as early as the late 18th century. However, by the early 19th century, much of the land that now lies in Union was owned by the Fowler family, and Benjamin Piatt Fowler built his home in what is now the northern area of the city c. 1817. It has been recorded that Union was established as early as 1833, but existing documentation shows that Union was officially incorporated as a city in 1838. Why the name Union was chosen no one actually knows, but the story goes that since it was a connection point between <span class="loc">Florence</span> and <span class="loc">Big Bone Lick</span>, "Union" seemed somehow appropriate. Salt was manufactured at <span class="loc">Big Bone Lick</span> during the early 19th century, and then brought to Union for distribution to other area settlements. Union is located at 38°56′43″N 84°40′19″W (38.945185, -84.671866).</p>
