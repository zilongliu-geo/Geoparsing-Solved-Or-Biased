  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kampala</span> is the capital and largest <span class="loc">city of Uganda</span>. The city is divided into five boroughs that oversee local planning: <span class="loc">Kampala</span> <span class="loc">Central Division</span>, <span class="loc">Kawempe Division</span>, <span class="loc">Makindye Division</span>, <span class="loc">Nakawa Division</span>, and <span class="loc">Lubaga Division</span>. The city is coterminous with <span class="loc">Kampala District</span>. Surrounding <span class="loc">Kampala</span> is the rapidly growing <span class="loc">Wakiso District</span>, whose population more than doubled between <span class="date">2002</span> and <span class="date">2014</span> and <span class="date">now</span> stands at over 2 million. Before the arrival of the British colonists, the <span class="loc">Kabaka</span> of <span class="loc">Buganda</span> had chosen the zone that would become <span class="loc">Kampala</span> as a hunting reserve. The area, composed of rolling hills with grassy wetlands in the valleys, was home to several species of antelope, particularly impala. When the British arrived, they called it "<span class="org">Hills of the Impala</span>". The language of the <span class="loc">Buganda</span>, <span class="loc">Luganda</span>, adopted many English words because of their interactions with the British. The <span class="loc">Buganda</span> translated "<span class="org">Hill of the Impala</span>" as Akasozi ke'Empala - "Kasozi" meaning "hill", "ke" meaning "of", and "empala" the plural of "impala". In <span class="loc">Luganda</span>, the words "ka'mpala" means "that is of the impala", in reference to a hill, and the single word "Kampala" was adopted as the name for the city that grew out of the <span class="loc">Kabaka</span>'s hills.</p><br><br>
