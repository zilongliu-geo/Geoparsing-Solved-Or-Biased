The county was once home to seven large earthworks sites, built by ancient Indigenous peoples of <span class="loc">the Americas</span> that lived in the area. Early French explorers likely passed through the area along the <span class="loc">Miami River</span>. The gravesites of <span class="per">David</span> and <span class="per">Margaret</span> Gregory indicate that they were some of the first white settlers in the area in Liberty Township.
