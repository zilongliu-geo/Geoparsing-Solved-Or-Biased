<p><span class="loc">Pilar</span> is a city in the province of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, <span class="loc">Argentina</span> with a population of 299,077 as per the 2010 census [INDEC]. It is part of the Greater <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> urban conurbation and is the seat of the administrative division of <span class="loc">Pilar</span> <span class="loc">Partido</span>. Since the early 1990s, <span class="loc">Pilar</span> has gained an increasingly upscale profile due to the development of numerous gated communities, country clubs and polo fields. [1] The rural outpost that later became <span class="loc">Pilar</span> was first assigned a local authority in 1774 with the appointment of Ventura López Camelo as its first alcalde, or mayor. <span class="loc">Pilar</span> is the site where the Treaty of <span class="loc">Pilar</span> was signed on February 23, 1820, establishing the basis for Argentine federalism, as a result of which the <span class="loc">city of Pilar</span> is acknowledged as the "Cradle of National Federalism." This Treaty marked the end of the war between the League of Free Peoples formed by the <span class="loc">provinces of Entre Ríos</span> and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> against <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>. The <span class="loc">Parish of Our Lady</span> of the Pillar was consecrated in 1856, and the partido (county) of <span class="loc">Pilar</span> was established in 1864. The first railway line built by the <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> and Pacific Railway reached the town in 1886, and by 1895 nearly 10,000 inhabitants lived in <span class="loc">Pilar</span>. The opening of National Route 8 in 1934 eased the 58 kilometres (36 mi) commute to <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>, and <span class="loc">Pilar</span> subsequently became a growing commuter town.</p>
