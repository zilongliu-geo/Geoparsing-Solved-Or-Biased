<p><span class="loc">Banda</span> is a hill that lies in <span class="loc">Nakawa Division</span>, within <span class="loc">Kampala</span>, the capital of <span class="loc">Uganda</span>, the third-largest economy in the East African Community. <span class="loc">Banda</span> also refers to the neighborhoods on the slopes of the hill and between <span class="loc">Banda Hill</span> and <span class="loc">Kireka</span>, extending all the way to the Kampala-Jinja Highway. The southwestern slopes of the hill are occupied by the neighbourhood known as <span class="loc">Kyambogo</span>, and is the location of the campus of Kyambogo University, one of the nine public universities in the country. <span class="loc">Banda</span> is bordered by Kiwaatule to the north, <span class="loc">Kireka</span> to the east, Kinnawattaka to the southeast, <span class="loc">Mbuya</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Nakawa</span> to the southwest, Ntinda to the west and northwest. The location of the hill is approximately 11 kilometres (6.8 mi), by road, east of <span class="loc">Kampala</span>'s central business district. The coordinates of <span class="loc">Banda</span> Hill are:0°21'14.0"N, 32°37'57.0"E (Latitude:0.353889; Longitude:32.632500). The full name of <span class="loc">Banda</span> is Bandabalogo. Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, Kabaka Muteesa I Mukaabya Walugembe Kayiira, the 30th <span class="loc">Kabaka</span> of the <span class="loc">Kingdom of Buganda</span>, who reigned from 1856 until 1884, maintained a palace on the hill. It was at this palace that British explorer John Hanning Speke met Kabaka Walugembe Muteesa I in 1862. Muteesa detained Speke for some months before finally releasing him in his quest to look for the source of the <span class="loc">Nile River</span>. At <span class="loc">Banda</span>, Muteesa faced many misfortunes, which he attributed to ill luck or witch-craft, thus the name Bandabalogo ("Wizards of <span class="loc">Banda</span>"). He left <span class="loc">Banda</span> and built another palace at <span class="loc">Nabulagala</span> which he later called <span class="loc">Kasubi</span>, named after his mother’s village in <span class="loc">Kyaggwe County</span>, which is now known as <span class="loc">Mukono District</span>. Today, the great, great grandson of Muteesa I, <span class="loc">Kabaka</span> Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II, the reigning Buganda monarch, maintains a palace on the hill with the entrance facing west, as is the tradition.</p>
