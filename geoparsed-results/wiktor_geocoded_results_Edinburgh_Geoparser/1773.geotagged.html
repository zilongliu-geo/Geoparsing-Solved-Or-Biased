<p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a nongovernmental county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 71,372, which makes it the least-populous county on the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> mainland, and the third-least populous county in the state. Its largest community and traditional county seat is <span class="loc">Greenfield</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> comprises the Greenfield Town, MA Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Springfield-Greenfield Town, MA Combined Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> was created on 24 June 1811 from the northern third of <span class="loc">Hampshire County</span>. It was named for Benjamin Franklin. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> was abolished by state government in 1997, at the county's request. Like several other <span class="loc">Massachusetts counties</span>, <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> exists today only as a geographic region and has no county government. The Franklin County Commission voted itself out of existence, and all former state-mandated county functions were assumed by state agencies in 1997. The sheriff and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region. Counties in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> and <span class="loc">New England</span> generally are historically weak governmental structures. The primary subdivision of the Commonwealth is the municipal township. Communities are permitted to form regional compacts for sharing services. The municipalities of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> have formed the Franklin Regional Council of Governments. The regional council provides various services on a regional basis, and a majority of the county's towns are members of the <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> Solid Waste Management District, which provides municipal waste disposal and recycling services to its members. Public transportation throughout the county and in the North Quabbin area of northwestern <span class="loc">Worcester County</span> is provided by the Franklin Regional Transit Authority.</p>
