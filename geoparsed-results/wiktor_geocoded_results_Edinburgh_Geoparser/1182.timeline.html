  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Parma</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cuyahoga County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located on the southern edge of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, it is both an inner-ring and the largest suburb of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>. <span class="loc">Parma</span>, as of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, is listed as the seventh largest city in the state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and the second largest city in <span class="loc">Cuyahoga County</span> after <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>. In <span class="date">1806</span>, the area that was to become <span class="loc">Parma</span> and <span class="loc">Parma Heights</span> was originally surveyed by <span class="per">Abraham Tappan</span>, a surveyor for the Connecticut Land Company, and was known as Township 6 - Range 13. This designation gave the town its first identity in the Western Reserve. Soon after, Township 6 - Range 13 was commonly referred to as "Greenbriar," supposedly for the rambling bush that grew there. Benajah Fay, his wife <span class="per">Ruth Wilcox</span> Fay, and their ten children, arrivals from <span class="loc">Lewis County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, were the first settlers in <span class="date">1816</span>. It was then that <span class="loc">Greenbriar</span>, under a newly organized government seat under Brooklyn Township, began attending to its own governmental needs. Self-government started to gain in popularity by the time the new Greenbriar settlement contained twenty householders. However, prior to the establishment of the new township, the name <span class="loc">Greenbriar</span> was replaced by the name <span class="loc">Parma</span>. This was largely due to Dr. <span class="per">David Long</span> who had recently returned from <span class="loc">Italy</span> and "impressed with the grandeur and beauty...was reminded of <span class="loc">Parma</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span> and...persuaded the early townspeople that the territory deserved a better name than <span class="loc">Greenbriar</span>."</p><br><br>
