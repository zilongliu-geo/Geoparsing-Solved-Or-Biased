<p><span class="loc">Dargo</span> is a town in Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, located 348 kilometres (216 mi) east of <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, in the Shire of Wellington. At the 2006 census, <span class="loc">Dargo</span> and the surrounding area had a population of 144. The town provided a stopover for Victorian Gold Rush miners on their way to the goldfields of Grant, <span class="loc">Talbotville</span>, and <span class="loc">Crooked River</span>. The Post Office opened on 18 March 1868. Today the town is a producer of timber, and stockmen reside in the nearby <span class="loc">Dargo High Plains</span>. The town is a popular destination for four-wheel drive enthusiasts, bushwalkers, sambar deer hunters as well as trout fisherman. The annual Walnut Festival runs through the Australian Easter Holiday period, and is usually well attended. note: due to crippling liability insurance, the annual Walnut Festival is no longer an event It is best to avoid the Dargo river if there have been recent heavy rains as the due to geological nature of the river (steep gradient flowing over rubble, gravel and rock substrate). It is prone to discolour easily and rise to levels that make shore fishing difficult and wading dangerous. Access to the river is excellent, with immediate access available around the township. The (unsealed) Upper Dargo Road runs alongside the river and provides river access for over 20 kilometres (10 mi) upstream of the township. Although the Upper Dargo Road is marked as a 4WD-only road on maps, a 2WD vehicle is sufficient except after heavy rains as there is a small creek crossing just prior to <span class="loc">Black Flat</span>, and beyond <span class="loc">Black Flat</span> (near <span class="loc">Matheson</span> Flat) the road can turn to mud.</p>
