<p><span class="loc">Hartford</span> is a town centrally located in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town population was 2,279 at the 2000 census. The Provincial Patent (1766) was granted to officer veterans of the French and Indian War. The patent included, within the "Town of <span class="loc">Westfield</span>," the present towns of <span class="loc">Putnam</span>, <span class="loc">Fort Ann</span>, <span class="loc">Dresden</span> part of <span class="loc">Kingsbury</span>, and <span class="loc">Hartford</span>. The Town of <span class="loc">Hartford</span> was set off from <span class="loc">Westfield</span> in 1793. The Town of <span class="loc">Westfield</span> represents the Vermont claim for part of this region, which was eventually settled by the eastern part of <span class="loc">Charlotte County</span> being transferred from <span class="loc">New York</span>. Many of the early settlers came from parts of <span class="loc">New England</span>. The land granted by the original patent was often sold to the new settlers. The Hartford Baptist Church and Cemetery and Elisha Straight House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 43.5 square miles (113 km2), of which, 43.4 square miles (112 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) of it (0.09%) is water.</p>
