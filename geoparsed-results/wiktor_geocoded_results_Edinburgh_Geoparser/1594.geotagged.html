<p>Newton, officially the Town of Newton, is an incorporated municipality located in <span class="loc">Sussex County</span>, <span class="loc">New Jersey</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is one of fifteen municipalities in the state organized as a town, and the municipal government operates under a council-manager structure provided by the Faulkner Act, or Optional Municipal Charter Law. As the location of the county's administrative offices and court system, Newton is the county seat of <span class="loc">Sussex County</span>. Newton was incorporated by an act of the <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> Legislature on April 11, 1864, from portions of Newton Township, which was also partitioned to create <span class="loc">Andover Township</span> and <span class="loc">Hampton Township</span>, and was then dissolved. Additional land was acquired from <span class="loc">Andover Township</span> in 1869 and 1927, and from <span class="loc">Fredon</span> Township in 1920. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the town's population was 7,997, reflecting a decline of 247 (-3.0%) from the 8,244 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 723 (+9.6%) from the 7,521 counted in the 1990 Census. Newton is located near the headwaters of the east branch of the <span class="loc">Paulins Kill</span>, a 41.6-mile (66.9 km) tributary of the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River. In October 1715, Colonial surveyor Samuel Green plotted a tract of 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) at the head of the <span class="loc">Paulins Kill</span>, then known as the <span class="loc">Tohokenetcunck</span> River, on behalf of <span class="loc">William Penn</span>. This tract, which would not be settled for approximately 30â€“35 years, was part of the survey and division of the Last Indian Purchase by the West Jersey Board of Proprietors. At the time of Green's survey, northwestern <span class="loc">New Jersey</span> was populated with bands of the Munsee, the northern branch of the Lenni Lenape peoples.</p>
