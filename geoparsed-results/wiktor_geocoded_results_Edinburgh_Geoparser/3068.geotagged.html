<p>Trenton is a town located in <span class="loc">Pictou County</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>. Trenton is situated on the east bank of the <span class="loc">East River of Pictou</span>, adjacent to and immediately north of the larger town of <span class="loc">New Glasgow</span>. The town's economy is tied to heavy industry and its residents are largely employed at <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> Power's Trenton Generating Station, Michelin's tire factory in <span class="loc">Granton</span>, or <span class="loc">Neenah Paper</span>'s pulp mill in <span class="loc">Abercrombie</span>. The massive TrentonWorks Ltd. facility dominates the town's waterfront, having opened in the 1870s as <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s first steel mill before being converted to focus exclusively on manufactured steel products by the late 19th century. The TrentonWorks site was used to produce railway cars throughout the entire 20th century before production ceased in 2007. Part of the facility was used as a shipyard to produce small cargo ships during both World Wars; the railcar plant was temporarily retooled during these conflicts to produce munitions. As of 2010, the facility is undergoing a $60 million conversion to produce components for wind turbines in a partnership between South Korean industrial conglomerate Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering (DMSE) and the governments of <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> and <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The end of railcar manufacturing on the TrentonWorks site saw the loss of 1300 jobs (at peak employment); it is currently hoped that the conversion to produce wind turbine components by DMSE will return employment to pre-2007 levels.</p>
