<p><span class="loc">Middleton</span> is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Rochdale</span>, <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, on the <span class="loc">River Irk</span> 5 miles (8.0 km) south-southwest of <span class="loc">Rochdale</span> and 4.4 miles (7.1 km) north-northeast of <span class="loc">Manchester city</span> centre.

Historically part of <span class="loc">Lancashire</span>, <span class="loc">Middleton</span>'s name comes from it being the centre of several circumjacent settlements.

The Flodden Window in the church's sanctuary is thought to be the oldest war memorial in the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span>, memorialising the archers of <span class="loc">Middleton</span> who fought at the Battle of <span class="loc">Flodden</span> in 1513. In 1770, <span class="loc">Middleton</span> was a village of twenty houses, but in the 18th and 19th centuries it grew into a thriving and populous seat of textile manufacture and it was granted borough status in 1886.</p>
