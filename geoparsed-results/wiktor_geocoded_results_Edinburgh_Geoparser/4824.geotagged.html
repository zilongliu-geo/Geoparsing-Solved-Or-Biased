<p>Churchill is a village and civil parish in <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is located in the unitary authority of <span class="loc">North Somerset</span>, on the western edge of the <span class="loc">Mendip Hills</span> about 8 miles (12.9 km) east of <span class="loc">Weston-super-Mare</span>. The parish, which includes the village of <span class="loc">Lower Langford</span> and the hamlet of <span class="loc">Upper Langford</span> has a population of 2,235. The village has a post office with shop and tea rooms, a fish and chip shop, a memorial hall, a doctor's surgery, a hotel, a number of bed and breakfasts, a sports centre with swimming pool, a dry ski slope and outdoor pursuits centre and four pubs: The Crown Inn, The Nelson Arms, The Stag and Hounds and The Churchill Inn. The Churchill family, who gave rise to the first Duke of Marlborough and later Sir Winston Churchill, derives its name from the parish. They had historical connections with it. The village is around the junction of the A38 and A368 and is overlooked by <span class="loc">Dolebury Warren</span>, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which has evidence of occupation of the site during the Iron Age, and Romano-British materials. In addition to the remains of double ramparts of an Iron Age hill fort still being visible there is also evidence of a medieval rabbit warren. At Dinghurst south of the village is the site of an Iron Age univallate hill fort and Roman fort.</p>
