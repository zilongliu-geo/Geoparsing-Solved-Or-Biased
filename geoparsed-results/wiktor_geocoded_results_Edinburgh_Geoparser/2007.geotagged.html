<p><span class="loc">Chur</span> or <span class="loc">Coire</span> (German: [ˈkuːr] or [ˈxuːr]; Romansh: Cuira [ˈkwerɐ] or [ˈkwoi̯rɐ]; Italian: Coira [ˈkɔi̯ɾa]; French: Coire [ˈkwaʁ]) is the capital of the Swiss canton of Graubünden and lies in the <span class="loc">Grisonian Rhine</span> Valley, where the <span class="loc">Rhine</span> turns towards the north, in the northern part of the canton. The city, which is located on the right bank of the <span class="loc">Rhine</span>, is reputedly the oldest town of <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. The official language of <span class="loc">Chur</span> is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect. Archaeological evidence of settlement at the site, in the Eastern Alps, goes back as far as the Pfyn culture (3900-3500 BC), making <span class="loc">Chur</span> one of the oldest settlements in <span class="loc">Switzerland</span>. Remains and objects from the Bronze and Iron Ages have been found also in the eastern sector of the current city's centre. The Roman Empire conquered Raetia in 15 BC. Under emperor Diocletian (late 3rd century AD), the existing settlement of Curia Raetorum was made the capital of the newly established <span class="loc">province of Raetia</span> prima. In the 4th century <span class="loc">Chur</span> became the seat of the first Christian bishopric north of the Alps. Despite a legend assigning its foundation to an alleged Briton king, St. Lucius, the first known bishop is one Asinio in 451 AD. After the invasion of the Ostrogoths, it was rechristened Theodoricopolis; in the 6th century it was conquered by the Franks. The city suffered several invasions, by the Magyars in 925-926, when the cathedral was destroyed, and by the Saracens (940 and 954), but afterwards it flourished thanks to its location, where the roads from several major Alpine transit routes come together and continue down the <span class="loc">Rhine</span>. The routes had been already used under the Romans but acquired greater importance under the Ottonian dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire. Emperor Otto I appointed his vassal Hartpert as bishop of <span class="loc">Chur</span> in 958, giving the bishopric numerous privileges. In 1170 the bishop became a prince-bishop and kept total control over the road between <span class="loc">Chur</span> and <span class="loc">Chiavenna</span>.</p>
