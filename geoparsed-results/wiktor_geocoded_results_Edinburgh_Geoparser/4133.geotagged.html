In 1824, Thomas M. Duke explored the area and reported to Stephen F. Austin, describing the Waco village: "This town is situated on the <span class="loc">West Bank</span> of the River. They have a spring almost as cold as ice itself. All we want is some Brandy and Sugar to have Ice Toddy. They have about 400 acres (1.6 km2) planted in corn, beans, pumpkins, and melons and that tended in good order. I think they cannot raise more than One Hundred Warriors."</p>
