<p><span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> is a town in the <span class="loc">Adelaide</span> Hills, south-east of <span class="loc">Adelaide</span> in <span class="loc">South Australia</span>. It is the former end of the Adelaide-Bridgewater railway line; this route was closed in 1987. The railway was converted to standard gauge in 1995 and continues to be the main line from <span class="loc">Adelaide</span> to <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, but no trains stop at the now demolished Bridgewater railway station. <span class="loc">Cox Creek</span> (named after the explorer Robert Cock, who led an expedition through this area in December 1837), runs through <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span>, and the town was originally settled as <span class="loc">Cox Creek</span>. An early use of the name "Bridgewater" was in James Addison's (ca.1819 – 26 April 1870) "Bridgewater Hotel", and the town was renamed <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> when the adjacent flour mill was built by John Dunn and the nearby land subdivided in 1857. The streets of one part of <span class="loc">Bridgewater</span> appear to have been named for Orient Line steam ships: SS <span class="loc">Omrah</span>, SS <span class="loc">Otway</span>, SS <span class="loc">Orsova</span>, SS Orontes (1902–1926), SS <span class="loc">Ophir</span>, SS <span class="loc">Otranto</span> (1909–1918), SS <span class="loc">Orvieto</span> (1909–1931), SS <span class="loc">Orotava</span> (1889–1921) (though <span class="loc">Oratava</span> Street) and SS <span class="loc">Osterley</span> (1909–1929).</p>
