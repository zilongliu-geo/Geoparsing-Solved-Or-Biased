<p>Concord is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. <span class="loc">Louis County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 16,421 at the 2010 census. It should not be confused with Concord Township or Concord Village; the CDP shares much land with both, but these areas' boundaries are not identical. Concord is located at 38°30′52″N 90°21′13″W (38.514386, -90.353666). The CDP is shaped roughly like a figure 8, with the southern loop larger and more rounded than the angular northern loop. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 5.5 square miles (14 km2), all of it land. Concord is mostly bounded by highways—by Interstate 255, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 67 (locally called Lindbergh Boulevard and co-signed here with <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 50 and <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 61), Route 21 (known locally as Tesson Ferry Road), and Route 30 (known locally as Gravois Road). Interstate 270 bisects the CDP's southern node. Most of Concord lies in the 63128 ZIP code; however, a significant northern portion is assigned to the 63123 ZIP code.</p>
