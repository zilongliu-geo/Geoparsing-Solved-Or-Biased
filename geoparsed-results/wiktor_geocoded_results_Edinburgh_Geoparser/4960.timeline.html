  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Ocampo</span> is a 3rd class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 43,523 people. Historical documents revealed that the municipality of <span class="per">Ocampo</span>, known before as Mabato-bato, was existing since <span class="date">1735</span>. Mabato-bato started as a sitio which was described as abounding with rocks and boulders of various sizes which were scattered over the place. Since <span class="date">the early 1900s</span>, the town of <span class="per">Ocampo</span> had been a part of Pili though it separated <span class="date">years</span> later, in <span class="date">1949</span>, and became an independent municipality. <span class="date">August 13, 1949</span>, marked a major event in the history of the town as this was the inauguration date of <span class="per">Ocampo</span>'s elevation into a municipality. It was also during <span class="date">this day</span> when the name <span class="loc">Matobato</span> was officially changed into <span class="per">Ocampo</span>, in honor of the late <span class="per">Don Julian Ocampo</span>, then the governor of <span class="loc">Camarines Sur</span>. <span class="per">Ocampo</span> is the place where <span class="per">Governor Luis Villafuerte</span> chose to build a sprawling deer sanctuary where at present houses different deer species from both local and foreign origins. This has served both for tourist attraction and commercial purposes.</p><br><br>
