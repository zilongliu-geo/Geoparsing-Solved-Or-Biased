  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Diego County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The population was 28,205 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The name "<span class="loc">Spring Valley</span>" may also refer to a wider area including the <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> CDP, <span class="loc">La Presa</span> and part of the neighborhood of <span class="loc">Casa de Oro</span> (which extends into <span class="loc">La Mesa</span>). There are claims that the Greater <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> area has over 100,000 residents [1] although this claims large areas that are actually unincorporated parts of <span class="loc">La Mesa</span> and <span class="loc">El Cajon</span>. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is served by the 91977 and 91978 ZIP codes. <span class="loc">Spring Valley</span> is named for the natural spring located there. It was long the home of the Kumeyaay tribe, who called it Neti or <span class="loc">Meti</span>. Spanish conquerors drove off the natives and used the area for cattle, calling it El aguaje de <span class="loc">San Jorge</span> (St. George's Spring). In <span class="date">1863</span> <span class="per">Judge Augustus S. Ensworth of San Diego</span> filed a claim for a 160 acre (647,000 mÂ²) ranch that included the spring. The ranch, and the small adobe house he built there, were sold to <span class="per">Rufus King Porter</span> and later to historian <span class="per">Hubert Howe Bancroft</span>. The adobe is <span class="date">now</span> a National Historic Landmark.</p><br><br>
