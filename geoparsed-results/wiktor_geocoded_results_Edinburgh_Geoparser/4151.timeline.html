  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Karonga</span> is a township in the <span class="loc">Karonga District</span> in <span class="loc">Northern Region</span> of <span class="loc">Malawi</span>. Located on the western shore of <span class="loc">Lake Nyasa</span>, it was established as a slaving centre sometime before <span class="date">1877</span>. As of 2008 estimates, <span class="loc">Karonga</span> has a population of 42,555. Some time before <span class="date">1877</span> <span class="loc">Karonga</span> existed as the stronghold of <span class="loc">Mlozi</span>, a famous Arab slaver. In <span class="date">1883</span> a British trading post, which formed the basis of the modern town, was opened there. British explorer Sir <span class="per">Harry Johnston</span> bought the post in <span class="date">1895</span> and ended the slave trade on <span class="loc">Lake Nyasa</span>'s western shore. At this point <span class="loc">Karonga</span> became an important commercial and agricultural center. According to Lonely Planet, the town "still bears a strong Swahili-Arab influence <span class="date">today</span>." A recent discovery of pre-historic tools and remains of hominids in <span class="loc">Malawi</span>'s remote northern district of <span class="loc">Karonga</span> provides further proof that the area could be the cradle of humankind. <span class="per">Professor Friedemann Schrenk</span> of the <span class="org">Goethe University</span> in <span class="loc">Frankfurt</span> told <span class="org">Reuters</span> News that two students working on the excavation site in <span class="date">September, 2009</span> had discovered prehistoric tools and a tooth of a hominid. "This latest discovery of prehistoric tools and remains of hominids provides additional proof to the theory that the Great Rift Valley of <span class="loc">Africa</span> and perhaps the excavation site near <span class="loc">Karonga</span> can be considered the cradle of humankind." <span class="per">Schrenk</span> said. The site also contains some of the earliest dinosaurs which lived between <span class="date">100 million and 140 million years ago</span> and early hominids believed to have lived between <span class="date">a million and 6 million years ago</span>. The discovery was at Malema excavation site 10 km (6.2 mi) from <span class="loc">Karonga</span>.</p><br><br>
