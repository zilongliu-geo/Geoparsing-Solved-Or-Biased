  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Nearly 200 people are confirmed dead and approximately <span class="date">2600</span> are ill in a central Haitian cholera outbreak, according to <span class="org">the Centers for Disease Control</span> (CDC), the <span class="org">U.S. Agency for International Development</span> (USAID) and United Nations (<span class="org">UN</span>). Haitian officials place the death toll at 194 deaths with 2,364 people being infected. According to CDC officials <span class="per">Dr. Rob Quick</span> and <span class="per">Dr. Carleene Dei</span> an eleven man team is being sent to <span class="loc">Haiti</span> to investigate and determine the best course of action for the country. <span class="org">The USAID</span> has said that they will provide supplies to set up treatment centers and have already provided 300,000 oral re-hydration kits and water purification kits. A majority of the reported cases are in the <span class="loc">Central Plateau</span> and Artibonite regions located just north of the earthquake ravaged capital, Port-Au-Prince. Officials fear that the disease could spread to the capital city if not brought under control. It has been reported that many people are flooding the St. Nicolas hospital, which is the main medical facility in <span class="per">St. Marc</span>, for treatment, causing pandemonium outside the gate. An aid worker who visited the hospital called it a "horror scene", while another worker, <span class="per">David Darg</span>, of Operation Blessing International wrote "The courtyard was lined with patients hooked up to intravenous drips. It had just rained and there were people lying on the ground on soggy sheets, half-soaked with feces."</p><br><br>
