<p><span class="loc">Woodville</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Sandusky County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,135 at the 2010 census. The National Arbor Day Foundation has designated <span class="loc">Woodville</span> as a Tree City <span class="loc">USA</span>. <span class="loc">Woodville</span> was laid out and platted in 1836. It was named for General Amos E. Wood. <span class="loc">Woodville</span> was the midway point on the Western Reserve and Maumee Turnpike, which was also known as the "Old Mud Pike" because of the thick mud that often mired animals and vehicles alike. It was the first permanent route across the Black Swamp. The toll road connected <span class="loc">Perrysburg</span> with <span class="loc">Lower Sandusky</span>, which has since been renamed <span class="loc">Fremont</span>. A mile marker from the road remains at 100 East Main Street, in front of the village pharmacy. Several of the milestones are still in place along the 31 miles (50 km) stretch between present day <span class="loc">Fremont</span> and <span class="loc">Perrysburg</span>. The route is currently designated <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 20. <span class="loc">Woodville</span> is also the point at which <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 20 crosses the <span class="loc">Portage River</span>. The former Pennsylvania Railroad also crossed the <span class="loc">Portage River</span> in <span class="loc">Woodville</span>. The line was at one time a main route from <span class="loc">Toledo</span> to <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>.</p>
