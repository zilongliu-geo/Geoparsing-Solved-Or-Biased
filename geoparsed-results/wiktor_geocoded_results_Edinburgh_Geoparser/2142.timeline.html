  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hollywood</span> (/ˈhɒliwʊd/ HOL-ee-wuud, informally Tinseltown) is a neighborhood in the central region of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. The neighborhood is notable for its place as the home of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> film industry, including several of its historic studios. Its name has come to be a metonym for the motion picture industry of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Hollywood</span> is also a highly ethnically diverse, densely populated, economically diverse neighborhood and retail business district. <span class="loc">Hollywood</span> was a small community in <span class="date">1870</span> and was incorporated as a municipality in <span class="date">1903</span>. It officially merged with the city of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span> in <span class="date">1910</span>, and soon thereafter a prominent film industry began to emerge, eventually becoming the most recognizable film industry in the world. In <span class="date">1853</span>, one adobe hut stood in <span class="loc">Nopalera</span> (Nopal field), named for the Mexican Nopal cactus indigenous to the area. By <span class="date">1870</span>, an agricultural community flourished. The area was known as the <span class="loc">Cahuenga</span> Valley, after the pass in the <span class="loc">Santa Monica Mountains</span> immediately to the north. According to the diary of <span class="per">H. J. Whitley</span>, known as the "Father of <span class="loc">Hollywood</span>", on his honeymoon in <span class="date">1886</span> he stood at the top of the hill looking out over the valley. Along came a Chinese man in a wagon carrying wood. The man got out of the wagon and bowed. The Chinese man was asked what he was doing and replied, "I holly-wood", meaning 'hauling wood.' <span class="per">H. J. Whitley</span> had an epiphany and decided to name his new town <span class="loc">Hollywood</span>. Holly would represent <span class="loc">England</span> and wood would represent his Scottish heritage. <span class="per">Whitley</span> had already started over 100 towns across the western <span class="loc">United States</span>.</p><br><br>
