<p>Lerma (formally <span class="loc">Lerma de Villada</span>) is a city and municipality located just east of <span class="loc">Toluca</span> and 54 km west of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> City in <span class="loc">Mexico</span> State, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The city was founded in the early colonial period and named after the Duke of Lerma in <span class="loc">Spain</span>. The municipal area saw two battles of the Mexican War of Independence, the Battle of <span class="loc">Monte de las Cruces</span> and the Battle of Lerma. For a time after independence, the city was the capital of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> State before it was moved to <span class="loc">Toluca</span>. The municipality is in one of the most densely populated areas of <span class="loc">Mexico</span> and is growing. Much of this growth is occurring near the <span class="loc">Toluca-Mexico City</span> highway and on the floodplains of the <span class="loc">Lerma</span> River. The latter has caused significant problems with flooding when the river overflows its banks during the rainy season. The Nahuatl name for the area is Cacamilhuacan, which translates to “crows in the field.” In the early colonial period, the area was called Santa Clara Cacamilhuacan. The municipality has both an Aztec glyph with a crow reflecting its Nahuatl name and a Spanish coat of arms.</p>
