  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Grantham</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Sullivan County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,985 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. This made <span class="per">Grantham</span> the fastest growing town numerically in <span class="loc">Sullivan County</span> between the <span class="date">2000</span> and 2010 censuses. (The neighboring town of <span class="loc">Springfield</span> grew at a higher percentage rate, due to a smaller overall population.) Incorporated in <span class="date">1761</span>, <span class="per">Grantham</span> takes its name from <span class="per">Thomas Robinson</span>, 1st <span class="per">Baron Grantham</span>, Secretary of <span class="org">State</span> for the <span class="org">Southern Department</span> from <span class="date">March 1754</span> to <span class="date">October 1755</span>. The families of <span class="loc">Howe</span>, <span class="loc">Dunbar</span> and <span class="loc">Leavitt</span> were all early <span class="per">Grantham</span> settlers. All three families secured lands in <span class="per">Grantham</span> as part of the charter granted to <span class="per">Baron Grantham</span> in <span class="date">1761</span>, and all three families "have <span class="per">Grantham</span> hills named after them," according to Elmer M. Hunt in <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Town Names And Whence They Came. "The Leavitts are said to have had at one time fifty children in attendance at the town's school, and over the <span class="date">years</span> no fewer than seventeen teachers." According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 28.1 square miles (72.8 km2), of which 27.2 square miles (70.4 km2) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.3 km2) is water, comprising 3.15% of the town. The highest point in town is <span class="loc">Grantham Mountain</span>, 2,660 feet (810 m) above sea level, a peak along the ridge of <span class="loc">Croydon Mountain</span>, which follows the western edge of the town. <span class="per">Grantham</span> lies fully within the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span> watershed. A major body of water in <span class="per">Grantham</span> is <span class="loc">Eastman</span> Pond which serves as a recreational hub of the <span class="org">Eastman Community</span>. In addition <span class="per">Grantham</span> boasts <span class="per">Anderson</span> and <span class="per">Butternut</span> ponds.</p><br><br>
