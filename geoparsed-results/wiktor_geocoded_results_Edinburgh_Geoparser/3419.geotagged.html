<p>Sibu /ˈsibuː/ (simplified Chinese: 诗巫; traditional Chinese: 詩巫; pinyin: Shīwū) is an inland town at the central region of <span class="loc">Sarawak</span> and the capital of <span class="loc">Sibu District</span> in <span class="loc">Sibu Division</span>, <span class="loc">Sarawak</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. It covers an area of 129.5 square kilometres (50.0 sq mi). It is located at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Rajang</span> and <span class="loc">Igan Rivers</span>, some 60 kilometres from the <span class="loc">South China Sea</span> and approximately 191.5 kilometres (119 mi) north-east of the state capital <span class="loc">Kuching</span>. The population is mainly dominated by Chinese especially the Fuzhou people. Other ethnic groups such as indigenous <span class="loc">Melanau</span>, <span class="loc">Malay</span>, and <span class="loc">Iban</span> are also present in this region. The town population as of the year 2010 is 162,676. <span class="loc">Sibu</span> was founded by James Brooke in 1862 when he built a fort in the town to fend off attacks by indigenous Dayak people. Following this, a small group of Chinese Hokkien people settled around the fort to carry out business activities safely in the town. In 1901, Wong Nai Siong led a large scale migration numbering 1,118 Foochow Chinese from <span class="loc">Fujian province</span> of <span class="loc">China</span> into <span class="loc">Sibu</span>. This made <span class="loc">Sibu</span> being referred popularly as "New Fuzhou". Sibu bazaar and the first hospital in <span class="loc">Sibu</span> was built by the Brooke government. Lau King Howe Hospital and a number of Methodist schools and churches were built in the 1930s. However, the town of <span class="loc">Sibu</span> was burnt to the ground twice in 1889 and in 1928 but it was rebuilt after that. There was no fierce fighting in <span class="loc">Sibu</span> during the Japanese occupation of <span class="loc">Sarawak</span> in 1941. The Japanese installed a new Resident at <span class="loc">Sibu</span> in June 1942 and <span class="loc">Sibu</span> was renamed to "Sibu-shu" in August 1942. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, <span class="loc">Sarawak</span> was ceded to the British as Crown Colony. This has caused a dissatisfaction amongst a group of young <span class="loc">Melanau</span> people in <span class="loc">Sibu</span> who were pro-independence. As a result, the second British Governor of <span class="loc">Sarawak</span>, Sir Duncan George Stewart was assassinated by Rosli Dhobi when he visited <span class="loc">Sibu</span> in December 1949. Rosli was later hanged to death at Kuching Central Prison in 1950. <span class="loc">Sibu</span> and the Rajang basin also became the centre of communist activities from 1950 and it continued even after the <span class="loc">Sarawak</span> independence in 1963. A Rajang Security Command (RASCOM) was then established to curb Communist activities in the area. Communist insurgency in <span class="loc">Sarawak</span> was significantly impaired in 1973 and later ended in 1990. <span class="loc">Sibu</span> was upgraded to the municipality status in 1981. The town received a royal visit in September 2001. The town is also a gateway to Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE) since 2008. In 2011, 110th anniversary of Foochow settlement was celebrated in <span class="loc">Sibu</span>.</p>
