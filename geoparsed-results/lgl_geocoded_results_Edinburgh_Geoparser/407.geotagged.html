<p>Fumo, free on bail, will be sentenced July 13. Former State Sen. Vincent J. Fumo is to be sentenced at 10 a.m. July 13, according to an order from <span class="loc">U.S.</span> District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter filed yesterday. Fumo is free on $2 million bail, secured by his mansion and other real estate, after a jury convicted him Monday on 137 counts of conspiracy, fraud, tax offenses, and obstruction of justice. He faces a long prison term. Prosecutors are demanding that Fumo, a Democrat, pay the federal government $4,034,106.34 in forfeiture. They pegged the loss to the Senate at $2.4 million. They said a <span class="loc">South Philadelphia</span> nonprofit, Citizens' Alliance for Better Neighborhoods, had lost $1.5 million. Fumo, they said, also should pay $115,000 to cover the cost of illegal free yacht trips he took courtesy of the Independence Seaport Museum in <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>.</p>
