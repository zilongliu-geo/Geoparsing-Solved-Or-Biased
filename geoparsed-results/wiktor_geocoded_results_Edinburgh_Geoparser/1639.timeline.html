  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cuba</span>, officially the <span class="loc">Republic of Cuba</span> (Spanish:  República de <span class="loc">Cuba</span> ), is a sovereign state comprising the islands of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>, <span class="loc">Isla de la Juventud</span> and several archipelagos in the <span class="loc">Caribbean Sea</span>. The capital and largest city <span class="loc">Havana</span> is 365 km (227 mi) from <span class="loc">Miami</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>. Geographically, <span class="loc">Cuba</span> is considered part of <span class="loc">North America</span>. Culturally, it is considered part of Latin <span class="loc">America</span>. Prior to Spanish colonization in the late 15th century, <span class="loc">Cuba</span> was inhabited by Amerindian tribes. It remained a colony of <span class="loc">Spain</span> until the Spanish–American War of <span class="date">1898</span>, which led to nominal independence as a de facto <span class="loc">U.S.</span> protectorate in <span class="date">1902</span>. As a fragile republic, <span class="loc">Cuba</span> attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of <span class="per">Fulgencio Batista</span> in <span class="date">1952</span>. Further unrest and instability led to <span class="per">Batista</span>'s ousting in <span class="date">January 1959</span> by the <span class="date">July 26</span> Movement, which afterwards established a government under the leadership of <span class="per">Fidel Castro</span>. Since <span class="date">1965</span>, the country has been governed by the Communist Party of <span class="loc">Cuba</span>. <span class="loc">Cuba</span> is the largest island in the Caribbean, and the second-most populous after <span class="loc">Hispaniola</span>, with over 11 million inhabitants. It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and customs derive from diverse origins, including the aboriginal Taíno and Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of African slaves, and a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the Cold War.</p><br><br>
