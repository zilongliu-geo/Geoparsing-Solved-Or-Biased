  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dalia (Hebrew: דַּלִיָּה) is a kibbutz in northern <span class="loc">Israel</span>. Located in the <span class="loc">Galilee</span> about 30 km southeast of <span class="loc">Haifa</span>, it falls under the jurisdiction of <span class="org">Megiddo Regional Council</span>. In <span class="date">2006</span> it had a population of 737. The kibbutz was established in <span class="date">1939</span>. Kibbutz Dalia was formed by uniting two communities affiliated with Hashomer Hatzair. The first kibbutz, "BaMa'ale", consisted of members from <span class="loc">Romania</span> and <span class="loc">Transylvania</span>. Many of them finished training in agriculture and industry in their respective countries, and were later united as a group for immigration. The first immigrants arrived in <span class="date">1933</span>, and stayed mainly in Magdiel and in <span class="loc">Kfar Malal</span> in <span class="loc">Hadar Ramatayim</span>. They worked in agriculture and other temporary jobs while waiting for permission from the Jewish Agency to settle permanently. The second kibbutz, "BaMifne" in <span class="loc">Karkur</span>, consisted of members from <span class="loc">Germany</span>. Before immigrating, most of them finished training in agriculture in <span class="loc">Denmark</span>, while others had studied in <span class="loc">Germany</span>, <span class="loc">France</span> and <span class="loc">England</span>. The first members immigrated in <span class="date">1933</span>, while other members arrived in "Bamifneh" where they worked in agriculture, mainly tending vegetable gardens in the area, about 40 dunams (40,000 m²), along with construction work at <span class="loc">Gan HaShomron</span> and porterage in <span class="loc">Haifa</span> Port. Once <span class="date">a month</span>, they went to see movies or a theater performance, and every <span class="date">three weeks</span> they went on foot to kibbutz <span class="loc">Ein Shemer</span> to listen to political lectures.</p><br><br>
