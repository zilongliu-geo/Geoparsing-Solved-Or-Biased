<p>An infectious superbug spreading in the <span class="loc">United States</span> is to "emerge in force" in <span class="loc">Canada</span>, doctors fear. The bacteria have been reported popping up in day care centers and locker rooms across the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Usually elderly or very ill hospital patients get the disease. More than 2 million <span class="loc">U.S.</span> residents are infected every year, the Centers for Disease Control estimates. An article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) on Tuesday said that Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are "spreading with alarming rapidity." The bacteria can cause boils, pimples, or in extreme cases, flesh-eating disease, and more. "The resistant bacteria is an old foe with new fangs: a pathogen combining virulence, resistance and an ability to disseminate at large," wrote Dr. John Conly, medical professor and an infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary. British <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Alberta</span>, <span class="loc">Saskatchewan</span>, <span class="loc">Manitoba</span>, and <span class="loc">Ontario</span> are the provinces which already have had MRSA in hospitals. A 30-year-old <span class="loc">Calgary</span>, <span class="loc">Alberta</span> man died last year of lung abscesses associated with the infection, as well as a three-month old toddler in <span class="loc">Toronto</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>. <span class="loc">Toronto</span> Blue Jays outfielder Alex Rios, last summer, suffered from an infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus in his leg. Pitcher Ty Taubenheim had a similar infection on his foot. Doctors are currently investigating some <span class="loc">Calgary</span> residents, who could be one of the first Canadian reports of <span class="loc">MRSA</span> outside of a hospital setting.</p>
