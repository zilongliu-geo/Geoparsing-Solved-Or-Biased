<p><span class="loc">Geneva</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Ashtabula County</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The area which would become <span class="loc">Geneva</span> was originally settled in 1805, and was incorporated as a city in 1958. It is named after <span class="loc">Geneva</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. The population was 6,215 at the 2010 census. The area which would eventually be <span class="loc">Geneva</span> was first settled in 1805 by a handful of settlers from Charlotte, <span class="loc">New York</span>. In 1806, settlers from <span class="loc">Harpersfield</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> arrived and established <span class="loc">Harpersfield</span> Township, which included the present-day townships of <span class="loc">Geneva</span>, <span class="loc">Trumbull</span> and <span class="loc">Hartsgrove</span>. However, in 1816, citizens of <span class="loc">Harpersfield</span> decided to withdraw from the township and form their own township, which then became <span class="loc">Geneva</span> Township, named after <span class="loc">Geneva</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. In 1866, the town of <span class="loc">Geneva</span> then became a village, and, nearly one hundred years later, in 1958, <span class="loc">Geneva</span> was incorporated as a city. <span class="loc">Geneva</span> is located at 41°48′0″N 80°56′45″W (41.800098, -80.945784), 45 miles (72 km) east of <span class="loc">Cleveland</span> and 55 miles (89 km) <span class="loc">west of Erie</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. The city is bordered to the north, east and west by <span class="loc">Geneva</span> Township and by <span class="loc">Harpersfield</span> Township to the south. The <span class="loc">Grand River</span> flows around <span class="loc">Geneva</span> to the south in <span class="loc">Harpersfield</span> and to the west in <span class="loc">Lake County</span>.
