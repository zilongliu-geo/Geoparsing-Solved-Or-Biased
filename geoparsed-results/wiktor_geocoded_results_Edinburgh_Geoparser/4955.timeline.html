  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Hot Springs is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Bath County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population as of the <span class="date">2010</span> Census was 738. It is located about 5 miles (8 km) southwest of Warm Springs on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 220. Hot Springs is the site of a number of resorts that make use of the springs. The area is historically important to the development of <span class="loc">Bath County</span>. As early as the mid 18th century, travelers came to use the springs. The first inn to accommodate them was built in <span class="date">1766</span> by <span class="per">Thomas Bullitt</span>. The most prominent modern resort, The Homestead, traces its origin to this inn. The Homestead, <span class="org">Mustoe House</span>, The Yard, <span class="loc">Barton Lodge</span>, <span class="org">Switchback School</span>, and Garth Newel are listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. On <span class="date">March 21, 2009</span>, two employees of the <span class="loc">The Homestead</span> were shot and killed in the hotel kitchen; the community of Hot Springs was briefly locked down under code red procedures as a security precaution. Authorities identified fellow employee Beacher Ferrel Hackney as a suspect in the killings. The slayings were the first homicides in <span class="loc">Bath County</span> since <span class="date">1983</span>. Beacher Hackney was a fugitive until his remains were later found in a wooded area near the Cascades Golf Course. The <span class="loc">Virginia</span> State Police crime lab confirmed that it was indeed Hackney's remains, closing the case.</p><br><br>
