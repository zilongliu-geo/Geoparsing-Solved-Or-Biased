  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Garita</span>, also known as <span class="per">Variadero</span>, is an unincorporated community located in <span class="loc">San</span> <span class="loc">Miguel County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The community is located on New <span class="loc">Mexico</span> State Road 104 where it crosses the <span class="loc">Conchas River</span>. It was founded in <span class="date">1872</span> by <span class="per">Jes√∫s Angel</span>, a settler from <span class="loc">Bernal</span>. <span class="per">Garita</span> has a post office with ZIP code 88421, which opened on <span class="date">January 19, 1907</span>; the post office used the name <span class="per">Variadero</span> intermittently until <span class="date">the 1920s</span>. The community's two names both come from Spanish terms; <span class="per">Variadero</span> derives from variar, meaning "to change", due to the changes in the river's course, while <span class="per">Garita</span> means "lookout" or "government building". <span class="per">Variadero</span> was initially called "Estrada" after the first settler, <span class="per">Jose Laureano</span> <span class="loc">Estrada</span>, who made a permanent home along the Conchas Arroyo around the time of the Civil War. <span class="per">Jose Laureano</span> is buried at the Catholic Cemetery across highway 104 from the Catholic Church in <span class="per">Variadero</span>. His wife, <span class="per">Filomena Estrada de Madrid</span> is buried at his side. The gravemarker is still visible for both of them and his reads "<span class="per">Jose Laureano</span> <span class="loc">Estrada</span>, <span class="date">1835</span> - <span class="date">1898</span>, The first settler of <span class="per">Variadero</span>. <span class="per">Garita</span> was settled as stated above. <span class="per">Garita</span>, however, was the name given to the huge square blocks of sandstone about eight miles southeast of <span class="per">Variadero</span> along highway 104 which reminded early settlers of a "garita" which is "sentry post" in Spanish. A small arroyo about a quarter mile northwest of the garita was named the <span class="loc">Garita</span> Creek. Later settlers made honmes to the west, along the <span class="loc">Garita</span> Creek and a small community in that area was known as <span class="per">Garita</span>. When Postal services were combined, the area developed the dual names of <span class="per">Garita</span> and <span class="per">Variadero</span>.</p><br><br>
