<p>The Town of Windsor is a Home Rule Municipality in Larimer and Weld counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. According to the 2010 Census, the population of the town was 18,644. Windsor is located in the region known as Northern <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. Windsor is situated 59 miles (95 km) north of the <span class="loc">Colorado</span> <span class="loc">State Capitol</span> in <span class="loc">Denver</span>. A rich wheat farming district, the area around Windsor first drew permanent residents in the early 1870s. Two factors were to play a critical role in stimulating Windsor's early development: irrigation and the railroad. Irrigation increased crop variety and production and the railroad shipped this bounty to market. The town was platted in 1882, the same year the Windsor Railroad Depot was built, and incorporated in 1890. It was named for the Rev. Samuel Asa Windsor. By 1900, tariffs on foreign sugar had created a market for new sources of sugar. Research in the improved cultivation of sugar beets was taking place at Colorado Agricultural College in Fort Collins, and the capital to advance production and manufacture of beet sugar was coming together. In 1903 a factory for producing sugar from sugar beets was built in Windsor. Sugar beet cultivation required large numbers of "stoop laborers", a need that was met by ethnic German immigrants from <span class="loc">Russia</span>. With large families and a strong work ethic, the German-Russians who settled in Windsor and other sugar beet areas would achieve financial success within one generation and own the highest producing beet farms. The Great Western Sugar Company fueled Windsor's economy through the mid-1960s, when the Windsor factory closed. Plentiful water and land drew Kodak to Windsor where it opened a manufacturing plant on the heels of the sugar factory's closing.</p>
