  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Casa Grande</span> (O'odham: Wainom Wo:g) is a city in <span class="loc">Pinal County</span>, approximately halfway between <span class="per">Phoenix</span> and <span class="per">Tucson</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. According to the <span class="date">2014</span> census, the population of the city is 51,478. It is named after the <span class="loc">Casa Grande Ruins National Monument</span>, which is actually located in <span class="loc">Coolidge</span>. "<span class="loc">Casa Grande</span>" is Spanish for "big house". <span class="loc">Casa Grande</span> was founded in <span class="date">1879</span> during the Arizona mining boom, specifically due to the presence of the Southern Pacific Railroad. In <span class="date">January 1880</span>, the community of Terminus, meaning "end-of-the-line," was established despite consisting of just five residents and three buildings. In <span class="date">September 1880</span>, railroad executives renamed the settlement <span class="loc">Casa Grande</span>, after the Hohokam ruins at the nearby <span class="loc">Casa Grande Ruins National Monument</span>. <span class="loc">Casa Grande</span> grew slowly, and suffered several setbacks both in <span class="date">1886</span> and <span class="date">1893</span>, when fires ravaged the town, destroying all wooden housing structures within it. When the mining boom slowed in the 1890s, the town was nearly abandoned, but with the advent of agriculture, the town remained alive and well, and was eventually incorporated in <span class="date">1915</span>.</p><br><br>
