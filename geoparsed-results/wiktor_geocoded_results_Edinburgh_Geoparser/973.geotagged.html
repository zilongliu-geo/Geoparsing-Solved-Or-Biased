There are a few farms in the area dotting <span class="loc">Ritson Road</span> and <span class="loc">Simcoe Street</span>. The village's population is about 325. Most people commute to <span class="loc">Oshawa</span> or <span class="loc">Toronto</span>. The nearest grocery store is at <span class="loc">Port Perry</span> or <span class="loc">Oshawa</span>. Columbus is about 15 minutes from <span class="loc">Oshawa</span> and 60 minutes from <span class="loc">Toronto</span>. The first settlers to the village in 1830 were surnames such as: Adams, Ashton, Roberts, Clark, Grass, Power, Perreman, <span class="loc">Wilcoxson</span> and others; of Irish descent were the Howden brothers. The community was first known as English Corners because most of the land was sold to people of some wealth, most of whom were English. When the post office was established in 1847, the community was named Columbus, possibly after the 15th century explorer Christopher Columbus. Its first postmaster was Robert Skirving.</p>
