  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Manki</span> (Kannada: ಮಂಕಿ) is a village in Honnavar Taluk, Uttara <span class="loc">Kannada district</span> of <span class="loc">Karnataka State</span>, <span class="loc">India</span>. It is located on the shore of the <span class="loc">Arabian Sea</span> and between <span class="loc">Goa</span> and <span class="loc">Mangalore</span>, about 100 km from <span class="loc">Karwar</span>. It lies on NH-66 running between <span class="loc">Mumbai</span> and <span class="loc">Mangalore</span>. Apparently, it is the largest village in <span class="loc">Karnataka</span> and second largest village in <span class="loc">India</span> where as Hadinbal is the third largest village in <span class="loc">India</span> both villages are showing brotherhood with each other and dense forest and hefty mountains. The population consists of various castes and religions including Kannadigas, Sherugars, <span class="loc">Nakhuda</span>, Nawayat, and Christians. <span class="loc">Manki</span> was a part of Hoysala Empire from <span class="date">1291</span> until <span class="date">1343</span>. Hoysala empire: Early inscriptions, dated <span class="date">1078</span> and <span class="date">1090</span>, have implied that the Hoysalas were ancestors of the Yadava by referring to the Yadava vamsa (clan) as Hoysala vamsa. But there are no early records directly linking the Hoysalas to the Yadavas of <span class="loc">North India</span>. The downfall of Hoysala resulted in the rise of another super power. <span class="loc">Manki</span> later fell into the hands of the Vijayanagara Empire.</p><br><br>
