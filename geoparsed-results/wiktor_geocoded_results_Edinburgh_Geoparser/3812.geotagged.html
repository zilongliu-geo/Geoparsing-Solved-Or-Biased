<p>Beaconsfield is an on-island suburb on the <span class="loc">Island of Montreal</span> in <span class="loc">Quebec</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Its population as of the <span class="loc">Canada</span> 2011 Census was 19,505. It is located on the north shore of Lake Saint-Louis and is bordered on the west by Baie-D'Urfé, on the north by <span class="loc">Kirkland</span> and on the east by Pointe-Claire. It was incorporated in 1910 and is named in honour of Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield, Prime Minister of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> in the 1860s and 1870s and close confidant of Queen Victoria. It is part of the Greater <span class="loc">Montreal region</span> locally referred to as the <span class="loc">West Island</span>. As part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>, <span class="loc">Beaconsfield</span> was merged into the <span class="loc">city of Montreal</span> on January 1, 2002, joining with neighbouring Baie-D'Urfé to create the <span class="loc">borough of Beaconsfield–Baie-D</span>'Urfé. After a change of government and a 2004 referendum, both of them voted to demerge and were reconstituted as independent cities on January 1, 2006. However, they remain part of the urban agglomeration of <span class="loc">Montreal</span>. The population of Beaconsfield is mostly English-speaking. Most buildings in Beaconsfield are single-family homes, with some townhouses and Montreal-style apartment buildings. It may be characterized as a bedroom community. Beaconsfield is also home to a recreation centre that contains a pool, an ice rink and a gym.</p>
