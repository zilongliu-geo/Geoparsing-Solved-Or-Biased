  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cuenca</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkweŋka]) is a city in the autonomous community of Castile–La Mancha in central <span class="loc">Spain</span>. It is the capital of the <span class="loc">province of Cuenca</span>. <span class="loc">Cuenca</span> is located across a steep spur, whose slopes descend into deep gorges of the Júcar and Huécar rivers. It is divided into two separate settlements: the "new" city is situated south-west of the old one, which is divided by the Huécar course. The climate of <span class="loc">Cuenca</span> is the typical continental Mediterranean of <span class="loc">Spain</span>'s "Meseta" (inner plateau). Winters are relatively cold, but summers are quite hot during the day with occasional cool <span class="date">nights</span>. Spring and <span class="date">autumn</span> <span class="date">seasons</span> are short, with pleasant temperatures during the day but with rather cold <span class="date">nights</span> due to its altitude from 956  m above sea level up to 1000 m in the old town. When the Iberian peninsula was part of the Roman Empire there were several important settlements in the province, such as Segóbriga, Ercávica and Gran Valeria. However, the place where <span class="loc">Cuenca</span> is located <span class="date">today</span> was uninhabited at that time.</p><br><br>
