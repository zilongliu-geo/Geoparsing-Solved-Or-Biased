  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Sorrento</span> ([s̪oˈr̺ːɛn̪t̪o]; Neapolitan: Surriento [s̪uˈr̺ːi̯en̺d̪ə]) is a town overlooking the <span class="loc">Bay of Naples</span> in Southern <span class="loc">Italy</span>. A popular tourist destination, it can be reached easily from <span class="loc">Naples</span> and <span class="loc">Pompeii</span> as it is at the south-eastern end of the Circumvesuviana rail line. The <span class="loc">Sorrentine</span> Peninsula has views of <span class="loc">Naples</span>, <span class="loc">Vesuvius</span> and the <span class="loc">Isle of Capri</span>. The <span class="loc">Amalfi</span> Drive, connecting <span class="loc">Sorrento</span> and <span class="loc">Amalfi</span>, is a narrow road that threads along the high cliffs above the <span class="loc">Tyrrhenian Sea</span>. Ferries and hydrofoils connect the town to <span class="loc">Naples</span>, <span class="loc">Amalfi</span>, <span class="loc">Positano</span>, <span class="loc">Capri</span> and <span class="loc">Ischia</span>. <span class="loc">Sorrento</span>'s sea cliffs and luxury hotels have attracted celebrities including <span class="per">Enrico Caruso</span> and <span class="per">Luciano Pavarotti</span>. Limoncello is a digestif made from lemon rinds, alcohol, water and sugar which is produced in <span class="loc">Sorrento</span>. Other agricultural production includes citrus fruit, wine, nuts and olives. The Roman name for <span class="loc">Sorrento</span> was <span class="per">Surrentum</span>. Legends indicate a close connection between <span class="per">Lipara</span> and <span class="per">Surrentum</span>, as though the latter had been a colony of the former; and even through the <span class="org">Imperial</span> period <span class="per">Surrentum</span> remained largely Greek. The oldest ruins are Oscan, dating from about <span class="date">600 BC</span>. Before its control by the Roman Republic, <span class="per">Surrentum</span> was one of the towns subject to Nuceria, and shared its fortunes up to the Social War; it seems to have joined in the revolt of <span class="date">90 BC</span> like Stabiae; and was reduced to obedience in <span class="date">the following year</span>, when it seems to have received a colony.</p><br><br>
