<p><span class="loc">Buenaventura</span> is a coastal seaport city on the department of Valle del Cauca, <span class="loc">Colombia</span> (<span class="loc">South America</span>). <span class="loc">Buenaventura</span> (Spanish for "good fortune") is the main port of <span class="loc">Colombia</span> in the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. <span class="loc">Buenaventura</span> is a city with a population of 333,194 as of the 2005 census (most of city development lies on <span class="loc">Cascajal</span> Island) and it is the size of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>' metropolitan area; most of the city's land is rural with scattered small villages throughout. It is served by the Gerardo Tobar LÃ³pez Airport. The city was founded on July 14, 1540, by Juan de Ladrilleros through orders from Pascual de Andagoya. At that time it was inhabited by the Buscajas. The city was destroyed by Native Americans before 1600; it was later rebuilt. <span class="loc">Buenaventura</span> thrived after the opening of the <span class="loc">Panama Canal</span> in 1914; and in the '50s became a regular stop over for the "International Jet Set". Today the city is crucial for sending raw materials to nearby areas; this has brought prosperity and allowed recent new development to occur. The city is, as of 2011, affected by very high levels of poverty and violence, and is considered a center for the cocaine trade in <span class="loc">Colombia</span>.</p>
