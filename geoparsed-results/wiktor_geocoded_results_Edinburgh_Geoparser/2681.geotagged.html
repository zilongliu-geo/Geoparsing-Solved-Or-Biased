<p>Harvey is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Jefferson Parish</span>, <span class="loc">Louisiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Harvey is on the <span class="loc">West Bank</span> of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River, within the New <span class="loc">Orleans–Metairie–Kenner Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 22,226 at the 2000 census. Harvey is located at 29°53′28″N 90°04′09″W. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 7.0 square miles (18 km2), of which 6.7 square miles (17 km2) is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2) (5.11%) is water. The original owner of the land was Jean-Baptiste d'Estrehan de Beaupre, royal treasurer and comptroller for the French <span class="loc">Louisiana</span> colony. His plantation slaves initially began digging the ditch that would become the <span class="loc">Harvey Canal</span>, from the banks of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River to the back of <span class="loc">Bayou Barataria</span>. Years later, the German settlers who would commence the final widening of the ditch with wooden shovels were paid off by d'Estrehan in small land parcels located down river in Mechanicsham, now the <span class="loc">city of Gretna</span>. <span class="loc">Jean Baptiste</span> d'Estrehan would settle his home where the ditch met the river banks, naming the settlement <span class="loc">Cosmopolite City</span>.</p>
