<p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in <span class="loc">Augusta County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 832 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Stauntonâ€“Waynesboro Micropolitan Statistical Area. As early as 1794, <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was platted and divided into 14 lots of 1-acre (4,000 m2) and sold by Thomas and Jane <span class="loc">Steele</span>. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> soon became a very busy stagecoach stop. This was because there were 3 major roads all intersecting at or near <span class="loc">Greenville</span>. One road connected <span class="loc">Greenville</span> with <span class="loc">Staunton</span>, another ran from <span class="loc">Waynesboro</span> to <span class="loc">Middlebrook</span>, and the south road led to Midway (now <span class="loc">Steeles Tavern</span>), <span class="loc">Fairfield</span>, and <span class="loc">Lexington</span>. The town slowly grew, and by 1810, the population had grown to 162, comparing to Staunton's 1225, and <span class="loc">Waynesboro</span>'s 250. An 1835 account of <span class="loc">Greenville</span> said that it had an extensive manufacturing flour mill and a woolen manufactory, two physicians in the area, contained 50 dwelling houses, 3 general stores, 2 taverns, 1 academy, 2 tanyards, 2 saddlers, 2 tailors, 1 blacksmith shop, 1 cabinet maker, 1 wheelwright, 1 saddle tree maker, 3 house carpenters, 1 hatter, and 4 boot and shoe makers. The population was about 250 in 1928.</p>
