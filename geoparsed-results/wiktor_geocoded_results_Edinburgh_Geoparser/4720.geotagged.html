<p>Ashley is a village and former civil parish in the <span class="loc">Borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme</span> of <span class="loc">Staffordshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 508. The village is close to the border of <span class="loc">Shropshire</span>, adjacent to Loggerheads, and is 4 miles (6 km) North East of <span class="loc">Market Drayton</span>. At the 2011 census the population had been incorporated in Loggerheads. The name means "land once cultivated and left fallow(Ley) in the near ash trees" <span class="loc">Ashley Dale</span> and <span class="loc">Jugbank</span>. Mainly sandstone cottages now mixed in with modern housing. From medieval times men have indiscriminately hacked clearings in the forests, then linked them with tracks and lanes following no specific pattern. The church of <span class="loc">St John</span> the <span class="loc">Baptist</span> possesses a 17th-century tower with the remainder built in 1860-62 by J. Ashdown of <span class="loc">London</span> in a style representative of the 13th-14th century. The church is notable for its collection of funerary art from several centuries. The spectacular tomb of Sir Gilbert Gerard (d. 1592) and his wife Anne Radcliffe (d. 1608) was later supplemented by free-standing, kneeling figures of their son, Thomas Gerard, 1st Baron Gerard and his son, Gibert 2nd Baron Gerard. This composite family group dominates the <span class="loc">Gerard</span> Chapel, on the north side of the church. This is balanced on the south side by the <span class="loc">Kinnersley</span> Chapel, containing the memorials of the Kinnersleys of <span class="loc">Clough Hall</span>. Most impressive is the sculpture of Thomas Kinnersley I, by Francis Leggatt <span class="loc">Chantrey</span>. His son and successor is commemorated by a large and elaborate structure, the work of Matthew Noble. Near to the church is a mound as yet unexcavated but thought to be a burial ground from the time of the Black Death.</p>
