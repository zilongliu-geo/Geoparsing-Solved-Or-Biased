<p><span class="loc">Porto Alegre</span> (local Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈpoɾtʊ aˈlɛɡɾɪ]; Joyful Harbour) is the capital and largest city of the Brazilian state of <span class="loc">Rio Grande do Sul</span>. Founded in 1769 by Manuel Sepúlveda, its population of 1,509,939 inhabitants (2010) makes it the tenth most populous city in the country and the centre of <span class="loc">Brazil</span>'s fourth largest metropolitan area, with 4,405,760 inhabitants (2010). The city is the southernmost capital city of a Brazilian state. <span class="loc">Porto Alegre</span> was founded in 1769 by Manuel Jorge Gomes de Sepúlveda, who used the pseudonym José Marcelino de <span class="loc">Figueiredo</span> to hide his identity; but the official date is 1772 with the act signed by immigrants from the <span class="loc">Azores</span>, <span class="loc">Portugal</span>. The vast majority of the population is of European descent. The city lies on the eastern bank of the <span class="loc">Rio Guaiba</span> (<span class="loc">Guaiba Lake</span>), where five rivers converge to form the <span class="loc">Lagoa dos Patos</span> (Lagoon of the Ducks), a giant freshwater lagoon navigable by even the largest of ships. This five-river junction has become an important alluvial port as well as a chief industrial and commercial center of <span class="loc">Brazil</span>.</p>
