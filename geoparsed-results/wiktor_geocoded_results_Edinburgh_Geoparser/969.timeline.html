  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Columbus</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Luna County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, about three miles north of the Mexican border. It is considered a place of historical interest, as the scene of the attack in <span class="date">1916</span> by Mexican revolutionary leader <span class="per">Francisco</span> "Pancho" Villa, that caused <span class="loc">America</span> to send 10,000 troops there in the Punitive Mexican Expedition. The population was 1,765 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="per">Columbus</span> was established in <span class="date">1891</span> just across the Mexican border from <span class="loc">Palomas</span>, Chihuahua, <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, and named after 15th century explorer <span class="per">Christopher Columbus</span>. In <span class="date">1902</span>, the village was moved three miles north when the <span class="loc">El Paso</span> and Southwestern Railroad built its <span class="loc">Columbus</span> Station. This Station is <span class="date">now</span> converted into a museum run by the <span class="org">Columbus Historical Society</span>. Around <span class="date">1905</span>, it was a very small town with a community of a hundred residents, two of those early settlers being <span class="per">Colonel Andrew O. Bailey</span>, and <span class="per">Louis Heller</span>. By this time, <span class="per">Columbus</span> had only one general store, a saloon, and a society inspector. In time, a high school was built, and Perrow G. <span class="loc">Mosely</span> established the <span class="per">Columbus</span> News, which later was renamed as the <span class="per">Columbus</span> Courier. By <span class="date">1915</span>, the town had seven hundred residents, the <span class="loc">Columbus</span> <span class="loc">State Bank</span> was built, four hotels were constructed, several stores and a Baptist church were also established. At that time, <span class="per">Columbus</span> also possessed rich silver, copper, lead, and zinc deposits.</p><br><br>
