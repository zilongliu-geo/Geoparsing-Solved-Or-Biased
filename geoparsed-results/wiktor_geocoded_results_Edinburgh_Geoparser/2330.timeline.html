  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dayton is a town in <span class="loc">Marengo County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 52 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, down from 60 in <span class="date">2000</span>. Dayton began to be settled in the early 19th century, with a town survey done and a "public well" established in <span class="date">1832</span>. The post office was established in <span class="date">1837</span>. It was incorporated on <span class="date">January 13, 1844</span>. A devastating tornado hit the town in <span class="date">1852</span>. By <span class="date">1860</span> the town had male and female academies, a hotel, cotton gin, oil mill, blacksmith shop, tavern, cabinet shop, drug store, and several general merchandise stores. The town also had several large homes, though most are <span class="date">now</span> gone. One of the survivors, the <span class="org">William Poole House</span>, is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. The decrease in agricultural activity over <span class="date">the last century</span> has reduced the population to a fraction of what it once was.
