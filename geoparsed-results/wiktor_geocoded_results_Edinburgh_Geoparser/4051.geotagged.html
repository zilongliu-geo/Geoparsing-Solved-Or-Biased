<p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 23,068. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Monroeville</span>. Its name is in honor of James Monroe, fifth President of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is a dry county, in which the sale of alcoholic beverages is restricted or prohibited, but <span class="loc">Frisco City</span> and <span class="loc">Monroeville</span> are wet cities. For thousands of years the area was inhabited by indigenous peoples. In historic times, it was primarily the territory of the Creek peoples, who became known to European-American settlers as one of the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was established by European Americans on June 29, 1815. It is known as the county older than the state. Most of the original European-American settlers were of English descent and came from the states of Virginia, <span class="loc">Georgia</span> and the <span class="loc">Carolinas</span>. The prominent <span class="loc">Upper Creek</span> chief, <span class="loc">Red Eagle</span> (also known as William Weatherford) of the prominent Wind Clan, settled here after the Creek War (1813-1814), where he established a successful plantation. He was of Creek and European descent, and had adopted chattel slavery as a planter and horse breeder. Most of the Creek people were removed from <span class="loc">Alabama</span> to Indian Territory (now <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>) in the 1830s. The area was settled by European Americans, who brought slave workers with them, or purchased more after acquiring land.</p>
