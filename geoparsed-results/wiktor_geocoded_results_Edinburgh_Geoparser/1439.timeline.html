  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Grafton County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, in the White Mountains Region. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> is located at the convergence of the <span class="per">Pemigewasset</span> and <span class="per">Baker</span> rivers. The population was 6,990 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is home to <span class="org">Plymouth State University</span>, <span class="org">Speare Memorial Hospital</span>, and <span class="org">Plymouth Regional High School</span>. The town's central settlement, where 4,456 people resided at the <span class="date">2010</span> census (primarily <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> State students), is defined as the <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> census-designated place (CDP), and is located along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 3, south of the confluence of the <span class="per">Baker</span> and <span class="per">Pemigewasset</span> rivers. <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> was originally the site of an Abenaki village that was burned to the ground by Captain <span class="per">Thomas Baker</span> in <span class="date">1712</span>. This was just one of the many British raids on American Indian settlements during <span class="per">Queen Anne</span>'s War. Part of a large plot of undivided land in the <span class="loc">Pemigewasset</span> Valley, the town was first named <span class="loc">New Plymouth</span>, after the original <span class="loc">Plymouth Colony</span> in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. Colonial Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span> granted <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> to settlers from <span class="loc">Hollis</span>, all of whom had been soldiers in the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span>. Some had originally come from <span class="loc">Plymouth</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. The town was incorporated in <span class="date">1763</span>. Parts of <span class="loc">Hebron</span> and <span class="loc">Campton</span> were annexed in <span class="date">1845</span> and <span class="date">1860</span>.</p><br><br>
