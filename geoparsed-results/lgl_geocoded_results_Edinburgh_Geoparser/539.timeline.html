Police received a call about 10 a.m. that <span class="per">Christensen</span> was lying near the bottom of an exterior stairway next to an alley. Winona police and the <span class="org">Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension</span> responded. An autopsy will be done, and the investigation is continuing. On <span class="date">March 7</span>, police found <span class="per">Kellen Donald Coatney</span> dead at the base of a slippery shed roof.
