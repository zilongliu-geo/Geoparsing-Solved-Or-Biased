  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Buenaventura</span> is a coastal seaport city on the department of <span class="per">Valle del Cauca</span>, <span class="loc">Colombia</span> (<span class="loc">South America</span>). <span class="loc">Buenaventura</span> (Spanish for "good fortune") is the main port of <span class="loc">Colombia</span> in the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. <span class="loc">Buenaventura</span> is a city with a population of 333,194 as of the <span class="date">2005</span> census (most of city development lies on <span class="loc">Cascajal</span> Island) and it is the size of <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>' metropolitan area; most of the city's land is rural with scattered small villages throughout. It is served by the <span class="per">Gerardo Tobar</span> LÃ³pez Airport. The city was founded on <span class="date">July 14, 1540</span>, by <span class="per">Juan de Ladrilleros</span> through orders from <span class="per">Pascual de Andagoya</span>. At that time it was inhabited by the Buscajas. The city was destroyed by Native Americans before <span class="date">1600</span>; it was later rebuilt. <span class="loc">Buenaventura</span> thrived after the opening of the <span class="loc">Panama Canal</span> in <span class="date">1914</span>; and in <span class="date">the '50s</span> became a regular stop over for the "International Jet Set". <span class="date">Today</span> the city is crucial for sending raw materials to nearby areas; this has brought prosperity and allowed recent new development to occur. The city is, as of <span class="date">2011</span>, affected by very high levels of poverty and violence, and is considered a center for the cocaine trade in <span class="loc">Colombia</span>.</p><br><br>
