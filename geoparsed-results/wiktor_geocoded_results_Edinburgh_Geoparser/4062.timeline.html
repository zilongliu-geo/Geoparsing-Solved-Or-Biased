  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Tanta</span> (Egyptian Arabic: طنطا Ṭanṭa  pronounced [ˈtˤɑntˤɑ], Coptic: ⲧⲁⲛⲧⲁⲑⲟ) is a city in <span class="loc">Egypt</span>. It is the country's fifth largest populated area, with an estimated 429,000 inhabitants (<span class="date">2008</span>). <span class="loc">Tanta</span> is located 94 km (58 mi) north of <span class="loc">Cairo</span> and 130 km (81 mi) southeast of Alexandria. The capital of the Gharbia Governorate, it is a centre for the cotton-ginning industry and the main railroad hub of the <span class="loc">Nile Delta</span>. <span class="loc">Tanta</span> is known for its sweets, eaten during the mulid (Arabic: المولد‎) festivals. The main streets are Al-Bahr (Algeish) Street, Al-Galaa Street, Al-Nahaas Street, <span class="per">Hassan Radwan</span> Street, <span class="per">Saeed Street</span> and <span class="per">El-Helw</span> Street. <span class="loc">Tanta</span> has cotton ginning factories and textile industries, and is also a university town (<span class="org">Tanta University</span> since <span class="date">1972</span>) and an institute attached to the Al-Azhar University in <span class="loc">Cairo</span> as well as the seat of a Metropolitan of the Coptic Church. This city comes to life in <span class="date">late October</span> at the end of the cotton harvest. About two million people from around the <span class="org">Delta</span> and other parts of the Arab world come for the Moulid of Sayid Ahmed el-Badawi, which is an eight-day celebration. The moulid is centered around the <span class="per">Mosque</span> and <span class="per">Tomb</span> of Sayid Ahmed el <span class="loc">Badawi</span>. El Badawi was the founder of one of <span class="loc">Egypt</span>'s largest Sufi orders called Badawiya. He was born in <span class="loc">Morocco</span>, but emigrated to <span class="loc">Arabia</span>. He was sent to <span class="loc">Tanta</span> in <span class="date">1234</span> as a representative of the order from <span class="loc">Iraq</span>. He was given permission to start a new order in <span class="loc">Tanta</span> and it soon flourished. His tomb was destroyed in the mid-nineteenth century but another was built and is the center of the festival. During the festival many sugar-coated nuts called 'hubb el 'Aziz' ('seeds of the Beloved Prophet') are eaten. They have been considered a delicacy since ancient times. The <span class="org">Museum of Tanta</span> contains collections from the present day back to Pharaonic times.</p><br><br>
