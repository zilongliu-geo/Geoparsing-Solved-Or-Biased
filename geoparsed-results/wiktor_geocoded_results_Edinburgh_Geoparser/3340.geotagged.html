<p><span class="loc">Milford</span> is an incorporated rural community located in North Central <span class="loc">Texas</span>, in the southwestern corner of <span class="loc">Ellis County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 728 in 2010. The town is located approximately 14 miles (22 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Hillsboro</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span> and 20 miles (32 km) south of Waxahachie, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 77 and Interstate 35E; <span class="loc">U.S.</span> 77 is signed locally as the town's Main Street. The community received media attention due to a Chevron gas pipeline explosion and resulting town evacuation which occurred in 2013. <span class="loc">Milford</span> dates back to the 1850s, when several men from <span class="loc">Cherokee County</span> came to the <span class="loc">Mill Creek</span> valley and bought land at 50 cents an acre from <span class="loc">Ellis County</span> landowner Arvin Wright. <span class="loc">Milford</span> was named by William R. Hudson after a factory town in <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. During 1853 the first house, a combined residence and general store belonging to William R. Hudson was built, along with a two story schoolhouse which served as church and community hall until it burned during the Civil War. In 1854 Wright, Hudson, and J.M. Higgins laid out town lots atop a ridge. In 1857, a gristmill began operation at the community. <span class="loc">Milford</span> was incorporated in 1888, with W.R. McDaniel serving as the first mayor. In 1890, the tracks of the <span class="loc">Dallas</span> and Waco Railway (later acquired by the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad) reached the community, which became an important shipping point for area cotton farmers.</p>
