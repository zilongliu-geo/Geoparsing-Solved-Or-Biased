  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Alberton</span> (<span class="date">2011</span> Town Population 1,135; UA population 1,135) is a Canadian town located in the western part of <span class="loc">Prince County</span>, <span class="loc">Prince Edward Island</span>. It is situated in the township of Lot 5. <span class="loc">Alberton</span> is a service centre for local fishing and farming communities, and is adjacent to the community and harbour of <span class="loc">Northport</span>. The area was long settled by the Mi'kmaq Nation. Europeans first ventured to the area in <span class="date">1534</span> when French explorer <span class="per">Jacques Cartier</span> recorded making landfall at nearby <span class="loc">Cape Kildare</span> during his journey of discovery in the Gulf of <span class="loc">St. Lawrence</span> and St. <span class="loc">Lawrence River</span>. Acadians settled on the island in small numbers through the 17th and 18th <span class="date">centuries</span> but only moved in greater numbers to the western part of Ile-Saint-Jean and specifically north of present-day <span class="loc">Alberton</span> to the Tignish area following their expulsion by British military forces in the late 1750s. Following British victory over <span class="loc">France</span>, the island's sovereignty passed to <span class="loc">Britain</span> in <span class="date">1763</span>. In <span class="date">1765</span>, Captain <span class="per">Samuel Holland</span> surveyed the island and the British government instituted a feudal system of land ownership. The township of Lot 5, which contains present-day <span class="loc">Alberton</span>, was granted to <span class="per">Edward Lewis</span>, a British Member of Parliament in the <span class="date">1767</span> land lottery.</p><br><br>
