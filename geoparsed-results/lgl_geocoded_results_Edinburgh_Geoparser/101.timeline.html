  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Home hit by fire a second time. <span class="loc">BYESVILLE</span> -- Firefighters are searching for the cause of a blaze <span class="date">Monday morning</span> that heavily damaged an Indian Lake Road residence <span class="date">approximately 14 months</span> after a house at that same address was destroyed by fire. A spokesperson for the <span class="org">Byesville Volunteer Fire Department</span> said the cause may be electrical, but the fire remains under investigation. The fire at the home of Rose Bench, 9025 Indian Lake Road, was first reported at approximately 8 a.m. It is believed to have started in the garage under the home. The <span class="org">Guernsey County Sheriff's Office</span> reported receiving multiple 911 calls advising of the blaze. Neighbors were concerned <span class="org">Bench</span> may have still been inside the home. A crew from United Ambulance was reportedly the first emergency responders to arrive on scene. "The neighbors tried to get inside, but they were unable to open the door," said <span class="org">Steve Helton of United Ambulance</span>. "We went around and kicked in the back door, but the smoke was already almost to the floor. "We got as low as possible and went inside where we were able to yell for anybody inside, but there was no response," added <span class="loc">Helton</span>, who is also a <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> firefighter, of the effort to locate <span class="org">Bench</span>. Working with <span class="loc">Helton</span> was fellow United Ambulance employee and firefighter Ron Brokaw. A dispatcher with the sheriff's office located <span class="org">Bench</span> <span class="date">a short time</span> later at her place of employment. Firefighters launched an initial attack on the flames through the kitchen located above the garage and then through the garage until the flames were knocked down. Providing mutual aid at the scene were firefighters from the <span class="loc">Cambridge</span>, <span class="loc">Pleasant City</span> and <span class="loc">Lore City</span> departments. A search of the home was conducted once the flames were under control and a recovery effort was later launched to remove salvageable items from the home. In addition to the heavy fire damage, the house sustained extensive smoke and water damage. A <span class="date">2006</span> <span class="org">Dodge</span> Dakota truck parked in the garage was also heavily damaged. No firefighters were injured fighting the fire. Firefighters cleared the scene at approximately 10:30 a.m. In <span class="date">January 2008</span>, a fire at a home at that same location destroyed the residence and injured a neighbor, who later succumbed to his injuries. Neighbors reported construction to replace the home had just recently finished. The <span class="org">American Red Cross</span> Disaster Team responded to the scene to assist <span class="org">Bench</span>, according to <span class="per">Caroline Johnson</span>, chapter office manager. Sheetz in <span class="loc">Cambridge</span> also provided coffee and donuts for firefighters and emergency responders at the scene.</p><br><br>
