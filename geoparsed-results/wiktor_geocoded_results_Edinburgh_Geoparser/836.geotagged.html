<p><span class="loc">Manchester</span> is a small incorporated town in northeastern <span class="loc">Carroll County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located just south of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> state line and north of <span class="loc">Baltimore</span>. The population was 4,808 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Manchester</span> was incorporated in 1834 and is the second oldest incorporated area in <span class="loc">Carroll County</span> after <span class="loc">Westminster</span>, which was incorporated in 1818. The town was originally formed as a part of <span class="loc">Baltimore County</span>, before the creation of <span class="loc">Carroll County</span> in 1837. It is governed by an elected mayor and an elected five-person town council. <span class="loc">Manchester</span> lies in the humid continental climate region, marked by cold and snowy winters but humid and hot summers. This climate is ideal for growing farmed crops in the summer such as sweet corn and squash, leaving much of the outlying area marked with large tracts of farmland. <span class="loc">Manchester</span> is a rural commuting town where residents travel to work in the greater <span class="loc">Baltimore Metropolitan</span> Area and the greater <span class="loc">Washington Metropolitan</span> Area. The Town of <span class="loc">Manchester</span>, officially incorporated in 1834, was originally known as "<span class="loc">Manchester</span> <span class="loc">Germantown</span>". However, the name <span class="loc">Germantown</span> referred to a community west of <span class="loc">Manchester</span> that was later incorporated with the town. The town was originally laid out in <span class="loc">Baltimore County</span> and remained a part of that county until the creation of <span class="loc">Carroll County</span> on January 19, 1837.</p>
