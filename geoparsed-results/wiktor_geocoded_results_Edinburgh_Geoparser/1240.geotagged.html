<p><span class="loc">Hartford</span> is the capital of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> and the historic seat of <span class="loc">Hartford County</span> until <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> disbanded county government in 1960. As of the 2010 Census, <span class="loc">Hartford</span>'s population was 124,775, making it Connecticut's fourth-largest city after the coastal <span class="loc">cities of Bridgeport</span>, <span class="loc">New Haven</span>, and <span class="loc">Stamford</span>. Nicknamed the "Insurance Capital of the World", <span class="loc">Hartford</span> houses many insurance company headquarters, and insurance remains the region's major industry. Founded in 1637, <span class="loc">Hartford</span> is among the oldest cities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Hartford</span> is home to the nation's oldest public art museum, the Wadsworth Atheneum; the oldest publicly funded park, <span class="loc">Bushnell</span> Park; the oldest continuously published newspaper, The <span class="loc">Hartford</span> Courant; the second-oldest secondary school, Hartford Public; Trinity College, an elite, private liberal arts college, and the Mark Twain House where the author wrote his most famous works and raised his family, among other historically significant attractions. In 1868, resident Mark Twain wrote, "Of all the beautiful towns it has been my fortune to see this is the chief." Following the American Civil War, <span class="loc">Hartford</span> was the richest city in the <span class="loc">United States</span> for several decades. Today, <span class="loc">Hartford</span> is one of the poorest cities in the nation with 3 out of every 10 families living below the poverty line. In sharp contrast, the <span class="loc">Hartford</span> metropolitan area is ranked 32nd of 318 metropolitan areas in total economic production and 7th out of 280 metropolitan statistical areas in per capita income. Highlighting the socio-economic disparity between <span class="loc">Hartford</span> and its suburbs, 83% of <span class="loc">Hartford</span>'s jobs are filled by commuters from neighboring towns who earn over $80,000, while 75% of <span class="loc">Hartford</span> residents who commute to work in other towns earn just $40,000.</p>
