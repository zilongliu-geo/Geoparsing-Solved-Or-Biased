<p><span class="loc">Seaforth</span> (2001 population: 2300) is a Southern <span class="loc">Ontario</span> community in the municipality of <span class="loc">Huron</span> East, in <span class="loc">Huron County</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. Originally known as <span class="loc">Four Corners</span> and <span class="loc">Steene</span>'s Corners after an early settler, much of the area of what is now <span class="loc">Seaforth</span> was acquired by brothers Christopher and George Sparling in anticipation of the construction of the Buffalo, <span class="loc">Brantford</span> and <span class="loc">Goderich Railway</span>. Developer James Patton of <span class="loc">Barrie</span> purchased the land and laid out a townsite in 1855. In many ways, <span class="loc">Seaforth</span> is the quintessential small <span class="loc">Ontario</span> town. The Victorian streetscape stands as a testament to the town's rich history and all the image and influences that make rural <span class="loc">Ontario</span> and its hierarchy of small urban centres so unique. Seaforth's Main Street is a Provincially Designated Heritage Conservation District, and architectural critics consider it to be one of the finest late 19th century streetscapes remaining in the Province. The name 'Seaforth' may be derived from the Scottish Seaforth Highlanders regiment or <span class="loc">Loch Seaforth</span> in the <span class="loc">Outer Hebrides</span> of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. A post office was established in <span class="loc">Seaforth</span> in 1859. Incorporation as a Village followed in 1868 and as a Town in 1874. In 2001, <span class="loc">Seaforth</span> was amalgamated with <span class="loc">Brussels</span>, Grey Township, <span class="loc">McKillop</span> Township and Tuckersmith Township to form the Municipality of <span class="loc">Huron</span> East.</p>
