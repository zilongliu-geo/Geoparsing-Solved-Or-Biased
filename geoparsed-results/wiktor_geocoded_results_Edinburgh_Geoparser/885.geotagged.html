<p>Wilson is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Menominee County</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Wilson is located in Harris Township along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 2 (<span class="loc">US</span> 2), <span class="loc">US</span> 41 and the Canadian National Railway, 4.5 miles (7.2 km) east-northeast of Powers. Wilson has a post office with ZIP code 49896. The <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and North Western Railway built a station at the community in 1872–73 to serve local charcoal kilns, which was originally called Ferry Switch. The first school in Wilson opened in 1881–82. A post office, originally called <span class="loc">Myra</span>, opened in the community on February 24, 1881; Daniel McIntyre was the first postmaster. The post office was renamed to Wilson on November 1, 1881, after local sawmill owner Frank D. Wilson, who then became postmaster. The railway station closed in 1950. The central buildings in the rural Wilson community are the Seventh-day Adventist Church and school. Wilson is home to the largest Adventist church in the Upper Peninsula of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. The church also operates a Junior Academy, enrolling grades 1 – 10. In the early 1900s, a group of Adventists from <span class="loc">Wisconsin</span> moved into the area and began farming. A church was erected in 1908 and services were originally held in French. The first minister was R.J. Bellows. In 1948, a furnace fire caused the church to be demolished, however, a new church was built and completed in 1949.</p>
