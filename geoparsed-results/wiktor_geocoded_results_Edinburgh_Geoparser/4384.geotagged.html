<p>Rode (formerly Road) is a village in <span class="loc">Somerset</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> located 5 miles (8.0 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Frome</span> and 5 miles (8.0 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Trowbridge</span>. The village was formerly in <span class="loc">Wiltshire</span>, before being transferred to neighbouring <span class="loc">Somerset</span>. The village lies within a mile of the Wiltshire border and is the easternmost settlement in <span class="loc">Somerset</span>. The Wiltshire village of <span class="loc">Southwick</span> is only 2 miles (3 km) to the east. Facilities in the village include a village school, pre-school, shop/post office, physiotherapy and acupuncture clinic and a cricket club, which was founded in about 1895. There used to be several mills in the village, one of which has now been converted into The Mill pub. Other pubs in Rode are The <span class="loc">Cross Keys</span> and The Bell. Until 1962, the village was home to Fussell's Brewery, which grew up behind the <span class="loc">Cross Keys</span> Inn. It continued to be used a bottling plant and distribution depot by Bass until 1992. The site was eventually sold off to a housing developer despite strong opposition from residents, as was the old site of Rode Tropical Bird Gardens, an animal sanctuary and small zoo, which closed its doors to the public in 2001.</p>
