  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Duba</span> (Arabic: ضبا‎) is a small city on the northern <span class="loc">Red Sea</span> coast, of <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span>. It is in <span class="loc">Tabuk Province</span>. Local citizens describe it as The Pearl of the <span class="loc">Red Sea</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Duba</span> is about 22,000. The first reference to <span class="loc">Duba</span>, under this name, is from <span class="date">1203</span>. However, the Valley of Salma and Valley of Kafafah were already known <span class="date">many centuries before</span>. The ancient Greek scholar Ptolemy mentioned a trade route leading from Kafafah to Lihyan (<span class="date">today</span>'s Al-`Ula). Sheikh Abdulghani <span class="per">Al Nabulsi</span> wrote about <span class="loc">Duba</span> in <span class="date">1790</span>, in his account of going to Mecca for the Hajj. Historically it is part of <span class="loc">Madian</span>; the city is mentioned in Islamic scriptures. According to the Quran, Prophet Moussa settled in <span class="loc">Madian</span> (the region starts from <span class="loc">Jordan</span> river and extends to the town of <span class="loc">Duba</span>) where Prophet Shoaib hosted him. The town of Prophet Shoaib as it is called is said to be located near <span class="loc">Maqna</span> where an ancient well can still be seen. The well is said to be the one where <span class="loc">Moussa</span> fed Shoaib's flock.</p><br><br>
