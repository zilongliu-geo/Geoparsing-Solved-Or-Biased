<p><span class="loc">Nashville</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Howard County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,627 at the 2010 census. The city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Howard County</span>. <span class="loc">Nashville</span> is situated at the base of the Ouachita foothills and was once a major center of the peach trade in southwest <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. Today the land is mostly given over to cattle and chicken farming. The world's largest dinosaur trackway was discovered near the town in 1983. <span class="loc">Mine Creek</span> Baptist Church was built along the banks of <span class="loc">Mine Creek</span> by the Rev. Isaac Cooper Perkins (1790–1852) in the area where <span class="loc">Nashville</span> now stands around 1835. Settlers later established a post stop along the settlement roads in 1840, and a post office incorporated in 1848. Michael Womack (1794–1861), a <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> native reputed to have killed the British General Edward Packenham during the War of 1812, settled in the area with his family in 1849. The area was then known by locals as <span class="loc">Mine Creek</span>, but was also called Hell's Valley and <span class="loc">Pleasant Valley</span>. Settlement in the area progressed slowly but steadily, though industry declined during the American Civil War. Following the war, the village's prospects improved, industry and settlement picked up, and the town was officially incorporated as <span class="loc">Nashville</span> on 18 October 1883, with D.A. Hutchinson serving as the first mayor. Womack is attributed with first proposing the name and called the town after <span class="loc">Nashville</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. The following year, Nashville and Hope were connected via railroad, spurring further growth, and the county seat was relocated from <span class="loc">Center Point</span> to <span class="loc">Nashville</span>. With the establishment of county government in the town, and due to the increased trade and access brought by the railroad, <span class="loc">Nashville</span> continued to grow. The town had a population of 928 in 1900, and boasted "a cotton-compress and gin" and a "bottling-works"; by 1920 the population had risen to 2,144.</p>
