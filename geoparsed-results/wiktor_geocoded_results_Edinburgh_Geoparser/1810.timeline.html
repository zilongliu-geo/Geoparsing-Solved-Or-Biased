  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Littleton</span> (historically Nipmuc: <span class="loc">Nashoba</span>) is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,924 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. For geographic and demographic information on the neighborhood of <span class="loc">Littleton Common</span>, please see the article <span class="loc">Littleton Common</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>. <span class="loc">Littleton</span> was first settled by white settlers in <span class="date">1686</span> and was officially incorporated by act of the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> on <span class="date">November 2, 1714</span>. The town was also the location of the sixth Praying Indian village established by <span class="per">John Eliot</span> called <span class="loc">Nashoba</span> Plantation, on the land between Lake Nagog and Fort Pond. <span class="per">Daniel Gookin</span>, in his Historical Collections of the Indians in <span class="loc">New England</span>, (<span class="date">1674</span>) chapter vii. says: Nashobah is the sixth praying Indian town. This village is situated, in a manner, in the centre, between <span class="loc">Chelmsford</span>, <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, <span class="loc">Groton</span> and <span class="org">Concord</span>. It lieth from <span class="loc">Boston</span> about twenty-five miles west north west. The inhabitants are about ten families, and consequently about fifty souls. At the time of <span class="per">King Philip</span>'s War, the General Court ordered the Indians at <span class="loc">Nashoba</span> to be interned in <span class="org">Concord</span>. A short while later, Concordians who were hostile to the <span class="loc">Nashoba</span> solicited some Militia to remove them to <span class="loc">Deer Island</span>. Around this time, fourteen armed men of <span class="loc">Chelmsford</span> went to the outlying camp at Wameset (near Forge Pond) and opened fire on the unsuspecting <span class="loc">Nashoba</span>, wounding five women and children and killing outright the only son of <span class="per">John Tahattawan</span>, a boy <span class="date">twelve years</span> old. For much of the war, Praying Indians were rounded up and sent to <span class="loc">Deer Island</span>. When increasing numbers of <span class="loc">Massachusetts Bay</span> officers began successfully using Praying Indians as scouts in the war, sentiment of the white settlers turned. In <span class="date">May, 1676</span>, the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> ordered that Praying Indians be removed from <span class="loc">Deer Island</span>. Still, many perished of starvation and disease. Upon their release, most survivors moved to <span class="loc">Natick</span> and sold their land to white settlers.</p><br><br>
