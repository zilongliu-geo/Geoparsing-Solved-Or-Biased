<p><span class="loc">Baga</span> is a town in the northeastern Nigerian state of <span class="loc">Borno</span>, close to <span class="loc">Lake Chad</span>, and lying northeast of the town of <span class="loc">Kukawa</span>. It is located within the Kukawa Local Government Area. The town is approximately 196km from <span class="loc">Maiduguri</span>, the capital of <span class="loc">Borno State</span>. The "Doron Baga" fish market, as of 2000, was located about six kilometres from the town. <span class="loc">Baga</span> used to lie on the border of <span class="loc">Lake Chad</span> and was a fishing center itself in the 1960s and 1970s, but the diminishing size of the lake has caused fishermen to move, and others have turned to subsistence farming. In April 2013, over 185 people were killed and over 2000 homes in <span class="loc">Baga</span> were destroyed as a result of fighting between the Nigerian military and the Boko Haram Islamist group. In January 2015, Boko Haram again attacked the town, seizing it and the military base used by a multinational force set up to fight them. The town was burned and the people massacred — perhaps 2000 deaths — the largest such massacre in Boko Haram's history. Some residents escaped to nearby <span class="loc">Chad</span>.</p>
