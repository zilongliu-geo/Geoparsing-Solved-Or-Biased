<p><span class="loc">Jamestown</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cloud County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 286. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was founded in 1878, and was incorporated as a city in 1883. It was named for either Senator James Pomeroy, or James P. Pomeroy, a railroad official. A post office was opened in <span class="loc">Alva</span> (an extinct town) in 1871, but it was moved to <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> in 1878. <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was located on the Missouri Pacific Railroad. History repeated itself on January 28, 2000 when another fire consumed several buildings on Main Street and spread to the city hall. And again, history repeated itself as the town rebuilt. Mayor Judy Hill stated, "A fire like that can destroy a small town, but instead it ignited a community spirit here." In a few days, <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was having town meetings to make plans for the future. The funeral home in <span class="loc">Jamestown</span> was selected as the temporary city office and meeting place. More than 50 people (out of a population of 307 at the time) came to town meetings there and the citizens organized into several committees to begin work.</p>
