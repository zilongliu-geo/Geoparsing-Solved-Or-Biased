Surrounded on all sides by the town of <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, the city is the county seat of <span class="loc">Chenango County</span>. The name is taken from <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Its population was 7,190 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Lt. Warren Eaton Airport</span> (OIC), serving the area, is located north of the city in the town of <span class="loc">North Norwich</span>. The first settlers arrived around <span class="date">1788</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Norwich</span> was formed in <span class="date">1793</span> from the towns of Union (<span class="date">now</span> in <span class="loc">Broome County</span>) and <span class="loc">Bainbridge</span>. Afterwards, <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, as a "mother town" of the county, lost substantial territory in the formation of new towns. In <span class="date">1806</span>, <span class="loc">Norwich</span> gave up territory to form the towns of <span class="loc">Pharsalia</span>, <span class="loc">Plymouth</span> and Preston. More of <span class="loc">Norwich</span> was lost in <span class="date">1807</span> to form parts of the towns of <span class="loc">New Berlin</span> and <span class="loc">Columbus</span>. In <span class="date">1808</span> and <span class="date">1820</span>, <span class="loc">Norwich</span> exchanged territory with the town of Preston. The central community of <span class="loc">Norwich</span> set itself off from the town in <span class="date">1816</span> by incorporating as a village, later becoming the <span class="loc">city of Norwich</span> in <span class="date">1914</span>.</p><br><br>
