  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Belmont</span> is an area of the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of Harrow. The area is named after the mound, constructed in the early 18th century by <span class="per">Henry James Brydges</span> - <span class="per">Earl of Carnarvon</span> and first <span class="per">Duke of Chandos</span>. He had a <span class="date">summer</span> house built atop the mound for the wonderful view. The mound, or mount, is <span class="date">now</span> the Stanmore Golf Course. <span class="loc">Belmont</span> is a suburban residential district and was formerly served by <span class="loc">Belmont</span> station, on a railway single-line branch running from Harrow &amp; <span class="loc">Wealdstone</span> station to <span class="loc">Stanmore</span> Village railway station. The line was known locally as The Rattler, a term first coined by <span class="per">Pete Knobbler</span>. The site of the station is <span class="date">now</span> a car park. What may remain of the platform and track lies beneath tons of earth and rubble used to bring the car park up to street level. <span class="loc">Belmont</span> Circle provides the main focus of the area, being a large, circular parade of that intersects <span class="per">Kenton Lane</span>. Many of the outlets are <span class="date">now</span> food related, with a few bars and a club completing the lineup. What was formerly the <span class="loc">Belmont</span> (and later The Spanish Arch) pub is <span class="date">now</span> 'Funky B, a bar/restaurant serving authentic Indian food. Just off the Circle, <span class="loc">Belmont</span> Community Hall hosts local activities, events and a regular jumble sale.</p><br><br>
