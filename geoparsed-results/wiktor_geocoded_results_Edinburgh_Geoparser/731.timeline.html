  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dalton /ˈdəltən/ is a small inland country town in the Southern Tablelands of <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span> in Upper Lachlan Shire. Dalton is north of the Hume Highway that joins <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and <span class="loc">Melbourne</span>, between <span class="loc">Goulburn</span> and <span class="loc">Yass</span> in southern <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, 255 kilometres (158 mi) southwest of <span class="loc">Sydney</span> and 79 kilometres (49 mi) north of the national capital, <span class="loc">Canberra</span>. Nearby towns are <span class="loc">Cullerin</span>, <span class="loc">Gundaroo</span>, <span class="loc">Gunning</span>, <span class="loc">Yass</span>, and <span class="loc">Murrumbateman</span>. The <span class="loc">Monaro region</span> is renowned for its sheep wool industry, notably for the Merino breed. The dry-land farming supports both <span class="date">summer</span> and <span class="date">winter</span> wheat, and some other cereal crops, but agriculture also extends to cattle production for meat. The vibrancy of Dalton's heyday in the 19th century as a sheep-shearing centre is gone, lost in <span class="date">1875</span> when the train line was routed through nearby <span class="loc">Gunning</span> rather than Dalton. <span class="date">Today</span> the town is taking on a new role as a rural-residential centre, with generally well-maintained wide streets and churches, a school, a viable hotel (pub), post office services, and a petrol station.</p><br><br>
