<p><span class="loc">La Fortuna</span> is the name of a district and a small city located in <span class="loc">San Carlos</span>, in the <span class="loc">province of Alajuela</span>, <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span>. "<span class="loc">La Fortuna</span>" is Spanish for "The Fortune", and aptly named due its ample supply of tourist attractions and extremely fertile lands. Originally called "El Bur√≠o", <span class="loc">La Fortuna</span> was founded in the mid 1930s by settlers that came from <span class="loc">Ciudad Quesada</span>, <span class="loc">Grecia</span> (canton), <span class="loc">Alajuela</span> and other parts of the region. In 1968, the Arenal Volcano erupted to the west, causing extensive damage and casualties, including 82 deaths. The eruption did not reach the village of <span class="loc">La Fortuna</span>. This catastrophe, nonetheless, changed the geography of whole region, making it one of the most visited tourist destinations of <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span>. <span class="loc">Arenal</span> is often cited by scientists as being in the top 10 or top 20 of the world's most active volcanoes. <span class="loc">La Fortuna</span> is less than 10 km from the peak of <span class="loc">Arenal</span> and less than 20 km from the entrance to Arenal Volcano National Park (the entrance is west of the peak, whereas <span class="loc">La Fortuna</span> is east of the peak).</p>
