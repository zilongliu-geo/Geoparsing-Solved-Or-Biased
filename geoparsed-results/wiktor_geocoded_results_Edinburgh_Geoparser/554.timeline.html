  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pomona</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Pomona</span> is located in the <span class="loc">Pomona</span> Valley, between the Inland Empire and the <span class="loc">San Gabriel</span> Valley. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the city's population was 149,058. The area was originally occupied by the Tongva or Gabrielino Native Americans. The city is named for <span class="loc">Pomona</span>, the ancient Roman goddess of fruit. For Horticulturist <span class="per">Solomon Gates</span>, "<span class="loc">Pomona</span>" was the winning entry in a contest to name the city in <span class="date">1875</span>, before anyone had ever planted a fruit tree The city was first settled by <span class="per">Ricardo Vejar</span> and <span class="per">Ygnacio Palomares</span> in the 1830s, when <span class="loc">California</span> and much of the now-American Southwest were part of <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The first Anglo-Americans arrived in prior to <span class="date">1848</span> when the signing of the Treaty of <span class="loc">Guadalupe Hidalgo</span> resulted in <span class="loc">California</span> becoming part of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. By the 1880s, the arrival of railroads and <span class="loc">Coachella</span> Valley water had made it the western anchor of the citrus-growing region. <span class="loc">Pomona</span> was officially incorporated on <span class="date">January 6, 1888</span>. In <span class="date">the 1920s</span> <span class="loc">Pomona</span> was known as the "Queen of the Citrus Belt", with one of the highest per-capita levels of income in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. In <span class="date">the 1940s</span> it was used as a movie-previewing location for major motion picture studios to see how their films would play to modally middle class audiences around the country (for which <span class="loc">Pomona</span> was at that time viewed as an idealized example).</p><br><br>
