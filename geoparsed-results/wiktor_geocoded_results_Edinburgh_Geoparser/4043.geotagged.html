<p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 44,519. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Madisonville</span>. During the 18th century, towns and villages of the <span class="loc">Overhill</span> <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> were scattered along the Little <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> River and <span class="loc">Tellico</span> River throughout <span class="loc">Monroe County</span>. These included <span class="loc">Chota</span>, <span class="loc">Tanasi</span> (the name source of "<span class="loc">Tennessee</span>") and Great <span class="loc">Tellico</span>, which at various times were <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> principal towns, as well as <span class="loc">Citico</span>, <span class="loc">Toqua</span>, <span class="loc">Tomotley</span>, <span class="loc">Mialoquo</span>, <span class="loc">Chilhowee</span> and <span class="loc">Tallassee</span>. Archaeological excavations at the <span class="loc">Citico</span> site suggest the area was inhabited for thousands of years before the arrival of European settlers. Artifacts uncovered from the <span class="loc">Icehouse Bottom</span> site near Vonore date to as early as 7500 B.C., during the Archaic period. <span class="loc">Fort Loudoun</span> was built by the British in 1756 as part of an agreement with the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>. After relations soured between the British and <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> in 1760, the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> laid siege to the fort, and killed most of its garrison. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was established in 1819 after the signing of the Calhoun Treaty, in which the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> relinquished claims to lands stretching from the Little <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> River south to the <span class="loc">Hiwassee</span> River. The county was named for President James Monroe.</p>
