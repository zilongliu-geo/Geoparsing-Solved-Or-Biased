  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Colton</span> is a ghost town located in <span class="loc">Utah County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, about 6 miles (9.7 km) south of <span class="loc">Soldier Summit</span>. Formerly a busy railroad junction on the <span class="loc">Denver</span> and <span class="loc">Rio</span> Grande Western <span class="per">Railroad, Colton</span> is a landmark on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 6 through Spanish Fork Canyon between the <span class="loc">cities of Spanish Fork and Price</span>. The site was first settled in <span class="date">1883</span> under the name of Pleasant Valley Junction, where the Pleasant Valley Railroad connected the mining town of <span class="date">Winter</span> <span class="date">Quarters</span>, 20 miles (32 km) to the south, to the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> line. This line was soon abandoned, replaced by a <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span> branch along a much easier grade between Pleasant Valley Junction and <span class="loc">Scofield</span>. Pleasant Valley Junction quickly grew to include a store, hotel, and five saloons. In addition to the railroad, the mining and milling of ozokerite was important in the local economy. Sometime just before <span class="date">1898</span> the town was renamed <span class="per">Colton</span> in honor of railroad official <span class="per">William F. Colton</span>. <span class="date">Two years later</span> in <span class="date">1900</span> the Scofield mine disaster dealt the entire area a serious blow, but <span class="per">Colton</span> survived.</p><br><br>
