<p><span class="loc">Salisbury</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It is 11 kilometres (7 mi) south of the <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> central business district. <span class="loc">Salisbury</span> was named after the residence of William Coote, an early <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> journalist and political figure, who lived in the area. The name was selected by the railway department when the Sunnybank/South Coast Railway Line opened in 1885. The book publishing company Boolarong Press has its headquarters in the suburb. <span class="loc">Toohey</span> Mountain and forest is located on the north east boundary of the suburb. The area remained predominantly rural until after the Second World War. Because of its comparative remoteness, a series of munition factories were built in the area, along what is now Evans Road. The tram line from the city to Moorooka was extended in 1941 to Evans Road to service these factories. The tram line finally closed on 13 April 1969. By the end of October 1943, the production of small arms at the Rocklea Factory had ceased and the place was ready for re-occupation and conversion to engine overhaul for the Department of Aircraft Production. Provision was also made for the establishment on the site of the Salisbury Hotel.</p>
