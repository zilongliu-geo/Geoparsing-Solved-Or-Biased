  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Riverside is a residential suburb 4 kilometres north-west of the central business <span class="loc">district of Launceston</span>, Tasmania's second largest city. The <span class="loc">West Tamar Highway</span> runs through the suburb, adjoining Riverside to the <span class="per">West Tamar</span>, which includes small towns: <span class="per">Beaconsfield, George</span> Town and <span class="loc">Beauty Point</span>. Riverside is part of the <span class="loc">West Tamar</span> Council local government area, despite its close proximity to the Launceston CBD. The suburb is <span class="date">now</span> Launceston's largest by population, narrowly ahead of Kings Meadows, nevertheless, it lacks in shopping facilities, with only a small $2 million centre which opened in <span class="date">the 1980s</span>. The <span class="org">Riverside Shopping Centre</span> as it is known, includes: a Woolworths supermarket, a Banjos bakery and a pharmacist. There are several schools (<span class="org">Riverside Primary School</span>, <span class="org">Riverside High School</span>, <span class="org">Launceston Christian School</span> and <span class="loc">St Anthony</span>'s) as well as an Aussie rules football ground named <span class="per">Windsor Park</span> which is home to the <span class="org">Launceston Football Club</span>, a soccer ground which is home to Riverside Olympic, the park also includes a cricket ground for senior players and also a junior ground used mainly by under 12 and under 14 sides, all along the course of the highway. Less than a 1 km further north there is a small complex containing a few shops including Joes IGA supermarket and St David's Church. Over the road is a restaurant, pub and bottle shop, as well as the 3.5 star Best Western Riverside motel.</p><br><br>
