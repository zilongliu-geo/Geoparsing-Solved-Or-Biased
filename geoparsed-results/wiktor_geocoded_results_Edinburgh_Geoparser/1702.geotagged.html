<p><span class="loc">Dinan</span> (French: [di.nɑ̃]) is a walled Breton town and a commune in the Côtes-d'Armor department in northwestern <span class="loc">France</span>. Its geographical setting is exceptional. Instead of nestling on the valley floor like <span class="loc">Morlaix</span>, most urban development has been on the hillside, overlooking the river <span class="loc">Rance</span>. The area alongside the River <span class="loc">Rance</span> is known as the port of <span class="loc">Dinan</span> and is connected to the town by the steep streets Rue Jerzual and its continuation outside the walls the Rue de Petit Fort. This river has moderate turbidity and its brownish water is somewhat low in velocity due to the slight gradient of the watercourse; pH levels have been measured at 8.13 within the <span class="loc">city of Dinan</span> and electrical conductivity of the waters have tested at 33 micro-siemens per centimetre. In the centre of <span class="loc">Dinan</span> the <span class="loc">Rance</span> summer flows are typically in the range of 500 cubic feet per second (14 m3/s). For many years, the bridge over the River <span class="loc">Rance</span> at <span class="loc">Dinan</span> was the most northerly crossing point on the river, but the tidal power station at the mouth of the estuary, constructed in the 1960s downstream from <span class="loc">Dinan</span>, incorporates a 750 metre long tidal barrage which doubles as a crossing point nearer to the sea.</p>
