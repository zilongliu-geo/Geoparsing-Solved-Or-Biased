<p>Meeting in Alexandria will discuss 2010 census. The town hall meetings, which will take place throughout spring and summer, will include a presentation on organizing local Complete Count Committees. Complete Count Committees are appointed by the mayor or other elected official and include leaders from the business, education, faith, media, non-profit, ethnic and other communities. These volunteer committees work together on community events such as festivals, parades, meetings and other activities to keep <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> first in the nation in responding to the census. The 2010 census is critical for <span class="loc">Minnesota</span>, which is at risk of losing one of its eight seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, according to census officials. Census information is also the foundation of equal representation in the state Legislature and determines the allocation of more than $300 billion in federal funding for everything from education to transportation. The business community also uses census information for planning, marketing, labor force projections and more. Additionally, the census will employ an estimated 8,000 Minnesotans throughout the process.</p>
