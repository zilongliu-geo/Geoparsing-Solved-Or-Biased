<p><span class="loc">Acton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">York County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,447 at the 2010 census. It includes the villages of <span class="loc">Acton</span>, Miller Corner and <span class="loc">South Acton</span>. The town is home to the <span class="loc">Acton</span> Fairground, which holds the <span class="loc">Acton</span> Fair every late summer. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> statistical area. It was part of the extensive Ossipee Tract sold on November 28, 1668 by Newichawannock Chief Captain Sunday (or Wesumbe) to Francis Small, a trader from <span class="loc">Kittery</span>. Small sold a half interest in the tract to Major Nicholas Shapleigh of Eliot. In 1770, heirs found the unrecorded deed and divided the land, with Shapleigh's descendants awarded one half of <span class="loc">Limerick</span> and all of <span class="loc">Parsonsfield</span> and <span class="loc">Shapleigh</span>. First called <span class="loc">Hubbardstown Plantation</span>, <span class="loc">Shapleigh</span> was in 1785 incorporated and named in honor of Nicholas Shapleigh. Its western portion was set off and incorporated on March 6, 1830 as <span class="loc">Acton</span>, named after <span class="loc">Acton</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The town was first settled at <span class="loc">Acton</span> village in 1776 by Benjamin Kimens, Clement Steele and John York, all from York. In 1779, Joseph Parsons built a gristmill on the Salmon <span class="loc">Falls River</span> near <span class="loc">Wakefield</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. Other mills followed at <span class="loc">Acton</span>'s various water power sites, including sawmills, gristmills, a hemp mill, a carding mill, a felt mill, a tannery and a shoe factory. In 1877, a vein of silver was discovered near <span class="loc">Goding Creek</span> and the <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> border. Prospectors dug mines during the 1880s, after which the enterprise declined.</p>
