<p><span class="loc">Lexington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Henderson County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="loc">Lexington</span> is midway between Memphis and Nashville, lying ten miles (16 km) south of Interstate 40, which connects the two cities. The population was 7,473 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Henderson County</span>. Shortly after the 1821 creation of <span class="loc">Henderson County</span>, a site near its center was chosen as a site for a county seat, and was named <span class="loc">Lexington</span> in honor of <span class="loc">Lexington</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, site of the first battle of the American Revolution. The first county courthouse was built in 1823; <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was incorporated in 1824 and by 1830 had a population of 260. As the lead-up to the American Civil War began, <span class="loc">Henderson County</span> voted against secession. As the war progressed, both Union and Confederate regiments were recruited in the county. The area in and around <span class="loc">Lexington</span> was the site of a skirmish on December 18, 1862. Union Colonel Robert Ingersoll sent his troops to destroy a bridge over the <span class="loc">Beech Creek</span> to disallow Confederate army to move into the area. However, Ingersoll's troops did not destroy the bridge and General Nathan Bedford Forrest's troops headed into <span class="loc">Lexington</span>. Forrest's troops overtook the Union soldiers, taking over 140 men, including Colonel Ingersoll, and collected artillery and supplies left behind by Union soldiers who escaped.</p>
