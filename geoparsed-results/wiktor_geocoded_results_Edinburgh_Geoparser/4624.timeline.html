  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Ivangorod</span> (Russian: Иванго́род; Estonian: Jaanilinn; Votic: Jaanilidna), also known as Ivan-Gorod (Ива́н-Го́род), is a town in <span class="loc">Kingiseppsky District</span> of <span class="loc">Leningrad Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, located on the right bank of the <span class="loc">Narva</span> River by the Estonia–Russia border, 159 kilometers (99 mi) west of St. Petersburg. Population: 9,854 (<span class="date">2010</span> Census); 11,206 (<span class="date">2002</span> Census); 11,833 (<span class="date">1989</span> Census). <span class="loc">Ivangorod</span> is a major border crossing point and a railway station by the Tallinn–St. Petersburg line. It is located just opposite to the Estonian town of <span class="loc">Narva</span>. The town is the site of the Ivangorod Fortress, a prominent fortification monument of the 15th and the 16th <span class="date">centuries</span>. The fortress was established in <span class="date">1492</span> during the reign of <span class="per">Ivan III</span> of <span class="loc">Moscow</span> and was named after him. Between <span class="date">1581</span>–<span class="date">1590</span> and between <span class="date">1612</span>–<span class="date">1704</span>, it was controlled by <span class="loc">Sweden</span>. <span class="loc">Ivangorod</span> was granted town privileges and administered as a Russian township under the <span class="org">Crown</span> of <span class="loc">Sweden</span> (who conquered it in <span class="date">1612</span> from boyar Teuvo Aminev) until <span class="date">1649</span>, when its burghers were ordered to remove to a <span class="loc">Narva</span> suburb. In <span class="date">1617</span>, the Treaty of <span class="loc">Stolbovo</span> was signed between <span class="loc">Russia</span> and <span class="loc">Sweden</span>, which placed the area under the Swedish sovereignty. <span class="loc">Russia</span> reconquered it during the Great <span class="org">Northern War</span> in <span class="date">1704</span>. Despite other changes in territory and sovereignty, <span class="loc">Ivangorod</span> was considered an administrative part of the town of <span class="loc">Narva</span> from <span class="date">1649</span> until <span class="date">1945</span>. In <span class="date">1780</span>, <span class="loc">Ivangorod</span>, together with <span class="loc">Narva</span>, was included into Narvsky Uyezd of St. Petersburg Governorate. In <span class="date">1796</span>, Narvsky Uyezd was abolished and merged into Yamburgsky Uyezd.</p><br><br>
