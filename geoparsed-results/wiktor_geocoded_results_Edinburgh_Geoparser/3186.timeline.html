  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Madison</span> is a city and former coal town in <span class="loc">Boone County</span>, <span class="loc">West Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,076 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Boone County</span>. <span class="per">Madison</span> was first established as <span class="loc">Boone</span> <span class="loc">Court House</span>. The town was renamed about <span class="date">1865</span>, presumably for <span class="per">James Madison</span>, the fourth president of the <span class="loc">United States</span>. Other theories hold that it was named for lawyer <span class="per">James Madison Laidley</span> or for <span class="per">Madison Peyton</span>, a pioneer coal operator, who was a leader in the movement which resulted in the formation of <span class="loc">Boone County</span> and for whom <span class="loc">Peytona</span> on <span class="loc">Big Coal River</span> was named. <span class="per">Madison</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1906</span>. The first courthouse at <span class="per">Madison</span>, a log structure, was burned by Union troops early in the American Civil War. The second courthouse, made of local brick, served until <span class="date">1913</span>, and a frame building was used by county officials for <span class="date">the next several years</span>. The present <span class="loc">Boone County</span> Courthouse, occupied in <span class="date">1921</span>, is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. <span class="per">Madison</span> is the "<span class="org">Gateway</span> to the Coalfields," as it is located on a principal route through the southern coalfields. It occupied a strategic place during the Mine Wars. Miners twice rallied at the town ballpark in <span class="date">August 1921</span>, to consider whether to continue their march to neighboring <span class="per">Logan</span> and <span class="per">Mingo</span> counties. Thousands of armed marchers passed through the town and surrounding region on their way to and from the fighting at <span class="loc">Blair Mountain</span>, which is located up Spruce Fork from <span class="per">Madison</span>.</p><br><br>
