<p><span class="loc">Baisha</span> (Chinese: 白沙; pinyin: Báishā; Jyutping: baak6saa1; literally: "white sand"; Taishanese: Bak-sa) is a town of <span class="loc">Taishan</span>, <span class="loc">Guangdong province</span>. It has a population of 140,000 residing in an area of 238 km2 (92 sq mi). Baisha town was the ancestral home of many of the first Chinese Canadians. Their descendants live all over <span class="loc">Canada</span>, and used to predominate before the 1980s in the Chinatowns of Victoria, <span class="loc">Vancouver</span>, <span class="loc">Calgary</span>, <span class="loc">Banff</span> and <span class="loc">Edmonton</span>, and <span class="loc">US</span> West Coast cities such as <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> and Seattle. Baisha Town is one of the few regions in <span class="loc">northern Guangdong province</span> where illegal rare earth mines were operating. Baisha Town is rich in rare earth minerals such as dysprosium. The Baisha variant of Taishanese is fading amongst the descendants of Canadian-Chinese, as Cantonese and Mandarin become more dominant. Based on observations of Chinese-Canadian elders living in <span class="loc">Edmonton</span> between 1980 and 2005, it would seem that the Taishan language spoken in <span class="loc">Baisha</span> in the mid-20th century differed somewhat from that spoken in <span class="loc">Taicheng</span> (Hoiseng in the Hoisan language, 台城), the county seat of <span class="loc">Taishan</span> (Hoisan, 台山县). Indeed, the pronunciation was more or less the same as that of people living across the river in the next county, <span class="loc">Kaiping</span> (Hoiping in the Toisanese language, 开平). One notable difference can be seen in the shift of certain vowel sounds, as follows:</p>
