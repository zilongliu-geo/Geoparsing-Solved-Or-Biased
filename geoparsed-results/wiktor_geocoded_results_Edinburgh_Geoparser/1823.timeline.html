  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Amherst</span> (formerly <span class="loc">Dearborn</span>) is a town in <span class="loc">Amherst County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,231 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Amherst County</span>. <span class="per">Amherst</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Lynchburg Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The Town of <span class="per">Amherst</span> was founded in <span class="date">1807</span>. Originally known as "The Oaks" and "<span class="loc">Seven Oaks</span>", it began as a mere stagecoach station on the Charlottesville-Lynchburg road. Once <span class="loc">Nelson County</span> was separated from <span class="loc">Amherst County</span> in <span class="date">1807</span>, the community became the seat of the <span class="loc">Amherst County</span> Government. It was at this time that the village decided to rename itself in honor of the French and Indian War hero, <span class="per">Sir Jeffery Amherst</span>. <span class="per">Major-General Amherst</span> had been the hero of the Battle of <span class="loc">Ticonderoga</span> and later served as the Governor-In-Chief of the Colony of <span class="loc">Virginia</span> from <span class="date">1763</span> to <span class="date">1768</span>. On <span class="date">April 15, 1910</span>, the Town of <span class="per">Amherst</span> was incorporated by the order of the Circuit Court. A charter was granted to the town by the General Assembly in <span class="date">1950</span>. The Official Town seal was created by Ward Cruea, a commercial artist from Dayton, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. His original idea for the Town Seal was the "sleeping giant" (the <span class="loc">Blue Ridge Mountain</span> ridgeline west of <span class="loc">Amherst</span>), but this was rejected since it represented an area outside the corporate limits of the Town. According to town legend, while a group was in the Clerk's office in the Town Hall engaged in conversation on the topics of the day, and looking eastward along E. Court Street, it was suggested that the <span class="per">Amherst</span> courthouse be used as a model for the official seal for the Town. During that era, a large letter "A" was attached to a radio antenna tower beside the telephone company building that was adjacent to the courthouse. This internally illuminated "A" was used as a visual navigation beacon by aircraft pilots. <span class="date">Approximately six months later</span> Cruea returned to the Town and delivered a framed original of a proposed Town seal. His proposal incorporated the courthouse, the "A" and the Town's date of incorporation. <span class="per">Cruea</span>'s proposal was adopted soon thereafter and became the official seal of the Town of <span class="per">Amherst</span>. The original seal is located on the wall of the <span class="org">Council</span> Chambers in the Town Hall.</p><br><br>
