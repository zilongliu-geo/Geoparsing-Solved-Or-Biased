  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dayton is an unincorporated community located in <span class="loc">Howard County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. Dayton is located southwest of <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> and north of <span class="loc">Washington</span>, D.C., between <span class="loc">Clarksville</span> and <span class="loc">Glenelg</span>. A postal office operated in the community from <span class="date">21 July 1864</span> to present with brief stops in service during the American Civil War. By <span class="date">1878</span> the town expanded to three general stores and a wheelwright shop. One of which is <span class="org">Maloney's General Store</span> built shortly after the civil war which served as a stagecoach stop and was later owned by Royal Harp III, <span class="per">Thomas Isaacs, Mr White</span>, and the Grant Family. The Dayton single room school house was along Green Bridge Road. After a fire in the single room schoolhouse for colored children, a new brown tile two room school was built at the crossroads of <span class="loc">Ten Oaks</span>, Green Bridge and Howard roads, and the colored children moved to the old white school. The two room school is <span class="date">now</span> on property owned by RLO Contractors. Dayton is in the 21036 zip code area and belongs to the 410 area code. Local landmarks are the Crossroads Pub famed for their <span class="loc">Maryland</span> blue crabs and once owned by the Harp family (Harp's Pub), who also owned Harp's grocery store; the Post Office; Hobbs Service Station; and a large wooden rabbit, which is decorated for major holidays.</p><br><br>
