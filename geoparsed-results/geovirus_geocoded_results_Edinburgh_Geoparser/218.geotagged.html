<p>A man accused of driving under the influence of alcohol stuffed his mouth full of feces in a failed attempt to foil the police breathalyzer. The man was arrested Sunday by <span class="loc">South Simcoe Police</span> after his pickup truck was pulled over on <span class="loc">Ontario</span> Provincial Highway 11 in <span class="loc">Stroud</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. On the way to the police station for testing, the 59-year-old vomited, urinated, and defecated in the police cruiser. Sgt. James Buchanan said that upon arriving at the station, the prisoner grabbed a handful of his own waste "and placed it in his mouth, attempting to trick the breathalyzer machine". Nevertheless, the man registered two readings of more than twice the legal blood alcohol limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood in his system. He was charged with impaired driving and driving over the limit and was released on a promise to appear in a <span class="loc">Bradford</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span> court on May 12.</p>
