  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Swansea</span> is a neighbourhood in the <span class="loc">City of Toronto</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>, bounded on the west by the <span class="loc">Humber River</span>, on the north by <span class="loc">Bloor</span> Street, on the east by <span class="loc">High Park</span> and on the south by <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span>. The neighbourhood was originally a separate municipality, the Village of <span class="loc">Swansea</span>, which was annexed by the <span class="loc">City of Toronto</span> in <span class="date">1967</span>. <span class="loc">Swansea</span> is primarily residential in nature, consisting of a mix of various housing types. Swansea's high-end homes are located either at the western edge of <span class="loc">High Park</span> overlooking <span class="loc">Grenadier</span> Pond, or on <span class="loc">Riverside Drive</span> and the <span class="loc">Brule Gardens</span> enclave bordering the <span class="loc">Humber</span> river. <span class="loc">Swansea</span> also contains a large number of semi-detached houses and bungalows located mostly in the centre of the neighbourhood. The typical house of the area was built between <span class="date">1905</span> and <span class="date">1935</span>. The area of the former Swansea Works area is considerably newer, except for some of the original workers' homes. The <span class="loc">Queensway</span> was built in <span class="date">the 1950s</span> through the Swansea Works lands. The area to the south was retained for industry and the area to the north was redeveloped with apartment buildings and townhome developments. The area of the actual factory site has been redeveloped since <span class="date">2000</span> into townhomes and condominium apartments.</p><br><br>
