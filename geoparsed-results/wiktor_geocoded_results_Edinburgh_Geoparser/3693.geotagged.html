<p><span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> /ˌbɜːrkənˈhɛd/ is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Wirral</span> in <span class="loc">Merseyside</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically in <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>, it is on the <span class="loc">Wirral</span> Peninsula, along the west bank of the <span class="loc">River Mersey</span>, opposite the <span class="loc">city of Liverpool</span>. At the 2001 Census, the town had a population of 83,729. By the time of the 2011 census <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> had become an electoral ward of the Local Authority called <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> and <span class="loc">Tranmere</span>. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 Census was 15,879. The recorded history of <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> began with the establishment of <span class="loc">Birkenhead Priory</span> and the <span class="loc">Mersey Ferry</span> in the 12th century. During the 19th century <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> expanded greatly, becoming a town as a consequence of the Industrial Revolution, with <span class="loc">Birkenhead Park</span> and <span class="loc">Hamilton Square</span> being examples of the era. Around the same time, <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> gained the first street tramway in <span class="loc">Britain</span>. Later, the Mersey Railway connected <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> and <span class="loc">Liverpool</span>, with the world's first tunnel beneath a tidal estuary. <span class="loc">Birkenhead</span> is perhaps best known for the shipbuilding of Cammell Laird, and for the town's seaport. In the second half of the 20th century, the town suffered a significant period of decline, with containerisation causing a reduction in port activity. During the first half of the 21st century, the <span class="loc">Wirral</span> Waters development is planned to regenerate much of the dockland.</p>
