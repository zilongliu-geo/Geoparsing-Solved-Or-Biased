  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Milford</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Clermont</span> and <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> counties in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, along the <span class="loc">Little Miami River</span> in the southwestern part of the state. It is a part of Greater Cincinnati. <span class="loc">Milford</span>, an abbreviated form of mill ford, was so named because it was the first safe ford across the <span class="loc">Little Miami</span> north of the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>, and was the only way for many people to reach the local mill. The population was 6,709 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The <span class="loc">Little Miami</span> Bike Trail, which runs from <span class="loc">Newtown</span> to <span class="loc">Springfield</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, runs through <span class="loc">Milford</span> where several major hiking trails converge, including the American Discovery Trail, the Sea to Sea Long Distance Hiking Route, and the Underground Railroad Cycling Route. The city is served by the Milford Exempted Village Schools. <span class="loc">Milford</span> has been inhabited since prehistoric times. A field along <span class="per">Gatch</span> Avenue on what was once the farm of <span class="per">John Gatch</span> has yielded large numbers of artifacts for several generations; it is <span class="date">now</span> believed to have been the site of a Native American village during the Woodland period. <span class="date">Today</span>, the field is an archaeological site known as the "<span class="per">Gatch</span> Site."</p><br><br>
