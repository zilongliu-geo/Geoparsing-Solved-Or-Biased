(AP) &#x97; A man being held in a northern <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> jail on a murder charge is accused of killing a fellow inmate who was from <span class="loc">Cincinnati</span>. The Kenton County Police Department has charged 27-year-old <span class="loc">Marion</span> Lawson Parker III with murder in the death Sunday of 40-year-old Isaac Jackson. Investigators say Jackson was beaten and strangled while in the <span class="loc">Kenton County</span> jail in <span class="loc">Covington</span>. Parker is awaiting trial in the death of a man whose body was found under a bridge in January. Jackson was being held on a charge of giving false information to police in a separate case. Police are trying to determine the motive. The name of Parker's attorney was not immediately available. Jail and prosecutor's offices were closed for the day, and online court records did not include his attorney's name.</p>
