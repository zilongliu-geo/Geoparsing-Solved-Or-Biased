  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Kew</span> (/kjuÀê/) is a suburban district in the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of <span class="loc">Richmond upon Thames</span>, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north-east of <span class="loc">Richmond</span> and 7.1 miles (11.4 km) west by south-west of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>; its population at the <span class="date">2011</span> Census was 11,436. <span class="loc">Kew</span> is the location of the <span class="loc">Royal Botanic Gardens</span> ("Kew Gardens"), <span class="date">now</span> a World Heritage Site, which includes Kew Palace. <span class="loc">Kew</span> is also the home of important historical documents such as Domesday Book, which is on public display at The National Archives. Successive <span class="per">Tudor, Stuart</span> and <span class="per">Georgian</span> monarchs maintained links with <span class="loc">Kew</span>. During the French Revolution, many refugees established themselves there and it was the home of several artists in the 18th and 19th <span class="date">centuries</span>. Since <span class="date">1965</span> <span class="loc">Kew</span> has incorporated the former area of <span class="loc">North Sheen</span> which includes <span class="per">St Philip</span> and <span class="loc">All Saints</span>, the first barn church consecrated in <span class="loc">England</span>. It is <span class="date">now</span> in a combined <span class="org">Church of England</span> ecclesiastical parish with St Luke's Church, <span class="loc">Kew</span>. <span class="date">Today</span>, <span class="loc">Kew</span> is an expensive residential area because of its suburban hallmarks. Among these are sports-and-leisure open spaces, schools, transport links, architecture, restaurants, no high rise buildings, modest road sizes, trees and gardens. Most of <span class="loc">Kew</span> developed in the late 19th century, following the arrival of the District line of the Underground. Further development took place in <span class="date">the 1920s and 1930s</span> when new houses were built on the market gardens of <span class="loc">North Sheen</span> and in the first decade of the 21st century when considerably more river-fronting flats and houses were constructed by the <span class="loc">Thames</span> on land formerly owned by <span class="loc">Thames</span> Water.</p><br><br>
