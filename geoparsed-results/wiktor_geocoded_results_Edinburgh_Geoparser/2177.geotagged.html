<p>Sharon is a town in <span class="loc">Hillsborough County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 352 at the 2010 census. It is home to the Sharon Arts School of Art and Craft, part of the Sharon Arts Center. It was first settled in 1738 as part of Peterborough Slip, an area which until 1768 included Temple. In 1777, it petitioned to become part of <span class="loc">Peterborough</span>, but was denied. It was called Sliptown until 1791, when it was incorporated as Sharon. It took its name from Sharon, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, from which many settlers originated. The topography is uneven and, in parts, mountainous. In 1823, the population was 400. By 1859, when the population was 229, the town had three sawmills. The principal occupation, however, was farming. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 15.6 square miles (40.4 km2), all of it land. Sharon is drained by several branches of the <span class="loc">Contoocook River</span>, which rise near the southeast corner of the town. <span class="loc">Temple Mountain</span> forms the eastern boundary of Sharon for several miles. Holt Peak on <span class="loc">Temple Mountain</span>, at 2,045 feet (623 m) above sea level, is the highest point in Sharon.</p>
