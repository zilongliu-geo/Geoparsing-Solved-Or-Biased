  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Mass. legislators put off debate on gas tax hike. "We've been pretty clear. We need to get to the reform-related issues before we do anything else," said Rep. <span class="per">Joseph F. Wagner</span>, D-Chicopee, the co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Transportation. "The public wants to see what we are going to do to fix a system that is broken." The announcement came as the five-member board of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Turnpike Authority is scheduled to meet 3 p.m. on <span class="date">Monday</span> at Ludlow Town Hall. Although the authority on <span class="date">Monday</span> is expected to vote to delay a toll increase in or near <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="per">Wagner</span> said he will ask board members to consider restoring tolls for passenger vehicles between Exits 1 in <span class="loc">West Stockbridge</span> and Exit 6 near <span class="loc">Springfield</span> as a way to generate money for maintenance of the western end of the turnpike. He said <span class="date">Monday</span>'s meeting would be an appropriate time and place for the board to weigh bringing back those tolls as well as a toll in <span class="loc">West Newton</span> that also was taken down in <span class="date">1996</span>, but as of <span class="date">Thursday</span>, the issue was not on the board's agenda for <span class="date">Monday</span>. The Boston toll increase was scheduled to take effect in two stages starting on <span class="date">March 29</span>. The governor, Senate President <span class="per">Therese Murray</span>, D-Plymouth, and House Speaker <span class="per">Robert A. DeLeo</span>, D-Winthrop, and turnpike officials have agreed to use turnpike reserve money to ward off the <span class="date">March 29</span> toll increase while they negotiate a more comprehensive answer for the state's transportation financing shortfall. The authority had approved the toll increases <span class="date">last month</span>, turning up the heat on legislators to act on a bill to boost the gas tax as a way to prevent the toll hikes. Instead, <span class="date">Thursday</span>'s agreement gives legislators some more time to weigh Patrick's bill for a 19-cent increase in the state's 23.5-cent gas tax. <span class="per">Wagner</span> said there is no support in the Legislature for the 19-cent increase Patrick proposed in his transportation bill submitted <span class="date">last month</span>. <span class="per">Wagner</span> said he couldn't say how much of an increase in the gas tax that legislators might support. "I get the clear sense that 10 cents may be too much," <span class="per">Wagner</span> said. The western portion of the turnpike is a separate financial operation from the road east of Route 128. If tolls were reinstated between Exits 1 and 6, <span class="per">Wagner</span> said, it would provide more money for maintaining the western end of the turnpike. "The road is in a terrible state of disrepair," <span class="per">Wagner</span> said. "It's clear the turnpike doesn't have the revenues to maintain that road." Rep. <span class="per">Donald F. Humason</span>, R-Westfield, said he would support restoring tolls between Exits 1 and 6 if the revenues are used to improve the western part of the turnpike. <span class="per">Humason</span> said he is concerned, however, with the plan by legislative leaders to approve a reform bill <span class="date">next week</span> while delaying a possible tax increase until sometime before <span class="date">July 1</span>. <span class="per">Humason</span> said there would not be enough time for the reforms to kick in and save some money. "Put the reforms in place," <span class="per">Humason</span> said. "Let them stand for <span class="date">a year</span>. Let them stand for <span class="date">six months</span>. Give them a chance to work." The authority has lost $12 million <span class="date">a year</span> since it eliminated tolls for passenger vehicles between Exits 1 in <span class="loc">West Stockbridge</span> near the <span class="loc">New York</span> border and Exit 6 at Interstate 291 in <span class="loc">Chicopee</span> in <span class="date">1996</span>, according to <span class="per">Mary Z. Connaughton</span>, of <span class="loc">Framingham</span>, a turnpike board member. <span class="per">Connaughton</span> said she supports reinstating tolls for passenger vehicles in Western <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> to generate money for maintenance for that section of the turnpike. She also wants to reinstate tolls on that section of the road because tolls are set to increase in <span class="loc">Boston</span> and the turnpike extension in <span class="loc">Boston</span>. <span class="per">Connaughton</span> said bringing back tolls between Exits 1 and 6 would also help assure that the turnpike from Route 128 westward becomes free of tolls in <span class="date">eight years</span>. Under current authority plans, bonds are to be paid off in <span class="date">2017</span> on the 123-mile western portion from the <span class="loc">New York</span> border to Route 128. Under state law, the tolls are supposed to be removed when construction debt is paid. <span class="per">Connaughton</span> said she is concerned that the commissioner of the state Highway Department could refuse to accept the western end of the turnpike as a state road if it is in poor condition in <span class="date">2017</span>. <span class="per">Connaughton</span> wants the turnpike authority on <span class="date">Monday</span> to consider restoring tolls for passenger vehicles between Exit 1 and Exit 6. The western end of the turnpike is currently operating at a deficit of about $15 million <span class="date">a year</span> if the authority spends what it should on bridge repairs, paving and other capital projects, according to a report by the state Transportation Finance Commission. The turnpike board's meeting on <span class="date">Monday</span> will center around an expected vote to delay a big toll increase scheduled to take place in <span class="loc">Boston</span> and on the turnpike extension east of Route 128. The first stage of the toll increase will boost tolls from $1.25 to $1.50 at the <span class="per">Allston</span> and <span class="per">Weston</span> booths and from $3.50 to $5.50 at the Boston Harbor tunnels. A second toll increase, due to take effect <span class="date">July 1</span>, will raise the tolls at <span class="per">Allston</span> and <span class="per">Weston</span> to $2 and the tunnel tolls to $7. Board members approved those toll increases to help pay off $2.2 billion in debt left from the $14.8 billion Big Dig, maintenance and capital improvements.</p><br><br>
