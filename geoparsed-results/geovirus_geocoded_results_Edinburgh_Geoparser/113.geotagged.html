<p>At least two new outbreaks of the H5N1 Avian Flu virus, also known as Bird Flu, have been found in <span class="loc">Poland</span>. One of the outbreaks was on a farm in Saldowo which affected at least 40 chickens. The other outbreak was found in unnamed wild birds near <span class="loc">Orneta</span>. "The new case was discovered in the village of Saldowo, near to Bieżuń, (central <span class="loc">Poland</span>) close to other recent cases. Just as in the previous cases all the chickens will be culled," said <span class="loc">Poland</span>'s Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Marek Sawicki. Officials have set up a zone of protection of at least a 30 kilometer radius of the farm.</p>
