<p><span class="loc">Jordan</span> (/ˈdʒɔːrdən/; Arabic: الأردن‎ Al-Urdun), officially The <span class="loc">Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan</span> (Arabic: المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية‎ Al-Mamlakah Al-Urduniyah Al-Hashimiyah), is an Arab kingdom in Western <span class="loc">Asia</span>, on the <span class="loc">East Bank</span> of the <span class="loc">Jordan River</span>. <span class="loc">Jordan</span> is bordered by <span class="loc">Saudi Arabia</span> to the east and south, <span class="loc">Iraq</span> to the north-east, <span class="loc">Syria</span> to the north, and <span class="loc">Israel</span> and <span class="loc">Palestine</span> to the west. The country's location at the crossroads of <span class="loc">the Middle East</span> has served as a strategic nexus connecting <span class="loc">Asia</span>, <span class="loc">Africa</span> and <span class="loc">Europe</span>. Inhabited since the Paleolithic period. Three kingdoms emerged on the territory of modern <span class="loc">Jordan</span> at the very end of the Bronze Age: <span class="loc">Ammon</span>, <span class="loc">Moab</span> and <span class="loc">Edom</span>. The lands were later part of several kingdoms and empires, most notably the Nabatean Kingdom, the Roman Empire and finally the Ottoman Empire. After the Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire after World War I by <span class="loc">Britain</span> and <span class="loc">France</span>, the Emirate of Transjordan was officially recognized by the Council of the League of Nations in 1922. In 1946, <span class="loc">Jordan</span> became an independent sovereign state officially known as The Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. <span class="loc">Jordan</span> captured the <span class="loc">West Bank</span> during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and the name of the state was changed to The <span class="loc">Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan</span> on 1 December 1948.</p>
