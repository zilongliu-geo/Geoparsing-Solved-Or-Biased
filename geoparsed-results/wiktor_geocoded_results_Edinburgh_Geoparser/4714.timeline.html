  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Palermo</span> is a neighborhood, or barrio of the Argentine capital, <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>. It is located in the northeast of the city, bordering the barrios of <span class="loc">Belgrano</span> to the north, <span class="loc">Almagro</span> and <span class="loc">Recoleta</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Villa Crespo</span> and <span class="loc">Colegiales</span> to the west and the RÃ­o de la Plata river to the east. With a total area of 17.4 km2 (7 sq mi), <span class="loc">Palermo</span> is the largest neighborhood in <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span>. As of <span class="date">1991</span> it had a population of 256,927 inhabitants (<span class="date">1991</span> census [INDEC]). It is the only barrio within the administrative division of Comuna 14. The name of the district is derived from the still-existing Franciscan abbey of "<span class="loc">Saint Benedict</span> of <span class="loc">Palermo</span>", an alternative name for <span class="loc">Saint Benedict</span> the Moor. <span class="loc">Saint Benedict</span> the Moor lived from <span class="date">1526</span> to <span class="date">1589</span> and is a complementary patron saint of <span class="loc">Palermo</span>, the capital <span class="loc">city of Sicily</span>. In an alternative history of the name, a folk story supported by journalists, the land would have been originally purchased by an Italian immigrant named <span class="per">Juan Domingo</span> <span class="loc">Palermo</span> in the late 16th century, shortly after the foundation of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> in <span class="date">1580</span>. <span class="loc">Juan Manuel</span> de <span class="loc">Rosas</span> built a country residence there which was confiscated after his fall in <span class="date">1852</span>.</p><br><br>
