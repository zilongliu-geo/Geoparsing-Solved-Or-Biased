<p>Hastings is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, the county seat of <span class="loc">Barry County</span> as well as the county's only city. The population was 7,350 at the 2010 census. The city borders Hastings Charter Township on the north, east, and south, and Rutland Charter Township on the west. Hastings is part of the Grand <span class="loc">Rapids-Wyoming metropolitan</span> area. In 1836 three entrepreneurs named Dibble, Kingsbury and Kendall bought 480 acres (1.9 km2) along the <span class="loc">Thornapple</span> River from <span class="loc">Detroit</span> banker <span class="loc">Eurotas</span> P. Hastings. The three platted the area into lots, and soon a small community arose. In 1843, the state legislature designated Hastings as the County Seat of <span class="loc">Barry County</span>. The first paper, the <span class="loc">Barry County</span> Pioneer, began publishing in 1851, and a second paper, the Republican Banner, began in 1856. The latter publication, a weekly paper published on Thursdays, continues to be published as the Hastings Banner. Hastings was incorporated as a village in 1855, with a population of around 300, and on March 11, 1871, Hastings officially become a city. The <span class="loc">Barry County</span> Courthouse, which is still in use today, was built in 1893. The city grew slowly, reaching 6,500 people in 1960 and remaining nearly flat through 1990.</p>
