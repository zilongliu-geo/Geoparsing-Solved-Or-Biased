  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dover</span> is an unincorporated community on the banks of <span class="loc">Mission Creek</span> in <span class="loc">western Shawnee County</span>, <span class="loc">Kansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Founded in <span class="date">1860</span>, it was once a larger community, but it declined for most of the 20th century. <span class="date">Today</span> a few commercial buildings remain at the intersection of K-4 Highway and 57th Street, but it is mainly a residential area. A newly founded <span class="org">Dover Community Foundation</span> has been created to support the growth of the community and retention of its history. Camp <span class="per">Daisy Hindman</span>, a rather large Girl Scout camp, is located 2 miles south of the town. 1Â½ miles west of town is a 50 ft high cliff known as Echo Cliff. Settlers came in the <span class="date">year 1856</span>. The <span class="per">Sage</span> and <span class="per">Bassett</span> families in <span class="loc">Dover</span> came from <span class="loc">Somersetshire</span>, <span class="loc">Bristol</span>. <span class="loc">Dover</span> was made a voting precinct of Auburn township, <span class="date">October 1, 1860</span>, and in the <span class="date">fall of 1867</span>, was erected into a township. <span class="per">E.M. Hewins</span> was the first trustee; <span class="per">Jacob Haskell</span> and <span class="per">George</span> Harden, Justices. The first postmaster was <span class="per">Alfred Sage</span>, appointed in <span class="date">1862</span>. The family name, <span class="per">Sage</span>, is still widespread in the area <span class="date">today</span>.</p><br><br>
