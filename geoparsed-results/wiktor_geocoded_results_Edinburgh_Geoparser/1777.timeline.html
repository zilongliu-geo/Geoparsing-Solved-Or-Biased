  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 1,163,414, making it the second-most populous county in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, the state capital and most populous city in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The county was established on <span class="date">April 30, 1803</span>, <span class="date">less than two months</span> after <span class="loc">Ohio</span> became a state, and was named after <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> originally extended all the way north to <span class="loc">Lake Erie</span> before <span class="loc">Ohio</span> subdivided further into more counties. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is included in the <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">OH</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, particularly <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, has been a centerpiece for presidential and congressional politics, most notably the <span class="date">2000</span> presidential election, the <span class="date">2004</span> presidential election, and the <span class="date">2006</span> midterm elections. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is home to one of the largest universities in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, The <span class="org">Ohio State University</span>, which as of <span class="date">fall 2014</span> has an enrollment of 58,322 students on its main <span class="loc">Columbus</span> campus. On <span class="date">March 30, 1803</span>, the Ohio government authorized the creation of <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>. The county originally was part of <span class="loc">Ross County</span>. Residents named the county in honor of <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>. In <span class="date">1816</span>, <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>’s <span class="loc">Columbus</span> became Ohio’s state capital. Surveyors laid out the city in <span class="date">1812</span>, and officials incorporated it in <span class="date">1816</span>. <span class="loc">Columbus</span> was not Ohio’s original capital, but the state legislature chose to move the state government there after its location for <span class="date">a short time</span> at <span class="loc">Chillicothe</span> and at <span class="loc">Zanesville</span>. <span class="loc">Columbus</span> was chosen as the site for the new capital because of its central location within the state and access by way of major transportation routes (primarily rivers) at that time. The legislature chose it as Ohio’s capital over a number of other competitors, including <span class="loc">Franklinton</span>, <span class="loc">Dublin</span>, <span class="loc">Worthington</span>, and <span class="loc">Delaware</span>.</p><br><br>
