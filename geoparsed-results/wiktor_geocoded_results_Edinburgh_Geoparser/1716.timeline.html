  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Scott County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The <span class="date">2014</span> population was 31,653 per the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau. It is the 9th-largest city by population in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. It is the seat of its county. It was originally called <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> when founded by Rev. <span class="per">Elijah Craig</span> and was renamed in <span class="date">1790</span> in honor of President <span class="loc">George Washington</span>. It is the home of <span class="org">Georgetown College</span>, a private liberal arts college. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is part of the Lexington-Fayette, <span class="loc">KY Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The city's growth began in the mid-1980s, when <span class="org">Toyota</span> built <span class="loc">Toyota Motor Manufacturing</span> <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, its first wholly owned <span class="loc">United States</span> plant, in the city. The plant, which currently builds the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Venza, <span class="loc">Avalon</span>, and <span class="org">Lexus</span> ES automobiles, opened in <span class="date">1988</span>. It is the largest building in terms of acres covered under one building in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, with over 200 acres (0.8 km2) occupied. The city previously served as the training camp for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals. Native peoples have lived along the banks of <span class="loc">Elkhorn Creek</span> in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Scott County</span> for <span class="date">at least 15,000 years</span>. European exploration can be dated to a <span class="date">June 1774</span> surveying expedition from <span class="loc">Fincastle County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, led by Colonel <span class="per">John Floyd</span>. For his military service, he was granted a claim of 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) in the area by the state of <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. He named it Royal Spring but did not settle it. <span class="per">John McClellan</span> was the first to settle the area and established <span class="per">McClellan</span>'s Station there in <span class="date">1775</span>, but the compound was abandoned following an Indian attack on <span class="date">December 29, 1776</span>.</p><br><br>
