<p><span class="loc">Durham</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Greene County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,725 at the 2010 census. The town was named after <span class="loc">Durham</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. The Town of <span class="loc">Durham</span> is in the northwest corner of the county. The town was first settled around 1755 within <span class="loc">Albany County</span>. The town was established from part of the Town of <span class="loc">Coxsackie</span> in 1790 as the "Town of Freehold." In the spring of 1800 Freehold became part of the newly formed <span class="loc">Greene County</span>. The town's name was changed to "Durham" in 1805, the town having been called informally "<span class="loc">New Durham</span>" by the many settlers from <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>. Part of the town was lost to form, in 1803, the new Towns of <span class="loc">Cairo</span>, <span class="loc">Greenville</span>, and <span class="loc">Windham</span>. In 1836, the western part of <span class="loc">Durham</span> became the Town of <span class="loc">Conesville</span> in <span class="loc">Schoharie County</span>. The first documented visit to the <span class="loc">Durham</span> area was by Eliab Youmans who had been commissioned to survey the <span class="loc">Maitland</span> patents in 1767. Undoubtedly, explorers, hunters, and trappers preceded <span class="loc">Youmans</span>, but their travels were unrecorded. The patents were the first official parceling out of the largely unclaimed land and were the precursors to settlement. Eight patents have been identified for lands that were in, or partly in the Town of <span class="loc">Durham</span>.</p>
