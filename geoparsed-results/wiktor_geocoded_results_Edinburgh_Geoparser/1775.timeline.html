  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 41,052. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Winchester</span>. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> is part of the Tullahoma-Manchester, <span class="org">TN Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. Euro-American settlement began around <span class="date">1800</span>, and the county was formally organized in <span class="date">1807</span> and named for <span class="per">Benjamin Franklin</span>. During <span class="date">the next several decades</span>, the size of the county was reduced several times by reorganizations which created the neighboring counties of <span class="loc">Coffee County</span>, <span class="loc">Moore County</span>, and <span class="loc">Grundy County</span>. One of the most notable early settlers was frontiersman <span class="per">Davy Crockett</span>, who came about <span class="date">1812</span> but is not thought to have remained long. The <span class="org">University of the South</span>, founded by the Episcopal Church, was organized just before the Civil War. It began full operations shortly after hostilities ceased. It encompasses a full university and theological seminary. The <span class="org">University of Tennessee Space Institute</span> is also located in the county. The area became strongly secessionist before the war. <span class="loc">Franklin County</span> formally threatened to secede from <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> and join <span class="loc">Alabama</span> if <span class="loc">Tennessee</span> did not leave the union, which it shortly did. This contrasted sharply with the situation in nearby <span class="loc">Winston County</span>, <span class="loc">Alabama</span>, which was pro-Union and discussed seceding from <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. The two illustrate the often divided and confused state of loyalties in the central South during this period.</p><br><br>
