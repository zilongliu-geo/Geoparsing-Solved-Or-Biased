<p>Hale is a village in <span class="loc">Surrey</span>, <span class="loc">England</span> between the towns of <span class="loc">Farnham</span> and <span class="loc">Aldershot</span> excluding the area between the two to the east which is <span class="loc">Badshot Lea</span>. On the side of the <span class="loc">Farnham</span> clay and sandstone range, Hale it is informally divided into Upper and Lower parts. Some housing and roads have views southward towards the <span class="loc">Greensand</span> Ridge from <span class="loc">Hindhead</span> to <span class="loc">Ewhurst</span>. The electoral ward <span class="loc">Farnham</span> <span class="loc">Upper Hale</span> has a population of 4,241. Often the eastern built-up (low-rise) area, <span class="loc">Weybourne</span> is considered separately but both localities share all amenities and form a neatly buffered settlement. There is evidence that the area has been occupied since the Mesolithic period. Some of the oldest surviving buildings in Hale date from the late 17th century, in the area once known as <span class="loc">Hungry Hill</span>. The oldest place of worship in the village is a chapel built in 1834. St John's Church was founded in 1844. It was paid for by Bishop Sumner and designed by the architect Benjamin Ferrey. Sumner is buried in the churchyard with his wife. Hale grew rapidly after 1854 when the British Army became established in <span class="loc">Aldershot</span>. Many people came to the area seeking employment in building the nearby town and barracks. As the cottages spread, those nearer to <span class="loc">Aldershot</span> formed a separate village, which became known as <span class="loc">Heath End</span>. In recognition of the services they had rendered, the army gave the villagers of Hale 2 acres (0.81 ha) of land for a new cemetery. St Mark's Church was built near to the cemetery in 1883.</p>
