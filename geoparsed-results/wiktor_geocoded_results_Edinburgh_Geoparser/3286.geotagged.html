<p><span class="loc">Sulu</span> (Tausūg: سوگ, Sūg; <span class="loc">Chavacano</span>: Provincia de Sūlū; Filipino: Lalawigan ng <span class="loc">Sulu</span>) is an autonomous archipelago province in the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>, located in the Autonomous Region in Muslim <span class="loc">Mindanao</span> (ARMM). Its capital is <span class="loc">Jolo</span> and the primary/main island of the same name occupies the middle part of the group of islands in the <span class="loc">Sulu Archipelago</span>, between Basilan and Tawi-Tawi. The peaceful advent of <span class="loc">Islam</span> around 1138 through merchants and traders had a distinct influence on Southeast <span class="loc">Asia</span>. The coming of Arabs, Persians and other Muslims paved the way for the arrival of religious missionaries, traders, scholars and travelers to <span class="loc">Sulu</span> and <span class="loc">Mindanao</span> in the 12th century. A landmark born of the social process was the founding of the Sultanate of <span class="loc">Sulu</span>. Year 1380 CE, Karim-ul Makhdum came to <span class="loc">Sulu</span> and introduced <span class="loc">Islam</span> to the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. Year 1450 CE, a Johore-born Arab adventurer, Sayyid Abubakar Abirin came to <span class="loc">Sulu</span> and lived with Rajah Baguinda Ali, eventually marrying his daughter Dayang-dayang Paramisuli and eventually inheriting Rajah Baguinda's polity (which was a principality before) and turning it into a sultanate. Sayyid Abubakar eventually inherited the rule of Rajah Baguinda, established the Sultanate of <span class="loc">Sulu</span> and became its first Sultan. To consolidate his rule, Sayyid Abubakar united the local political units under the umbrella of the Sultanate. He brought <span class="loc">Sulu</span>, <span class="loc">Zamboanga Peninsula</span>, <span class="loc">Palawan</span> and <span class="loc">Basilan</span> under its aegis.</p>
