  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Ashley</span> is a village and civil parish in the <span class="loc">East Cambridgeshire</span> <span class="loc">district of Cambridgeshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, about 4 miles (6.4 km) east of Newmarket. The modern village consists of the two ancient <span class="loc">parishes of Ashley and Silverley</span>. <span class="per">Ashley</span> covers 2,250 acres (910 ha) and in the <span class="date">2011</span> census had a population of 749. <span class="per">Ashley</span> is in the electoral area of <span class="loc">Cheveley ward</span>. <span class="per">Ashley</span> and <span class="per">Silverley</span> were both mentioned in the Domesday Book. In <span class="date">1086</span> <span class="per">Silverley</span> had a total population off 22 households and had land for 8 plough teams. The Domesday Book does not give the population of <span class="per">Ashley</span>, but <span class="per">Ashley</span> only had land for 4 plough teams. In <span class="date">1086</span>, the tenant-in-chief in both <span class="per">Ashley</span> and <span class="per">Silverley</span> was <span class="per">Aubrey de Vere</span>. In the 13th century, the manors of both <span class="per">Ashley</span> and <span class="per">Silverley</span> were owned by the Knights Hospitallers of <span class="loc">Chippenham</span>. <span class="per">Silverley</span> was the larger of the two villages and so the villages at that time were known as <span class="per">Silverley</span> cum <span class="per">Ashley</span>. However, since the Hospitaller's manor house was situated in <span class="per">Ashley</span>, by the end of the 13th century the villages became known as <span class="per">Ashley</span> cum <span class="per">Silverley</span>.</p><br><br>
