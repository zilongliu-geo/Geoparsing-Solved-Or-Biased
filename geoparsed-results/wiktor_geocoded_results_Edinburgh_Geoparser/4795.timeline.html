  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Princeton</span> is a ghost town located in <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Once a busy port on the <span class="loc">Mississippi River</span>, <span class="loc">Princeton</span> <span class="date">today</span> is covered by forest and a portion of the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Levee. Nothing remains of the settlement. <span class="loc">Princeton</span> was named for <span class="per">William Berry Prince</span>, who settled on nearby <span class="loc">Lake Jackson</span> with his wife <span class="per">Sarah S. Jefferies</span> in the early 1820s. <span class="loc">Princeton</span> was one of the first towns in the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> <span class="org">Delta</span>. In <span class="date">1830</span>, <span class="loc">Princeton</span> became <span class="loc">Washington County</span>'s second county seat after the first county seat, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, caved into the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. The <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River flowed directly west of <span class="loc">Princeton</span>, and "<span class="loc">Princeton</span> Landing" was the town's port. Across the river in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> was the now-extinct town of "<span class="loc">Grand Lake</span>". The <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> Legislature incorporated the "<span class="loc">Lake Washington</span> and <span class="loc">Deer Creek</span> Railroad and Banking Company" in <span class="date">1836</span>. Based in <span class="loc">Princeton</span>, the railroad began constructing a line east from the town to <span class="loc">Lake Washington</span> and <span class="loc">Deer Creek</span>. The intent was to move cotton by railroad to <span class="loc">Princeton</span>, where it could be shipped by boat along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. Only a portion of the railroad bed was completed before the company's charter was repealed in <span class="date">1839</span>.</p><br><br>
