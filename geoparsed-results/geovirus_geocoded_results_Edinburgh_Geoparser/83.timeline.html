  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A cholera epidemic in <span class="loc">Angola</span> has killed over 1,200 people in <span class="date">the past three months</span>. The <span class="org">UN World Health Organization</span> (WHO) says about 35,000 people have fallen ill, half the victims in the capital of <span class="loc">Luanda</span>, where the first cases were detected in <span class="date">February</span>. The <span class="org">UN</span> say the epidemic is <span class="loc">Angola</span>â€™s worst cholera outbreak in <span class="date">almost two decades</span> continues to rage on with 546 new cases and 31 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. A third of the victims are children under 5. The medical charity <span class="loc">Mangola</span>, <span class="org">Medecines</span> Sans Frontieres and the <span class="org">World Health Organisation</span> say it is the worst outbreak recorded in the country. Spokesman for <span class="org">Medecines</span> Sans Frontiere <span class="per">Richard Veerman</span> said: "<span class="loc">Angola</span> is heading for its worst ever outbreak and the situation remains very bad in <span class="loc">Angola</span>," he said. "It's very worrying, the official number of deaths countrywide is <span class="date">now</span> more than 1,200, which is likely under-reported. Many people will be at home and die at home and have no possibility to come to one of our treatment centres." Cholera, an acute intestinal disease caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, causes copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment, including rehydration, is not given promptly.</p><br><br>
