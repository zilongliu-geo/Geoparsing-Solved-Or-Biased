  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Taylor is a town in <span class="loc">Navajo County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was founded by Mormon settlers (<span class="per">James Pearce</span>) in <span class="date">January 1878</span>, <span class="date">several months</span> before the neighboring community of Snowflake, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. Taylor straddles <span class="loc">Silver Creek</span>, flowing from the nearby <span class="loc">White Mountains</span> to the <span class="loc">Little Colorado River</span> on <span class="loc">Arizona</span>'s <span class="loc">Colorado Plateau</span>. According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population of the town is 4,112. There is no postal home delivery in Taylor.

Lack of postal delivery is also a problem when using services that validate postal addresses, as none will validate in Taylor. Taylor was once served by the <span class="org">Apache</span> Railway. The tracks were constructed between <span class="date">1917</span>–<span class="date">1920</span> and extended from the Santa Fe Railway at <span class="loc">Holbrook</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span> to Snowflake and then via Taylor to the forests at <span class="loc">McNary</span>. The Snowflake to McNary line was abandoned in <span class="date">1984</span>. Taylor is located at 34°27′57″N 110°6′16″W (34.465762, -110.104385).
