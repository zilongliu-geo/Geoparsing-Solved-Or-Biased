<p><span class="loc">Milford</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Dickinson County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,898 at the 2010 census. The town includes many businesses related to its location in the <span class="loc">Iowa</span> <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> region and is often referred to as the southern gateway to the <span class="loc">Iowa</span> <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span>. The <span class="loc">Iowa</span> <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> Area was settled in the 1850s. It attracted many colonists because of the rich black soil, water from the lakes, and an abundance of wild game and fish. As the population increased at these times, there was a need for a good flouring mill because the nearest mills were those in Mankato, <span class="loc">Minnesota</span> and <span class="loc">Fort Dodge</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. In 1861, there was an attempt to build one on <span class="loc">Mill Creek</span>, at the outlet of the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span> but the attempt was abandoned after the Dakota-U.S. War of 1862 and the extremely low water level that year. In 1868 one was successfully built, and sawmill was built and put into operation in 1869. The mills began to attract many customers, and the small community began to grow around <span class="loc">Old Town</span>. In 1870, the company that operated the mill bought a section of land northwest of <span class="loc">Old Town</span> and laid out a plan for the town of <span class="loc">Milford</span>.</p>
