  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Not to be confused with the neighboring summit communities of <span class="loc">Beartown</span>, <span class="loc">Blue Ridge Summit</span>, <span class="loc">Buena Vista Springs</span>, <span class="loc">Highfield</span> or <span class="org">Cascade</span>, Pen <span class="date">Mar</span>, or <span class="loc">Pennersville</span> <span class="loc">Monterey</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, is an unincorporated community which was added to the <span class="org">USGS Geographic Names Information System</span> on <span class="date">August 2, 1979</span>. After the site was surveyed c.â€‰<span class="date">1839</span> for the never-completed Tapeworm Railroad, the summit community was settled on the <span class="loc">Emmitsburg</span> &amp; Waynesboro Turnpike [4] east of the Nichol's Gap Road intersection near the <span class="loc">Toll Gate</span> and Brown's Spring and later bypassed by the 20th century <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Route 16 highway. As with the Pen <span class="date">Mar</span> Park to the south, <span class="loc">Monterey</span> was the site of numerous resort facilities such as the <span class="org">Clermont House</span>, <span class="date">1887</span> <span class="loc">Monterey</span> Hotel,[5] the <span class="org">Monterey House</span>,[6] the <span class="loc">Monterey</span> Inn, the <span class="org">Monterey Academy</span>,[7] and the <span class="org">Monterey Country Club</span>. The community's post office established in the late 19th century was named <span class="loc">Charmian</span> (another PA post office already was named <span class="loc">Monterey</span>), and the Charmian station of the <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> and <span class="loc">Harrisburg Railway</span> was established after the Western Extension was laid in 1888-1889 (cf. <span class="loc">Monterey</span> Station in <span class="date">1872</span>).</p><br><br>
