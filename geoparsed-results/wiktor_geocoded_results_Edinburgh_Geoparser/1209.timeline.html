  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Bedford</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Middlesex County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is within the Greater Boston area, 15 miles (24 km) north-west of the <span class="loc">city of Boston</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Bedford</span> was 13,320 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The following compilation comes from <span class="per">Ellen Abrams</span> (<span class="date">1999</span>) based on information from <span class="per">Abram English Brown</span>’s <span class="org">History of the Town</span> of <span class="loc">Bedford</span> (<span class="date">1891</span>), as well as other sources such as The Bedford Sampler Bicentennial Edition containing <span class="per">Daisy Pickman</span> Oakley’s articles, Bedford Vital Records, New <span class="loc">England</span> <span class="per">Historical</span> and <span class="per">Genealogical</span> Register, Town Directories, and other publications from the <span class="org">Bedford Historical Society</span>. The land <span class="date">now</span> within the boundaries of <span class="loc">Bedford</span> was first settled by Europeans around <span class="date">1640</span>. In <span class="date">1729</span> it was incorporated from a portion of <span class="org">Concord</span> (about 3/5 of <span class="loc">Bedford</span>) and a portion of <span class="loc">Billerica</span> (about 2/5 of <span class="loc">Bedford</span>). In <span class="date">1630</span> came the arrival of <span class="per">John Winthrop</span> and <span class="per">Thomas Dudley</span> of the <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> Bay Company. Aboard the Arabella from <span class="loc">Yarmouth</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>, <span class="loc">Winthrop</span> and <span class="per">Dudley</span> sailed, and after a difficult ten-week voyage, they landed on the shores of the <span class="loc">New World</span>, with <span class="loc">Salem</span> and <span class="loc">Boston Harbor</span> being the Arabella's earliest destinations. In <span class="date">1637</span>, the General Court of <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span> granted some 2,200 acres (9 km²) of land, including <span class="loc">Huckins</span> Farm land to the first Governor, <span class="per">John Winthrop</span>, and to Deputy Governor <span class="per">Thomas Dudley</span>. <span class="date">The following year</span>, the two men agreed to divide the land so that the parcel south of the two large boulders by the <span class="org">Concord</span> River (<span class="loc">Brothers Rocks</span>) belonged to <span class="per">Governor Winthrop</span> and north of the Rocks was to belong to Deputy Governor <span class="per">Dudley</span>. Later, <span class="per">Dudley</span> became governor. <span class="per">Dudley</span>’s son <span class="per">Rev. Samuel Dudley</span> and <span class="per">Winthrop</span>’s daughter <span class="per">Mary</span> were married, thus <span class="loc">Brothers Rocks</span> were so named because of this marriage of families.</p><br><br>
