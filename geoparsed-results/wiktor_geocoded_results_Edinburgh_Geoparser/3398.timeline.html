  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Gurun</span> is a small town and a major industrial park situated within the parliamentary <span class="loc">district of Jerai</span> in <span class="loc">Kedah</span>, <span class="loc">Malaysia</span>. "Gurun" in English means desert, however the town does not resemble in the slightest the meaning of its English translation. <span class="loc">Gurun</span> derived its name from the word "gerun", which means terrify or "kurun" meaning elephant in the Siamese dialect. These words are associated with an incident during the reign of Sultan <span class="per">Abdullah Muhammad</span> Shah II Ibni Almarhum Sultan Jaafar Muazzam Shah (<span class="date">1874</span> - <span class="date">1876</span>), Sultan of <span class="loc">Perak</span>, who was killed in <span class="date">1876</span> by the invading Thai armies when they crushed his body using an elephant. This incident took place behind the current Gurun Police Station. Administratively, <span class="loc">Gurun</span> is under the district of <span class="loc">Kuala Muda</span> and falls within the local government administration of <span class="org">Sungai Petani Municipal Council</span>. <span class="loc">Gurun</span> is designated as N22 for the <span class="org">Kedah State Legislative Council Zone</span> and is represented by <span class="per">Dr Leong Yong Kong</span> (National Front - BN) (incumbent) who defeated Salma binti <span class="loc">Ismail</span> (People Justice Party - PKR) with majority of 1,296 votes in the <span class="date">2013</span> General Election. Its Member of Parliament (P12 - <span class="loc">Jerai</span>) is Datuk <span class="loc">Seri</span> <span class="loc">Jamil</span> <span class="loc">Khir</span> bin Baharom (National Front - BN) who defeated Mohd. Firdaus Ja'afar (<span class="org">Malaysian Islamic Party</span> - PAS) by a majority of 1,196 votes.</p><br><br>
