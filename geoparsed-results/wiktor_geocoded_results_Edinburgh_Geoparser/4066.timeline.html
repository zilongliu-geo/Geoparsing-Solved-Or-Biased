  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Birmingham</span> is a borough in <span class="loc">Huntingdon County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 90 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> is the site of the Birmingham Window, a geologic structure created by a Paleozoic thrust fault. Birmingham's early settler, <span class="per">John Cadwallader</span>, settled on a hill above the <span class="loc">Little Juniata River</span> and made plans to establish a large city. Legend among the local residents is that it was once in consideration to be the state capital. In <span class="date">the first several decades</span> of the 19th century, the village grew quickly as a hub for commerce being carried on the <span class="loc">Little Juniata River</span> and on the nearby <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Canal. By <span class="date">1850</span>, the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Railroad had passed through the valley. The development of the railroad diminished the importance of <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> as a trading hub since the railroad's nearby hubs in <span class="per">Tyrone</span> and <span class="per">Altoona</span> grew quickly on land that was better suited for development. In <span class="date">1853</span>, the Mountain Female Seminary opened in <span class="loc">Birmingham</span> as a boarding school for girls. In its earliest <span class="date">years</span>, the school benefited from the ease of transportation afforded by the passage of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> railroad through <span class="loc">Birmingham</span>. Currently, the school still operates as <span class="org">Grier School</span>, a boarding school for girls.</p><br><br>
