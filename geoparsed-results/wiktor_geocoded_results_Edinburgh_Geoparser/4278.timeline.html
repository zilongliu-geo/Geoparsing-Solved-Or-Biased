  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Mapua</span> is a small town in the <span class="loc">South Island</span> of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>. It is to the west of Nelson on State Highway 60 and on the coastline of <span class="loc">Tasman Bay</span>. The <span class="date">2006</span> census gave a population of <span class="date">1878</span>, up 16.1 percent since the <span class="date">2001</span> Census.: With a thriving wharf and commercial area, <span class="loc">Mapua</span> has grown in popularity for visitors, with numbers swelling the region over the <span class="date">summer</span> <span class="date">months</span>. A large fair and market is held every <span class="date">Easter Sunday</span>. Up to 30,000 people visit the town on <span class="date">this day</span> to enjoy rides, stalls, and other attractions. The local schools and playcentre benefit from the fair, which is their primary fundraising activity. Middens, tools and human bones found at <span class="loc">Grossis</span> Point and around the Northern edges of the Waimea inlet suggest small seasonal Maori settlements were located here With a <span class="per">Major Pa</span> (fortified settlement) located on the Kina Cliffs, Which survived through to early European settlement of the Mapua area, and can still be visited by the public. The lack of evidence of cannibalism and the rarity of weapons indicates that the Maori living in this district were peaceful and seldom were involved in wars. In the late 1820s, <span class="loc">Maori</span> from the <span class="loc">North Island</span> (led by the Maori Chief <span class="per">Te Rauparaha</span>) came to the <span class="loc">South Island</span> with warriors armed with muskets. <span class="per">Te Rauparaha</span> took over <span class="loc">Marlborough</span> before sending half his army west to take over <span class="loc">Tasman Bay</span> and <span class="loc">Golden Bay</span>. Due to the invaders' considerable advantage in weaponry and skill, they soon overcame the local Maori populations. After a battle, most of the invaders moved on, leaving only a small local population of <span class="loc">Maori</span> left in the region.</p><br><br>
