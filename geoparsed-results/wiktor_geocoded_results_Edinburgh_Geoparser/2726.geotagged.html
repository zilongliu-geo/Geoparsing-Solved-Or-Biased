<p>Columbia, formerly Wright's Ferry, is a borough in <span class="loc">Lancaster County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, 28 miles (45 km) southeast of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> on the left (east) bank of the <span class="loc">Susquehanna River</span>, across from <span class="loc">Wrightsville</span> and <span class="loc">York County</span> and just south of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 30. The settlement was founded in 1726 by Colonial English Quakers from <span class="loc">Chester County</span> led by entrepreneur and evangelist John Wright. Establishment of the eponymous Wright's Ferry, the first commercial <span class="loc">Susquehanna</span> crossing in the region, inflamed territorial conflict with neighboring <span class="loc">Maryland</span> but brought growth and prosperity to the small town, which was briefly considered as a candidate for the new <span class="loc">United States</span>' capital. Though besieged for a short while by Civil War destruction, Columbia remained a lively center of transport and industry throughout the 19th century, once serving as a terminus of the <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> Canal. Later, however, the Great Depression and 20th-century changes in economy and technology sent the borough into decline. It is notable today as the site of one of the world's few museums devoted entirely to horology. The area around present-day <span class="loc">Columbia</span> was originally populated by Native American tribes, most notably the Susquehannocks, who migrated to the area between 1575 and 1600 after separating from the Iroquois Confederacy. They established villages just south of <span class="loc">Columbia</span> in what is now <span class="loc">Washington Boro</span>, as well as points as far south as <span class="loc">Maryland</span>. Captain John Smith estimated their numbers to be about 2,000 in the early 1600s.</p>
