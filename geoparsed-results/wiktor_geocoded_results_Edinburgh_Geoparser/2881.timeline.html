  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wamba</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">Luo Scientific Reserve</span>, <span class="loc">Tshuapa District</span> of the <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>. It is inhabited by Bongando people. The reserve is home to bonobos, threatened due to hunting. The 150 square kilometres (58 sq mi) Wamba forest is home to an important population of bonobos. It was founded in <span class="date">1973</span> by Takayoshi Kano, who surveyed the forests of Congo, covering 2,000 km on bicycle.  After travelling through occasionally hostile villages, he found <span class="loc">Wamba</span> to be friendly, and he could hear bonobo calls from the forest, so he decided to set up a research station here. In <span class="date">1974</span>, his student Suehisa Kuroda went to <span class="loc">Wamba</span> and identified three groups of bonobos, one of which they were able to habituate after <span class="date">a year</span>, by provisioning a sugarcane field. In <span class="date">the past</span>, the local people co-existed with the bonobos and had taboos against eating bushmeat. These have broken down as villagers were forced to hide in the forest during two civil wars. By <span class="date">2005</span> an area that once held 300 bonobos <span class="date">now</span> held just 22, with a serious risk of extinction.</p><br><br>
