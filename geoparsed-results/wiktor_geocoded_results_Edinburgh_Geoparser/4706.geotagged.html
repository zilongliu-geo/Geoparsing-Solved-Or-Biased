<p>Vale is a city in <span class="loc">Malheur County</span>, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, about 12 miles (19 km) west of the Idaho border. It is at the intersection of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Routes 20 and 26, on the <span class="loc">Malheur River</span> at its confluence with <span class="loc">Bully Creek</span>. Vale was selected as Malheur's county seat in 1955, 68 years after the county was founded. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 1,874, down from 1,976 in 2000. Vale is part of the <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, OR–ID Micropolitan Statistical Area. The community was the first stop in <span class="loc">Oregon</span> along the <span class="loc">Oregon</span> Trail. A post office with the name of Vale was established in February 1883, and the community was incorporated by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on February 21, 1889. Originally incorporated as the Town of Vale, it became the City of Vale in 1905. Vale has a semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk). July is on average the hottest month and January the coldest. Typically there will be 148.3 nights each winter falling below 32 °F or 0 °C and 6.3 nights falling under 0 °F or −17.8 °C, although the clear skies mean that only 25.2 days do not top freezing and only 101.5 days fail to top 50 °F or 10 °C. During summer, 12.7 days will top 100 °F or 37.8 °C and 61.2 days – including 43 of 62 in July and August – will on average top 90 °F or 32.2 °C. However, the low humidity and clear high-altitude skies mean nights are cool even in summer, with minima rarely above 65 °F or 18.3 °C.</p>
