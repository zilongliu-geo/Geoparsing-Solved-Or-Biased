  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Gilbert</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Maricopa County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located southeast of <span class="per">Phoenix</span>, within the <span class="loc">Phoenix metropolitan</span> area. Once known as the "Hay Shipping Capital of the World", <span class="per">Gilbert</span> is currently the most populous incorporated town in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. <span class="per">Gilbert</span> encompasses 76 square miles (197 km2) and has made a rapid transformation from an agriculture-based community to an economically diverse suburban center located in the southeast valley of the <span class="loc">Phoenix metropolitan</span> area. In <span class="date">the last three decades</span>, <span class="per">Gilbert</span> has grown at an extremely high rate, increasing in population from 5,717 in <span class="date">1980</span> to 208,453 as of the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="per">Gilbert</span> owes its beginnings to William "Bobby" <span class="per">Gilbert</span> who provided land to the <span class="loc">Arizona</span> Eastern Railway in <span class="date">1902</span> to construct a rail line between <span class="per">Phoenix</span> and <span class="per">Florence</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. Ayer's Grocery Store, the first store in <span class="per">Gilbert</span>, opened in <span class="date">1910</span> and became the location of the first post office in <span class="date">1912</span>. The location of the town post office moved several times before settling on the east side of <span class="per">Gilbert</span> Road in downtown, where it still stands <span class="date">today</span>. In <span class="date">1912</span>, many Mormons who had fled the Mormon colonies in <span class="loc">Mexico</span> due to the actions of the forces of <span class="per">Pancho Villa</span> settled in <span class="per">Gilbert</span>. By <span class="date">1915</span>, they began holding church meetings at the <span class="org">Gilbert Elementary School</span>. In <span class="date">1918</span>, they were organized into the <span class="per">Gilbert Ward</span>.</p><br><br>
