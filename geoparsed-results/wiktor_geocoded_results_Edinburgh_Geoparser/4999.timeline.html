  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Margate</span> is a small seaside town on the Channel Highway between <span class="loc">North-West Bay</span> and the Snug Tiers, 7 kilometres (4 mi) south of Kingston in <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. At the <span class="date">2006</span> census, <span class="loc">Margate</span> had a population of 1,368. Although more people live in the immediate region around the town. <span class="loc">Margate</span> is part of the <span class="org">Kingborough Council</span> and is a frequent 'pit-stop' for those travelling south towards Snug, <span class="loc">Kettering</span> or <span class="loc">Bruny Island</span>. Vineyards, grazing fields and stands of trees surround the town and its approaches. The town itself has a range of shops, schools and religious buildings as well as several notable features including the Dru Point Bicentennial Park on the edge of <span class="loc">North-West Bay</span>. Recent history has seen <span class="loc">Margate</span> strongly affected by the building boom of the early 2000s with new housing developments in almost all directions. This in some ways reflects demographic themes within the population. A fair percentage of the population commute into the greater Hobart area while the rest are employed locally in either the service industry or commercial enterprises such as the Tassal fish factory or the Austal shipyard. Margate Primary school has been declared a "big winner" from the <span class="date">2009</span> Australian federal budget, receiving $2.5 million for new buildings. However the local <span class="org">ABC</span> Learning centre narrowly avoided closure. More recently the residents of <span class="loc">Margate</span> were found by the <span class="date">Sunday</span> <span class="org">Tasmanian's National Health Test</span>, to be the "happiest in the state."</p><br><br>
