  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Brandon is a small town and civil parish in the English <span class="loc">county of Suffolk</span>. It is in the <span class="per">Forest Heath</span> local government district. Brandon is located in the Breckland area on the border of <span class="loc">Suffolk</span> with the adjoining <span class="loc">county of Norfolk</span>. Surrounded by Forestry Commission and agricultural land it is considered a rural town. According to <span class="per">Eilert Ekwall</span> (The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names) the likely origin of the name is "Brandon, usually 'hill where broom grows'", the earliest known spelling being in the 11th century when the town, gradually expanding up and along the rising ground of the river valley, was called Bromdun. From prehistoric times the area was mined for flint as can be seen at Grimes Graves, a popular Brandon tourist destination. Much more recently, the town was a major centre for the production of gunflints. The Domesday Book records that the manor of Brandon in <span class="date">1086</span> had 25 households. In medieval times and beyond Brandon was renowned for its rabbit fur. On <span class="date">14 May 1789</span>, the town suffered a Great Fire, a report of which can be found at the <span class="org">Brandon Heritage Centre</span>. While all the young men were away at <span class="date">a fair day</span> in nearby <span class="loc">Thetford</span>, a fire caused by a lightning strike set fire to the surgeon's house which quickly spread to the surrounding properties. Eleven houses were damaged and 8 of them were completely destroyed. The hardest hit was <span class="per">Francis Diggon</span>, the saddler, who lost all of his property and possessions, costing a total of 381 pounds, 2 shillings.</p><br><br>
