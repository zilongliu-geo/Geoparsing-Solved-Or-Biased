<p><span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> (Spanish: santa—holy, fe—faith) is a city in <span class="loc">Galveston County</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is named for the Santa Fe Railroad (now part of BNSF Railway) which runs through the town alongside State Highway 6. The population of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> at the 2010 census was 12,222. Locals refer to their town as "The Fe." In 1877, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway was built through the western part of <span class="loc">Galveston county</span>. By the turn of the century, three small, unincorporated towns had formed along the railway: <span class="loc">Alta Loma</span>, <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> and <span class="loc">Algoa</span>. The Santa Fe Independent School District, named after the railway, was established shortly afterward to serve the area. In the mid-1970s, the neighboring <span class="loc">City of Hitchcock</span> tried to annex an area in eastern <span class="loc">Alta Loma</span> known as the Morningview neighborhood. The residents of this neighborhood were passionately opposed to becoming a part of <span class="loc">Hitchcock</span>. <span class="loc">Hitchcock</span> was culturally very different, and <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> and <span class="loc">Hitchcock</span> sports teams had harbored an intense rivalry for decades. To fend off annexation, a petitioning effort was begun to incorporate the area into a new city. On January 21, 1978, a ballot proposal to incorporate <span class="loc">Alta Loma</span> and parts of <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> (a total of nine square miles) passed by a wide margin, and the City of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> was born. In the years since, the City of <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> has grown to include all of <span class="loc">Arcadia</span> and parts of <span class="loc">Algoa</span>, and has become one of the more affluent areas of <span class="loc">Galveston County</span>. Today, ironically, <span class="loc">Santa Fe</span> is twice the size of <span class="loc">Hitchcock</span>.</p>
