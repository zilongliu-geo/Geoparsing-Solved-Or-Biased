<p><span class="loc">Bala</span> is a Canadian community famous for the <span class="loc">Bala</span> Falls. It is located in <span class="loc">Muskoka Lakes Township</span> in <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, where <span class="loc">Lake Muskoka</span> empties into the Moon River. It is considered one of the hubs of cottage country located north of <span class="loc">Toronto</span>. Thus, its year-round population of several hundred is increased by thousands of seasonal residents and weekend day-trippers during summer months. It is known as the Cranberry Capital of <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, as the province's largest cranberry farms, Johnston's <span class="loc">Cranberry Marsh</span> and Wahta Iroquis Growers, are located nearby. It was once the smallest incorporated town in <span class="loc">Canada</span>, until amalgamation as part of <span class="loc">Muskoka Lakes Township</span>. <span class="loc">Bala</span> was settled by Thomas Burgess in 1868. Thomas Burgess opened a sawmill and store to serve the area's scattered settlers. Thomas Burgess named it after the town of <span class="loc">Bala</span> in <span class="loc">Wales</span> with which it is officially twinned. Located on the <span class="loc">Canadian Shield</span>, it proved unsuitable for farming and its fortunes declined as logging became less economically viable. Railway connections helped to re-establish the village as a popular location for summer resorts. In 1914, the town incorporated with Burgess' son as the first mayor making it the smallest incorporated town in <span class="loc">Canada</span>.</p>
