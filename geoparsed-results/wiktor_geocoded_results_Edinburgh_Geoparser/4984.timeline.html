  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Guildford</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Perth</span>, Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 12 km northeast of the city. Its local government area is <span class="org">the City of Swan</span>. <span class="loc">Guildford</span> was established in <span class="date">1829</span> on the <span class="loc">Swan River</span>, being sited near a permanent fresh water supply. During <span class="per">Captain Stirling</span>'s exploration for a suitable site to establish a colony on the western side of <span class="org">the Australian</span> continent in the late 1820s, the exploration party of boats found a fresh water stream across the river from the site of <span class="loc">Guildford</span> which they called Success Hill. <span class="loc">Guildford</span> was primarily the centre of the <span class="org">Swan</span> <span class="loc">River Colony</span> before <span class="loc">Perth</span> succeeded in being the dominant location on the <span class="org">Swan</span> Coastal Plain. <span class="loc">Guildford</span> was the home of <span class="loc">Lew</span> <span class="loc">Whiteman</span> and his family. The <span class="loc">Whiteman</span> family were responsible for the establishment of various industries. The <span class="loc">Whiteman</span> family established Mussel Pool as a picnic area for their employees. This land and the purchase of surrounding land by the State Government in <span class="date">1978</span> was used to create <span class="loc">Whiteman</span> Park. The original home of the <span class="loc">Whiteman</span> family are <span class="date">now</span> Tea rooms; the house is one of the oldest standing homes in Western <span class="loc">Australia</span>.</p><br><br>
