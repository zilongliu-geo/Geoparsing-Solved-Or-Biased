<p>Hampton is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, 14 kilometres (9 mi) south-east of Melbourne's central business district. Its local government area is the <span class="loc">City of Bayside</span>. At the 2011 Census, Hampton had a population of 12,482. Hampton is in a wealthy bayside area of Melbourne, wedged between the suburbs of <span class="loc">Brighton</span> and <span class="loc">Sandringham</span>. Hampton has a vibrant shopping centre along the main road, Hampton Street, boasting more than 50 cafes and restaurants plus numerous fashionable boutiques. Hampton, like <span class="loc">Brighton</span>, started off as a place of market gardens in the 1840s and 1850s, supplying fruits and vegetables for Melbourne. In the 1850s, interest started to grow in the beaches in the area as places for daytrips and holidays for Melbournians, particularly <span class="loc">Picnic Point</span>, on the beautiful bay foreshore of Hampton. This expanded when a railway line was built to <span class="loc">Brighton</span> Beach in the 1860s. In 1887, the railway line was extended to <span class="loc">Sandringham</span>, with a station servicing <span class="loc">Picnic Point</span>. It was called Retreat, after the Retreat Hotel at the Point. However, several landmarks in the area, including the beach, had been named Hampton, after a local market gardener Dyas Hampton, and as wealthy landowners began buying subdivided land in the area, they favored the name Hampton as it sounded more regal. The name was set when the station was renamed Hampton. Hampton Post Office opened on 1 July 1909.</p>
