  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Dayton</span> is a town in <span class="loc">York County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,965 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> statistical area. <span class="per">Dayton</span> is one of the smallest towns in <span class="loc">York County</span>. The area was once inhabited by the <span class="loc">Sokokis</span> (or <span class="loc">Saco</span>) Indians, who hunted and fished along the <span class="loc">Saco</span> River. The old <span class="loc">Sokokis</span> Trail is <span class="date">now</span> Route 5, which passes through <span class="per">Dayton</span>. In <span class="date">1664</span>, Major <span class="per">William Phillips</span> purchased from the sagamore the land which would become Little Falls Plantation—today the towns of <span class="per">Hollis, Dayton</span> and part of <span class="loc">Limington</span>. In <span class="date">1728</span>, a stockaded fort which contained a trading post was built a half mile below <span class="loc">Union Falls</span>. Called the <span class="org">Saco Truck House</span> or <span class="org">Saco Block House</span>, the garrison was maintained throughout the <span class="org">French and Indian War</span> until the fall of <span class="loc">Quebec</span> in <span class="date">1759</span>. Settlers arrived in <span class="date">1753</span>, and lumbering became a principal industry. Logs were rolled down the banks of the <span class="loc">Saco</span> River and floated to sawmills at <span class="loc">Saco</span>. <span class="per">Nathaniel Goodwin</span> established the first local mill in <span class="date">1782</span> at Goodwins Mills, where falls in <span class="org">Swan</span> Brook drop 33 feet (10 m). A sawmill and gristmill were erected at <span class="loc">Union Falls</span> (then called Hopkinson's Mill) in <span class="date">1806</span>. Tanneries were built, and land was cleared for farms. In <span class="date">1798</span>, Little Falls Plantation was incorporated as <span class="loc">Phillipsburg</span>, in honor of <span class="per">Major William</span> Phillips—but only until <span class="date">1810</span>. Considered difficult to pronounce and write, the <span class="loc">Phillipsburg</span> was changed to <span class="per">Hollis</span>. Then, in <span class="date">1854</span>, the southern part of <span class="per">Hollis</span> petitioned the state legislature to become a separate town. Permission was granted, and the community was named <span class="per">Dayton</span> after <span class="per">Thomas Day</span>, who submitted the petition.</p><br><br>
