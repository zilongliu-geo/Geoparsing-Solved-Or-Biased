<p><span class="loc">Kirkwood</span> is a town in the Eastern Cape Province of <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. It is situated on the banks of the <span class="loc">Sundays River</span> in the eponymously named <span class="loc">Sundays River</span> Valley, which forms part of the <span class="loc">Sundays River</span> Valley Municipality in the Sarah Baartman District Municipality of the Eastern Cape. <span class="loc">Kirkwood</span> is situated about 80 km (50 mi) from the <span class="loc">Indian Ocean</span> and about 100 meters (330 ft) above sea level. The South African Weather Service recorded a temperature of 50.3 °C (122.5 °F) in <span class="loc">Kirkwood</span> in 1928 - the highest temperature ever recorded in <span class="loc">South Africa</span>. To the north of <span class="loc">Kirkwood</span> are the <span class="loc">Rietberg</span> Mountains with the Uyepoort (Uye Gateway), which provides passage to the <span class="loc">Zuurberg Mountains</span> and the <span class="loc">Addo Elephant National Park</span>. The Governor of the <span class="loc">Cape Colony</span>, Sir John Francis Cradock, gave the first farms in the <span class="loc">Sundays River</span> Valley to the leaders of the successful burger commandos for their role in the victories in the border wars of 1811 and 1812. These farms were awarded to Magistrate Cuyler (originally from the <span class="loc">United States</span>) of <span class="loc">Uitenhage</span>, who received <span class="loc">Geelhoutboom</span> (Yellow Tree, later <span class="loc">Dunbrody</span>); Commandant Ignatius Muller, who received Klaaskraal (Klaas' Corral, situated just outside what is now <span class="loc">Kirkwood</span>) and Field Cornet J.S. van <span class="loc">Niekerk</span>, who received Gouwernements Belooning (Government's Reward). It is on the latter farm that <span class="loc">Kirkwood</span> would be established many decades later.</p>
