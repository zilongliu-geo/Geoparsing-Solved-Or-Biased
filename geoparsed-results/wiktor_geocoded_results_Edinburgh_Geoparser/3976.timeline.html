  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Boca</span> is a former settlement in <span class="loc">Nevada County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. It is situated at an elevation of 5,528 ft (1,685 m) above sea level. <span class="loc">Boca</span> is located on the Southern Pacific Railroad, 6.5 miles (10.5 km) northeast of <span class="loc">Truckee</span>. The place was named by the Central Pacific Railroad Boca (Spanish for "mouth" and "river mouth") in <span class="date">1867</span> because it was near the mouth of the <span class="loc">Little Truckee River</span>. It had a post office during the period of <span class="date">1872</span> through <span class="date">1945</span>. In <span class="date">1880</span>, the population was 200. <span class="loc">Boca</span> has a fairly typical climate for its region, a continental Mediterranean climate (Köppen Dsb), with dry summers that feature hot <span class="date">days</span> and cold <span class="date">nights</span>, and cold, snowy winters. Snowfall is less heavy than <span class="loc">Truckee</span> and <span class="loc">Tahoe</span> city due to the rain shadow effect of the <span class="loc">Sierra Nevada</span>, but depths can still reach to 90 inches (2.29 m), and in recent times 70 inches (1.78 m) of snow was on the ground at <span class="date">the end of February</span> <span class="date">1993</span>. On <span class="date">January 20, 1937</span>, the temperature at <span class="loc">Boca</span> fell to −45 °F (−42.8 °C), the lowest temperature ever recorded in <span class="loc">California</span>, though on average only <span class="date">a dozen nights</span> will fall below 0 °F (−17.8 °C) and <span class="date">256 days</span> exceed 50 °F (10 °C). Nightly frosts are common even in <span class="date">summer</span>, and only <span class="date">93 nights</span> per year fail to fall below 32 °F (0 °C).</p><br><br>
