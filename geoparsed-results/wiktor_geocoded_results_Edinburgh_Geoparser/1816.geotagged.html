<p>Mason is a city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. It is named after the state's first governor, Stevens T. Mason. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 8,252. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Ingham County</span>. Mason is the only city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> that serves as a county seat ahead of a state capital, with the capital of <span class="loc">Lansing</span> also in <span class="loc">Ingham County</span>. Despite Mason being the county seat, many county offices and courtrooms are located in <span class="loc">Lansing</span>. In 1836 Charles Noble knew that <span class="loc">Michigan</span> would be seeking a central location for a new capital when it became a state. He purchased an area of forest, cleared 20 acres (81,000 m2), and founded Mason Center. The "Center" was soon dropped. In 1847, however, the state chose Lansing Township 12 miles (19 km) northward to be its capital due its potential for water power. Noble managed to make Mason the county seat instead. <span class="loc">Ingham County</span>'s first downtown courthouse was built in 1843, and was replaced in 1858, and then again in 1905.</p>
