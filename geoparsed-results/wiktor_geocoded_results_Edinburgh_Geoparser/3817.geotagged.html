<p><span class="loc">Knox County</span> is a county located in <span class="loc">Indiana</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It was one of two original counties created in the old Northwest Territory in 1790 and was reduced to its present size in 1817. As of 2010, the population was 38,440. The county seat is <span class="loc">Vincennes</span>. In 1790, Winthrop Sargent, Secretary of Northwest Territory, organized the first <span class="loc">Indiana county</span>, <span class="loc">Knox County</span>. It was named for Major General Henry Knox, <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Secretary of War. <span class="loc">Knox County</span> was one of the original counties of the Northwest Territory and was created prior to the formation of the <span class="loc">Indiana</span> Territory. When it was created, <span class="loc">Knox County</span> extended to <span class="loc">Canada</span> and encompassed all or part of the present states of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, and <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. When the <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Territory was formed in 1809, the portions of <span class="loc">Knox County</span> beyond the <span class="loc">Wabash</span> River became a part of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. Many of Knox Country townships and lots were surveyed with the French system, which goes towards non-cardinal compass points. Knox and Clark counties are the only ones laid out in this fashion. The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, and by the <span class="loc">Indiana</span> Code.</p>
