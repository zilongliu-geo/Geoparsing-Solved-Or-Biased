<p><span class="loc">Loka</span> (pronounced [ˈloːka]; Italian: <span class="loc">Lonche</span>) is a small village in the City Municipality of <span class="loc">Koper</span> in the Littoral region of <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. The toponym <span class="loc">Loka</span> is relatively common in <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. It is derived from the Slovene noun loka 'swampy meadow', from Proto-Slavic *lǫka 'swampy, flood-prone meadow', semantically derived from 'meander'. Toponyms of the same origin are also found in other Slavic countries (e.g., Polish Łąka, Serbian Luka, Bulgarian Shiroka Laka, etc.) The Italian name <span class="loc">Lonche</span> reflects the early Slavic nasal vowel. During the Second World War, from March to September 1943 the first regional committee of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation was headquartered at the house of Ivan Žigante (a.k.a. Peter) in the hamlet of Žgani. <span class="loc">Loka</span> was burned by German forces on 12 October 1943. The local church is dedicated to Saint Cecilia and belongs to the <span class="loc">Parish of Predloka</span>. The medieval church was burned by German forces on 12 October 1943 and its ruins were registered as cultural heritage. The parish archive, which had been transferred from Predloka to <span class="loc">Loka</span> for safekeeping, was also destroyed in the fire. The church was rebuilt by the villagers in 2005.</p>
