<p>Lawrence is a village in <span class="loc">Nassau County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the village population was 6,483. The Village of Lawrence is in the southwest corner of the Town of <span class="loc">Hempstead</span>, adjoining the border with the New <span class="loc">York City</span> <span class="loc">borough of Queens</span> to the west and near the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> to the south. Lawrence is one of the "Five Towns", which consists of the villages of Lawrence and Cedarhurst, the hamlets (unincorporated areas) of <span class="loc">Woodmere</span> and <span class="loc">Inwood</span>, and "The <span class="loc">Hewletts</span>", which is made up of the hamlet of <span class="loc">Hewlett</span> together with the villages of <span class="loc">Hewlett Bay Park</span>, <span class="loc">Hewlett Harbor</span> and <span class="loc">Hewlett Neck</span>, along with <span class="loc">Woodsburgh</span>. Old Lawrence, or Back Lawrence, is a part of the Village of Lawrence, comprising many large homes, mansions, beach side villas and former plantations with very large property, a few dating back to the time of the American Revolution. This area, like <span class="loc">Hewlett</span> is unique because its rural affluence is similar in character to the more well known <span class="loc">Gold Coast</span> of the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> instead of being more urbanized like the rest of the <span class="loc">South Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Nassau County</span>. An interesting pre-Revolutionary home on <span class="loc">Long Island</span>, Rock Hall, was home to two prominent families, the Martins and Hewletts, and is now an active museum.</p>
