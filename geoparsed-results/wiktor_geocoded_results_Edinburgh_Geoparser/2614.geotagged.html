<p><span class="loc">Collinsville</span> is a mining town and locality in the Whitsunday Region, <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. In the 2011 census, <span class="loc">Collinsville</span> had a population of 1,501 people. The town has a historical association with radicalism to the extent that it earned the nickname "little <span class="loc">Moscow</span>". <span class="loc">Collinsville</span> is in the coal-rich <span class="loc">Bowen</span> Basin region of Central <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, 1,245 kilometres (774 mi) north of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> and 87 kilometres (54 mi) south-west of the coastal town of <span class="loc">Bowen</span>. European settlement of the region began in 1861 with the opening of the lands to pastoralists, with some cattle stations still in operation. Coal was discovered in 1866 but it wasn't until 1912 that large-scale mining operations commenced. The town was originally known as 'Moongunya', an aboriginal word that roughly translates to 'place of coal'. On 20 September 1921 it was officially renamed <span class="loc">Collinsville</span> after Charles Collins who was the Labor Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for <span class="loc">Bowen</span> from 1915 to 1936. Collinsville State School opened on 27 June 1921. Collinsville Post Office opened on 21 May 1923 (a receiving office had been open from 1922).</p>
