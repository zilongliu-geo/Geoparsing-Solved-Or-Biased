  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Beaufort</span> (Welsh: <span class="per">Cendl</span> or <span class="per">Y Cendl</span>) is a village and community located in the historic <span class="loc">county of Brecknockshire</span> (Breconshire) and the preserved <span class="loc">county of Gwent</span>. It currently lies on the northern edge of the <span class="loc">county borough of Blaenau Gwent</span> in <span class="loc">Wales</span>. According to the <span class="date">2011</span> census, the population of the <span class="loc">ward of Beaufort</span> is 3,866 with the community of <span class="per">Beaufort</span> (which includes the <span class="loc">wards of Badminton and Rassau</span>) being 10,210. The settlement arose on the boundary of two parishes, <span class="loc">Llangattock</span> in <span class="loc">Brecknockshire</span> and Aberystruth in <span class="loc">Monmouthshire</span> on the <span class="date">1779</span> establishment of the <span class="per">Beaufort</span> Iron Works by <span class="per">Edward</span> and <span class="per">Jonathan</span> Kendall (<span class="per">Cendl</span>) after whom the new settlement was first named. NB The photograph is of the 'New Rassau estate'. Built late fifties-seventies. The information above, pertains to the village commonly known as 'The Old Rassau', but recognised by the local Authority as one community called 'Rassau'. The village's name derives from the fact that much of the local land was originally owned by the <span class="per">Duke of Beaufort</span>. The border between <span class="loc">Beaufort</span> and <span class="loc">Ebbw Vale</span> itself is generally considered to be the <span class="loc">Ebbw River</span> which passes close to St David's Church (Church in <span class="loc">Wales</span>).</p><br><br>
