<p>‘Rodent activity’ temporarily closes restaurant. Richmond’s Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant was shut down March 10 by the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, marking the city’s sixth restaurant closure of the year and its fifth for rodent infestation. The restaurant, at #80-8100 Ackroyd Rd., was ordered closed after an inspector found 19 violations. Among them were signs of “rodent activity” inside the walk-in cooler, on floors, shelves and on products, food stored with other decaying food, mould found on the cooler walls and holes present in the walls. The Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant re-opened a day later, on March 11, after an inspector found the conditions had improved sufficiently. Richmond's other closures for the year were at Yokohama Japanese Restaurant, Jo Jo's <span class="loc">Cafe</span>, Wing Kee Restaurant, Tomiyama Ent. Ltd. and Ginger and Garlic Malaysian Restaurant and Grill. They have all since reopened.</p>
