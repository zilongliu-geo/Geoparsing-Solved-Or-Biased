  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Rincon</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in Doña <span class="loc">Ana County</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the CDP population was 271. It is part of the <span class="org">Las Cruces Metropolitan Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Rincon</span> is located at 32°40′21″N 107°3′58″W (32.672457, -107.066132), adjacent to Hatch, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span> in the valley of the <span class="loc">Rio Grande</span>. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2), all of it land. <span class="loc">Rincon</span> is 33 miles <span class="loc">north of Las Cruces</span>, <span class="loc">New Mexico</span>, on Interstate 25, and approximately 20 miles south of Spaceport <span class="loc">America</span>, a new purpose-built spaceport being built by the New <span class="loc">Mexico</span> Spaceport Authority with State and county funding. Spaceport construction has generated some 800 temporary jobs on the site, but some Rincon residents have been skeptical that the spaceport will generate as many jobs in the long term as supporters claimed in the runup to public funding. As of <span class="date">January 2012</span>, one company, <span class="org">Virgin</span> Galactic, plans to employ about 150 persons at the spaceport site.</p><br><br>
