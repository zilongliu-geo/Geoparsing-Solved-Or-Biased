<p>Lincoln is a city in the province of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> in <span class="loc">Argentina</span>. It is the capital of the <span class="loc">district of Lincoln</span> (Lincoln Partido). The <span class="loc">district of Lincoln</span> was established on July 19, 1865, during a redistricting of <span class="loc">Buenos Aires</span> Province. The first settlement of the <span class="loc">city of Lincoln</span> occurred in 1871. The name Lincoln was chosen as a tribute to the recently assassinated <span class="loc">Abraham Lincoln</span>, 16th President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> (1861 to 1865), and enactor of the Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln's economy is dominated by agriculture. The main crops are wheat, maize, soy and sunflowers. The district is home to around 500,000 cows and is responsible for 10% of <span class="loc">Argentina</span>'s honey production. Bees are bred and nourished as champions to compete in international honey producing competitions. Carnivals held in Lincoln are the main tourist attraction, featuring carrozas, cabezudos, mechanical attractions and a non-stop music and general party ambience. Recently, the city hosts as well the Lincoln Rock Festival. Both events contribute to the arrival of the so-called turistas gasoleros (inexpensive tourism).</p>
