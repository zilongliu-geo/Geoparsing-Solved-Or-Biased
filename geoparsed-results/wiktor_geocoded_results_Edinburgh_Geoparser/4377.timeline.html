  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Memphis is a city in <span class="loc">Scotland County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,822 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Scotland County</span>. Memphis is located adjacent to <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Highway 136, east of <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, and west of <span class="loc">Kahoka</span>. Although <span class="loc">Scotland County</span> was organized by an act of the <span class="org">Missouri General Assembly</span> on <span class="date">January 29, 1841</span> the town of Memphis did not come to be until <span class="date">more than two years later</span>. County commissioners met at <span class="loc">Sand Hill</span> on <span class="date">May 15, 1843</span> to select the county seat. A spot near the geographical center of the county was chosen, and after some debate, was named Memphis, after the ancient <span class="loc">city of Memphis</span>, <span class="loc">Egypt</span>. The name had been previously used by a <span class="org">U.S. Post Office</span> that operated on the <span class="loc">North Fabius River</span> a short distance away. The land for the town, about fifty acres, was donated to the county by early settler <span class="per">Samuel Cecil</span>. After being laid out in town lots the original plat of Memphis was filed with county court on <span class="date">October 11, 1843</span>. However a few homes already existed on the site and had for <span class="date">several years</span>, the first being a log cabin constructed in <span class="date">1835</span> by Burton Tompkins.</p><br><br>
