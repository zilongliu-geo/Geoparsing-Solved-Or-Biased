Linden has a very rich history, dating back to the mid-19th century. Linden was all owned by a family of farmers named Morgan. It went on that way for twenty years until John Morgan sold a large portion of land to unknown buyers. Over 230 acres (0.93 km2) are still owned by the <span class="loc">Morgans</span>. It is the largest land ownership in Linden. Four original <span class="loc">Morgans</span> live on the 230 acres (0.93 km2) that make up that homestead.</p>
