<p><span class="loc">Bukovo</span> (Macedonian: Буково, pronounced [ˈbukɔvɔ]) is a village in the Bitola municipality approximately three kilometers distance from the <span class="loc">city of Bitola</span> in the Republic of <span class="loc">Macedonia</span>. Not unlike most other larger villages in the country, locals typically distinguish an "upper" (горна) and "lower" (долна) quarter (маала). Historically, the latter developed from the expansion of the former. The neighborhood Bukovski Livadi (Буковски Ливади, "Bukovo Meadows") comprises ten residential streets and is located at the entrance to the village; often considered a part of <span class="loc">Bukovo</span>, it is actually a suburb of the <span class="loc">City of Bitola</span>. The village collectively celebrates the Feast of the Transfiguration as its local holiday — referred to as "the Day" (Денот) — after the village's eponymous monastery. The celebration of <span class="loc">Lazarus</span> Saturday is also upheld devotedly, a tradition which has very nearly died out in the rest of the country. The village has been famous since at least the late 19th century for its crushed red pepper.[2] The local variety of chili pepper is known as "буковец" (bukovec).[3] The name of the village—or a derivative of it—is now used as a name for crushed red pepper in general in a number of Southeast European languages: "буковка" (bukovka, Macedonian), "bukovka" (Serbian, Croatian and Slovene) and "μπούκοβο" (búkovo, Greek).</p>
