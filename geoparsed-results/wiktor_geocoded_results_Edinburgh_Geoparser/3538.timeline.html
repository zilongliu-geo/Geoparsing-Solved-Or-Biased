  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wilmington</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Will County</span>, <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,134 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="per">Thomas Cox</span> purchased land near Alden's Island in <span class="date">1834</span> and built a sawmill, corn cracker, gristmill, and a carding machine. <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> was founded by <span class="per">Thomas Cox</span>. It later became famous as a stop on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 66, which followed the route of modern-day <span class="loc">Illinois</span> Route 53. The only rest-inn in the town is called "Van Duyne's" and is situated right on old Route 66. A notable attraction for travelers along this route is the "Gemini Giant" Muffler Man type statue located next to the former Launching Pad fast food restaurant. The town is also home to the historic <span class="loc">Eagle Hotel</span>. A bus-station scene from Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles was filmed in <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>. The bus station was demolished in <span class="date">2011</span>. <span class="loc">Wilmington</span> is located at 41°18′27″N 88°08′46″W. It is located on the banks of the <span class="loc">Kankakee</span> River, approximately 50 miles (80 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Chicago</span> and 15 miles (24 km) south of <span class="loc">Joliet</span>. One of Wilmington's most notable geographical features is a large island in the <span class="loc">Kankakee</span> River, much of which is occupied by a city park. This island divides the river into a large channel and a smaller one which was used as a natural mill race during the early <span class="date">years</span> of the city. The island is the source of the city's nickname, "The <span class="loc">Island City</span>."</p><br><br>
