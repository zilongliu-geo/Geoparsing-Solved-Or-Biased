<p><span class="loc">Louisville</span> (pronounced LEWIS-ville) is a city in <span class="loc">Stark County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The population was 9,186 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Canton-Massillon, <span class="loc">OH Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. On October 8, 1834, <span class="loc">Louisville</span> was formally settled by Henry Lautzenheiser, from <span class="loc">Germany</span>, and Henry Fainot, a French <span class="loc">Huguenot</span>. The city was named after Lautzenheiser's son, Lewis, and called <span class="loc">Lewisville</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. The name of the town was also considered appropriate because of the fact that it was initially surveyed by the similar-sounding name of Lewis Vail. When the post office was established in 1837, with Sam Petree as its first postmaster, it was discovered <span class="loc">Ohio</span> already had a <span class="loc">Lewisville</span>, so the spelling was changed to <span class="loc">Louisville</span>. Within Louisville's early days, the town competed with the fellow Nimishillen Township community of <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> for growth. <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> initially flourished due to its accessibility as a stagecoach stop between Canton, Alliance, <span class="loc">Cleveland</span>, and <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>. Meanwhile, <span class="loc">Louisville</span> also grew, due to its location upon the east branch of the <span class="loc">Nimishillen Creek</span>, which flows toward Canton. However, when the <span class="loc">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Fort Wayne</span> and <span class="loc">Chicago Railway</span> was laid through <span class="loc">Louisville</span> in 1852, <span class="loc">Louisville</span> began to grow more quickly than <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, which struggled with the difficulty of hauling its main product, wheat, by barge. Today, <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> is now an unincorporated community, marked only by a handful of businesses and a Roman Catholic parish.</p>
