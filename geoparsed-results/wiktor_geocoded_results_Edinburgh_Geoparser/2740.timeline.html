  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Panama</span> is a town in Le <span class="loc">Flore County</span>, <span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Fort Smith</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The population was 1,413 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. This town began as a coal mining community named Red Town because all of the miners' shacks were painted red. The origin of the town name is uncertain. Some historians claim that the name was inspired by the building of the <span class="loc">Panama Canal</span>, but the town was already called <span class="loc">Panama</span> by <span class="date">1898</span>. The site for the canal was not selected until <span class="date">1902</span>, so this claim seems unfounded. In <span class="date">1896</span> the <span class="loc">Kansas City</span>, <span class="loc">Pittsburg</span> and Gulf Railroad (acquired by the <span class="loc">Kansas City</span> Southern Railway in <span class="date">1900</span>) built a north-south line through the region. The Midland Valley Railroad built an east-west line through the region in <span class="date">1903</span>-<span class="date">1904</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Panama</span> moved to the crossing of the two railroads. The <span class="loc">Panama</span> post office first opened <span class="date">January 14, 1898</span>, but the order was rescinded for some unknown reason on <span class="date">February 23, 1898</span>. The post office reopened <span class="date">February 21, 1899</span>.</p><br><br>
