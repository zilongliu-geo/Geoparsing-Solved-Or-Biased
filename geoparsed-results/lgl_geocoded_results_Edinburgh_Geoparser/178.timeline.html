  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Former <span class="loc">Hall County</span> official named to <span class="loc">Forsyth County</span> post. The board voted 5-0 tonight to remove the "interim" tag from County Manager <span class="per">Doug Derrer</span>'s title. The decision was not unexpected. <span class="date">Two weeks ago</span>, the board named <span class="per">Derrer</span> as the sole finalist for the position. A 14-day period of review followed the announcement, in which the public could comment on <span class="per">Derrer</span>'s selection. <span class="per">Derrer</span> is the fifth person to hold the spot since <span class="date">2004</span>. The position pays the same as his interim post, $130,000 per year, with a one-year severance should he leave. <span class="per">Derrer</span>'s job does not fall under the protection of the civil service board, a three-member panel that determines employee appeals. One added benefit to <span class="per">Derrer</span>'s contract as county manager is that the county will pay 100 percent of his health insurance. His government experience runs deep. A veteran of <span class="loc">Hall County</span> government, he retired in <span class="date">December 2007</span> after <span class="date">more than 25 years</span> of service. He opted to take early retirement from Hall, but felt he "still had a lot of energy left, and I feel like I still have a lot to offer the community." <span class="date">Months</span> after retiring from Hall, he joined <span class="loc">Forsyth</span> as deputy county manager. He was elevated to the interim county manager spot after Rhonda Poston-O'Connor was fired as county manager in <span class="date">September 2008</span>.</p><br><br>
