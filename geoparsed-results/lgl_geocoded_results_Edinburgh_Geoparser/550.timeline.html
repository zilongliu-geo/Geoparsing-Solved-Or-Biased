  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Council looks over ‘to do’ list. <span class="loc">Paris City</span> Council asked the city manager to expand an 18-to-24-month bullet point strategic business plan presented at <span class="date">Monday night</span>’s council meeting out <span class="date">10 years</span> and to meet with <span class="org">Paris Junior College</span> president <span class="per">Dr. Pam Anglin</span> and <span class="loc">Chamber of Commerce</span> <span class="per">president Pete Kampfer</span> for assistance. The plan has been a point of contention between City Manager <span class="per">Kevin Carruth</span> and some council members for <span class="date">the past year</span>. District 6 Councilman Edwin Pickle was first to question the brevity of the plan followed by Councilman <span class="per">Steve Brown</span>. The District 4 councilman said he was not consulted for input as referenced by <span class="per">Carruth</span>’s statement in the council package that “most council members did not indicate a particular preference in format or content, however the consensus was a simple bullet of &#x91;to do’ list that would cover the next 18-24 <span class="date">months</span> and could be utilized in planning for the <span class="date">FY 2009</span>-2010 budget.” “I guess I am not part of the consensus, so it doesn’t matter,” <span class="per">Brown</span> said. Pickle asked council members directly, “I just want to make sure there was a consensus and we are happy with a simple bullet or &#x91;to do’ list,” Pickle said. District 7 Councilwoman <span class="per">Rhonda Rogers</span> said themanager’s plan “is an adequate beginning.” “I think we continue to develop a plan <span class="date">10 years</span> out,” she added. <span class="per">Rogers</span> also expressed concern that she saw nothing from any departments about what is in future plans to address services to outlying areas, particularly for those taxpayers who have requested disannexation because of lack of city services. “I didn’t see what the different departments are going to do toward helping them with whatever city services they feel like they need,” <span class="per">Rogers</span> said. “We’ve got to make them feel like they are part of the city.” Pickle recommended, as he said he had done in <span class="date">the past</span>, that <span class="per">Anglin</span> be consulted to help on the strategic plan. “<span class="per">Dr. Anglin</span> agreed and expressed a desire to help work on a strategic plan for the city &#x97; not for PEDC; not for the Chamber; not for the county,” Pickle said. Mayor <span class="per">Jesse Freelen</span> agreed that bringing <span class="per">Anglin</span> into the equation “is not a bad idea at all.” Some long-term planning is needed but not necessary in every area of every department, District 2 Councilman <span class="per">Kevin Kear</span> said. He cited airport development, wastewater treatment and water delivery as “some big infrastructure I think we do need to have a general plan about where we are going.” <span class="per">Freelen</span> agreed that long-term planning in those areas would give future councils some type of guidelines as well as serve as a measurement tool to show “where we have been and where we are going.” Although Brown said he would have liked to have the bullet list presented <span class="date">Monday</span> “<span class="date">18 months ago</span>,” the councilman added, “From this you look at it and then you make your strategic plan. I like that &#x97; at least we have a start now.” <span class="per">Freelen</span> asked <span class="per">Carruth</span> to schedule a meeting with <span class="per">Anglin</span> and <span class="per">Kampfer</span> and to make regular reports on the planning process. In other business the council: received a favorable outside audit report for fiscal year ended <span class="date">Sept. 30 2008</span>; rejected a disannexation request from three property owners; cancelled a <span class="date">May 9</span> election for unchallenged Districts 4, 5, and 7 incumbents; took favorable action on a Trail de Paris extension as well as a United Way early learning project on the trail; and, discussed the possibility of adding 10 hangars at Cox Field, estimated to cost $480,000. Council then spent a little more than an hour in executive session before reconvening the meeting and adjourning shortly afterwards. Pickle said prior to the meeting he had requested an executive session to discuss what is expected of the city manager, mainly in regard to the strategic planning process. Also in executive session, the council was to receive information about an incentive offer to a business prospect.</p><br><br>
