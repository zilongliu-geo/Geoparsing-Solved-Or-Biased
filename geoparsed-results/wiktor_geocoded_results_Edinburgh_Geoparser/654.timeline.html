  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Arlington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Bennington County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 2,317 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town of <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was chartered <span class="date">July 28, 1761</span>, by <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Governor <span class="per">Benning Wentworth</span>, as part of the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Grants. In <span class="date">1777</span>, <span class="loc">Arlington</span> became the first capital of the <span class="loc">Vermont</span> Republic. Among the first settlers in <span class="loc">Arlington</span> were <span class="per">Captain Jehiel Hawley</span> and his family, who had settled there by <span class="date">1764</span>. They were Anglicans and had fled <span class="loc">Roxbury</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, because of the oppressive requirements of the established Congregational church. At a Proprietor's meeting in <span class="date">1764</span>, the town voted to give 50 acres (20 hectares) of land to any man who would set up a gristmill in what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">East Arlington</span>. This offer was accepted by Remember Baker (first cousin of <span class="per">Ethan Allen</span>), who built a grist and sawmill. In the <span class="date">years</span> leading up to the American Revolution, both <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> laid claim to lands comprising current-day <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. The Province of <span class="loc">New York</span> began to grant land in <span class="date">1765</span>, lagging <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> by <span class="date">four years</span>. <span class="loc">Arlington</span> was, for the most part, settled by Anglicans from <span class="loc">Roxbury</span>, <span class="loc">Newtown</span>, and <span class="loc">Milford</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, with ownership rights derived from the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Grants.</p><br><br>
