<p><span class="loc">Salem</span> is the county seat of <span class="loc">Dent County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,950 at the 2010 census which allows <span class="loc">Salem</span> to become a Class 3 city in <span class="loc">Missouri</span>; however, the city has chosen to remain a Class 4 city under <span class="loc">Missouri</span> Revised Statutes. <span class="loc">Salem</span> is located a few miles north of the Ozark Scenic Riverways and close to Montauk State Park, which contains the headwaters of the Current River. The name <span class="loc">Salem</span> is derived from the Hebrew word Shalom, meaning "peace". <span class="loc">Dent County</span> was first explored by Dustin Counts and settled between 1818 and 1829. In 1851 the Missouri Assembly created <span class="loc">Dent County</span> from Crawford and Shannon counties. It was named for early settler Lewis Dent, who served as the first representative. A log courthouse, built about 1851 or 1852, was <span class="loc">Dent County</span>'s first and was located on the <span class="loc">Wingfield</span> farm northeast of <span class="loc">Salem</span>. W. P. Williams became the first mayor of <span class="loc">Salem</span> in 1860, just after the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> State Legislature passed laws regarding the administration of village government. During the American Civil War, <span class="loc">Salem</span> was sometimes manned by units of the 5th <span class="loc">Missouri</span> State Militia. Village governments were suspended during the Civil War. In 1881, <span class="loc">Salem</span> was incorporated as a town.</p>
