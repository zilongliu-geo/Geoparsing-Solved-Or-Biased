<p><span class="loc">Altoona</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Polk County</span>, <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span> and is a part of the Des Moinesâ€“West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 14,541 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Altoona</span> is home of Adventureland, an amusement park, Prairie Meadows, a horse racing track and casino, and a Bass Pro Shops retail store, the first one in central <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. Anthony Yant first settled in what is now <span class="loc">Altoona</span> in 1854, the same year that Gilbert T. Taylor settled there. The land was originally surveyed in 1847 and put up for sale by the <span class="loc">US</span> government in 1848, but it took six years to sell. After many different sales between different families, the Davis family ended up with the land on February 1, 1868. The <span class="loc">Davises</span> hired surveyor Juian B. Bausman to lay out the city for them. He is also credited for giving the city the current name. <span class="loc">Altoona</span> is named for the Latin word for "high," altus, after surveyor Julian B. Bausman discovered that <span class="loc">Altoona</span> was the highest point on the <span class="loc">Des Moines</span> Valley Railroad between <span class="loc">Des Moines</span> and <span class="loc">Keokuk</span>.</p>
