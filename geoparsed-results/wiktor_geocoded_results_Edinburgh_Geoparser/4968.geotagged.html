<p><span class="loc">Guimba</span> is a first class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Nueva Ecija</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 104,894 people. It was incorporated by the King of Spain by virtue of a royal decree in 1897. It is known as the Organic Capital of <span class="loc">Nueva Ecija</span> and the Mushroom Capital of <span class="loc">Nueva Ecija</span>. <span class="loc">Guimba</span> came from the Ilocano term 'Gebba' which was the process of heating molded clay pots in a pit until they turn reddish and durable. Tree stumps were made into large pieces of charcoal. The live charcoals were placed underneath the clay pots. After a few hours these were hardened and ready to bring out from the pit and ready for use. The story goes, once a Spanish visited the place where most of the residents are engaged in pottery making. The foreigner stopped and asked the earth-bakers this question in a nasalized manner, 'Que jugar este?'. The foreigner asked what this place was. The natives misunderstood the question and were asked what they were doing, so they answered “GEBBA” pointing to the ground. The foreigner repeated the word as they left the place “GHEBHA” in a nasalized way, pronouncing through their aquiline nose. Since full Spanish occupation was done in the area, the place was called <span class="loc">Guimba</span>.</p>
