  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lake County</span> is a county located in the north central portion of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">California</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 64,665. The county seat is <span class="loc">Lakeport</span>. The county takes its name from <span class="loc">Clear Lake</span>, the dominant geographic feature in the county and the largest natural lake wholly within <span class="loc">California</span> (<span class="loc">Lake Tahoe</span> is partially in <span class="loc">Nevada</span>; <span class="loc">Salton Sea</span> was accidentally flooded). <span class="loc">Lake County</span> forms the <span class="loc">Clearlake</span>, <span class="loc">CA</span> <span class="org">Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>. It is directly north of the San Francisco Bay Area. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> was formed in <span class="date">1861</span> from parts of <span class="loc">Napa</span> and <span class="loc">Mendocino</span> counties, but the area had European-American settlers from at least the 1840s. <span class="loc">Lake County</span> has long been known as a farming community. The <span class="date">1911</span> California Blue Book lists the major crops as Bartlett pears and beans. Other crops include grain, alfalfa, hay, prunes, peaches, apples, grapes and walnuts. Stockraising included goats, hogs, turkeys and dairying. Some vineyards were planted in the 1870s by European Americans but the first in the state were established in the 18th century by Spanish missionaries. By the early 20th century, the area was earning a reputation for producing some of the world's greatest wines. However, in <span class="date">1920</span>, national Prohibition essentially ended <span class="loc">Lake County</span>'s wine production. With authorized cultivation limited to sacramental purposes, most of the vineyards were ripped out and replanted with walnut and pear farms.</p><br><br>
