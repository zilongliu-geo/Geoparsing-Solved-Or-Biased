The original settlers in the area were former New Englanders. According to The History of <span class="loc">Ontario County</span> <span class="loc">New York</span>, some of the earliest pioneers included "Daniel Gates, Daniel Warner, Ezra Platt, Samuel Day, George Chapin, Israel Chapin, Jr., Frederick Follett, Thomas Sawyer, Benjamin Wells and Mr. Sweet, all of whom were from <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, while William Wyckoff who was another pioneer, was from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>."</p>
