<p><span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a city in Calhoun and Talladega counties in the State of <span class="loc">Alabama</span>. The population was 21,348 at the 2010 census, an increase of 46.3% since the 2000 Census. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is one of two principal cities of and included in the <span class="loc">Anniston-Oxford Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 31.0 square miles (80.3 km2), of which 30.7 square miles (79.4 km2) is land and 0.35 square miles (0.9 km2), or 1.07%, is water. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> lies among the foothills at the southern end of the <span class="loc">Blue Ridge Mountains</span>. Nearby <span class="loc">Cheaha Mountain</span> is Alabama's highest point and offers expansive views of the surrounding wilderness and the city below. Much of the city's southern border is shared with the <span class="loc">Talladega National Forest</span>. Major bodies of water include <span class="loc">Oxford Lake</span>, Lake Hillabee, <span class="loc">Snows Creek</span> and <span class="loc">Choccolocco Creek</span>, which bisects the city. Founded in the early 1850s, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> was the first city in <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span> to be incorporated, in 1852. When the town was formed, it was originally named <span class="loc">Lick Skillet</span>. The name was later changed to "Oxford" due to the presence of a narrow crossing of <span class="loc">Chocolocco</span> Creek that allowed farmers to ford cattle from one side of the creek to the other. Since 1970, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> has annexed large amounts of land to the south and west, including the communities of <span class="loc">Coldwater</span> and <span class="loc">Bynum</span>. In 1970 it was all in <span class="loc">Calhoun County</span>, but today it includes areas in <span class="loc">Talladega County</span>.</p>
