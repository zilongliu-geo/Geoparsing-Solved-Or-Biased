  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Wikinews spoke to several residents of the <span class="loc">US</span> state of <span class="loc">Texas</span> finding varying opinions, and responses, to the threat from the <span class="loc">West Nile</span> virus; this, in contrast to the troubling media reports released recently. The state as a whole has seen more than 400 confirmed instances of the illness so-far <span class="date">this year</span>. <span class="per">A Longview</span> woman, said, "[...] It's terrifying. I'm so scared." The woman was quick to point out a virus-related death occured in her city the same day. When asked about her daily routines, in light of the virus, she said, "I don't go outside. I stay indoors. <span class="loc">West Nile</span> [virus] is bad." The Director of <span class="org">Nursing</span> for a large encampment located near Tyler said their operation had seen no cases of the illness, despite serving over 19,000 campers <span class="date">this summer</span>. Her staff took no special precautions during <span class="date">August</span>. Although having some worries, <span class="per">Jimmy Philmont</span>, 39, of <span class="loc">Fairfield</span> told Wikinews, "[...] I don't let it keep me up at night. Overall, I'm not too scared." Asked if he was aware of recent virus-related deaths in <span class="loc">Texas</span>, <span class="loc">Philmont</span> said, "Yeah, I am. That's kind of scary. But, you have to live your life, you know? The world is hot <span class="date">now</span>. You can't go hide in a hole somewhere." <span class="date">Earlier in the month</span>, Tim Whitley, a city official in <span class="loc">Malakoff</span>, told Wikinews his city had began using a pesticide specialist to spray twice-weekly. <span class="loc">Whitley</span> explained two treatments per week is more often than usual for the city, "With the concerns in Dallas, we're taking it seriously", he said. A nurse at a senior activity center in Austin told media she'd taken time to educate their facility's clients about the virus and proper precautions; Adding, "They feel less alarmed and we try to protect our folks here [...]". <span class="per">Mark Kitsmore</span>, 54, of Tyler said, "Honestly, I'm not too worried about it." He jokingly commented, "I've probably used a little more bug spray over <span class="date">the past few weeks</span>, though." Twenty-six people have died so-far <span class="date">this year</span> as result of having contracted the virus, approximately half occurring in <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The mayor and county judge in Dallas have declared a state of emergency in response to the virus.</p><br><br>
