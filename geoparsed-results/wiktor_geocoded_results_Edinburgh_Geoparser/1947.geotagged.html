It lies along the Highlands Highway 21.5 kilometres (13.4 mi) north-west of <span class="loc">Lae</span>, 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) southeast of <span class="loc">Nadzab</span>.

In 1930, a delegation including the District Officer and Patrol Officer (Kiap based around <span class="loc">Nadzab</span>, inspected <span class="loc">Markham</span> Valley villages. The report to the Council of the League of Nations states: "The Yalu natives had recently abandoned their old village, and have established themselves nearby in a more accessible position. I inspected the village and saw 120 natives, none had complaints" During World War 2, Number 3 Platoon, 2/1 Forestry Company, Royal Australian Engineers established a forestry camp at <span class="loc">Yalu</span> to provide timber and the New Guinea RAAF Training School was located in and around <span class="loc">Yalu</span>. In 2008, three weeks of rain recorded at 107mm for a 24-hour period has led to extensive flooding in <span class="loc">Papua</span> New Guinea's <span class="loc">Morobe province</span> with the Yalu bridge connecting the province and the highlands on the verge of collapsing. Many farms and homes in <span class="loc">Yalu</span> have been washed away.</p>
