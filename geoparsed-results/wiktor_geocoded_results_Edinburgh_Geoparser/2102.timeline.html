  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 51,407. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Dandridge. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Morristown</span>, <span class="loc">TN</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the Knoxville-Morristown-Sevierville, <span class="org">TN Combined Statistical Area</span>. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> was established on <span class="date">June 11, 1792</span>, by <span class="per">William Blount</span>, Governor of the Southwest Territory. It had been a part of <span class="loc">Caswell County</span> during the State of <span class="org">Franklin</span> period (<span class="date">1784</span>â€“<span class="date">1789</span>). <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat, Dandridge, was settled in <span class="date">1783</span>. On the eve of the Civil War, <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, like most other counties in mountainous <span class="loc">East Tennessee</span>, was opposed to secession. In Tennessee's <span class="org">Ordinance of Secession</span> referendum on <span class="date">June 8, 1861</span>, <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> voters rejected secession by a margin of 1,987 to 603. A railroad bridge at <span class="loc">Strawberry Plains</span> was among those targeted by the <span class="loc">East Tennessee</span> bridge-burning conspiracy in <span class="date">November 1861</span>. This led to internal conflict in the area throughout the war, with men from the county enlisting in both of the rival armies. <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>'s current mayor is <span class="per">Alan Palmieri</span>. The county has 21 commissioners, two from each of the ten districts, with <span class="loc">White Pine</span> electing three.</p><br><br>
