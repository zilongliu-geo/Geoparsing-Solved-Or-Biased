  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Cumberland</span> is an incorporated village municipality in the <span class="loc">Comox</span> Valley on <span class="loc">Vancouver Island</span> in British <span class="org">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The village was originally named <span class="org">Union</span>, British <span class="org">Columbia</span> after the <span class="org">Union</span> Coal Company, which was in turn named in honour of the <span class="date">1871</span> union of British <span class="org">Columbia</span> with <span class="loc">Canada</span>. The town was renamed after <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> in <span class="loc">Great Britain</span> by <span class="per">James Dunsmuir</span> in <span class="date">1891</span>. <span class="per">Robert Dunsmuir</span> had the town built in <span class="date">1888</span>. The <span class="org">Union</span> Coal Company was begun in <span class="date">1871</span> to exploit a coal discovery made <span class="date">the previous year</span> on <span class="loc">Coal Creek</span> which flows into <span class="loc">Comox Lake</span>. By <span class="date">1874</span> the company had built a tramway and a road to <span class="loc">Comox</span> Harbour at what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Royston</span> but after this initial work, the high cost of opening a mine proved too high for the original partners and work stopped. In <span class="date">1884</span>, the same year he received the land grant related to the <span class="loc">Esquimalt</span> and <span class="loc">Nanaimo Railway</span>, <span class="per">Robert Dunsmuir</span> bought the <span class="org">Union</span> Coal Company. He bought the nearby Perseverance Mine at what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Union Bay</span> in <span class="date">1888</span> and the Baynes Sound Mine in <span class="date">1881</span>. Two slopes were open at the <span class="org">Union</span> Mine by <span class="date">1893</span>. By <span class="date">1897</span> the mine was producing 700 to 1000 tons per day, employed 600 men and supported a town of 3000. In <span class="date">1946</span>, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake demolished chimneys of houses in <span class="loc">Cumberland</span>.</p><br><br>
