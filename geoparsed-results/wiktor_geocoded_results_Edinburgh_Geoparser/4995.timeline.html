He had also two daughters, <span class="per">Irene Buenagua</span> <span class="per">Fernandez</span> and <span class="per">Lydia</span> <span class="per">Buenagua</span> <span class="loc">Guerrero</span>, both retired teachers, and three other sons, Salvador, <span class="loc">Melchor</span>, and <span class="per">Diogenes Buenagua</span> who are all still residing in <span class="loc">Bombon</span>.
