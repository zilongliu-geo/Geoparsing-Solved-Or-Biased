  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">York County</span> man pleads guilty in attempted robbery; two others sentenced. <span class="per">Derek D. Moore</span>, a key figure in a plan hatched by <span class="loc">York County</span> high school friends <span class="date">last year</span> to rob a notorious drug dealer, is getting a taste of life behind bars. <span class="per">Judge Thomas B. Hoover</span> of New <span class="org">Kent County Circuit Court</span> revoked bond and sent the former <span class="org">Bruton High School</span> student to jail <span class="date">yesterday</span> after <span class="per">Moore</span> pleaded guilty in the case and then tested positive for marijuana. Also, two other defendants in the case were sentenced <span class="date">yesterday</span>. Out on bond since shortly after his arrest in <span class="date">October</span>, <span class="per">Moore</span>, 19, told the judge at first that he was clean, but after testing positive, offered that he may have picked up marijuana in his system from being with friends. That excuse reverberates through a case that ended with the shooting death of another <span class="loc">Bruton</span> student, <span class="per">Christopher Greene</span>, in the <span class="date">Oct. 14</span> effort to rob <span class="per">John Steven Carter</span> of drugs and guns at <span class="per">Carter</span>'s Lanexa home. <span class="per">Carter</span>, 56, was using an alias and was on the run from drug charges in <span class="loc">Florida</span>; he apparently gunned down <span class="per">Greene</span> as <span class="per">Greene</span> broke through <span class="per">Carter</span>'s back door with a rifle, according to court documents. <span class="per">Carter</span> disappeared but was arrested <span class="date">this month</span> in <span class="loc">Alabama</span> after a monthslong search. He is facing drug, weapon and fugitive charges in <span class="loc">Florida</span>; it is uncertain whether he will be extradited back to Virginia. <span class="per">Moore</span>, who helped arrange the plan to rob <span class="per">Carter</span> and who drove to <span class="loc">Lanexa</span> on <span class="date">Oct. 14</span> with three other current or former <span class="loc">Bruton</span> students, lost his freedom <span class="date">yesterday</span> and will be formally sentenced <span class="date">June 8</span>. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery and attempted robbery; sentencing guidelines indicate he'll serve seven to <span class="date">20 months</span> in jail. <span class="per">Moore</span> was best friends with <span class="per">Greene</span> and came forward to police the day after <span class="per">Greene</span>'s death. "What we know about this case comes from <span class="per">Mr. Moore</span>," Commonwealth's Attorney <span class="per">C. Linwood</span> Gregory told Hoover. Two other defendants in the case pleaded guilty <span class="date">yesterday</span> to misdemeanor charges of being accessories to conspiracy and to attempted robbery. <span class="per">Robert T. Tynes Jr.</span>, described in a batch of letters of support as an outstanding young man with a limitless future, received a suspended 24-month sentence. <span class="per">Tynes</span> accompanied others to <span class="loc">Lanexa</span> and drove the vehicle home that carried the young men, leaving <span class="per">Greene</span>'s body behind outside <span class="per">Carter</span>'s back door. A third defendant, <span class="loc">Kodie</span> <span class="per">L. Tyler</span>, who passed up bond and has been in jail since <span class="date">October</span>, received a 10-year sentence, with all but <span class="date">six months</span> suspended. He pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy to commit grand larceny. The drug den operated by <span class="per">Carter</span> housed a secret marijuana growing operation. Two 18-year-old acquaintances of <span class="per">Moore</span> set the robbery in motion by telling him about <span class="per">Carter</span>; <span class="per">Robert M. Perez</span> drove <span class="loc">Moore</span> and <span class="loc">Greene</span> to <span class="loc">Lanexa</span> to check out the house the day before the robbery attempt. <span class="per">John W. Chaffin</span> and <span class="per">Perez</span> told <span class="per">Moore</span> he could find "pillowcases full" of dope at <span class="per">Carter</span>'s, and a deal was struck to share proceeds of the heist. <span class="date">This month</span>, <span class="loc">Chaffin</span> and <span class="loc">Perez</span> pleaded guilty to attempted petit larceny. <span class="per">Perez</span> received a suspended 12-month sentence and <span class="per">Chaffin</span> is serving <span class="date">six months</span>. <span class="per">Chaffin</span> was sent directly to jail after testing positive for cocaine.</p><br><br>
