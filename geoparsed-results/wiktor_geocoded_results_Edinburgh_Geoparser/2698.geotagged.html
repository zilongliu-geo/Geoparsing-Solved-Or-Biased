It is 4 miles (6.4 km) north of <span class="loc">Roseburg</span> on Interstate 5 and the <span class="loc">North Umpqua River</span>. <span class="loc">Winchester</span> was laid out in 1850 by surveyor Addison R. Flint, who was part of an <span class="loc">Umpqua</span> exploring expedition from <span class="loc">San Francisco</span>. The town was named for one of two brothers named <span class="loc">Winchester</span> who took part in the expedition, probably Heman <span class="loc">Winchester</span>, who was the expedition's captain. <span class="loc">Winchester</span> was the largest settlement in the <span class="loc">Umpqua</span> Valley for many years and the county seat until 1854, when it was moved to <span class="loc">Roseburg</span>. <span class="loc">Winchester</span> post office was established in 1851, and Flint served as the first postmaster. The community was incorporated as a city by the Oregon Legislative Assembly on February 20, 1891. <span class="loc">Winchester Dam</span> in <span class="loc">Winchester</span>, constructed in 1889, is on the National Register of Historic Places. This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F (22.0 °C).
