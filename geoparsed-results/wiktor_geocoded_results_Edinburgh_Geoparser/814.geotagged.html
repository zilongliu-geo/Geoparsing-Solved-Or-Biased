<p>Mesa is a city in <span class="loc">Franklin County</span>, <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 489 at the 2010 census. The <span class="loc">Washington</span> State Office of Financial Management's 2013 estimate placed the population at 495. Originally called <span class="loc">Bluff Wells</span>, then <span class="loc">Judson</span>, now Mesa was a stop on the <span class="loc">Ainsworth</span> (now <span class="loc">Pasco</span>) to Spokane branch of the Northern Pacific Railroad. It was the stop between <span class="loc">Eltopia</span> and <span class="loc">Palouse Junction</span> (now <span class="loc">Connell</span>). The station was established in 1883. The Columbia Basin Irrigation Project brought water to the area in 1948. Prior to this development, people relied on either private wells or the railroad well at Mesa. Mesa was officially incorporated on June 23, 1955. Today, Mesa is a small town supported by dryland farming, irrigated farming, and livestock. Mesa is located at 46°34′37″N 119°0′9″W (46.576963, -119.002516). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.64 square miles (4.25 km2), all of it land. In 2008, the city was involved in litigation with former mayor and councilwoman Donna Zink over incorrectly handled public document requests under Washington State's Public Records Act. A Superior Court judge has ruled that the town of Mesa must pay its former mayor about $230,000 after losing the long-running dispute.</p>
