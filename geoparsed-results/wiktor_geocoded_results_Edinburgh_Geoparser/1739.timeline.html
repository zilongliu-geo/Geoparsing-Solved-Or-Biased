  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Boma</span> is a port town on the <span class="loc">Congo River</span>, some 100 km upstream from the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>, in the <span class="loc">Bas-Congo province</span> of the <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>. It had an estimated population of 527,725 in <span class="date">2009</span>. <span class="loc">Boma</span> was the capital city of the <span class="loc">Congo Free State</span> and Belgian <span class="loc">Congo</span> (the modern <span class="loc">Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>) from <span class="date">1 May 1886</span> to <span class="date">1926</span>, when the capital was moved to Léopoldville (since renamed <span class="loc">Kinshasa</span>). The port handles exports of tropical timber, bananas, cacao, and palm products. <span class="loc">Boma</span> was founded as a slaving station and entrepôt by merchants of several European countries in the 16th century. Trade was chiefly in the hands of Dutch merchants, but British, French and Portuguese firms also had factories there. No European power exercised sovereignty, though claims were from time to time put forward by <span class="loc">Portugal</span>. <span class="per">Henry Morton Stanley</span> arrived here on <span class="date">9 Aug. 1877</span>, after crossing <span class="loc">Africa</span> east to west. In <span class="date">1884</span> the people of <span class="loc">Boma</span> granted a protectorate of their country to the International Association of the <span class="loc">Congo</span>. <span class="loc">Boma</span> lies on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Congo River</span>, some 100 km upstream from <span class="loc">Muanda</span>, where the river meets the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span>. The great width and depth of the river allow seagoing ships to reach <span class="loc">Boma</span>, which is the second-largest port of DR <span class="loc">Congo</span>, after <span class="loc">Matadi</span>. Between <span class="date">1889</span> and <span class="date">1984</span>, the port was served by a 610 mm gauge railway line from <span class="loc">Tshela</span>.</p><br><br>
