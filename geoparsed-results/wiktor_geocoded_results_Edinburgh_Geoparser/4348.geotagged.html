<p>Harrow /ˈhæroʊ/ is a large suburban town in the <span class="loc">London Borough</span> of Harrow, northwest <span class="loc">London</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is centred 10.5 miles (16.9 km) northwest of <span class="loc">Charing Cross</span>. Harrow-on-the-Hill includes the conservation area with a high proportion of listed buildings with a residential and institutional array of georgian architecture and a few 17th century examples. Harrow gives its initial letters to a wider postcode area. The administrative offices of the borough are in the town which currently is made up of the <span class="loc">Greenhill</span>, <span class="loc">Headstone</span> South and <span class="loc">West Harrow</span> electoral wards; these had a population of 33,928 in the 2011 census. Harrow was a municipal <span class="loc">borough of Middlesex</span> before its inclusion in <span class="loc">Greater London</span> in 1965. Harrow is home to a large University of <span class="loc">Westminster</span> campus and its oldest secondary schools are Harrow School and Harrow High School. Harrow's name comes from Old English hearg = "(heathen) temple", which was probably on the hill of Harrow, where St. Mary's Church stands today. The name has been studied in detail by <span class="loc">Briggs</span>. The first and only contemporary artist-led gallery in Harrow was set up in 2010 by the Usurp Art Collective. The space is called the Usurp Art Gallery &amp; Studios and is based in <span class="loc">West Harrow</span>, a bohemian part of Harrow. Usurp Art provides professional support to artists and runs the only public artists studios in the borough. It is a flagship project for Arts Council <span class="loc">England</span>.</p>
