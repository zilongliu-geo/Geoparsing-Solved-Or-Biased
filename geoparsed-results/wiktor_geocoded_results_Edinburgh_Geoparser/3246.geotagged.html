<p><span class="loc">Charlestown</span> is the capital of the island of <span class="loc">Nevis</span>, in the <span class="loc">Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis</span>, <span class="loc">Leeward Islands</span>, <span class="loc">West Indies</span>. <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> is situated on the leeward side of the island of <span class="loc">Nevis</span>, near the southern end of Pinneys Beach. Historically, in colonial times, the town of <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> was protected by <span class="loc">Fort Charles</span> to the south and Fort <span class="loc">Black Rocks</span> to the north. Many of the oldest two-story stone buildings were severely damaged over time by earthquakes, which tended to cause the upper story to collapse into the lower story. This unfortunate design flaw lead to the common practice of building a wooden upper floor above a stone ground floor. <span class="loc">Charlestown</span> was the birthplace and childhood home of Alexander Hamilton. The restored stone building which was his place of birth now houses the Museum of Nevis History on the ground floor, and the Nevis Island Administration Assembly Room on the upper floor. There are two other museums in <span class="loc">Charlestown</span>: the Nelson Museum, and the Nevis Sport Museum, as well as the Philatelic Bureau. There are many other important buildings in the town, some historical and some recent, such as the Post Office, the old Treasury Building which is now the Nevis Tourism Authority, the Court House and Public Library, the new Police Station and the Alexandra Hospital. At the northern end of town is the Bath Hotel and <span class="loc">Spring House</span>, which was a famous tourist hotel and spa during the 18th century. The main building of the Bath Hotel is now occupied by government offices.</p>
