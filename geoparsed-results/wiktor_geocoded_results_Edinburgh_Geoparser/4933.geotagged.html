<p><span class="loc">Carter County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 57,424. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Elizabethton. The county is named in honor of Landon Carter, an early settler active in the State of Franklin movement. <span class="loc">Carter County</span> is part of the <span class="loc">Johnson City</span>, <span class="loc">TN</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area, commonly known as the "Tri-Cities" region of Northeast Tennessee. The county is named for General Landon Carter, the son of John Carter of Virginia, who was "chairman of the court" of the first majority-rule system of American democracy, known as the Watauga Association of 1772. The association was the first permanent settlement established outside the original thirteen American colonies and included the area that is today's <span class="loc">Carter County</span>. In 1775, the Association was absorbed into <span class="loc">North Carolina</span> by petition, becoming known thereafter as the <span class="loc">Washington District</span>. <span class="loc">Carter County</span> was served by the narrow gauge <span class="loc">East Tennessee</span> and Western <span class="loc">North Carolina Railroad</span> (The ET&amp;WNC, nicknamed "Tweetsie") until the line ceased operations in 1950.</p>
