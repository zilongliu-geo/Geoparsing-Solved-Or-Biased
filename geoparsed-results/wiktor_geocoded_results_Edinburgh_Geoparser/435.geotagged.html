<p><span class="loc">Washington</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Rappahannock County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. The site of this town was surveyed by <span class="loc">George Washington</span> himself in July 1749. It was the first of what would be many American places to be named after the future first president. Its population was just 135 people at the 2010 census, down from 183 in the 2000 census. It is also the county seat of <span class="loc">Rappahannock County</span>. It is nicknamed <span class="loc">Little Washington</span> to avoid confusion because of its proximity to <span class="loc">Washington</span>, <span class="loc">D.C.</span>, which lies only 70 miles (110 km) to the north east. The Town of <span class="loc">Washington</span> was formerly the location of a trading post utilized by frontier families and members of the resident Manahoac tribe. All of the territory in and around the current town was under the ownership of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. In 1748, Lord Fairfax met a 16-year-old <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, a distant relative of his. Being impressed by his character, Fairfax employed <span class="loc">Washington</span> to survey his lands west of the <span class="loc">Blue Ridge Mountains</span>. On July 24, 1749, the town layout as it appears today was surveyed and platted by <span class="loc">Washington</span> with the assistance of his chainmen John Lonem and Edward Corder as part of his service to Fairfax. The village was officially established as a Town by the Virginia General Assembly on December 14, 1795 when it gained the requisite population of 200. Records from an 1835 gazetteer state that the town contained one academy, fifty-five dwellings, four mercantile stores, two taverns, one house of worship, twenty-seven trade shops, and two large flour mills.</p>
