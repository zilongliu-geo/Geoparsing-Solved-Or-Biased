  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greenville</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Piscataquis County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,646 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is centered on the lower end of <span class="loc">Moosehead</span> Lake, the largest body of fresh water in the state. <span class="loc">Greenville</span> is the historic gateway to the north country and a center for outdoor recreation in the area. <span class="org">Greenville High School</span>, with 89 students, was ranked as the third best high school in <span class="loc">Maine</span> and one of the top 1,000 in the <span class="loc">US</span> in <span class="date">2010</span>. First called T9 R10 NWP (or Township 9, Range 10, North of the Waldo Patent), the land was granted about <span class="date">1812</span> by the <span class="org">Massachusetts General Court</span> to <span class="org">Thornton Academy</span> in <span class="loc">Saco</span>. In <span class="date">1824</span>, <span class="per">Nathaniel Haskell</span> of <span class="loc">Westbrook</span> bought the <span class="org">Thornton Academy Grant</span>. With <span class="per">Oliver Young</span> and <span class="per">John Smith</span>, he began clearing trees <span class="date">that summer</span> for farming near <span class="loc">Wilson</span> Pond, where the <span class="loc">Wilson</span> Stream would provide water power for mills. In <span class="date">1827</span>, <span class="per">Haskell</span> completed a house, and his family joined him. A sawmill was built on <span class="loc">Wilson</span> Stream in <span class="date">1829</span>, with a gristmill added <span class="date">the following year</span>. In <span class="date">1835</span>, <span class="per">Henry Gower</span> began clearing land beside <span class="loc">Moosehead</span> Lake for what would develop into Greenville village. There he erected the first hotel, a two-story building called The <span class="org">Seboomook House</span>, and the first store. On <span class="date">February 6, 1836</span>, <span class="loc">Greenville</span> was incorporated from <span class="per">Haskell</span> Plantation, and named for its green forests. By <span class="date">1846</span>, Greenville village included two houses, two blacksmith shops and a schoolhouse. On <span class="date">August 10, 1848</span>, the town annexed land from <span class="loc">Wilson</span>, the remainder of which was distributed to <span class="loc">Shirley</span> and <span class="loc">Elliotsville</span>.</p><br><br>
