<p>Santiago (/ˌsæntiˈɑːɡoʊ/; Spanish pronunciation: [sanˈtjaɣo]), also known as Santiago de <span class="loc">Chile</span> [sanˈtjaɣo ðe ˈtʃile], is the capital and largest <span class="loc">city of Chile</span>. It is also the center of its largest conurbation. Santiago is located in the country's central valley, at an elevation of 520 m (1,706 ft) above mean sea level. Founded in 1541, Santiago has been the capital <span class="loc">city of Chile</span> since colonial times. The city has a downtown core of 19th century neoclassical architecture and winding side-streets, dotted by art deco, neo-gothic, and other styles. Santiago's cityscape is shaped by several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing <span class="loc">Mapocho</span> River, lined by parks such as Parque Forestal. The <span class="loc">Andes Mountains</span> can be seen from most points in the city. These mountains contribute to a considerable smog problem, particularly during winter. The city outskirts are surrounded by vineyards and Santiago is within a few hours of both the mountains and the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span>. Santiago's steady economic growth over the past few decades has transformed it into a modern metropolis. The city is now home to a growing theater and restaurant scene, extensive suburban development, dozens of shopping centers, and a rising skyline, including the tallest building in Latin <span class="loc">America</span>, the Gran Torre Santiago. It includes several major universities, and has developed a modern transportation infrastructure, including a free flow toll-based, partly underground urban freeway system and the Metro de Santiago, <span class="loc">South America</span>'s most extensive subway system. Santiago is the cultural, political and financial center of <span class="loc">Chile</span> and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational corporations. The Chilean executive and judicial powers are located in Santiago, but Congress meets in nearby Valparaíso.</p>
