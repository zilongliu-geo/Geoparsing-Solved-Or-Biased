<p><span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Illinois</span>. According to the 2010 census, it had a population of 32,957. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat and largest city is <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>. <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> is included in the St. Louis, <span class="loc">MO-IL Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is located in the southern portion of <span class="loc">Illinois</span> known locally as "<span class="loc">Little Egypt</span>". Indigenous peoples lived along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River and related waterways for thousands of years before European contact. French Jesuit priests in the Illinois Country encountered the <span class="loc">Kaskaskia</span> and <span class="loc">Cahokia</span>, bands of the Illiniwek confederacy. The first European settlement in this area was St. Philippe, founded in 1723 by Philippe Fran√ßois Renault, a French courtier, on his concession about three miles north of Fort de <span class="loc">Chartres</span> along the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. This early agricultural community quickly produced a surplus, and grains were sold to the lower Louisiana colony for years. They were integral to that community's survival, as its climate did not allow cultivation of such staple grains. After the American Revolution, <span class="loc">Monroe County</span> was formed in 1816 out of <span class="loc">Randolph</span> and St. <span class="loc">Clair counties</span>, as the 8th county created from the then Illinois Territory.</p>
