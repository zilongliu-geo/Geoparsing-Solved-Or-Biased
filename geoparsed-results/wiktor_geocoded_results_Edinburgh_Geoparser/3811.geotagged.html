<p>Beaconsfield /ˈbiːkənzfiːld/ is a former gold mining town near the <span class="loc">Tamar River</span>, in the north-east of <span class="loc">Tasmania</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>. It lies 40 kilometres north of <span class="loc">Launceston</span> on the <span class="loc">West Tamar Highway</span>. It is part of the Municipality of West <span class="loc">Tamar</span>. At the 2011 census, Beaconsfield had a population of 1,199. The area around Beaconsfield was first explored by Europeans in 1804 when William Paterson led an expedition to <span class="loc">Port Dalrymple</span> and established a settlement at <span class="loc">York Town</span>. Settlement of Beaconsfield itself, then known as <span class="loc">Brandy Creek</span> did not occur until the 1850s. Limestone mining led to the discovery of gold in 1869. Gold mining began in 1877 and the area's population boomed. <span class="loc">Brandy Creek</span> Post Office opened on 1 December 1877 and was renamed Beaconsfield in 1879. The town was named Beaconsfield in 1879 in honour of Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, who was the Prime Minister of the <span class="loc">United Kingdom</span> at the time. In 1881, the Beaconsfield newspaper was called the Beaconsfield Tickler. In 1953, Beaconsfield was the first town in <span class="loc">Australia</span> to fluoridate the water supply. Gold was first discovered in Beaconsfield in 1847. When the gold rush hit Victoria and <span class="loc">New South Wales</span> in 1851 and the Tasmanian Government offered a reward for the discovery of a payable goldfield. In 1877 the cap of a payable gold reef was discovered on the eastern slope of Cabbage Tree Hill by brothers William and David Dally. This became known as the fabulous Tasmanian Reef. In October 1877 the Dally brothers sold their claim on the <span class="loc">Tasmania</span> Reef to William D Grubb &amp; William Hart for 15,000 pounds, and 1/10 share in any company formed.</p>
