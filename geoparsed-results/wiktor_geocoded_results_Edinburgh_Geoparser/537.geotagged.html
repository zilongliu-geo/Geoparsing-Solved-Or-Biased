Emanuella Grinberg of CNN said that <span class="loc">Las Lomas</span> at one time "consisted of dilapidated shacks, trailers or homes in various stages of completion. Homes with no foundations, no floors, no windows, doors, or walls were scattered throughout" the community. Grinberg added that "strong winds stirred up suffocating clouds of dust in the streets" because all of the streets were unpaved. She added that "[s]mall gullies formed when it rained because there was no drainage system. Gangs of teens prowled the area, burning unattended construction sites, stealing TVs or the few households appliances people owned". As of 2011, residents are increasingly gaining basic services.</p>
