<p><span class="loc">Richmond</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Ontario County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,361 at the 2010 census. The town is on the western border of the county, south of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. <span class="loc">Richmond</span> was part of the <span class="loc">Phelps</span> and <span class="loc">Gorham Purchase</span>. The area was first settled around 1790. The town was established in 1796 as "Pittstown," but was later renamed "Honeoye." In 1815, the name was changed to "Richmond." More territory was added to <span class="loc">Richmond</span> from the Town of <span class="loc">Canadice</span> in 1836. Parts of the Towns of <span class="loc">Bristol</span> and <span class="loc">South Bristol</span> were added to <span class="loc">Richmond</span> in 1848, but were returned to the source towns in 1852. In 1600 the Honeoye Lake Watershed was—apart from clearings made by Native Americans and natural causes such as fire, steep slope landslides, wind or ice—completely forested. The watershed’s primeval forest contained massive trees, some covering as much as a half-acre of ground. Early settlers found these forests useful. Probably the first product to be transported to market was barrels of potash, made from ashes of the burned trees. As sawmills were erected, lumber from the trees cut from 1830 to 1890 were used in the construction of urban centers such as <span class="loc">Rochester</span>, <span class="loc">Buffalo</span>, and <span class="loc">Syracuse</span>.</p>
