  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Brunswick</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Frederick County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 5,870 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The area <span class="date">now</span> known as <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> was originally home to the Susquehanna Indians. In <span class="date">1728</span> the first settlement was built, and the region became known as Eel Town, because the natives would fish for eel in the <span class="loc">Potomac River</span>. A grant to the land was then given to <span class="per">John Hawkins</span> by <span class="per">George II</span> of <span class="loc">Great Britain</span> on <span class="date">August 10, 1753</span>. The grant had the name "<span class="per">Hawkins</span> Merry-Peep-o-Day". The land was sold and <span class="per">Leonard Smith</span> platted it in <span class="date">1787</span> with the name of “Berlin,” as many Germans settled in the area. The name “Berlin,” however, could not be used for mail as there was already a <span class="loc">Berlin</span> on the <span class="loc">Eastern Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, so the post office changed the name to "Barry." The town continued to grow and was incorporated <span class="date">April 18, 1890</span> with the name “Brunswick.” Established along the now-defunct <span class="loc">Chesapeake and Ohio Canal</span>, the city became a hub for the <span class="loc">Baltimore</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Railroad</span>, which built a six-mile-long rail yard along the <span class="loc">Potomac</span> from <span class="date">1891</span> to <span class="date">1912</span>, boosting the population to over 5,000, and making <span class="loc">Brunswick</span> virtually a company town. The railroad reduced its yard operations in <span class="date">the 1950s</span>.</p><br><br>
