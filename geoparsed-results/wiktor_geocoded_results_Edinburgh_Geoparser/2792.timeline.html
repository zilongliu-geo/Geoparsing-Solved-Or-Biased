  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> is a census-designated place (CDP) in and the county seat of <span class="loc">Banner County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 100 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, and all of <span class="loc">Banner County</span>, were originally part of <span class="loc">Cheyenne County</span> and began with a homestead in <span class="date">1884</span>. A settlement, at first called Randall and then <span class="loc">Centropolis</span>, developed around this and neighboring homesteads. In <span class="date">November, 1888</span>, <span class="loc">Cheyenne County</span> subdivided into five counties, and the settlement was included in the territory which became <span class="loc">Banner County</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat was originally located at <span class="loc">Ashford</span>, a few miles northeast. However, in <span class="date">1889</span> <span class="per">Charles Schooley</span>, a settler, donated part of his land for the development of a formal town. A migrant being from <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> caused the name to be selected. Because of its central location, <span class="loc">Harrisburg</span> became the home base for stagecoach and mail carrier lines in the county, and the county government moved its operations from <span class="loc">Ashford</span> in mid-1891. By <span class="date">1892</span>, Harrsiburg had two hotels, two livery stables, a brickwork, a cheese factory, two banks and three newspapers. It was the principal community for the county, which was almost entirely devoted to wheat farming and cattle ranching. In <span class="date">1951</span>, oil (which had first been discovered in <span class="date">1919</span>) became the county's third commodity.</p><br><br>
