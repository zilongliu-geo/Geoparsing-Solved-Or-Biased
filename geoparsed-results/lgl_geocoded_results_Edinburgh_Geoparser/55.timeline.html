  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Vandals striking local businesses. Costly acts of mischief have been happening around city businesses, roadways over <span class="date">last several months</span> The <span class="org">Athens Police Department</span> is asking for the public’s help in finding those responsible for painting graffiti on various buildings and structures around the city. The most recent cases of criminal mischief were reported <span class="date">Tuesday morning</span>. During the night, someone spraypainted Dunn’s <span class="per">Automotive</span> and <span class="per">Norman</span>’s Welding on <span class="per">West Tyler Street</span>. Symbols and obscenities had also been painted on the concrete portion of the railroad overpass on <span class="loc">West Corsicana Street</span>, APD reports state. “It appears to be a small group of kids that’s going around spraypainting on the buildings,” Detective Sgt. <span class="per">Don Yarbrough</span> said. “It’s really a nuisance. People have to paint over it and it’s done several thousand dollars damage.” Most of the occurrences have been in the north and west portions of the city, <span class="per">Yarbrough</span> said. Often the painting involves gang symbols. The cases of mischief have been more abundant over <span class="date">the past two months</span>. “They’ve hit buildings, storage building places, sidewalks,” <span class="per">Yarbrough</span> said. “They’ve done a little bit of everything. We believe they’re doing it late at night.” The property owners usually discover the damage the following morning and are unable to offer a description of the individuals. “So far we have no idea who it is. We hope if someone sees them doing it they’ll give us a call,” <span class="per">Yarbrough</span> said. Anyone with information that leads to the arrest of the vandals can contact <span class="loc">Henderson County</span> Crimestoppers at 903-675-8477. Callers can remain anonymous. <span class="per">Yarbrough</span> said anyone with information may also call him at the <span class="org">Athens Police Department</span> at 903-675-5454.</p><br><br>
