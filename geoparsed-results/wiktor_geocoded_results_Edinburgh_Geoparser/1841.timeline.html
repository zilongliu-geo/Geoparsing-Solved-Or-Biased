  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Parker</span> is a city located in <span class="loc">Armstrong County</span>, <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located in the extreme northwestern portion of the county. The population was 840 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city was named for Judge <span class="per">John Parker</span>, a lead surveyor of <span class="loc">Lawrenceburg</span> and founder/owner of <span class="per">Parker</span>'s Landing, the two villages which were combined to create <span class="per">Parker</span>. <span class="per">Parker</span> is sometimes referred to as the "<span class="loc">Smallest City</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.A.</span>". <span class="per">Parker</span> was incorporated as a city on <span class="date">March 1, 1873</span>, by special state legislation in the midst of the northwestern <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> oil boom. The new municipality was called "<span class="per">Parker</span>" and was made up of the earlier villages of <span class="per">Parker</span>'s Landing (on the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> River) and <span class="loc">Lawrenceburg</span> (on the bluff above the river). Residents assumed that <span class="per">Parker</span> would quickly become a major population center, and, at the height of the oil boom, the population of <span class="per">Parker</span> grew to over 20,000. The boom quickly went bust, however, and by the 1880s the "city" returned to its historic, small village size, and a population of approximately 1,000.</p><br><br>
