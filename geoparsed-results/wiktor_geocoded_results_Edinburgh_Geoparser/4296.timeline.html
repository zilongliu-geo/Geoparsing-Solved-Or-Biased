  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Potter County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 17,457, making it the fifth-least populous county in <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is Coudersport. The county was created in <span class="date">1804</span> and later organized in <span class="date">1836</span>. It is named after <span class="per">James Potter</span>, who was a general from <span class="loc">Pennsylvania</span> in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Though it is named for him, <span class="per">James Potter</span> never actually lived in <span class="loc">Potter County</span> and may have never even visited the area. <span class="loc">Potter County</span> is located in the <span class="loc">Allegheny</span> Plateau region. <span class="per">Major Isaac Lyman</span>, an American Revolutionary war veteran was one of the first permanent settlers in <span class="loc">Potter County</span>. <span class="per">Major Lyman</span> is recognized as the founder of <span class="loc">Potter County</span>. He was paid ten dollars for each settler he convinced to move to <span class="loc">Potter County</span>. He built his home in <span class="date">1809</span> in nearby <span class="loc">Lymansville</span>, <span class="date">now</span> known as Ladonna. <span class="per">Major Lyman</span> also built the first road to cross <span class="loc">Potter County</span> and <span class="loc">Potter County</span>'s first sawmill and gristmill. <span class="per">Lyman</span> had a colorful personal history. After the death in childbirth of his first wife, <span class="per">Sally Edgecombe</span>, he remarried; later he left his second wife and started a third family in <span class="loc">Potter County</span>. The second <span class="per">Mrs. Lyman</span> was determined not to suffer on her own. She sought out the Major, travelling from <span class="loc">Bolton Landing</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> to <span class="loc">Potter County</span> with the help of their son, <span class="per">Burrell</span>, who was 18 at the time. <span class="per">Major Lyman</span> lived with these two families in <span class="loc">Potter County</span>. Historical accounts of the living situation vary. Some say that <span class="per">Lyman</span> kept both wives under one roof. Others state that there were two log homes for the families on the same piece of property. <span class="org">Descendants of Major</span> <span class="per">Isaac Lyman</span>'s three families still live and work in <span class="loc">Potter County</span>.</p><br><br>
