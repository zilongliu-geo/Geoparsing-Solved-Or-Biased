  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Canterbury</span> (Māori: <span class="loc">Waitaha</span>) is a region of <span class="loc">New Zealand</span>, located in the central-eastern <span class="loc">South Island</span>. The region covers an area of 44,508 square kilometres (17,185 sq mi), and is home to a population of 586,500 (<span class="date">June 2015</span> estimate). The region in its current form was established in <span class="date">1989</span> during nationwide local government reforms. The <span class="loc">Kaikoura District</span> joined the region in <span class="date">1992</span> following the abolition of the Nelson-Marlborough Regional Council. <span class="loc">Christchurch</span>, the <span class="loc">South Island</span>'s largest city and the country's third-largest urban area, is the seat of the region and home to 65 percent of the region's population. Other major towns and cities include <span class="loc">Timaru</span>, <span class="loc">Ashburton</span>, <span class="loc">Rangiora</span> and <span class="loc">Rolleston</span>. In <span class="date">1848</span>, <span class="per">Edward Gibbon Wakefield</span>, a Briton, and <span class="per">John Robert Godley</span>, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, founded the <span class="org">Canterbury Association</span> to establish an Anglican colony in the <span class="loc">South Island</span>. The colony was based upon theories developed by <span class="per">Wakefield</span> while in prison for eloping with a woman not-of-age. Due to ties to the prestigious <span class="org">Oxford University</span>, the <span class="org">Canterbury Association</span> succeeded in raising sufficient funds and recruiting middle-class and upper-class settlers. In <span class="date">April 1850</span>, a preliminary group led by <span class="per">Godley</span> landed at Port Cooper—modern-day Lyttelton Harbour—and established a port, housing and shops in preparation for the main body of settlers. In <span class="date">December 1850</span>, the first wave of 750 settlers arrived at <span class="loc">Lyttelton</span> in a fleet of four ships.</p><br><br>
