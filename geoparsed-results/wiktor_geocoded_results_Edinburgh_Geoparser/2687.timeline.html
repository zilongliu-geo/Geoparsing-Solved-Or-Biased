  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Aura is a small unincorporated community in Arvon Township of <span class="loc">Baraga County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>. With coordinates of 46°51′46″N 88°19′07″W, the area is approximately 12 miles (19 km) northeast of L'Anse and four miles (6 km) east of <span class="loc">Pequaming</span>. In the 1870s, the land on the <span class="loc">Abbaye Peninsula</span> was still mostly the property of the Chippewa Native Americans. In <span class="date">1877</span>, the <span class="per">Hebard</span> and <span class="per">Thurberg</span> Lumber Company leased the peninsula from the chief, <span class="per">David King</span>. They built a large steam-powered sawmill <span class="date">the following year</span> and established sixteen lumber camps. The principal Chippewa village, known as Pe-qua-qua-wa-ming, is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Pequaming</span>. The mill produced up to 25 million board feet of lumber annually and employed as many as 650 men. After the death of King, his heirs sold the entire peninsula to <span class="per">Charles Hebard</span> and his company. The land and the sawmill were later owned by <span class="per">Henry Ford</span>. Towards the end of the Copper Country Strike of <span class="date">1913</span>-<span class="date">1914</span> that affected mining interests throughout the Copper Country region of <span class="loc">Michigan</span>, <span class="per">Hebard</span> began selling off harvested lands in the middle of the Abbaye peninsula on reasonable terms, of $300 for 40 acres (160,000 m2) with only a small cash downpayment to stake a claim. Many jobless Finnish miners moved there to begin farming the land. The first settlers in <span class="date">June 1914</span> were <span class="per">Tobias Hilunen</span> and his family, who purchased Camp Number 3 and which had buildings in habitable condition. Other Finnish families arrived <span class="date">later that summer</span>. They named the place Aura (Finnish: "Plow"), because someone had found an old plow on the land, apparently left by loggers.</p><br><br>
