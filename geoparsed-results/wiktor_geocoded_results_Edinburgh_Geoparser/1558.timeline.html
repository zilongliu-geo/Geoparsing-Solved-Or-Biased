  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Gilbert</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Searcy County</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 28 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, ranking it as one of the smallest municipalities in the state and nation. Over the <span class="date">years</span>, <span class="per">Gilbert</span> has gained a reputation (along with Calico Rock) as one of the coldest locations in <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. The <span class="org">Gilbert General Store</span>, built in <span class="date">1901</span>, is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> under the name Mays Store. The community was founded in <span class="date">1902</span> when a railroad construction camp for the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and <span class="loc">North Arkansas Railroad</span> was built and named in honor of <span class="per">Charles W. Gilbert</span>, secretary-treasurer of <span class="org">Allegheny Supply Company</span>, which was building the railroad. In <span class="date">1906</span>, William Mays moved his store and post office from Duff, located a few miles away. <span class="per">Gilbert</span> was a hub for commerce. Cotton, logs, ore and grain came by rail. <span class="per">Gilbert</span> was eventually the home to a repair shop for the railroad, which ceased operation in <span class="date">1946</span>. While the tracks were removed and sold as scrap, there are still signs of the railroad where the old concrete supports crossed the <span class="loc">Buffalo River</span>. The former rail bed is <span class="date">now</span> a hiking route along the river.</p><br><br>
