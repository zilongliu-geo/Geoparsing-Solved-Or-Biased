<p><span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a county located in the state of <span class="loc">Florida</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 24,935. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Chipley</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>. <span class="loc">Washington County</span> is a prohibition or entirely dry county, meaning that the sale of alcoholic beverages is banned in the county. <span class="loc">Washington County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span> was created in 1825, and was nearly twice the size of the State of <span class="loc">Delaware</span>, stretching all the way to the <span class="loc">Gulf of Mexico</span>. After a century of boundary shifts, the county, with over 382,000 acres (1,546 km2) of rolling hills covered in thick, stately pines and mixed hardwood forests, now covers a large portion of the central <span class="loc">Florida</span> Panhandle. Over a span of more than 150 years, <span class="loc">Washington County</span> has seen Native American, Spanish and English cultural influences. <span class="loc">The County</span>'s historical lore is rich with stories of the exploits of Andrew Jackson. There are numerous Native American Mounds and evidence of strong settlements still being discovered. Named after <span class="loc">George Washington</span>, the first President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>, the area was first settled by those seeking both economic and political freedom in this frontier land of vast timber and mineral resources. Inland waterway transportation brought about heavy river settlements. The arrival of railroads in the late 1800s boosted economic, social and political developments.</p>
