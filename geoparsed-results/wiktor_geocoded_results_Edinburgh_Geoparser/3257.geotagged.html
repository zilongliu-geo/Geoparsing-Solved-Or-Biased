<p><span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cache County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 9,495 at the 2010 census, with an estimated population of 11,014 in 2014. It is included in the Logan, <span class="loc">Utah-Idaho Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area, and is the second largest city in the area after Logan, the county seat. <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> is home to Sky View High School, where students from all of northern <span class="loc">Cache County</span> come to study. Originally known as "<span class="loc">Summit Creek</span>", <span class="loc">Smithfield</span> was founded in 1857 by Robert Thornley and his cousin Seth Langdon who were sent north from <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span> by Brigham Young to found a settlement on <span class="loc">Summit Creek</span>. After a preliminary scouting, Robert returned with his new wife Annie Brighton. The first winter was spent in a wagon box. By the next summer, with more settlers arriving, a small fort was built on the edge of the creek, one cabin of which remains. As the settlement grew, a bishop was named and the town took his name. By 1917 the town had planted trees on both sides of its Main Street and had acquired a <span class="loc">Carnegie</span> library and a Rotary club. Dependent for many years on dairying, a <span class="loc">Del Monte</span> canning factory, and the sugar beet industry, the town is now essentially a bedroom community for Logan and its Utah State University.</p>
