<p>Hamilton is an inner northern suburb of the <span class="loc">City of Brisbane</span> in <span class="loc">Queensland</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, lying on the north bank of the <span class="loc">Brisbane River</span> along <span class="loc">Hamilton Reach</span>. The area is hilly with views of the <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> central business district. At the 2011 Australian census the suburb recorded a population of 4,721. In 2013, the suburb had the highest mean taxable income of any in <span class="loc">Queensland</span>. It is believed the first hotel in the district was built by the Gustavus Hamilton (father of Messrs. F. G. Hamilton, barrister, and R. Hamilton, surveyor). Amongst the earlier lessees of the hotel was a Mrs. Warren, who, by coincidence, married another Mr. Hamilton, so that the hotel was occupied by different families of the name Hamilton. The Hamilton Hotel became an easy reference mark in the days when buildings were few in the district, and its name was gradually applied to the whole district. In <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>'s early history, Hamilton was the home to many aristocrats and clergy. This suburb is known for being an "old wealth" suburb compared to "new wealth" suburbs in <span class="loc">Brisbane</span> such as <span class="loc">Paddington</span>, <span class="loc">Toowong</span> and Indooroopilly. Many of <span class="loc">Brisbane</span>'s iconic mansions are found in Hamilton, mainly because the exclusive suburb boasts spectacular views of the entire central business district and other surrounding suburbs.</p>
