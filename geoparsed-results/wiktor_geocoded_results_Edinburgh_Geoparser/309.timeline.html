  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Saba</span> (/ˈsɑːbə/) is a Caribbean island and the smallest special municipality (officially public body) of the <span class="loc">Netherlands</span>. It consists largely of the potentially active volcano <span class="loc">Mount Scenery</span>, at 887 metres (2,910 ft) the highest point of the entire <span class="loc">Netherlands</span>. <span class="loc">Saba</span> has a land area of 13 square kilometres (5.0 sq mi). As of <span class="date">January 2013</span>, the population was 1,991 inhabitants, with a population density of 150 inhabitants per square kilometre (390/sq mi). Its towns and major settlements are The Bottom (the capital), Windwardside, <span class="loc">Hell's Gate</span> and <span class="loc">St. Johns</span>. The origin of the name "Saba" is often believed to be derived from the <span class="per">Arawak</span> Indian word for "rock," which was "siba." <span class="per">Christopher Columbus</span> is said to have sighted the island on <span class="date">13 November 1493</span>. He did not land, being deterred by the island's perilous rocky shores. In <span class="date">1632</span>, a group of shipwrecked Englishmen landed upon <span class="loc">Saba</span>. They stated they found the island uninhabited when they were rescued. There has been clear evidence found indicating that <span class="per">Caribs</span> and <span class="per">Arawak</span> Indians have been on the island.</p><br><br>
