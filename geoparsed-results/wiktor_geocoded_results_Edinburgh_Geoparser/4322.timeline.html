  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Nashville</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Washington Township</span>, <span class="loc">Brown County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 803 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The town is the county seat of <span class="loc">Brown County</span> and is the county's only incorporated town. The town is best known as the center of the <span class="loc">Brown County</span> Art Colony and as a tourist destination. Settlement of land in and around <span class="loc">Nashville</span> began with the acquisition of land from native populations under the <span class="date">1809</span> Treaty of <span class="loc">Fort Wayne</span>. This was expanded with more acquisitions under the <span class="date">1818</span> Treaty of St. Mary's. Founded in <span class="date">1836</span> by county agent Banner <span class="per">C. Brummett</span>, it was first named <span class="loc">Jacksonburg</span>. The population of the entire county was estimated to be 150 in <span class="date">1830</span>. The first Nashville courthouse was constructed in <span class="date">1837</span> and a jail was added in the same year. By <span class="date">1840</span>, area population had grown to 2,364. The town was officially incorporated in <span class="date">1872</span>. By <span class="date">the turn of the century</span>, heavy logging in the area had caused significant deforestation which resulted in dramatic erosion problems. In the early twentieth century, a number of artists settled in the area, most notably <span class="per">T. C. Steele</span>, the American Impressionist painter. These artists were the basis for the <span class="loc">Brown County</span> Art Colony, which continues to <span class="date">this day</span> as the <span class="loc">Brown County</span> Art Guild.</p><br><br>
