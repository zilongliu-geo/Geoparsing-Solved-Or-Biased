Located in Southern <span class="loc">Illinois</span>, the population was 4,442 at the <span class="date">2010</span> United States Census, a decline from 5,135 in <span class="date">2000</span>. The city is known for being tied to its close neighbor <span class="loc">Jonesboro</span>, together known as Anna-Jonesboro.

Anna was platted on <span class="date">March 3, 1854</span>. The city was incorporated on <span class="date">February 16, 1865</span>. Anna was historically a sundown town, in which African Americans were excluded from living in the town's limits. In <span class="date">1909</span>, a mob of angry white citizens drove out Anna's black families following the lynching in a nearby town of a black man accused of raping a white woman. According to Historian <span class="per">James Loewen</span>, a common adage in the town was that its name of "Anna" was actually an acronym, standing for "Ain't No Niggers Allowed".

According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, Anna has a total area of 3.519 square miles (9.11 km2), of which 3.5 square miles (9.06 km2) (or 99.46%) is land and 0.019 square miles (0.05 km2) (or 0.54%) is water.</p><br><br>
