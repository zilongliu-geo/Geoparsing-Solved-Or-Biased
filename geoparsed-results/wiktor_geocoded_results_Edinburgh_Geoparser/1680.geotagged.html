<p><span class="loc">Columbia County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">New York</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 63,096. The county seat is Hudson. The name comes from the Latin feminine form of the name of Christopher Columbus, which was at the time of the formation of the county a popular proposal for the name of the <span class="loc">United States</span> of <span class="loc">America</span>. <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> comprises the <span class="loc">Hudson</span>, <span class="loc">NY</span> Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Albany-Schenectady, NY Combined Statistical Area. It is located on the east side of the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>. At the time of European encounter, the area was occupied by the indigenous Mohican Indians. To the west of the river were the <span class="loc">Mohawk</span> and other four tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy, extending past what is now the border of <span class="loc">New York</span> state. The first known European exploration of <span class="loc">Columbia County</span> was in 1609, when Henry Hudson, an English explorer sailing for the Dutch, ventured up the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>. An accident to his craft forced him to stop at what is now known as <span class="loc">Columbia County</span>, and search for food and supplies. In 1612, the Dutch established trading posts and minor settlements, constructing <span class="loc">New Amsterdam</span> (today New <span class="loc">York City</span>) and <span class="loc">Fort Orange</span> (today <span class="loc">Albany</span>). <span class="loc">Fort Orange</span> became a center of the fur trade with the <span class="loc">Mohawk</span> people. Traders began to stop at midway points along the <span class="loc">Hudson River</span>, on their travels between <span class="loc">New Amsterdam</span> and <span class="loc">Fort Orange</span>. Small settlements arose along the river to supply the traders' ships.</p>
