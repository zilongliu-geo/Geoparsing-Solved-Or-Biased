  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Stockton</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Newcastle</span>, <span class="loc">New South Wales</span>, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, located 600 m (0.4 mi) from <span class="loc">Newcastle</span>'s central business district. It is the only residential suburb of <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> that lies north of the <span class="loc">Hunter River</span>. <span class="loc">Stockton</span> is a peninsula, with the <span class="loc">Hunter River</span> at the south and south-west and the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> at the east. On the eastern side are sand dunes and surfing beaches, with numerous shipwrecks at its north, while on the western side there are marshes, where many migratory birds can be spotted. There are numerous spots at <span class="loc">Stockton</span> suitable for recreational fishing. For <span class="date">many years</span>, <span class="loc">Stockton</span> was linked to <span class="org">Newcastle's Central Business District</span> ("Overtown" or "Over Seas" in Stocktonian parlance) at the south by passenger and vehicular ferry services. While there is still a passenger ferry service, vehicular traffic is <span class="date">now</span> connected by the <span class="loc">Stockton</span> Bridge, built in <span class="date">1971</span> as part of a northern detour to the outside world. <span class="loc">Stockton</span> was settled almost as soon as the foundation of <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> in <span class="date">1797</span>. It was originally called "Pirates Point" as the result of escaped convicts being shipwrecked on the peninsula in <span class="date">1800</span>. The southern tip of the peninsula, near the northern breakwater is still known as "<span class="loc">Pirate Point</span>". For much of the 19th century it served as an industrial and mining base. In <span class="date">1896</span> tragedy struck the local colliery, in which a gas leak killed 11 people. It has become a working-class dormitory suburb during the 20th century, and remains so <span class="date">today</span> for its 4,200 residents.</p><br><br>
