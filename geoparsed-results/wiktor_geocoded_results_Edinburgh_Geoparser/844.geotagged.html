Much of the island is within the borders of Daisen-Oki National Park. <span class="loc">Ama</span> has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa) with very warm summers and cool winters.

Emperor Go-Toba, defeated in the Jōkyū War in 1221, was exiled to the <span class="loc">Oki</span> Islands, and lived in <span class="loc">Ama</span> for 19 years until his death in 1198. <span class="loc">Oki</span> Shrine was built in 1939 to commemorate the 700th year of his death. <span class="loc">Ama</span> came under the control of the <span class="loc">Matsue Domain</span> in the <span class="loc">Edo</span> period, and was divided into seven villages. After the Meiji restoration, the <span class="loc">Oki</span> Islands became part of Tottori Prefecture in 1871, but were transferred to <span class="loc">Shimane Prefecture</span> in 1881. <span class="loc">Ama</span> Village was established in 1904.
