  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Guadalupe is a small city located in Santa <span class="loc">Barbara County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. According to the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Census of <span class="date">2010</span>, the city has a population of 7,080. Guadalupe is economically and socially tied to the city of <span class="loc">Santa Maria</span>, which is about ten miles to the east. The first European land exploration of Alta <span class="loc">California</span>, the Spanish Portol√† expedition, camped near <span class="date">today</span>'s Guadalupe on <span class="date">September 1, 1769</span>. Franciscan missionary and expedition member <span class="per">Juan Crespi</span> noted in his diary that they found "a very large lake". The lake has since mostly filled in, leaving a low-lying plain traversed by the <span class="loc">Santa Maria River</span> and several tributaries. When Mission <span class="date">La Purisima</span> was established in <span class="date">1787</span>, the area became part of the mission's pasture land. In <span class="date">1840</span>, following secularization of the mission, the area became part of the <span class="loc">Rancho Guadalupe</span> land grant. <span class="loc">Rancho Guadalupe</span> was settled by pioneers of many unique backgrounds, such as European, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Mexican. The small town was incorporated as the <span class="loc">city of Guadalupe</span> on <span class="date">May 19, 1946</span>. The city name honors <span class="loc">Our Lady of Guadalupe</span>, the title given to the <span class="org">Virgin</span> Mary.</p><br><br>
