<p><span class="loc">Bayang</span> is a fifth class municipality in the province of <span class="loc">Lanao del Sur</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 21,472 people. In May 1902, during the Moro Rebellion (also known as the Moroâ€“American War), <span class="loc">Bayang</span> was the site of a clash between Moro rebels and American troops that became known as the Battle of <span class="loc">Bayang</span>. The American troops, three infantry battalions and a battery of artillery totaling some 1200 men, were led to <span class="loc">Bayang</span> by colonel Frank Baldwin to demand the extradition of the <span class="loc">Moros</span> responsible for the ambushing and killing of two American soldiers at the construction of a road from <span class="loc">Iligan</span> to <span class="loc">Lake Lanao</span>, two months earlier. When the sultan of <span class="loc">Bayang</span> refused, Baldwin's troops attacked and captured the nearby cotta (fortress; "small, castle-like structures with thick, high walls") of <span class="loc">Binidayan</span> on 2 May. They subsequently attempted to capture the cotta of Pandapatan, which resisted the artillery fire and was only subdued the next day after hand-to-hand combat between <span class="loc">Moros</span> and Americans. The number of Moro casualties is estimated at 300 to 400, including the sultan of <span class="loc">Bayang</span> and his brother. On the American side, ten soldiers were killed and some forty wounded.</p>
