<p><span class="loc">Providence</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Cache County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 7,075 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Logan, <span class="loc">Utah-Idaho Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Providence</span> lies 2.5 miles (4.0 km) south of Logan on former State Route 238. Its 1990 census population was 3,344. Situated immediately east of the confluence of <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span> with the <span class="loc">Logan River</span>, the town lies astride a delta at the mouth of <span class="loc">Providence</span> Canyon and beneath 8,881-foot (2,707 m) <span class="loc">Big Baldy Mountain</span>. The settlement was located on <span class="loc">Spring Creek</span> to take advantage of water, arable land, timber resources, and existing trails. As directed by LDS President Brigham Young, on 24 July 1855 Captain Briant Stringham, Simon Baker, Andrew Moffat, and Brigham Young, Jr., located headquarters for the Elkhorn Cattle Ranch on a spring of water near the west bank of the Blacksmith <span class="loc">Fork River</span>, immediately southwest of the present site of <span class="loc">Providence</span>. Subsequently, in the early spring of 1857, Samuel, Joseph, Aboile, and Nephi Campbell, and John Dunn, crossed the mountains from <span class="loc">North Ogden</span> into Cache Valley, seeking a new place to settle. To them, the town they called "Ogden's Hole" was becoming too crowded. They pitched camp at the present site of <span class="loc">Providence</span>, at a spring and pond where a creek from a canyon in the Bear River Range entered the alluvial lowland. To assess the fertility of the soil, the explorers broke sod and plowed a long furrow.</p>
