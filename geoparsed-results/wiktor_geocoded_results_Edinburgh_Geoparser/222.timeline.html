  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is a city in western Victoria, <span class="loc">Australia</span>, at the intersection of the Glenelg Highway (from <span class="loc">Ballarat</span> to <span class="loc">Mount Gambier</span>) and the Henty Highway (from <span class="loc">Portland</span> to <span class="loc">Horsham</span>). The <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> Highway connects it to <span class="loc">Geelong</span>. <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> is in the federal Division of <span class="loc">Wannon</span>, and is in the Southern <span class="loc">Grampians</span> local government area. <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> used to claim to be the "Wool Capital of the World", based on its strong historical links to sheep grazing which continue <span class="date">today</span>. These <span class="date">days</span>, the town uses the "Greater <span class="loc">Hamilton</span>: one place, many possibilities" tagline, recognising the good schools, highly skilled workforce and rich natural beauty of the region. <span class="loc">Hamilton</span> was built near the border of three traditional indigenous tribal territories: the Gunditjmara land that stretches south to the coast, the Tjapwurong land to the north east and the Bunganditj territory to the west. People who lived in these areas tended to be settled rather than nomadic. The region is fertile and well-watered, leading to an abundance of wildlife, and no need to travel far for food. Physical remains such as the weirs and fish traps found in <span class="loc">Lake Condah</span> to the south of <span class="loc">Hamilton</span>, as well as accounts of early white settlers support local indigenous oral histories of well-established settlements in the area.</p><br><br>
