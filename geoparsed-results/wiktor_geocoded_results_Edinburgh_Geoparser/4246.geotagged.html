<p><span class="loc">Compton</span> is a suburb of <span class="loc">Wolverhampton</span>, <span class="loc">West Midlands</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is located to the west of <span class="loc">Wolverhampton</span> city centre on the A454, within the <span class="loc">Tettenhall</span> <span class="loc">Wightwick ward</span>. <span class="loc">Compton</span> sits nestled below the ridge that stretches south west from Aldersley, with some of its housing climbing the steep hill near 'The <span class="loc">Holloway</span>' on the climb towards <span class="loc">Tettenhall Wood</span>. Across the Smestow valley the terrain rises again in the direction of Finchfield. The valley here through which the <span class="loc">Smestow Brook</span> flows was formed as a glacial meltwater channel. The area was quarried for its sandstone. Its place name reflects its position - first recorded in the Domesday book of 1086 as 'Contone', from Old English cumb - a narrow valley or deep hollow ('cumb' is likely a continuation in use or a loan word from Brythonic cwm (Welsh) or cum (Cornish), meaning 'valley'), and Old English tūn - a farmstead or fenced place. Compton Lock on the <span class="loc">Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal</span> was the starting point in 1766 for the construction of the canal under James Brindley. In the late 19th-early 20th century, <span class="loc">Compton</span> was home of a distinguished local artist Joseph Vickers de <span class="loc">Ville</span> (1856–1925). It was during this time that the still existing terraced housing was built along <span class="loc">Henwood Road</span> near the <span class="loc">Bridgnorth Road</span> junction.</p>
