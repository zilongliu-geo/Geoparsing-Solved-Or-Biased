  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Milton is a village and civil parish about 3 miles (5 km) west of <span class="loc">Didcot</span> and a similar distance south of <span class="loc">Abingdon</span>. The <span class="date">2011</span> Census recorded the parish's population as 1,290. In AD 956 <span class="per">King Eadwig</span> granted 15 hides of land at Milton to his thegn Alfwin, who in turn gave the estate to the <span class="loc">Benedictine Abingdon</span> Abbey. In <span class="org">the Dissolution of the Monasteries</span> in the 1530s the abbey surrendered its lands to the <span class="org">Crown</span>. Milton was among a number of estates that <span class="per">Henry VIII</span> granted to <span class="per">Baron Wriothesley</span> in <span class="date">1546</span>. <span class="per">Wriothesley</span> sold Milton that same year to <span class="per">Thomas Calton</span>, a goldsmith of <span class="loc">London</span>, whose descendants retained it for <span class="date">the next 218 years</span>. In <span class="date">1709</span> <span class="per">Paul Calton</span> married <span class="per">Catherine</span>, daughter of <span class="per">Admiral</span> <span class="per">John Benbow</span>. In <span class="date">1764</span> <span class="per">Catherine, Martha</span> and <span class="per">Mary Calton</span> sold the estate to <span class="per">Bryant Barrett</span>, in whose family the property remains. <span class="per">Bryant Barrett</span> was a Roman Catholic, so, by English law, could not own property. He and his brother <span class="per">Isaac</span> agreed that the latter should buy the house and estate on <span class="per">Bryant</span>'s behalf for Â£10,600. Milton <span class="loc">Manor House</span> is a yellow and red brick manor house built for the <span class="per">Calton</span> family in the 17th century. The actual date is unknown: in <span class="date">1696</span> it was described as "newly built" but Sir <span class="per">Nikolaus Pevsner</span> believed that it could not be much later than the 1660s. The original building is of five bays and three storeys and may have been designed by <span class="per">Inigo Jones</span>. In <span class="date">1772</span> short two-storey wings designed by <span class="per">Stephen Wright</span> were added to the house for <span class="per">Bryant Barrett</span>. The house is a Grade I listed building.</p><br><br>
