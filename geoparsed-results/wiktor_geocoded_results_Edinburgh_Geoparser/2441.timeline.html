  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Los Algodones</span>, <span class="loc">Baja California</span>, is a small Mexican town located on the extreme northeastern tip of the municipality of <span class="loc">Mexicali</span>, approximately 16 km (9.9 mi) <span class="loc">west of Yuma</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">USA</span>. Its official name is <span class="loc">Vicente Guerrero</span>, although most people use <span class="loc">Algodones</span> or Molar City when referring to it. It reported a population of 5,474 as of the <span class="date">2010</span> Mexican census. It also serves as a borough seat of its surrounding area. <span class="loc">Los Algodones</span> is the northernmost town in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, and at its northeastern tip is the northernmost point in <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, and in Latin <span class="loc">America</span>. Another interesting geographical distinction is that if someone were to travel in any of the four cardinal directions from anywhere in <span class="loc">Algodones</span> (due north, due east, due south, or due west), they would cross a <span class="loc">U.S.</span> border. Situated near the borders of both southeastern <span class="loc">California</span> and southwestern <span class="loc">Arizona</span>, <span class="loc">Los Algodones</span> has become a popular tourist attraction in <span class="date">recent years</span> due in part to inexpensive shopping and restaurants as well as inexpensive medical care and prescription medicines. The warm, dry climate of the area attracts a number of older tourists from across the <span class="loc">United States</span> and <span class="loc">Canada</span> who settle during the <span class="date">winter</span> in the nearby towns of <span class="loc">Yuma</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span> and <span class="loc">Winterhaven</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>. Organized day trips from the <span class="loc">Coachella</span> Valley are popular among seniors as well.</p><br><br>
