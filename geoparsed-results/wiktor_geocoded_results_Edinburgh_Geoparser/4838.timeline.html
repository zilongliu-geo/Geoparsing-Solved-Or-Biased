  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>The <span class="loc">city of Grafton</span> is the seat of local government, the Federal and State government admimistrative centre, and the commercial hub of the <span class="loc">Clarence River</span> Valley. Established in <span class="date">1851</span>, <span class="loc">Grafton</span> features many historic buildings and tree-lined streets. It is located approximately 630 kilometres north of the New South <span class="loc">Wales</span> State capital, <span class="loc">Sydney</span>, 340 km <span class="loc">south of Brisbane</span>, <span class="loc">Queensland</span> and approximately 35 km west of the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> coast. As at <span class="date">June 2014</span>, <span class="loc">Grafton</span> had a population of 18,698. Before European settlement, the <span class="loc">Clarence River</span> marked the border between the <span class="per">Bundjalung</span> and <span class="per">Gumbainggir</span> peoples, and so descendants of both language groups can <span class="date">now</span> be found in the <span class="loc">Grafton region</span>. <span class="loc">Grafton</span>, like many other settlements in the area, was first opened up to white settlement by the cedar-getters. An escaped convict, <span class="per">Richard Craig</span>, 'discovered' the district in <span class="date">1831</span>. With the wealth of 'red gold' cedar just waiting for exploitation, he was given a pardon and one hundred pounds to bring a party of cedar-getters on the cutter '<span class="per">Prince George</span>' to the region. Word of such wealth to be had did not take long to spread and one of the arrivals was pioneer <span class="per">John Small</span> on the 'Susan' in <span class="date">1838</span>, and he first occupied land on <span class="loc">Woodford</span> Island. 'The Settlement' (as the embryonic <span class="loc">Grafton</span> was then imaginatively named) was established shortly after.</p><br><br>
