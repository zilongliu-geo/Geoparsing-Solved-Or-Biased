<p>Easton is a town in <span class="loc">Bristol County</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 23,112 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Greater Boston area, but is also part of the 6-county definition of the Providence MSA. Easton is governed by an elected committee of selectmen and a town administrator. Easton was first settled in 1694 and was officially incorporated in 1725. In 1694, the first settler, Clement Briggs, established his home near the <span class="loc">Easton Green</span>. In 1711, the Taunton North Purchase area became <span class="loc">Norton</span>, and in 1713, the sixty-nine families settled in Easton and hired Elder William Pratt as their first minister. Prior to the settlers' establishment, the area was occupied by Native Americans as a hunting area and a burial ground. During King Philip's War, Metacom, also known as King Philip, used part of Easton as a headquarters for his troops. There was no legal parish in Easton until 1722, when the East Precinct of <span class="loc">Norton</span> was recognized. In 1725, the area was incorporated as the Town of Easton; it was so named because it was formerly called the "<span class="loc">East End</span>" of the Taunton North Purchase and was shortened by pronunciation to Easton. During the Revolutionary War, General <span class="loc">George Washington</span> stayed at the Benjamin Williams Tavern on Bay Road, which is now the second oldest existing house in Easton, while on his way to negotiate for cannonballs at the old Perry Foundry in <span class="loc">Taunton</span>.</p>
