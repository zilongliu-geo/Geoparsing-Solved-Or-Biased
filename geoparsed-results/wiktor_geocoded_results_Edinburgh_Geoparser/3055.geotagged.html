<p><span class="loc">Chatsworth</span>, is a large suburb created in the 1960s to house the predominantly <span class="loc">South</span> <span class="loc">Africa</span> Indian population. The suburb is situated in <span class="loc">South Durban</span> basin in <span class="loc">South Africa</span> and is roughly bordered by the <span class="loc">Umhlatuzana River</span> in the North and <span class="loc">Umlaas River</span> in the <span class="loc">South</span>. In the 1940s, The Pegging Acts and the Ghetto Act were passed. These acts gave the government the right to remove and destroy shacks and small self-made shelters, with the putative intention of improving sanitary conditions. This led to the Group Areas Act of June 1950, which designated certain areas for the Whites and other areas for Indians, Coloureds and Africans. Indians were removed from areas such as <span class="loc">Mayville</span>, <span class="loc">Cato Manor</span>, the <span class="loc">Clairwood</span>, Magazine Barracks, Bluff, Riverside, Prospect Hall, Duikerfontein and Sea <span class="loc">Cow Lake</span>. The removed populace was moved into primarily the two large Indian suburbs of Phoenix, which is situated <span class="loc">North of Durban</span>, and <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> in the <span class="loc">South</span>. During the later 1940s and early 1950s, there were advertisements in the papers of an exclusively Indian suburb, <span class="loc">Umhlatuzana</span>. Then in the early 1960s <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> was planned, opening in 1964 and consisting of eleven neighbourhood units. Modern day <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> is spread over seven municipal wards which all fall roughly in the <span class="loc">South Central</span> municipal area. <span class="loc">Chatsworth</span> was deliberately built to act as buffer between white residential areas and the large African township of <span class="loc">Umlazi</span>.</p>
