<p><span class="loc">Exeter</span> is a Canadian community in the municipality of <span class="loc">South Huron</span>, in the southern portion of <span class="loc">Huron County</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, located approximately 50 kilometres north of <span class="loc">London</span>. The community proclaims itself the "Home of the White Squirrel", owing to the presence of the unusually-coloured mammals. <span class="loc">Exeter</span>'s mascot, "Willis The White Wonder" can be seen at many community events throughout the year, including <span class="loc">Canada</span> Day celebrations, the <span class="loc">Exeter</span> Rodeo, and the Santa Claus Parade. <span class="loc">Exeter</span> was first founded in the winter of 1832 by the Irish settlers James and Jane Willis accompanied by the explorer Sir Michael Jacques. By 1853, <span class="loc">Exeter</span> had grown into a community of over 300 with the help of Isaac Carling bringing immigrants from the <span class="loc">Exeter</span> and <span class="loc">Devon</span> areas of England.The original Carling homestead, a designated historical landmark still stands on Huron St.W. It was on July 1, 1873, when the villages north and south of the <span class="loc">Ausable River</span> (<span class="loc">Francistown</span> and <span class="loc">Exeter</span> respectively) merged to form the Village of <span class="loc">Exeter</span>. <span class="loc">Exeter</span> eventually became a town of over 4,700 people. Paintings of some of <span class="loc">Exeter</span>'s historical citizens, by the late artist Harry Burke, may be seen at the <span class="loc">Exeter</span> Legion Hall.</p>
