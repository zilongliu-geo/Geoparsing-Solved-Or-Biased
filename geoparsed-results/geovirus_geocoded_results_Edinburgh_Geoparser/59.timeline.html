  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Libya</span> has freed six foreign medical personnel who were convicted of infecting hundreds of Libyan children with HIV and sentenced to death. In jail since <span class="date">1999</span>, the five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor arrived in Sofia, <span class="loc">Bulgaria</span>, <span class="date">today</span>. The president of <span class="loc">Bulgaria</span>, <span class="per">Georgi Parvanov</span>, promptly pardoned them. All six have maintained their innocence throughout. They have also claimed that they suffered torture to extract confessions. International HIV experts testified at the trials that the infections began before the six arrived at the Benghazi hospital. They said the infections were more likely the result of poor hygiene. <span class="date">Last week</span>, <span class="loc">Libya</span> lifted the death sentences following a US$460 million financial settlement, which works out to US$1 million to each HIV victim's family. However, <span class="loc">Libya</span> insisted on further concessions on relations with the European Union and aid. A deal between the <span class="org">E.U.</span> and <span class="loc">Libya</span>, mediated by <span class="loc">Qatar</span>, ended the diplomatic standoff. The foreign minister of <span class="loc">Libya</span>, <span class="per">Abdel Rahman Shalgham</span>, said the <span class="org">E.U.</span> promised to provide "life-long treatment" to the infected children, as well as aid to "improve the Benghazi hospital" where the children were infected. Further, he claimed that deal will allow for "full cooperation and partnership between <span class="loc">Libya</span> and the European Union." "We hope to go on further [in] normalising our relations with <span class="loc">Libya</span>. Our relations with <span class="loc">Libya</span> were to a large extent blocked by the non-settlement of this medics issue," said <span class="per">Jos√© Manuel Barroso</span>, President of the European Commission. The president of <span class="loc">France</span>, <span class="per">Nicolas Sarkozy</span>, said that neither the <span class="org">E.U.</span> nor <span class="loc">France</span> paid money to <span class="loc">Libya</span>. He also said he would visit <span class="loc">Libya</span> on <span class="date">Wednesday</span> to help Tripoli's reintegration. "I can quite simply confirm to you that neither <span class="loc">Europe</span> nor <span class="loc">France</span> have made the slightest financial contribution to <span class="loc">Libya</span>," said <span class="per">Sarkozy</span> to reporters in <span class="loc">Paris</span>. "I have had the opportunity to thank the Qatari authorities very warmly for their mediation and their humanitarian intervention." <span class="per">Benita Ferrero-Waldner</span>, the European Commissioner for External Relations, said: "I share the joy of their families and friends and of the government and people of <span class="loc">Bulgaria</span>. For over <span class="date">eight years</span>, we have never forgotten the suffering of the medical staff who have shown such dignity and fortitude during their long ordeal." "<span class="date">Now</span> I still can't believe that I am standing on Bulgarian soil. We were told the news at four o'clock in the morning and we left the jail at quarter to six to board the plane. <span class="date">Now</span> I will try to get my previous life back," said Kristiyana Vulcheva, 48, upon her release at the airport.</p><br><br>
