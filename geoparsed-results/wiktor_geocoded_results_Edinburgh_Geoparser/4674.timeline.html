  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Warburton</span> is a village and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of <span class="loc">Trafford</span> in <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. Historically in <span class="loc">Cheshire</span>, <span class="loc">Warburton</span> lies on the south bank of the <span class="loc">River Mersey</span> between the <span class="loc">borough of Warrington</span> and <span class="loc">Greater Manchester</span>. In the 21st century, the village remains predominantly rural. <span class="loc">Altrincham</span> is the nearest town. According to the <span class="date">2001</span> census, the parish had a population of 286. <span class="loc">Warburton</span> has a history of settlement stretching back to the 11th century, with the possibility of earlier habitation. There are 17 listed buildings in the village, including the timber framed Grade I Church of St Werburgh, which is <span class="date">at least 700 years</span> old. Among the other listed buildings are examples of architect <span class="per">John Douglas</span>' work, including the second Church of St Werburgh, built in <span class="date">1883</span>. In <span class="date">2006</span>, Time Team excavated in the lands of Moss <span class="loc">Brow Farm</span> in <span class="loc">Warburton</span>, looking for a Roman fortlet. Some limited evidence has been found of activity on the site of <span class="loc">Warburton</span> dating from the Bronze Age, through the Iron Age and Roman periods; these include a flint blade, six Mesolithic tools, pieces of quernstone, and a snake bracelet. Archaeological evidence indicates that the area around <span class="loc">Warburton</span> has been used agriculturally since at least the Roman times. In the Domesday Book, the name was Warburgtune which name has evolved to <span class="date">today</span>'s '<span class="loc">Warburton</span>'. The suffix –ton means a settlement or farmstead in Old English, indicating that the settlement has pre-Conquest origins. It has been suggested that <span class="loc">Warburton</span> was the site of an Anglo-Saxon burgh or defended settlement, possibly either called "Toppingburgh" orWeard byrig, established by Aethelflaed, Queen of the Mercians, in 915 during the wars with the Vikings. However, it <span class="date">now</span> seems likely that site lay on the Wales–Cheshire border.</p><br><br>
