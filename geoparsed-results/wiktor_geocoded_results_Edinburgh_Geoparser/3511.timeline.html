  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is a large village in <span class="per">Highland</span> and <span class="per">Ross</span> counties, <span class="loc">Ohio</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 4,639. Since the population declined to under 5,000, the Census Bureau may still call it a city, but by <span class="loc">Ohio</span>'s laws it is technically deemed a village. Since the change from city to village there is no longer a mayor of the town but a city manager; the current city manager is Ron Coffey, who was born and raised in <span class="loc">Greenfield</span>. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> is most well known because of its rich history, including its community members helping in the underground railroad, new industries, and a school. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> was named for its rural appearance. <span class="per">General Duncan McArthur</span> founded the town in <span class="date">1799</span>. <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> has had many innovators, such as <span class="per">Edward Lee McClain</span> who was well known for his detachable horse collar. The American <span class="per">Pad</span> and <span class="per">Textile</span> Company was created by <span class="per">McClain</span> later in life. This company provided job opportunities for <span class="loc">Greenfield</span>, and created products such as the life vest used in World War II. His memory will never be forgotten by <span class="loc">Greenfield</span> however because he donated a great gift to the town. <span class="per">Edward Lee McClain</span> High School which opened on <span class="date">September 23, 1915</span>, was named after him. People who wished to attend paid a fee of 15 cents for admission. Located in the center of town and serving as a focal point for the town, the school has many sculptures, paintings and murals, making it a well known school in <span class="loc">Ohio</span>. It was the first school in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> to have an indoor swimming pool, which is still there <span class="date">today</span>, with minor construction revisions.</p><br><br>
