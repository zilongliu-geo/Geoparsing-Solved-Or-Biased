<p><span class="loc">Windsor</span> (2011 population: 3,785) is a Canadian town located in <span class="loc">Hants County</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>. It is a service centre for the western part of the county and is situated on Highway 101. The town has a history dating back to its use by the Mi'kmaq Nation for several millennia prior to European discovery. When the Acadians lived in the area, the town was raided by <span class="loc">New England</span> forces in 1704. The area was central to both Father Le Loutre's War and the Expulsion of the Acadians during the Bay of Fundy Campaign in 1755. The town promotes itself as the birthplace of ice hockey and was the home of <span class="loc">Canada</span>'s first internationally best-selling author, Thomas Chandler Haliburton. Situated at the junction of the <span class="loc">Avon</span> and St. Croix Rivers, it is the largest community in the District of the Municipality of <span class="loc">West Hants</span> and had a 2001 population of 3,779 residents. Prior to the county being divided into separate municipal districts, <span class="loc">Windsor</span> had served as the shire town of the county. The region encompassing present day <span class="loc">Windsor</span> was originally part of Pisiguit, a Mi'kmaq term meaning "Junction of Waters". This name referred to the confluence of the <span class="loc">Avon</span> and St. Croix rivers, which flow into the <span class="loc">Minas Basin</span>.</p>
