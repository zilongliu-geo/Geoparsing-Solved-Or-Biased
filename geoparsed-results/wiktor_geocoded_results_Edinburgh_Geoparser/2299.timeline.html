  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Kula is a <span class="loc">district of Maui</span>, <span class="loc">Hawaii</span>, that stretches across the "up-country", the western-facing slopes of Haleakalā, from <span class="loc">Makawao</span> to <span class="loc">Ulupalakua</span>. Most of the residential areas lie between about 500 to 1,100 m (1,600 to 3,600 ft) in elevation. The district has traditionally been where full-time residents prefer to live, as distinct from the generally hotter and busier, more tourism-oriented towns near sea level, such as <span class="loc">Kihei</span> and <span class="loc">Lahaina</span>. Kula roughly extends from <span class="loc">Haleakala</span> Highway (Hawaii Route 37) in the north to <span class="loc">Keokea</span> in the south—a distance of about 16 miles around 20°47′32″N 156°19′37″W. The largely rural area known as Upper Kula includes the region up-slope from Lower Kula, the more densely populated area spread along the Kula Highway. The word Kula means "open meadows" in the Hawaiian language. On Maui Kula is one of the island's 12 foundation districts of ancient <span class="loc">Hawaii</span> called moku. Generally, Kula is a zone of arid earth with open country slopes between the inhabited and productive shoreline areas and the densely forested zone higher on the mountain. Maui's Kula district is the island's largest district, extending from dry coastal areas to the wetter high pasture lands of three major ranches (<span class="loc">Haleakala</span>, <span class="loc">Erewhon</span>, and <span class="loc">Ulupalakua</span>) that cap the region about halfway up the slopes of <span class="loc">Haleakala</span>. It laterally extends from <span class="loc">Keokea</span> to near <span class="loc">Makawao</span> where the rainforest of <span class="loc">East Maui</span> once began.</p><br><br>
