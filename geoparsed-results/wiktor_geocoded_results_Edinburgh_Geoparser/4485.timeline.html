  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Antas is a municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Almer√≠a</span>, in the autonomous community of <span class="loc">Andalusia</span>, <span class="loc">Spain</span>. The mountains of the Filabres roll down in undulating slopes at their north eastern end and here, on a fertile plain, lies Antas. The river, <span class="date">now</span> usually dry, has carved a ravine through the soft sandstone, where birds nest in the holes in the cliffs. All around Antas there are numerous large orange and lemon groves, and other fruits and vegetables are grown on this highly cultivated area. The local market is known in the area for the quality of its produce. During <span class="date">the 1960s</span>, the male population in Antas far exceeded the female one. Spinsters and widows were brought in from the <span class="loc">province of Murcia</span> and duly integrated into the society. Antas was the centre of the El Argar prehistoric culture. The remains of <span class="per">Neolithic</span> and <span class="per">Bronze</span> Age man can be seen in various protected sites around the town. Roman and Medieval remains have also been found here, such as the remains of an aqueduct that lie beside the road on the outskirts of the town.</p><br><br>
