<p><span class="loc">Lota</span> is a city and commune located in the center of <span class="loc">Chile</span> on the Gulf of <span class="loc">Arauco</span>, in the <span class="loc">southern Concepción Province</span> of the <span class="loc">Biobío Region</span>, 39 kilometres south of Concepción, and is one of the ten cities(communes) that constitutes the <span class="loc">Concepción metropolitan</span> area. The first Spanish settlement, <span class="loc">Santa Maria de Guadalupe</span>, was founded by the governor Ángel de <span class="loc">Peredo</span> on October 12 1662 but it did not survive long amidst the hostilities of the Arauco War. The modern city expanded with the coal mining industry in the mid-nineteenth century. It was established as a town on January 5, 1875 and became a city on November 30th 1881. The name <span class="loc">Lota</span> is thought to be derived from the Mapudungun word <span class="loc">Louta</span> meaning small or insignificant settlement. The city's coal mines were nationalized by Salvador Allende due to civil unrest and heavy Socialist support, but privatized again under Augusto Pinochet. The mines were closed in the 1990s after Lota's coal resources were nearly exhausted and cheaper Colombian coal arrived on the market, plunging the residents of <span class="loc">Lota</span> into poverty. Today, <span class="loc">Lota</span> is one of the poorest cities in <span class="loc">Chile</span> and is trying to turn its economy towards tourism. Tourist attractions include guided visits to the coal mine, White Beach, the Park of <span class="loc">Lota</span> (created by the Cousiño family), and the Historical Museum of <span class="loc">Lota</span>. <span class="loc">Lota</span> also has <span class="loc">Chile</span>'s oldest hydroelectric power station, the Chivilingo Hydroelectric Plant, designed by <span class="loc">Thomas Edison</span> and built in 1897.</p>
