  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wau</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span>, in the <span class="loc">province of Morobe</span>. It has a population of approx 5,000 and situated at an altitude of around 1100m. <span class="loc">Wau</span> was the site of a Gold rush during <span class="date">the 1920s and 30's</span> when prospective gold diggers arrived at the coast at <span class="loc">Salamaua</span> and struggled inland along the Black Cat Track. At the Battle of <span class="loc">Wau</span>, in <span class="date">January 1943</span>, during World War II, <span class="org">the Australian</span> Army stopped an advance by the Japanese. A road was established soon after World War II to <span class="loc">Lae</span> and this fostered the further development of local timber and agricultural industries that were originally established in support of the mining industry. While much of the mineral reserves have been extracted, industrial gold mining continues at <span class="loc">Edie Creek</span> and at the newly established Hidden Valley Gold Mine operated by Morobe Goldfields (a subsidiary of Harmony Gold - <span class="loc">South Africa</span>). The <span class="org">Wau Ecology Institute</span> is a biological research station situated near <span class="loc">Wau</span>. The first strike at <span class="loc">Wau</span>, the start of what would be known as the Morobe Goldfield, was made at <span class="loc">Koranga</span> Creek by William ‘Shark-Eye’ Park, probably towards <span class="date">the end of 1921</span>. Park and his partner, <span class="per">Jack Nettleton</span>, ran a clandestine mining operation for <span class="date">twelve months</span> from <span class="date">April 1922</span> until a new Mining Ordinance enabled them to get their gold out legally. <span class="per">Nettleton</span>, it is known, took out 6000 troy ounces, or about 190 kg, of gold in <span class="date">August 1923</span>.</p><br><br>
