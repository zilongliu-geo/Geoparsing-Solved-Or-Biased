  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Dōngfāng (simplified Chinese: 东方; traditional Chinese: 東方; literally: "the East") is one of the seven county-level <span class="loc">cities of Hainan</span> province, <span class="loc">China</span>. Although called a "city", <span class="loc">Dongfang</span> refers to a large land area in <span class="loc">Hainan</span> - an area which was once a county. Within this area is the main city, <span class="loc">Dongfang City</span>. It is located on the western coast of <span class="loc">Hainan Island</span> facing <span class="loc">Vietnam</span> across the <span class="loc">Gulf of Tonkin</span>, and in <span class="date">2004</span> had a population of 435,000. As all county-level units, <span class="loc">Dongfang</span> is administratively divided into township-level units (see the list). The main urban area of <span class="loc">Dongfang</span> (i.e., what used to be called "the county seat", when <span class="loc">Dongfang</span> was a county) is the town of <span class="loc">Basuo</span>. The former <span class="loc">county of Ganen</span> (postal: <span class="loc">Kumyan</span>, <span class="loc">Kanem</span> or <span class="loc">Kamyan</span>) is <span class="date">now</span> part of the city. <span class="loc">Dongfang</span> has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen Aw). Monsoonal influences are strong, and <span class="date">the two seasons</span> are the wet season and the dry season (<span class="date">November</span> to <span class="date">April</span>), when very little rainfall occurs. Rainfall is heaviest and most frequent from <span class="date">August</span> to <span class="date">October</span>, when typhoons may strike, and averages an annual total of 961 mm (37.8 in), far lower than much of the island. <span class="date">January</span> thru <span class="date">March</span> features the highest relative humidity levels of the year, while <span class="date">May</span> thru <span class="date">August</span> is very sunny, consistently averaging above 60% of possible sunshine. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 46% in <span class="date">February</span> to 67% in <span class="date">May</span>, the city receives 2,558 hours of sunshine annually, a level not seen in the southern half of <span class="loc">China</span> outside of <span class="loc">Tibet</span>. The average low temperature remains above 26.0 °C (78.8 °F) from <span class="date">June</span> to <span class="date">August</span>.</p><br><br>
