  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Pazar</span> (Laz and Georgian: ათინა/Atina; Greek: Αθήνα/Athina) is a town and <span class="loc">district of Rize</span> Province in the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> region of <span class="loc">Turkey</span>, 37 km east of the <span class="loc">city of Rize</span>. The town was formerly named <span class="loc">Atina</span> (Αθήνα του Πόντου) and was renamed <span class="loc">Pazar</span>, meaning 'market', in <span class="date">1928</span>. <span class="loc">Pazar</span> is a strip of <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> coast with high mountains running parallel to the coast inland. This coast has a mild climate with warm summers (22 °C in <span class="date">August</span>) and cool winters (7 °C in <span class="date">January</span>, it rarely snows on the coast), but very wet and humid, apart from the <span class="date">early summer</span> (April–May–June) it rains heavily year round, with an average of 50 sunny <span class="date">days</span> per year. The wind off the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> is cold in <span class="date">autumn</span>, warm and wet in <span class="date">summer</span>. With all this rainfall the area is very green, and even more water is brought to the area by the many streams bringing rainwater and snowmelt down from the <span class="loc">Black Sea</span> mountains, including the <span class="loc">Pazar River</span> itself. This is a hilly district and the main economic activity is tea growing, plus some fishing, trade and light industry (tea processing) in the town of <span class="loc">Pazar</span>. Tea was first planted here in <span class="date">1944</span> and there are <span class="date">now</span> three factories in <span class="loc">Pazar</span> for processing the crop. 65% of arable land in <span class="loc">Pazar</span> is used for growing tea. Before tea was planted, citrus fruits and apples were grown here but this has mostly ceased <span class="date">now</span>, apart from trees in family gardens, where people grow vegetables and keep poultry. There are small areas of tobacco, corn, potatoes and beans.</p><br><br>
