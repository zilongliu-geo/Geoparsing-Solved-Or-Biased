<p>Mohamed Tamalt, a journalist imprisoned in <span class="loc">Algeria</span> for insulting President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, died in hospital while serving his sentence. His lawyer on Sunday announced his death. Tamalt, 42, lived in <span class="loc">England</span>, basing himself in <span class="loc">London</span>, and had UK-Algerian dual citizenship. He was arrested on June 27 near his parents' Algiers home after writing a poem on Facebook. Human Rights Watch said he began a hunger strike immediately. On June 11 he was fined 200,000 dinars (Â£1,400; US$1,800) and imprisoned for two years. This was upheld on appeal. Tamalt fell into a coma which his lawyer, Amine Sidhoum, said lasted three months. He was undergoing treatment in <span class="loc">Bab</span> el-Oued hospital. Human Rights Watch had asked <span class="loc">Algeria</span> to release him when reportedly in critical condition in August. Reporters Without Borders called Tamalt's death a shocking blow to Algerian free speech. "Why was there such a conviction just for words on Facebook which did no harm to anyone?" asked the organisation's North African head, Yasmine Kacha. Amnesty International have sought an "independent and transparent investigation into the circumstances" of Tamalt's death. Tamalt was convicted of insulting President Bouteflika and defaming a public organisation, both breaches of the national Penal Code. Sidhoum told al-Jazeera the occasion marked "the first time since <span class="loc">Algeria</span> gained its independence from <span class="loc">France</span> that a journalist died in jail because of what he wrote on the Internet." He also said he was "really sad at the lack of support from his fellow Algerian journalists, who left him and abandoned him." </p>
