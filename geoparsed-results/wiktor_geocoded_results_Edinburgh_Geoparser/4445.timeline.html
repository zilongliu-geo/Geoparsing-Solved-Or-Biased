  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bridgetown</span> is a Canadian community located in north-central <span class="loc">Annapolis County</span>, <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span>. Situated on the <span class="loc">Annapolis River</span> at the head of the tide, the area saw Mi'kmaq settlements, followed by Acadian settlers from Port-Royal and then British-sponsored settlements by the late 18th century. There were at least ten Acadian settlers in the <span class="loc">Bridgetown</span> area before the French census of <span class="date">1671</span>, and the population doubled by <span class="date">1707</span>. The main Acadian settlement was on the east boundary of the present town, called Gaudetville. There were other Acadian settlers in the town proper, some of whom lived just east of the present bridge. Several armed skirmishes occurred in neighbouring <span class="loc">Carleton</span> Corner during <span class="per">Queen Anne</span>'s War (<span class="org">the Battle of Bloody Creek</span> (<span class="date">1711</span>)) and <span class="date">several decades later</span>, <span class="date">the Seven Years</span>' War (<span class="org">the Battle of Bloody Creek</span> (<span class="date">1757</span>)). Deed references suggest British settlement in <span class="loc">Bridgetown</span> from the early 1760s onward, after the Acadians were expelled from <span class="loc">Nova Scotia</span> in <span class="date">1755</span>. These settlers appeared shortly after the allocation of Granville Township among its proprietors; <span class="loc">Bridgetown</span> is located in what was formerly Granville Township, settled from <span class="date">1760</span> on. The central part of <span class="loc">Bridgetown</span> was referred to as the Farm of <span class="loc">Henly</span> for unknown reasons. The community grew into a successful wooden shipbuilding area during the 19th century, accounting for many grand homes. It was incorporated as a town in <span class="date">1897</span>. The town was actually an entrepot for the agricultural and forest products of the surrounding areas and became a significant manufacturing and commercial centre in the 19th century. Manufacturing included a furniture factory, an organ factory, a tannery, a bottling plant, a cider plant, the first M.W. Graves cannery and vinegar factory (Graves was a major food processor that later moved to <span class="loc">Kings County</span>) and a distillery.</p><br><br>
