According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census conducted by the Rural Health Unit, it has a population of 23,111 people. <span class="loc">Buenavista</span> is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. Bagacay Bagtingon Bicas-bicas <span class="loc">Caigangan</span> <span class="loc">Daykitin</span> <span class="loc">Libas</span> <span class="loc">Malbog</span> <span class="loc">Sihi</span> <span class="loc">Timbo</span> (Sanggulong) Tungib-Lipata Yook Barangay I (Pob.) Barangay II (Pob.) Barangay III (Pob.) Barangay IV (Pob.) The town was named "Buenavista" by <span class="per">Don Cornelio</span> Sadiua, due to its "good view." Its former name was <span class="loc">Sabang</span>, which is the river that runs through it. The majority of Buenavistans trace their ancestry to the <span class="per">Don Cornelio</span> Sadiua family. In <span class="date">1942</span>, the Japanese <span class="org">Imperial</span> forces landed in <span class="loc">Buenavista</span> at <span class="loc">Patay Ilog</span> before making their way to the capital. Due to its rugged terrain, relative isolation, and fierce pro-American sentiment, <span class="loc">Buenavista</span> was the headquarters for the resistance movement. Japanese forces and the Resistance and guerrillas frequently engaged in skirmishes within the town borders. Occupying Japanese forces burned the school and municipal building, after holding captives composed a member from each Buenavista family. Guerrilla forces eventually re-captured the town.</p><br><br>
