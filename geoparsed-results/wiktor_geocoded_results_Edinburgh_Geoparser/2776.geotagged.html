<p><span class="loc">Jamaica</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windham County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 946 at the 2000 census. <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> includes the villages of <span class="loc">East Jamaica</span> and <span class="loc">Rawsonville</span>. Its ZIP code is 05343. The town is home to <span class="loc">Jamaica</span> State Park, noted for scenic camping spots and various swimming holes, including <span class="loc">Hamilton Falls</span>. The nearest large town is <span class="loc">Brattleboro</span>. In the colonial period, what is now <span class="loc">Vermont</span> was disputed territory, with land claims from both <span class="loc">New York</span> and <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>. The original grants for this area, issued by the Royal Governor of <span class="loc">New York</span> in 1767 and 1772, were for two towns. But in 1777, the Republic of <span class="loc">Vermont</span> was established. Ignoring the previous grants, it gave charter on November 7, 1780 for “a tract of vacant land within this state which has not heretofore been granted.” The charter goes on to say “that the same be and is hereby Incorporated into a Township by the name of <span class="loc">Jamaica</span>”—its name from the Natick word for beaver and not the Caribbean island. The grant encompassed forty-two square miles, at an altitude ranging from 688 feet (210 m) above sea level along the <span class="loc">West River</span> to 2,542 feet (775 m) on The Pinnacle. On the charter were listed sixty-seven grantees, many of whose surnames can be found among residents today.</p>
