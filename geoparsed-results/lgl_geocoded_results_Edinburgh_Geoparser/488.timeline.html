  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Santa <span class="loc">Clara County</span> sex assault conviction overturned. A state appeals court has reversed a Santa <span class="loc">Clara County</span> sexual assault conviction, finding the defendant received a "grossly unfair trial'' because a trial judge allowed the prosecutor to improperly rely on a separate indecent exposure allegation to persuade the jury to return a guilty verdict. In a ruling <span class="date">last week</span>, a divided panel of the <span class="loc">San Jose</span>-based 6th District Court of Appeal overturned <span class="per">Cameron Lee Earle</span>'s conviction for assaulting a woman in a local parking lot in <span class="date">December 2004</span>. The appeals court concluded that <span class="per">Earle</span>'s trial was tainted because Superior Court Judge <span class="per">Rene Navarro</span> allowed the jury to consider a separate, unrelated misdemeanor indecent exposure charge, which was emphasized heavily by the prosecutor. The 6th District found that the evidence against <span class="per">Earle</span> was weak and circumstantial in the more serious sexual assault case, and that trying the two allegations at the same time allowed prosecutors to exploit the indecent exposure evidence "through spurious legal theories'' to convict <span class="per">Earle</span>. The appellate panel ruled that <span class="per">Earle</span> was entitled to separate trials on the two distinct charges. <span class="per">Justice Nathan Mihara</span> dissented, saying trying the two charges together did not deprive <span class="per">Earle</span> of a fair trial and did not prejudice the outcome. <span class="per">Earle</span> is currently serving his sentence of <span class="date">five years</span> and <span class="date">eight months</span> in prison for his convictions.</p><br><br>
