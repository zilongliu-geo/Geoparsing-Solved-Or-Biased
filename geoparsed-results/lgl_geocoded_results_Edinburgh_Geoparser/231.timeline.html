  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Ripley's account of Panthers at <span class="loc">Belle Plaine</span>. The <span class="per">Scott West</span> wrestling team upped their record to 24-5 in <span class="loc">Belle Plaine</span> on <span class="date">Friday night</span> as the Panthers closed out their regular season of wrestling with a 30-21 win over Minnesota's #7 rated team in Class AA, the Watertown-Mayer Lutheran Royals. "It was a Royal Battle!" exclaims <span class="per">Scott West</span> Wrestling coach Darren Ripley. With both teams in Section 2AA, the win will most likely give <span class="per">Scott West</span> the number 1 seed heading into <span class="date">this week</span>'s Section 2AA Team Tournament that will be held in <span class="loc">Montgomery</span>. "It was a hard fought meet by both teams and we got a good team effort," states coach <span class="loc">Ripley</span>. "The #1 is seed is what we wrestled for tonight," claims coach <span class="loc">Ripley</span>. "However, a seed does not put you in the State Tournament and that's what we will be wrestling for <span class="date">next week</span>." The "Royal Battle" would begin with three battles in the lightweight divisions of 103, 112 and 119. Watertown-Mayer Lutheran would come out on the winning end of all three low scoring matches as the Royals got a win from #3 rated <span class="per">Drew Fleming</span> at 103 as he scored a late, third period reversal to win 4-2 over #4 rated Panther <span class="per">Lee Goldberg</span>. The <span class="per">Fleming</span> win was followed by a 2-1 <span class="per">Joey Stadnick</span> win at 112 as the #7 rated Royal wrestler made a first period take down stand up over Panther <span class="per">Tyler Zilverberg</span>. Tenth-rated Brandon Henrich would make it a sweep of the first three weight classes for the visiting Royals as the 119 pounder held on to a 4-2 win over <span class="per">Jake Siegle</span>. "We knew coming into the meet that there were going to be several close, hard fought matches," insists coach <span class="loc">Ripley</span>. "The fight was on!" After <span class="per">Drake Matuska</span> gave the Royals a 15-0 team lead by pinning <span class="per">Francis Dvorak</span> in the first period at 125, <span class="per">Mark Dvorak</span> would break the scoring ice for the Panthers as he scored a dramatic 5-4 victory over <span class="per">Bill McCain</span> at 130. Trailing 4-3 with just seven seconds left in the match, <span class="per">Dvorak</span> switched <span class="per">McCain</span> for a match winning reversal that gave the Panthers their first three team points of the meet. "We needed somebody to break the ice," comments coach <span class="loc">Ripley</span>. "I would say that is <span class="per">Mark</span>'s biggest win for the team since his 8th grade year when he picked up a couple of big team wins over STMA and Milaca." The <span class="per">Dvorak</span> win at 152 gave <span class="per">Scott West</span> its first team lead at 18-15 and <span class="per">Dillon Fogarty</span> would close out the Panther six match winning streak pretty much in the same manner as it had started. Trailing Watertown's <span class="per">Taylor Neaton</span> 2-0 late in the match, <span class="per">Fogarty</span> would be awarded one point for a stalling call and then would reverse the Royal wrestler with less than five seconds remaining in the match to get a 3-2 win at 160. "We always stress that you have to wrestle six minutes and that you have to score the last points of the period," states coach <span class="loc">Ripley</span>. "Fortunately, we were able to do that a couple of times tonight." The Royals would come back to tie the team score (21-21) at 171 as #1 rated <span class="per">Eric Reinert</span> would score a third period pin of <span class="per">Kyle McDermand</span>. However, the Panthers would come back to win the last three matches of the meet and secure the 30-21 team win behind <span class="per">Connor Fogarty</span>'s 4-0 win over <span class="per">Brad Falde</span> at 189, <span class="per">Alex Krautkremer</span>'s 3-2 win over Nate Dickhausen at 215 and <span class="per">Travis Hentges</span> 4-0 win over <span class="per">Derek Ernst</span> at heavyweight. "Again, all three wrestlers stayed in good position and made points hard to come by," states coach <span class="loc">Ripley</span>. "<span class="per">Krautkremer</span>'s win was especially big because <span class="loc">Dickhausen</span> had defeated him earlier at the <span class="date">Christmas</span> Tournament and it gave us an insurmountable six point team lead in this meet."</p><br><br>
