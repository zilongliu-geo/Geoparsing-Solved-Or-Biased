  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Orange County</span> is a county located in the central piedmont region of the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 33,481. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="org">Orange</span>. <span class="loc">Orange County</span> is home to <span class="loc">Montpelier</span>, the 2,700 acre estate of <span class="per">James Madison</span>, the 4th President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> and oft-hailed "<span class="org">Father of the Constitution</span>." The county celebrated its 275th anniversary in <span class="date">2009</span>. The area was inhabited for <span class="date">thousands of years</span> by various cultures of indigenous peoples. At the time of European encounter, the Ontponea, a sub-group of the Siouan-speaking Manahoac tribe, lived in this Piedmont area. The first European settlement in what was to become <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was Germanna, formed when Governor <span class="per">Alexander Spotswood</span> settled 12 immigrant families from <span class="loc">Westphalia</span>, <span class="loc">Germany</span> there in <span class="date">1714</span>; a total of 42 people. <span class="loc">Orange County</span>, as a legal entity, was created in <span class="date">August 1734</span> when the <span class="org">Virginia House of Burgesses</span> adopted “An Act for Dividing Spotsylvania County.” Unlike other counties whose boundaries had ended at the <span class="loc">Blue Ridge Mountains</span>, <span class="org">Orange</span> was bounded on the west “by the utmost limits of Virginia” which, at that time, stretched to the <span class="loc">Mississippi River</span> and the <span class="loc">Great Lakes</span>. The colony of Virginia claimed the land, but very little of it had yet been occupied by any English. For this reason, some contend that <span class="loc">Orange County</span> was at one time the largest county that ever existed. This situation lasted only <span class="date">four years</span>; in <span class="date">1738</span> most of the western tract was split off into <span class="loc">Augusta County</span>. The expansiveness of the county boundaries was to encourage settlement further westward as well as to contend against the French claim to the <span class="loc">Ohio</span> Valley region.</p><br><br>
