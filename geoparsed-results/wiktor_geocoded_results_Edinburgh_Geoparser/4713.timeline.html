  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Palermo</span> (Italian: [paˈlɛrmo], Sicilian: Palermu, Latin: <span class="loc">Panormus</span>, from Greek: Πάνορμος, <span class="loc">Panormos</span>, Arabic: بَلَرْم‎, Balarm; Phoenician: זִיז, Ziz) is a city in Insular <span class="loc">Italy</span>, the capital of both the autonomous region of <span class="loc">Sicily</span> and the <span class="loc">Province of Palermo</span>. The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over <span class="date">2,700 years</span> old. <span class="loc">Palermo</span> is located in the northwest of the island of <span class="loc">Sicily</span>, right by the Gulf of <span class="loc">Palermo</span> in the <span class="loc">Tyrrhenian Sea</span>. The city was founded in <span class="date">734 BC</span> by the Phoenicians as Ziz ('flower'). <span class="loc">Palermo</span> then became a possession of <span class="loc">Carthage</span>, before becoming part of the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire and eventually part of the Byzantine Empire, for over <span class="date">a thousand years</span>. The Greeks named the city Panormus meaning 'complete port'. From 831 to <span class="date">1072</span> the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of <span class="loc">Sicily</span> when the city first became a capital. The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm, the root for <span class="loc">Palermo</span>'s present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, <span class="loc">Palermo</span> became the capital of a new kingdom (from <span class="date">1130</span> to <span class="date">1816</span>), the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Sicily</span> and the capital of the <span class="per">Holy Roman</span> Empire under <span class="per">Frederick II</span> <span class="per">Holy Roman Emperor</span> and <span class="per">Conrad IV</span> of <span class="loc">Germany</span>, King of the Romans. Eventually <span class="loc">Sicily</span> would be united with the Kingdom of <span class="loc">Naples</span> to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies until the Italian unification of <span class="date">1860</span>.</p><br><br>
