  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Littleton</span> is the Home Rule Municipality in <span class="per">Arapahoe, Douglas</span>, and <span class="per">Jefferson</span> counties that is the county seat of <span class="loc">Arapahoe County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The city is a part of the <span class="org">Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, CO</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city population was 41,737 at the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, ranking as the 20th most populous municipality in the State of <span class="loc">Colorado</span>. The <span class="loc">city of Littleton</span>'s history dates back to the <span class="date">1859</span> Pike's Peak Gold Rush, which brought not only gold seekers, but merchants and farmers to the community. <span class="per">Richard Sullivan Little</span> was an engineer from <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> that made his way out west to work on irrigation systems. Little soon decided to settle in the area at present day <span class="loc">Littleton</span> and brought his wife Angeline out from the East in <span class="date">1862</span>. The <span class="loc">Littles</span>, along with many neighbors, built the <span class="per">Rough</span> and <span class="per">Ready</span> Flour Mill in <span class="date">1867</span>, which provided a solid economic base in the community. By <span class="date">1890</span>, the community had grown to 245 people and the residents voted to incorporate the Town of <span class="loc">Littleton</span>. <span class="loc">Littleton</span> became widely known in <span class="date">1999</span> when the Columbine High School massacre occurred at Columbine High School. News media reported that the incident happened in the city, because the school’s ZIP code is primarily associated with <span class="loc">Littleton</span>. The school is actually located in adjacent Columbine, an unincorporated community, which is not a place name accepted by the <span class="org">U.S. Postal Service</span>; by default, locations in ZIP code 80123 use “Littleton” in their mailing addresses. Columbine High School is in the <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span> school system and is not one of the <span class="org">Littleton Public Schools</span>.</p><br><br>
