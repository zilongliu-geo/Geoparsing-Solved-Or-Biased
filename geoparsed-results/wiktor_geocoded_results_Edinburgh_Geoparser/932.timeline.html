  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Tabor is a city in <span class="loc">Fremont County</span> and extends northward into <span class="loc">Mills County</span> in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Iowa</span>. The population was 1,040 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Tabor is located at 40°53′48″N 95°40′21″W (40.896605, -95.672368). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.29 square miles (3.34 km2), all of it land. In <span class="date">1852</span> the <span class="loc">city of Tabor</span> was founded by several Christian clergymen, who were also active abolitionists, (<span class="per">George Gaston</span>, <span class="per">Samuel A. Adams</span>, and Rev. <span class="per">John Todd</span>) and their families. They chose to settle in what is <span class="date">now</span> Tabor in order to found a Christian college, which eventually became Tabor College. The founders "were impressed with this high location and mutually selected the name "Tabor" after the Biblical name of <span class="loc">Mount Tabor</span>, a mountain near <span class="loc">Nazareth</span>, the town of Jesus' childhood." In the 1850s the abolitionist <span class="per">John Brown</span> kept a store of weapons in Tabor, and met here with other supporters to plan his raids in <span class="per">Kansas</span> and <span class="per">Virginia</span>, including the Raid on Harpers Ferry. The town was the home of many abolitionists, including <span class="per">John Todd</span>, a 'conductor' on the Underground Railroad and co-founder of Tabor College. Tabor College was located in the city from <span class="date">1853</span> to <span class="date">1927</span> before it closed its doors for financial reasons. The college's buildings housed German P.O.W.s during World War II. The only building remaining from the college has <span class="date">now</span> been subdivided into apartments.</p><br><br>
