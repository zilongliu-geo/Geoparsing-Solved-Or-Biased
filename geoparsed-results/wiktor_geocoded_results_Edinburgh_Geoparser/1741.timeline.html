  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lafayette</span> (formerly, <span class="loc">La Fayette</span>) is a city in Contra <span class="loc">Costa County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of <span class="date">2011</span>, the city's population was estimated to be 24,285. <span class="date">Today</span> <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> is known for its wealthy inhabitants and pastoral rolling hills. The town is also known for excellent schools within the highly ranked <span class="org">Acalanes School District</span>. In <span class="date">2012</span>, estimated median household income in <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> was over 150,000 dollars, more than double the statewide average and nearly triple the national average. Before the colonization of the region by <span class="loc">Spain</span>, <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> and its vicinity were inhabited by the Saclan tribe of the indigenous Bay Miwok. Ohlone also populated some of the areas along <span class="loc">Lafayette Creek</span>. The indigenous inhabitants' first contact with Europeans was in the late 18th century with the founding of Catholic missions in the region. These initial contacts developed into conflict, with <span class="date">years</span> of armed struggle, including a battle on what is currently Lafayette soil in <span class="date">1797</span> between the Saclan and the Spanish, and eventually resulting in the subjugation of the native population. Most of what is currently <span class="loc">Lafayette</span> was given as a Mexican land grant, Rancho Acalanes to Candelario Valencia in <span class="date">1834</span>. The name Acalanes seems to have come from the name of a native village in the area, Ahala-n.</p><br><br>
