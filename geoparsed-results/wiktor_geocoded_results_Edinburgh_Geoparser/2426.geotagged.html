It is the geographic center of <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>. In 1999, this town was damaged by the 921 earthquake. The damage was especially severe in <span class="loc">Taomi</span> Village a small rural village located within Puli Township. 10 years on, the village has since re-invented itself to be the pride of <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>'s eco-tourism industry. Especially after the opening of the Paper Dome, now a major attraction in Puli Township, <span class="loc">Taomi</span> Village was transformed from a sleepy agricultural village to one that is busting with activities related to community redevelopment and eco-tourism. Since then, <span class="loc">Taomi</span> Village has seen vibrancy unprecedented since its glory days in the 1970s as an agricultural hub. There is a nationally owned brewery in the township. One of the main economic activities in <span class="loc">Puli</span> is tourism. It is located in the mountainous center of <span class="loc">Taiwan</span>, and many tourist destination spots are nearby. The nearest train station that serves Puli Township is the <span class="loc">Checheng</span> Station in Shuili Township.</p>
