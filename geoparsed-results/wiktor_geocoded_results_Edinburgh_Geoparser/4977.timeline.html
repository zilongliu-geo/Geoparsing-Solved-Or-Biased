  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Hempstead</span> is one of the three towns in <span class="loc">Nassau County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, occupying the southwest part of the county. Twenty-two incorporated villages are completely or partially in the town. <span class="loc">Hempstead</span>'s combined population was 759,757 at the <span class="date">2010</span> Census, the majority of the population of the county and by far the most of any town in <span class="loc">New York</span>. Also, a village named <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> is within the Town. If the town were to be incorporated as a city, it would be the second-largest city in <span class="loc">New York</span> behind New <span class="loc">York City</span> and ahead of Buffalo. It would be the 16th-largest city in the country, between <span class="loc">Columbus</span>, <span class="loc">Ohio</span> and <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span>, <span class="loc">Texas</span>. The town's population density is greater than that of <span class="loc">Columbus</span> and <span class="loc">Fort Worth</span>. <span class="org">Part of Hofstra University</span>'s north campus is located in <span class="loc">Hempstead</span>. The town was first settled around <span class="date">1644</span> following the establishment of a treaty between English colonists, John <span class="per">Carman</span> and <span class="per">Robert</span> <span class="loc">Fordham</span>, and the Lenape Indians in <span class="date">1643</span>. Although the settlers were from the English colony of <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, a patent was issued by <span class="loc">New Amsterdam</span> after the settlers had purchased land from the local natives. This transaction is depicted in a mural in the <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> Village Hall, reproduced from a poster commemorating the 300th anniversary of <span class="loc">Hempstead</span> Village.</p><br><br>
