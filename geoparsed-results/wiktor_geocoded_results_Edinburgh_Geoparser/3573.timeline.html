  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Naples</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Cumberland County</span>, <span class="loc">Maine</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, <span class="loc">Maine metropolitan</span> statistical area. The population was 3,872 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census, and it is home to part of <span class="loc">Sebago Lake</span> State Park. <span class="loc">Naples</span> is a resort area. The area was settled in <span class="date">1790</span>. Farming was limited by the soil, which consisted of gravelly loam, its surface strewn with glacial erratic boulders. The uplands, however, provided good grazing for livestock, and hay became the principal crop. Named for <span class="loc">Naples</span>, <span class="loc">Italy</span>, the town was incorporated on <span class="date">March 4, 1834</span>, from parts of <span class="loc">Otisfield</span>, <span class="loc">Harrison</span>, <span class="loc">Raymond</span> and <span class="loc">Bridgton</span>. Between <span class="date">1845</span> and <span class="date">1856</span>, it annexed more land from <span class="loc">Sebago</span>, <span class="loc">Otisfield</span> and <span class="loc">Bridgton</span>. The <span class="loc">Songo Lock</span>, completed <span class="date">two years</span> before town incorporation, linked <span class="loc">Long Lake</span> and Brandy Pond with <span class="loc">Sebago Lake</span>, allowing passage of boats from <span class="loc">Harrison</span> to <span class="loc">Portland</span> through the <span class="loc">Cumberland</span> and <span class="loc">Oxford Canal</span> in <span class="loc">Standish</span>. A canning factory and cooperage were established at <span class="loc">Naples</span> village. The community also produced carriages, men's and boy's clothing, boots and shoes.</p><br><br>
