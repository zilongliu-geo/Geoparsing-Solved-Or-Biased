<p>Nurturing South L.A., one market at a time.

Student Britanni Marie Dighero, left, youth coordinator Sharlene Gozalians and student Jessica Orellana check ingredients of food sold at Coronado Meat Market and Bakery on <span class="loc">Avalon Boulevard</span> in <span class="loc">Los Angeles</span>. Britanni Marie Dighero stood in an aisle of the Coronado Meat Market and Bakery in <span class="loc">South Los Angeles</span>, reading the ingredient list on a package of her favorite fudge cookies into a video camera. She occasionally stumbled over phrases like "propylene glycol mono" and "diesters of fats and fatty acids." "I never read this before, and I'm really sad right now," said Britanni, a high school senior. "If you can't read it, don't eat it," added another student, Jessica Orellana. The spot they were taping, called "Do You Mind Reading What You're Eating? ," will be included on a website the students are developing as part of a broader effort to fight childhood obesity and related diseases, including diabetes. They are working in neighborhoods where a third of the children are overweight and about half are not physically fit -- and where a scarcity of supermarkets is a long-standing source of community ire.</p>
