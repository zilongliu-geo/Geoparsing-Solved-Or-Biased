  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Marietta</span> is located in central <span class="loc">Cobb County</span>, <span class="loc">Georgia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, and is the county's seat and largest city. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the city had a total population of 56,579. The <span class="date">2013</span> estimate is 59,089, making it one of the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> metropolitan area's largest suburbs. <span class="loc">Marietta</span> is the fourth largest of the principal cities (by population) of the <span class="loc">Atlanta</span> metropolitan statistical area. Homes were built by early settlers near the Cherokee town of <span class="loc">Big Shanty</span> (<span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Kennesaw</span>) prior to <span class="date">1824</span>. The first plat was laid out in <span class="date">1833</span>. Like most towns, <span class="loc">Marietta</span> had a square in the center with a courthouse. The <span class="org">Georgia General Assembly</span> legally recognized the community on <span class="date">December 19, 1834</span>. Built in <span class="date">1838</span>, <span class="org">Oakton House</span> is the oldest continuously occupied residence in <span class="loc">Marietta</span>. The original barn, milk house, smokehouse, and wellhouse remain on the property. The spectacular gardens contain the boxwood parterre from the 1870s. <span class="loc">Oakton</span> served as <span class="per">Major General Loring</span>'s headquarters during the Battle of <span class="loc">Kennesaw Mountain</span> in <span class="date">1864</span>. <span class="loc">Marietta</span> was initially selected as the hub for the new <span class="per">Western</span> and <span class="per">Atlantic</span> Railroad, and business boomed. By <span class="date">1838</span>, roadbed and trestles had been built north of the city. However, in <span class="date">1840</span>, political wrangling stopped construction for a time. In <span class="date">1842</span>, the railroad's new management decided to move the hub from <span class="loc">Marietta</span> to an area that would become <span class="loc">Atlanta</span>. Nonetheless, in <span class="date">1850</span>, when the railroad began operation, <span class="loc">Marietta</span> shared in the resulting prosperity.</p><br><br>
