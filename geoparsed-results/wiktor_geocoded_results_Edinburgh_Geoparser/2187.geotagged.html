<p>Stockton is a city in <span class="loc">Cedar County</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,819 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Cedar County</span>. Stockton was platted in 1846. It was originally named <span class="loc">Lancaster</span>, but was renamed <span class="loc">Fremont</span> in 1847 in honor of John C. Fr√©mont. In 1857 it was renamed again in honor of Robert F. Stockton. According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.14 square miles (5.54 km2), of which, 2.10 square miles (5.44 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) is water. The town and lake are located in the rural foothills of the <span class="loc">Ozarks</span> in Southern <span class="loc">Missouri</span>, just 45 minutes north of the "<span class="loc">Queen City</span> of the <span class="loc">Ozarks</span>", <span class="loc">Springfield</span>. <span class="loc">South Missouri</span> and the town of Stockton are often referred to culturally and geographically by many as "Where the South Begins" because of its laid back southern lifestyle that culturally and geographically seems to have more in common with (<span class="loc">Oklahoma</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, Virginia, and <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>) than it does the rest of <span class="loc">Missouri</span> which carries a more industrial cornbelt feel that is found in the true <span class="loc">Midwest</span>. The town is surrounded by rolling hills, rocky terrain, winding rivers, pristine lakes, cattle ranches, and heavily forested woods. Stockton's original settlers came into the area from the coastal Southeast and Deep South regions of the country. This history gives the town and region its own unique flair in fulfilling their role in the extreme cultural and geographical diversity of the "Show-Me-State".</p>
