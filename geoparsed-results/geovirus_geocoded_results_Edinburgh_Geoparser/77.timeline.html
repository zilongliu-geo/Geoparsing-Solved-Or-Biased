  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>A man about to be indicted by the United States Department of <span class="per">Justice</span> died <span class="date">Tuesday</span>. His lawyer has called the death a suicide. <span class="per">Bruce Edwards</span> <span class="per">Ivins</span>, 62, was taken to <span class="org">Frederick Memorial Hospital</span> in Frederick, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, where he died of an overdose of Tylenol and codeine, the Los Angeles Times reported <span class="date">Friday</span>. <span class="per">Ivins</span>, who worked at the biodefense laboratories in Fort <span class="loc">Detrick</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span> for <span class="date">18 years</span>, was about to be charged by the <span class="per">Justice</span> Department in connection with the <span class="date">2001</span> anthrax attacks, which killed five people and infected 17 others. Ivin's lawyer, <span class="per">Paul Kemp</span>, insisted that his client had no role in the attacks, which targeted politicians in <span class="loc">Washington</span> <span class="loc">DC</span>, and members of the media in New <span class="loc">York City</span> and <span class="loc">Florida</span>. "For <span class="date">six years</span>, <span class="per">Dr. Ivins</span> fully cooperated with that investigation, assisting the government in every way that was asked of him," <span class="per">Mr. Kemp</span> told <span class="org">the New York Times</span>. "The relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people, as has already been seen in this investigation. In <span class="per">Dr. Ivins</span>’ case, it led to his untimely death." “Everybody is jumping to the conclusion that because this guy committed suicide, he must be the anthrax killer,” <span class="per">Mr. Clawson</span> told <span class="org">the New York Times</span>. “That is a lousy premise. The pressure of these F.B.I. investigations on individuals is phenomenal, and it is quite likely that this guy cracked under that pressure but had nothing to do with the killings.” <span class="org">The New York Times</span> reports that <span class="per">Ivins</span> had been undergoing psychiatric treatment within <span class="date">the last month</span> and had a restraining order placed on him by a woman he was allegedly stalking and threatening. According to National Public Radio (NPR), mental health professional <span class="per">Jean C. Duley</span> requested that a <span class="loc">Frederick County</span> court issue a "peace order", a type of restraining order, against <span class="per">Ivins</span> in <span class="date">July</span>. <span class="per">Duley</span> submitted documents to the court which show a history of "homicidal actions, threats and plans."</p><br><br>
