<p>Alma is a Statutory Town located in <span class="loc">Park County</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The town population was 270 at the 2010 <span class="loc">United States</span> Census. At an elevation of approximately 10,578 feet (3,224 m), it is the highest incorporated municipality in the <span class="loc">United States</span> with permanent residents. Alma, which is a town, did not take the title as highest incorporated city from <span class="loc">Leadville</span>, <span class="loc">Colorado</span>, as is commonly believed. <span class="loc">Leadville</span> is still the highest incorporated city in <span class="loc">North America</span>. Using administrative boundaries as a measure, not settled areas, in 2006 Winter Park, <span class="loc">Colorado</span> became the highest incorporated town due to its annexation of a ski area. Alma, however, has a contiguous residential area (on Mountain View Drive) extending to 11,680 feet (3,560 m) above sea level, while any such area in or near Winter Park reaches only 9,550 feet (2,910 m), <span class="loc">Leadville</span> 10,360 feet (3,160 m). The town was named by a merchant named Mr. James, after his wife. Alma is located at 39°17′03″N 106°03′48″W, along State Highway 9.</p>
