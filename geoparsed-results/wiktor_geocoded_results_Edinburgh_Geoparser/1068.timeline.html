  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Madang</span> (old German name: Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen) is the capital of <span class="loc">Madang Province</span> and is a town with a population of 27,420 (in <span class="date">2005</span>) on the north coast of <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span>. It was first settled by the Germans in the 19th century. <span class="loc">Madang</span> is the home of Divine Word <span class="org">University</span>. The <span class="org">University</span> accepts local and international students. Russian biologist <span class="per">Nicholai Miklukho-Maklai</span> was probably the first European to visit the area. In <span class="date">1871</span> he stayed at <span class="loc">Astrolabe Bay</span> just south of present-day <span class="loc">Madang</span> for <span class="date">15 months</span>. He had a good relationship with the local communities before leaving, suffering from malaria. In <span class="date">1884</span> the German New Guinea Company arrived and tried to establish a base at various locations including at present day <span class="loc">Madang</span> but were continually beaten by malaria. They eventually moved to <span class="loc">Rabaul</span>. The Japanese invaded and captured <span class="loc">Madang</span> without a fight during World War II in <span class="date">1942</span>. In <span class="date">September 1943</span>, Australian forces launched a sustained campaign to retake the <span class="loc">Finisterre Range</span> and <span class="loc">Madang</span>. The town was captured on <span class="date">April 24, 1944</span>. During the occupation and fighting the town was virtually destroyed and had to be rebuilt afterwards.</p><br><br>
