On the other side of the A174, is the village of <span class="loc">Lazenby</span>. The parish church is dedicated to St <span class="loc">Cuthbert</span>. <span class="loc">Wilton Castle</span> was sold to ICI in the 1940s. <span class="loc">Wilton Castle</span> is an early 19th-century mansion house, built on the site of a medieval castle, now converted into residential apartments. It is a Grade II listed building. The Bulmer family owned the manor of <span class="loc">Wilton</span> in the 13th century and were granted a licence to fortify their manor house in 1210. In 1331 Ralph Bulmer was granted permission to build a castle on his manor. The estate was confiscated by the Crown following the attainder and execution of Sir John and Lady Bulmer for high treason arising out of their part in the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536. The manor was restored to their son but was lost again, by sequestration in 1644, following Sir William Bulmers opposition to Parliament during the English Civil War. It was again later restored but the castle had been sleighted by Parliamentary forces and made uninhabitable.</p>
