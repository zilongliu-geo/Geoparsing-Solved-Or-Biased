<p>Durango ( duˈɾaŋɡo ), officially Free and Sovereign State of Durango (Spanish: Estado Libre y Soberano de Durango) ( Tepehuan: Korian) (Nahuatl: Tepēhuahcān), is one of the 31 states which, with the Federal District, compose the 32 Federal Entities of <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. The state is located in Northwest <span class="loc">Mexico</span>. With a population of 1,632,934, it has <span class="loc">Mexico</span>'s second-lowest population density, after <span class="loc">Baja California Sur</span>. The city of <span class="loc">Victoria de Durango</span> is the state's capital, named after the first president of <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, <span class="loc">Guadalupe Victoria</span>. Durango, along with the states of Chihuahua, <span class="loc">Sonora</span> and <span class="loc">Sinaloa</span>, formed the historical and geographical unity of Northern <span class="loc">Mexico</span>, for what was the majority of the last millennium; it was not until the territories were reorganized after the independence struggle that they emerged as independent entities. This broad area represents the natural corridor that the <span class="loc">Sierra Madre Occidental</span> offered to the <span class="loc">Toltec</span> and Nahuatlaca tribes, both whom took advantage of the large accidental stone conformations to survive in the wilderness of the territory. The new formations formed as the only security for the tribes that moved among Northern <span class="loc">Mexico</span> and the Valley of <span class="loc">Anahuac</span>, eventually becoming a home-state for these tribes who then began to form small communities, united by language and region. The Tepehuános, Huichol, Cora, <span class="loc">Tarahumara</span> incorporated perfectly distinct nations, each with evident sedentary purposes, and a strong family structure, all whilst setting aside the bellicose attitude of the Chichimec tribe of the center of the then-current Republic. Sedentary life began in Durango around 500 B.C. in response to population growth. The exceptions were the Acaxee, Humas, and Xiximes who were constantly at war but always on the look-out for final settlements in the region of the <span class="loc">Quebradas</span>.</p>
