<p>Stampede Kills 4 At Discotheque. Four people died in a stampede at a discotheque in a small town outside <span class="loc">Yekaterinburg</span> when word spread that it was offering limited free entry Saturday night, a local police spokesman said Sunday. About 200 people flocked to the discotheque in the Urals town of Pervouralsk after it announced that admission would be free for the first 30 minutes after it opened its doors, spokesman Valery Gorelykh said. Three 16-year-old schoolgirls and a 30-year-old man died in the crush to get to the door, one person was rushed to hospital and seven were treated by paramedics at the scene, he said. The discotheque has a capacity of 400 people, he said. Police have opened an investigation. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.</p>
