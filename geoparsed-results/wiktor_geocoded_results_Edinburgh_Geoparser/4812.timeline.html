  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Middleton</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">Montgomery County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Originally located in <span class="loc">Carroll County</span>, <span class="loc">Middleton</span> was one of its earliest settlements. Once a thriving commercial and educational center, little remains of the original settlement but a cemetery. The first non-Native to settle at this site was Irelton <span class="per">C. DeVane</span>, who in <span class="date">1790</span> built a small log store used for trading with the Native people and with the occasional traveler. Other settlers included <span class="per">William Pace</span> and his wife, who came from <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> in the 1820s. Mail was sent from the community by stagecoach as early as <span class="date">1824</span>. Following the Treaty of Dancing <span class="loc">Rabbit Creek</span> in <span class="date">1830</span>, and the subsequent removal of the Native Americans from the area, many new settlers began to arrive. The "Little Log Store", located at the junction of the <span class="loc">Carrollton</span> and Shongalo roads, became a well-known trading post. The town was originally incorporated in <span class="date">1837</span> as "Irwin", but was changed to <span class="loc">Middleton</span> in <span class="date">1840</span>. Unofficial names included "Oxford" and "<span class="loc">Bowling Green</span>". Several businesses opened during the 1830s, included two general merchandise stores, two doctors offices, a tavern, a furniture maker, a shoe factory, a large store called "The Big Store", a tailor, and a clock shop. <span class="loc">Middleton</span>'s businesses were located around a town square, and the town had Baptist, Methodist, <span class="org">Presbyterian and Christian</span> churches.</p><br><br>
