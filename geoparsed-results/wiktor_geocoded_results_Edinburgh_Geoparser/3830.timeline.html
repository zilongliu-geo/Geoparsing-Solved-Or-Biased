  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Wola</span> (Polish pronunciation: [ˈvɔla]) is a district in <span class="loc">western Warsaw</span>, <span class="loc">Poland</span>, formerly the village of <span class="loc">Wielka Wola</span>, incorporated into <span class="loc">Warsaw</span> in <span class="date">1916</span>. An industrial area with traditions reaching back to the early 19th century, it is slowly changing into an office and residential district. Several museums are located in <span class="loc">Wola</span>. First mentioned in the 14th century, it became the site of the elections, from <span class="date">1573</span> to <span class="date">1764</span>, of Polish kings by the szlachta (nobility) of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The <span class="loc">Wola district</span> later became famous for the Polish Army's defence of <span class="loc">Warsaw</span> in <span class="date">1794</span> during the Kościuszko Uprising and in <span class="date">1831</span> during the <span class="date">November</span> Uprising, when <span class="per">Józef Sowiński</span> and <span class="per">Józef Bem</span> defended the city against tsarist forces. During the Warsaw Uprising (August–October <span class="date">1944</span>), fierce battles raged in <span class="loc">Wola</span>. Around <span class="date">August 8</span>, <span class="loc">Wola</span> was the scene of the largest single massacre in <span class="loc">Poland</span> of 40,000 to 50,000 civilians. The area was held by Polish fighters belonging to the Armia Krajowa. <span class="loc">Wola</span> is divided into the neighbourhoods (osiedle) of <span class="loc">Czyste</span>, Koło, Mirów, Młynów, Nowolipki, <span class="loc">Odolany</span>, Powązki and Ulrychów neighbourhoods, which in many cases correspond to old villages or settlements.</p><br><br>
