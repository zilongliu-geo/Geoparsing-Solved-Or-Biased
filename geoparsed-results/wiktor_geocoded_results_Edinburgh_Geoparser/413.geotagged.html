By the 1870s, the town was more frequently being called "<span class="loc">Salem</span>" than "<span class="loc">New Salem</span>", as the separation of <span class="loc">West Virginia</span> from Virginia in 1863 had diminished the need to distinguish it from the town named <span class="loc">Salem</span> near <span class="loc">Roanoke</span>. The US Postal Service made the change official in 1884.</p>
