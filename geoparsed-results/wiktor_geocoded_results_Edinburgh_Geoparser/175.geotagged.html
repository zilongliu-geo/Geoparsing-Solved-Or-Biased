<p>The Municipality of <span class="loc">Rosario</span> (also referred to as Salinas) is a first class urban municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Cavite</span>, <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 92,253 people in an area of 5.6 square kilometers, making it the most densely populated city/municipality in <span class="loc">Cavite</span> at 16,473 per km2. It is accessible by land and water transportation. With the continuous expansion of <span class="loc">Metro Manila</span>, the municipality is now included in Manila conurbation which reaches <span class="loc">Lipa City</span> in its southernmost part. On October 22, 1845, Spanish Governor General Narciso Claveria promulgated a Decree for the establishment of a new town comprising Salinas-Leiton and <span class="loc">Tierra Alta</span> of <span class="loc">San Francisco</span> de <span class="loc">Malabon</span>, what is now the town of Gen. Trias. On October 27, Don Juan Arlegui, Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Manila informed the Politico-Military Governor of <span class="loc">Cavite</span> Don Miguel Roca, that he was designated by the Governor-General to look for a person of unquestionable integrity who will be entrusted with the money for the construction of the church building. On November 3, 1845, presbyter Don Mamerto <span class="loc">Ner</span>, who was at that time one of the priests of the Curia of Manila, was appointed parish priest and served until December 1866.</p>
