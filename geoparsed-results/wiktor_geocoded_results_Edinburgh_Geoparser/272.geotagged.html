The city population was 26,091 at the 2010 census, making it the third largest city in the state. <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> is the principal city of the Aberdeen Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Brown and Edmunds counties and has a population of 40,602 in 2010. <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> is the home of Northern State University and Presentation College. Before <span class="loc">Aberdeen</span> or <span class="loc">Brown County</span> was inhabited by European settlers, it was inhabited by the Sioux Indians from approximately 1700 to 1879. Europeans entered the region for business, founding fur trading posts during the 1820s; these trading posts operated until the mid-1830s. The first "settlers" of this region were the Arikara Indians, but they would later be joined by others. The first group of Euro-American settlers to reach the area that is now <span class="loc">Brown County</span> was a party of four people, three horses, two mules, fifteen cattle, and two wagons. This group of settlers was later joined by another group the following spring, and eventually more settlers migrated toward this general area, currently known as <span class="loc">Columbia</span>, <span class="loc">South Dakota</span>. This town was established on June 15, 1879. The town was settled in 1880, and incorporated in 1882.</p>
