  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">El Salvador</span> is a mining town in the commune of <span class="loc">Diego de Almagro</span>, <span class="loc">Chañaral Province</span>, <span class="loc">Atacama Region</span>, <span class="loc">Chile</span>. Located at an elevation of more than 2,400 meters in the foothills of the <span class="loc">Andes</span> and in the middle of the <span class="loc">Atacama Desert</span>, it has a population of approximately 7,000 inhabitants. At its peak, <span class="loc">El Salvador</span> once had a population of 24,000 inhabitants. <span class="loc">El Salvador</span>'s economy is entirely based on copper mining. The Atacameños extracted copper from this area for <span class="date">more than a thousand years</span>. Nevertheless, it was American explorations in <span class="date">the 1950s</span> that revealed the presence of ore that could be exploited in an industrial scale. Anaconda Copper Mining Company was concerned about declining reserves in its Potrerillos mine and it sent prospectors in search of a new Chilean ore body in <span class="date">1951</span>. Working under the auspices Anaconda's <span class="loc">Andes</span> Mining subsidiary, the mineralization was discovered in <span class="date">1954</span> and mapped in <span class="date">1955</span>. As a remote discovery, Anaconda had to build <span class="loc">El Salvador</span> as a self-contained and self-sustaining town. It was complete with housing, schools, stores, water and electrical plants and a railway. The mine opened in <span class="date">1959</span>. The architect in charge of designing the city was <span class="per">Raymond Olson</span>, who worked at the Anaconda headquarters in New <span class="loc">York City</span>.</p><br><br>
