  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dakar</span> (English pronunciation: /dɑːˈkɑːr, ˈdækər/; French: [da.kaʁ]) is the capital and largest <span class="loc">city of Senegal</span>. It is located on the Cap-Vert Peninsula on the Atlantic coast and is the westernmost city in the <span class="loc">Old World</span> and on the African mainland. Its position, on the western edge of <span class="loc">Africa</span>, is an advantageous departure point for trans-Atlantic and European trade; this fact aided its growth into a major regional port. According to <span class="date">31 December 2005</span> official estimates, the <span class="loc">city of Dakar</span> proper has a population of 1,030,594, whereas the population of the <span class="loc">Dakar</span> metropolitan area is estimated at 2.45 million people. <span class="loc">Dakar</span> is a major administrative center, home to the <span class="org">Senegal National Assembly</span> and the Presidential Palace. The Cap-Vert peninsula was settled, no later than the 15th century, by the Lebou people, an aquacultural ethnic group related to the neighboring <span class="per">Wolof</span> and <span class="per">Sereer</span>. The original villages: <span class="loc">Ouakam</span>, <span class="loc">Ngor</span>, <span class="loc">Yoff</span> and <span class="loc">Hann</span>, still constitute distinctively Lebou neighborhoods of the city <span class="date">today</span>. In <span class="date">1444</span>, the Portuguese reached the Bay of <span class="loc">Dakar</span>, initially as slave-raiders, but were repulsed by the natives on the shores. Peaceful contact was finally opened in <span class="date">1456</span> by <span class="per">Diogo Gomes</span>, and the bay was subsequently referred to as the "<span class="per">Angra de Bezeguiche</span>" (after the name of the local ruler). The bay of "<span class="per">Bezeguiche</span>" would serve as a critical stop for the Portuguese <span class="loc">India</span> Armadas of the early 16th century, where large fleets would routinely put in, both on their outward and return journeys from <span class="loc">India</span>, to repair, collect fresh water from the rivulets and wells along the Cap-Vert shore and trade for provisions with the local people for their remaining voyage. (It was famously during one of these stops, in <span class="date">1501</span>, where the Florentine navigator <span class="per">Amerigo Vespucci</span> began to construct his "<span class="loc">New World</span>" hypothesis about <span class="loc">America</span>.)</p><br><br>
