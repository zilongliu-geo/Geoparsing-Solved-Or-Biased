<p>Salmonella outbreak spreading in <span class="loc">Iowa</span>; experts advise caution. An outbreak of confirmed cases of salmonella has made its way to <span class="loc">Iowa</span>, and the numbers are alarming. Salmonella cases in <span class="loc">Iowa</span> are up to 27, this bringing the outbreak number in the region to 121. These figures came as health officials in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> and <span class="loc">Iowa</span> have confirmed 45 more cases of salmonella linked to alfalfa sprouts. The outbreak that’s sickened people in four Midwest states has been tied to SunSprout Enterprises’ sprouts that were distributed to grocery stores and restaurants.
