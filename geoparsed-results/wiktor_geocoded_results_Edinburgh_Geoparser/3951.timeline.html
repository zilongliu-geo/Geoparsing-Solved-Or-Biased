  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Bellevue</span> (French for "beautiful view") is a city in <span class="loc">Sarpy County</span>, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 50,137 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Eight miles <span class="loc">south of Omaha</span>, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is part of the Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area. Originally settled in the 1830s, <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> was incorporated in <span class="date">1855</span> and is the oldest continuous town in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. The <span class="loc">Nebraska</span> State Legislature has credited the town as being the second oldest settlement in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. It was once the seat of government in <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is located at an elevation of <span class="date">1159</span>  ft (353 m). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 16.02 square miles (41.49 km2), of which, 15.85 square miles (41.05 km2) is land and 0.17 square miles (0.44 km2) is water. It is bounded on the east by the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River. The <span class="loc">Sarpy County</span> Courthouse is located in nearby Papillion, <span class="loc">Nebraska</span>. Settlement of what became <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> began when a fur trading post was built in <span class="date">1822</span> by <span class="per">Joshua Pilcher</span>, then president of the <span class="org">Missouri Fur Company</span> based in <span class="per">St. Louis</span>. The post was later known as <span class="org">Fontenelle's Post</span> after being run by <span class="per">Lucien Fontenelle</span>, a fur trader who purchased it in <span class="date">1828</span> to represent the American Fur Company. The Post served as a central trading point with local <span class="loc">Omaha</span>, <span class="loc">Otoe</span>, <span class="loc">Missouri</span> and <span class="loc">Pawnee</span> tribes. Early French Canadian trappers named the area <span class="loc">Belle Vue</span> because of the beauty of the view from the bluffs overlooking the <span class="loc">Missouri</span> River.</p><br><br>
