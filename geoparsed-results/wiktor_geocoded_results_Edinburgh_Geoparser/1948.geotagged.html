<p><span class="loc">Oxford</span> is a waterfront town and former colonial port in <span class="loc">Talbot County</span>, <span class="loc">Maryland</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 651 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Oxford</span> is one of the oldest towns in <span class="loc">Maryland</span>. While <span class="loc">Oxford</span> officially marks the year 1683 as its founding because in that year it was first named by the Maryland General Assembly as a seaport, the town began between 1666 and 1668 when 30 acres (120,000 m2) were laid out as a town called <span class="loc">Oxford</span> by William Stephens, Jr.. By 1669 one of the first houses was built for Innkeeper Francis Armstrong (see <span class="loc">Talbot County</span> Land Records, A 1, f. 10/11). <span class="loc">Oxford</span> first appears on a map completed in 1670, and published in 1671. In 1694, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> and a new town called Anne Arundel (now <span class="loc">Annapolis</span>) were selected as the only ports of entry for the entire <span class="loc">Maryland province</span>. Until the American Revolution, <span class="loc">Oxford</span> enjoyed prominence as an international shipping center surrounded by wealthy tobacco plantations. Early inhabitants included Robert Morris, Sr., agent for a <span class="loc">Liverpool</span> shipping firm who greatly influenced the town's growth; his son, Robert Morris, Jr., known as "the financier of the Revolution;" Jeremiah Banning, sea captain, war hero, and statesman; The Reverend Thomas Bacon, Anglican clergyman who wrote the first compilation of the laws of <span class="loc">Maryland</span>; Matthew Tilghman, known as the "patriarch of <span class="loc">Maryland</span>" and "father of statehood"; and Colonel Tench Tilghman, aide-de-camp to <span class="loc">George Washington</span> and the man who carried the message of General Cornwallis's surrender to the Continental Congress in <span class="loc">Philadelphia</span>. Tench Tilghman's grave can be found at the <span class="loc">Oxford</span> cemetery. It is overshadowed by the <span class="loc">Tench Tilghman</span> Monument, a stone spire approximately 10 feet tall. The monument is the tallest monument found at the <span class="loc">Oxford</span> cemetery. The cemetery itself was used in the opening sequence of the 1988 feature film, Clara's Heart, starring Whoopi Goldberg and Neil Patrick Harris.</p>
