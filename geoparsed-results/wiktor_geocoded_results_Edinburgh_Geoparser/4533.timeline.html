  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Belton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">eastern Anderson County</span>, <span class="loc">South Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 4,134 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. In <span class="date">1845</span> a group was created to connect the Piedmont region of <span class="loc">South Carolina</span> by rail to the existing rail system which then ran from <span class="loc">Columbia</span> to <span class="loc">Charleston</span>. The expanded rail line ran through what was to become <span class="per">Belton</span>, with a spur line which ran to the nearby town of Anderson. Because of the population explosion that occurred by the time the railroad had been completed in <span class="date">1853</span>, the state incorporated the town in <span class="date">1855</span>, with the boundaries being located within a half mile radius from the new railroad depot. The city was given the name of <span class="per">Belton</span> after the first president of the <span class="loc">Columbia</span> and <span class="loc">Greenville Railroad</span> from <span class="per">Newberry, John</span> <span class="per">Belton O'Neal</span>. The city prospered not only due to the railroad junction, but also because of the area's cotton crop, which led to the establishment of cotton mills. In <span class="date">1908</span>, a municipal water system was established. A 155-foot (47 m) reinforced concrete tower with a 165,000-US-gallon (625 m3) capacity was built. Known as the <span class="per">Belton</span> Standpipe, the tower is still in use <span class="date">today</span>. It was listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span> on <span class="date">November 5, 1987</span>. The standpipe is the inspiration for the yearly <span class="per">Belton</span> Standpipe Festival, first held in <span class="date">1987</span> as a fundraising event.</p><br><br>
