  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Milford</span> is a coastal city in southwestern New <span class="loc">Haven County</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located between <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span> and <span class="loc">New Haven</span>. The population was 52,759 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. The city contains the incorporated <span class="loc">borough of Woodmont</span> and the unincorporated village of <span class="loc">Devon</span>. The land which <span class="date">today</span> comprises <span class="loc">Milford</span>, <span class="loc">Orange</span> and <span class="loc">West Haven</span> was purchased on <span class="date">February 1, 1639</span> from <span class="per">Ansantawae</span>, chief of the local Paugussets (an Algonquian tribe) by English settlers affiliated with the contemporary <span class="loc">New Haven</span> Colony. Originally, the area was known as "Wepawaug", after the small river which runs through the town, and which has given its name to several streets in both <span class="per">Milford</span> and <span class="per">Orange</span>. A grist mill was first built over the <span class="loc">Wepawaug River</span> in <span class="date">1640</span>. During the Revolutionary War the <span class="per">Milford</span> section of the <span class="org">Boston Post Road</span>, a vital route connecting <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> and other major coastal cities, was blockaded by Continental forces, and <span class="loc">Fort Trumbull</span> was constructed to protect the town. The site of the blockade is commemorated by the <span class="per">Liberty Rock</span> monument. By <span class="date">1822</span>, the town had grown large enough that residents in the northern and eastern sections of <span class="per">Milford</span> chartered their own independent course as the town of Orange. During <span class="date">the next century and a half</span>, the remaining section of <span class="per">Milford</span> was known for shipbuilding, farming and oystering, although a small subset of industrial facilities also developed in town. During this time, <span class="per">Milford</span> also became known as a beach resort for residents of <span class="loc">New Haven</span> and <span class="loc">Bridgeport</span>.</p><br><br>
