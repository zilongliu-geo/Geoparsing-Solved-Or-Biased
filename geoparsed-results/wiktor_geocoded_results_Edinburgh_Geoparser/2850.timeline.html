Its history has been tied to traffic on the rivers. Settlement initially occurred on the north side in what in <span class="date">1805</span> was called <span class="loc">Matthews</span> Prairie.

Jeff Thompson</span> robbed the <span class="org">Union Bank of Charleston</span>. <span class="per">Thompson</span>, who handed the cashier a note, gave the cashier an hour to get approval from superiors to give him keys to the vault. After receiving the money, he left a receipt for $57,000 and discovered later that only $56,000 was in the bags.</p><br><br>
