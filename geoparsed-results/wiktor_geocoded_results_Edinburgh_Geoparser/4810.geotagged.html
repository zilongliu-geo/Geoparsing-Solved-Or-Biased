<p>Middleton is a town in <span class="loc">Strafford County</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 1,783 at the 2010 census. Granted by the Masonian Proprietors in 1749, the town was named after Sir Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham, who was in charge of convoy service between <span class="loc">Barbados</span> and the colonies. The land was first settled shortly before the Revolutionary War by settlers from Lee and Rochester. Soon after the War, its population was challenged when a number of Quaker families led by the town auditor, Nicholas Austin, left for the more peaceful setting of Austin, <span class="loc">Quebec</span>. Although the soil is rocky and unsuited for cultivation, cider was made in considerable quantities, and maple syrup to some extent. Middleton was situated on the road between the <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> Seacoast and Wolfeboro, the location of Colonial Governor John Wentworth's summer home, <span class="loc">Kingswood</span>. (Today the road survives as "Governors Road" in northern <span class="loc">Rochester</span> and Milton and continues as "<span class="loc">Kings Highway</span>" through Middleton.) Neglect of the road caused the governor to bill the proprietors for repairs he had to make for safe travel to <span class="loc">Kingswood</span>, built in 1771. Middleton was incorporated on March 4, 1778, and originally included <span class="loc">Brookfield</span>, which was split off in December of 1794.</p>
