<p><span class="loc">Waterford</span> (from Old Norse Veðrafjǫrðr, meaning "ram (wether) fjord"; Irish: Port Láirge, meaning "Lárag's port") is a city in <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. It is in the South-East of <span class="loc">Ireland</span> and is part of the <span class="loc">province of Munster</span>. It is the oldest and the fifth most populous city within <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. It is the eighth most populous city on the island of <span class="loc">Ireland</span>. <span class="loc">Waterford City</span> and County Council is the local government authority for the city. According to the 2011 Irish Census, there are 65,928 in the <span class="loc">Waterford Metropolitan</span> District, however it does not include its suburbs in <span class="loc">County Kilkenny</span> and <span class="loc">County Wexford</span>. There are over 80,000 within a 15km radius of the city centre. With a population of 46,732, <span class="loc">Waterford</span> is the fifth most populous city in the State and the 32nd most populous area of local government. Following the Local Government Reform Act 2014, <span class="loc">Waterford City</span> and County Council is the local government authority for the city. The authority came into operation on 1 June 2014. Prior to this the city had its own local council, <span class="loc">Waterford City</span> Council. The new Council is the result of a merger of <span class="loc">Waterford City</span> Council and Waterford County Council. The Council has 32 representatives (councillors) who are elected from five electoral areas. The city itself forms three of the electoral areas – which when combined form the Metropolitan District of <span class="loc">Waterford</span> – and returns a total of 18 councillors to <span class="loc">Waterford City</span> and County Council. Residents in these areas are restricted to voting for candidates located in their ward for local elections. The office of the Mayor of <span class="loc">Waterford</span> was established in 1377. A mayor is then elected by the councillors from the two electoral areas of the Metropolitan District of <span class="loc">Waterford</span> every year, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual may serve. Mary O'Halloran who was mayor during 2007–2008 was the first woman to hold the post. The current mayor is John Cummins.</p>
