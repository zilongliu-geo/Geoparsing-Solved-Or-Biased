  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p>Kingston is civil parish and small scattered village in the South Hams, <span class="loc">Devon</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. It is three miles south west of <span class="loc">Modbury</span>, and about a mile from the mouth of the <span class="loc">River Erme</span> at Wonwell. See the entry for <span class="loc">Erme Mouth</span>. In <span class="date">2001</span> the population of the parish was 399, reducing to 387 at the <span class="date">2011</span> census. It has a small village hall – the Reading Room – that is used regularly for village events. There are several old houses, including a number of thatched cottages. Nearby is a beach called <span class="loc">Westcombe</span> (wis-com). Kingston is home to one of <span class="loc">Devon</span>'s two volunteer fire stations. It is crewed by locals who operate in the same manner as retained fire service personnel. However, being volunteers, they don't guarantee availability. Kingston Fire station was set up in <span class="date">September 1949</span>, just after the water main was laid. <span class="per">Mervyn Freeman</span> has been in charge since his father, <span class="loc">Viv</span>, retired in <span class="date">1992</span>. The crew attend about 30 calls <span class="date">a year</span>. They currently have a unique vehicle, the <span class="loc">South Ham</span>'s only 4-wheel-drive fire engine, based on a <span class="org">Mercedes</span> 814DA chassis, built at the <span class="loc">Crownhill</span> workshops of the old <span class="loc">Devon</span> fire and rescue service in <span class="date">1998</span> – a far cry from the 15-year-old ex <span class="loc">Cornwall</span> <span class="org">Land Rover</span> it replaced.</p><br><br>
