  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Boston</span> (/ˈbɒstən/) is a town and small port in <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span>, on the east coast of <span class="loc">England</span>. It is the largest town of the wider <span class="loc">Borough of Boston</span> local government district. The borough had a total population of 64,637 at the <span class="date">2011</span> census, whilst the town itself had a population of 35,124 at the <span class="date">2001</span> census. It is due north of <span class="loc">Greenwich</span> on the Prime Meridian. <span class="loc">Boston</span>'s most notable landmark is St Botolph's Church ("The Stump"), said to be the largest parish church in <span class="loc">England</span>, with one of the taller towers in <span class="loc">England</span> visible for miles around from the flat lands of <span class="loc">Lincolnshire</span>. Residents of <span class="loc">Boston</span> are known as Bostonians. Emigrants from <span class="loc">Boston</span> named several other settlements after the town, most notably <span class="loc">Boston</span>, <span class="loc">Massachusetts</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The name "<span class="loc">Boston</span>" is commonly said to be a contraction of "Saint Botolph's town", "stone", or "tun" (Old English for a hamlet or farm). The town's direct link to the saint is probably apocryphal, but the name may have arisen from confusion as to the site of his monastery or owing to his patronage of the parish church.</p><br><br>
