<p><span class="loc">Princeton</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Patoka Township</span>, <span class="loc">Gibson County</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 8,644 at the 2010 census, and it is part of the greater <span class="loc">Evansville</span>, <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, Metropolitan Area. The city is the county seat of and the largest city in <span class="loc">Gibson County</span>. In 1800 the <span class="loc">Indiana</span> Territory was created with <span class="loc">Vincennes</span> (<span class="loc">Knox County</span>) as its capital. The rich farmlands in the southwest of the territory with access to the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span> attracted many pioneers and settlers to the area, one of whom was an Irish immigrant named William Prince. Born in 1772, he immigrated to <span class="loc">America</span> 22 years later. He would become a <span class="loc">Gibson County</span> Commissioner and the namesake for the county seat of <span class="loc">Princeton</span>. The year 1813 saw the move of the territorial capital east from <span class="loc">Vincennes</span> to <span class="loc">Corydon</span> and the creation of <span class="loc">Gibson County</span>. Gibson had previously been part of the vast <span class="loc">Knox County</span> which covered all the land of southwestern <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, bordered by the <span class="loc">Wabash</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Rivers</span>. By early 1814, settlers to this area were asking for a "seat of justice," or county seat. Captain William Prince was one of four commissioners who located the seat at the half-way stand on the <span class="loc">Evansville</span> and <span class="loc">Vincennes</span> stage line. By drawing of lots, commissioners decided to name the town after Captain Prince.</p>
