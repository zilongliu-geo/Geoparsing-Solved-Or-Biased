  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Lawrence</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Nassau County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span> in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> <span class="loc">United States</span> Census, the village population was 6,483. The Village of <span class="per">Lawrence</span> is in the southwest corner of the Town of <span class="loc">Hempstead</span>, adjoining the border with the New <span class="loc">York City</span> <span class="loc">borough of Queens</span> to the west and near the <span class="loc">Atlantic Ocean</span> to the south. <span class="per">Lawrence</span> is one of the "Five Towns", which consists of the villages of <span class="per">Lawrence</span> and <span class="per">Cedarhurst</span>, the hamlets (unincorporated areas) of <span class="loc">Woodmere</span> and <span class="loc">Inwood</span>, and "The <span class="loc">Hewletts</span>", which is made up of the hamlet of <span class="loc">Hewlett</span> together with the villages of <span class="loc">Hewlett Bay Park</span>, <span class="loc">Hewlett Harbor</span> and <span class="loc">Hewlett Neck</span>, along with <span class="loc">Woodsburgh</span>. <span class="per">Old Lawrence</span>, or <span class="per">Back Lawrence</span>, is a part of the Village of <span class="per">Lawrence</span>, comprising many large homes, mansions, beach side villas and former plantations with very large property, a few dating back to the time of the American Revolution. This area, like <span class="loc">Hewlett</span> is unique because its rural affluence is similar in character to the more well known <span class="loc">Gold Coast</span> of the <span class="loc">North Shore</span> instead of being more urbanized like the rest of the <span class="loc">South Shore</span> of <span class="loc">Nassau County</span>. An interesting pre-Revolutionary home on <span class="loc">Long Island</span>, <span class="per">Rock Hall</span>, was home to two prominent families, the <span class="per">Martins</span> and <span class="per">Hewletts</span>, and is <span class="date">now</span> an active museum.</p><br><br>
