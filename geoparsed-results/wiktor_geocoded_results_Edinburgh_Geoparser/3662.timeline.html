  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Fala</span> is a settlement on the <span class="loc">Drava River</span> in northeastern <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. The part of the settlement on the right bank of the river belongs to the Municipality of Ru≈°e. The part on the left bank of the river belongs to the Municipality of Selnica ob Dravi. Traditionally the area was part of <span class="loc">Styria</span>. The municipality is <span class="date">now</span> included in the <span class="loc">Drava</span> statistical region. <span class="loc">Fala</span> was mentioned in written sources in <span class="date">1245</span> as in domo Volmari (and as de <span class="loc">Valle</span> in <span class="date">1279</span>, <span class="loc">Vall</span> and <span class="loc">Valle</span> in <span class="date">1289</span>, and Fall in <span class="date">1495</span>). The name is of unclear origin, although the initial F- indicates a German origin. It could be derived from Old High German falo 'yellowish' (referring to soil or water color) or from valle 'trap' (referring to hunting activity). Derivation from Latin vallis 'valley' is unlikely because the area was not under Romance influence. The <span class="loc">Fala</span> hydroelectric power plant in the settlement was built between <span class="date">1913</span> and <span class="date">1918</span>. As a technological and construction achievement of its time, the <span class="org">Slovenian Ministry of Culture</span> included it in its register of monuments of national importance in <span class="date">2008</span>.</p><br><br>
