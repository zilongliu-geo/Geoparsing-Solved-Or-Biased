<p><span class="loc">Scarborough</span> (/ˈskɑːrbəroʊ/; 2011 Census 625,698) is a district and former municipality within the eastern part of the <span class="loc">city of Toronto</span>, <span class="loc">Ontario</span>, <span class="loc">Canada</span>. <span class="loc">Scarborough</span> is bordered on the south by <span class="loc">Lake Ontario</span>, on the west by Victoria Park Avenue, on the north by Steeles Avenue East, and on the east by the <span class="loc">Rouge River</span> and the <span class="loc">City of Pickering</span>. Over 200 years, <span class="loc">Scarborough</span> grew from a collection of small rural villages to become a large city with a diverse cultural community. It was named after the English town of <span class="loc">Scarborough</span>, <span class="loc">North Yorkshire</span> in 1796 by Elizabeth Simcoe, who was inspired by the <span class="loc">Scarborough</span> Bluffs which reminded her of white cliffs near her home. Originally <span class="loc">Scarborough</span> Township, it became part of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953, and was renamed as a borough in 1967. <span class="loc">Scarborough</span> rapidly developed as a suburb of Old Toronto during the Metro Toronto years and became a city in 1983. <span class="loc">Scarborough</span> was amalgamated into the <span class="loc">city of Toronto</span> in 1998. The area is an administrative district in the new <span class="loc">City of Toronto</span>, and has its own community council composed of <span class="loc">Toronto city</span> councillors. The Scarborough Civic Centre, the former city hall, is still used by the municipal government of <span class="loc">Toronto</span>.</p>
