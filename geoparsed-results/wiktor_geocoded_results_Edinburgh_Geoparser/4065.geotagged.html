<p><span class="loc">Birmingham</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Oakland County</span> of the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Michigan</span> and a suburb of <span class="loc">Detroit</span>. As of the 2010 census, the population was 20,103. The city's downtown attracts shoppers from throughout the Metro Detroit area. The area comprising what is now the <span class="loc">city of Birmingham</span> was part of land ceded by Native American tribes to the <span class="loc">United States</span> government by the 1807 Treaty of <span class="loc">Detroit</span>. However, settlement was delayed first by the War of 1812 and subsequently by an unfavorable report by the Surveyor-General of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, Edward Tiffin, regarding the placement of Military Bounty Lands for veterans of the War of 1812. Tiffin's report claimed that "There would not be an acre out of a hundred, if there would be one out of a thousand that would, in any case, admit cultivation." In 1818, Territorial Governor Lewis Cass led a group of men along the Indian Trail. The governor's party discovered that the swamp was not as extensive as Tiffin had supposed. Not long after Cass issued a more encouraging report about the land, interest quickened in its suitability for settlement.</p>
