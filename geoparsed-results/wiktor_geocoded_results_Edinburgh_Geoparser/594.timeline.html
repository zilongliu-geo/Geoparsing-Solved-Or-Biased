According to the <span class="date">2010</span> census, it has a population of 42,874 people. The town is known as the "<span class="org">Gateway</span> to <span class="loc">Baguio</span>", as the three major highways that give access to the adjacent <span class="loc">city of Baguio</span> are largely traversed in the municipality. Tuba was originally a barrio of the township of <span class="loc">Baguio</span> in <span class="date">the early 1900s</span> under the American Occupation of the <span class="loc">Philippines</span>. It was separated from <span class="loc">Baguio</span> upon the latter's conversion into a chartered city on <span class="date">September 1, 1909</span>, and became part of the township of <span class="loc">Twin Peaks</span> in <span class="loc">Benguet</span>. <span class="loc">Twin Peaks</span> was abolished as a township on <span class="date">December 11, 1911</span> with the issuance of Executive <span class="per">Order</span> No. 77 by American Governor General <span class="per">William Cameron Forbes</span>, creating the township of Tuba. On <span class="date">June 25, 1963</span>, President <span class="per">Diosdado Macapagal</span> issued Executive <span class="per">Order</span> No. 42 and by operation of Section 2 of Republic Act No. 1515, the municipal <span class="loc">District of Tuba</span> was converted into a regular municipality. Tuba is situated in the south-western tip of the Central Cordillera Mountain Range that extends from the north-western tip of <span class="loc">Luzon</span> towards <span class="loc">Pangasinan</span>. South of the municipality lies the <span class="loc">province of Pangasinan</span> and to the west lies the Ilocos rolling hills of the province of <span class="loc">La Union</span>. It is hemmed in by the municipalities of <span class="loc">Sablan</span> and <span class="loc">La Trinidad</span> on the north; the <span class="loc">city of Baguio</span> and the municipality of <span class="loc">Itogon</span> on the east; and the municipalities of <span class="loc">Sison</span> and <span class="loc">San Manuel</span> on the south.</p><br><br>
