  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lake County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 7,832, making it the fifth-least populous county in <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>. <span class="loc">Its county</span> seat is <span class="loc">Tiptonville</span>. It is the state's northwesternmost county, sharing a border with <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> and separated from <span class="loc">Missouri</span> to the west by the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River. <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span> occupies much of the northern part of the county. The history of <span class="loc">Lake County</span> has been largely defined by <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span>, a natural lake created by the New Madrid earthquakes of <span class="date">1811</span> and <span class="date">1812</span>. The county was established by the state legislature in <span class="date">1870</span>. It was originally included in <span class="loc">Obion County</span>, but was created as a separate county due to difficulties its residents had to cross the swampy wetlands around <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span> to reach Obion's county seat. <span class="loc">Tiptonville</span> was designated as <span class="loc">Lake County</span>'s seat of government. In <span class="date">1862</span>, during the Civil War, the Battle of <span class="loc">Island Number Ten</span> took place in the <span class="loc">Mississippi</span> River, just off the shores of what is <span class="date">now</span> <span class="loc">Lake County</span>. In <span class="date">1907</span>, a violent conflict took place in Lake and <span class="loc">Obion counties</span> when a private company, the <span class="loc">West Tennessee Land</span> Company, gained control of <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span> and announced plans to drain it. A band of local renegades, known as the "Night Riders of <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span>," harassed the company's employees, eventually kidnapping and killing one. <span class="per">Governor Malcolm Patterson</span> personally led the <span class="org">Tennessee National Guard</span> into the area, and arrested hundreds of suspected Night Riders. The state gained title to the lake in <span class="date">1914</span>, and the lake was designated as a hunting and fishing reserve by Governor <span class="per">Austin Peay</span> in <span class="date">1925</span>. This was the precedent for the area to be preserved as the modern <span class="loc">Reelfoot Lake</span> State Park.</p><br><br>
