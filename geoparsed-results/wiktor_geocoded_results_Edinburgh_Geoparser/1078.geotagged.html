<p>Franklin is a town in Franklin Township, <span class="loc">Macon County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, within the <span class="loc">Nantahala National Forest</span>. The population was 3,845 as of the 2010 census. It is the county seat of <span class="loc">Macon County</span>. Franklin is an official <span class="loc">Appalachian</span> Trail-friendly destination. The Franklin area is rich in gems and minerals and is known locally as the "Gem Capital of The World." Long before the first European settlers arrived to the mountains of southwestern <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, they were home to the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> Indian Nation. In a valley surrounded by some of the oldest mountains on earth, the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> called the area that is now Franklin, "Nikwasi" or "center of activity". Nikwasi was an ancient and important <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> town. The remains of Nikwasi Mound are still visible in downtown Franklin, marking the location of Nikwasi's townhouse. While the mound was probably built during the earlier Mississippian Culture, it was the spiritual center of the area. A Council House, or Town House, used for councils, religious ceremonies, and general meetings, was located on top the mound, and the ever-burning sacred fire, which the <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> had kept burning since the beginning of their culture, was located there. Thus the mound was a most revered site.</p>
