  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p>Linden is an unincorporated community in Central <span class="loc">Sumter County</span>, <span class="loc">Florida</span>. The zip code is 33597, which is shared by <span class="loc">Webster</span> to the north. Linden is bordered by the <span class="loc">Withlacoochee State Forest</span> to the south, <span class="loc">Tarrytown</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Webster</span> and <span class="loc">Center Hill</span> to the north, and <span class="loc">Mabel</span> to the east. The main road through Linden is State Road 50. The abandoned <span class="org">Orange</span> Belt Railway line spanning from Trilby in <span class="loc">Pasco County</span> to <span class="loc">Sylvan Lake</span> in <span class="loc">Seminole County</span> runs parallel to SR 50 throughout the community. Pavement markings approaching this line still exist on County Road 772. The primary industry within Linden is farming. The only other businesses include a single store operating from a former gas station, an aggregate mine close to <span class="loc">Mabel</span>, three churches, and a cemetery dating back to <span class="date">1842</span>. Linden has a very rich history, dating back to the mid-19th century. Linden was all owned by a family of farmers named <span class="per">Morgan</span>. It went on that way for <span class="date">twenty years</span> until <span class="per">John Morgan</span> sold a large portion of land to unknown buyers. Over 230 acres (0.93 km2) are still owned by the <span class="loc">Morgans</span>. It is the largest land ownership in Linden. Four original <span class="loc">Morgans</span> live on the 230 acres (0.93 km2) that make up that homestead.</p><br><br>
