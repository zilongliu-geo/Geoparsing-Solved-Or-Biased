<p><span class="loc">Norwich</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Windsor County</span>, <span class="loc">Vermont</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 3,414 at the 2010 census. Home to some of the state of <span class="loc">Vermont</span>'s wealthiest residents, the municipality is a commuter town for nearby <span class="loc">Hanover</span>, <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> across the <span class="loc">Connecticut River</span>. The town is part of the Dresden School District, the first interstate school district in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, signed into law by President John F. Kennedy. The boundaries of <span class="loc">Norwich</span> were established on July 4, 1761, when Governor Benning Wentworth of <span class="loc">New Hampshire</span> defined the boundaries of townships in <span class="loc">Vermont</span>. The first settlers reached the area in 1763 and began to clear the wilderness and erect the first hand-hewn log buildings, wintering over for the first time in 1765. Early settlements occurred along the <span class="loc">Ompompanoosuc River</span>. Later, the current village site became settled. The first town meeting occurred in April 1768. The first Congregational church was founded in 1770 and a structure built in 1778. The population grew from 206 in 1771 to 1,158 in 1791 and 2,316 in 1830. The town was named after <span class="loc">Norwich</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span>, the state from which the first settlers originated. In the original charter, the name was spelled "Norwhich", but the additional 'h' was dropped shortly after the town was chartered. Originally pronounced "Norritch" (similar to the English pronunciation of the <span class="loc">city of Norwich</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>), the town name has in more recent times become more commonly pronounced "Nor-wich".</p>
