<p><span class="loc">Boho</span> (pronounced /ˈboʊ/ BOH, from Irish: <span class="loc">Botha</span>, meaning "huts") is a hamlet and a civil parish 11 kilometres (7 mi) covering approximately 12 km × 7 km (7 mi × 4 mi)southwest of <span class="loc">Enniskillen</span> in <span class="loc">County Fermanagh</span>, <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>. This area contains a high density of historically significant sites stretching from the Neolithic Reyfad Stones, through the Bronze Age/Iron Age (Aghnaglack Tomb) and medieval (High Crosses) to comparatively recent historical buildings such as the Linnett Inn. <span class="loc">Boho parish</span> also has a high biodiversity of flora and fauna due in part to the niches offered by the limestone karst substrata. The three mountains found within the parish; namely Glenkeel, <span class="loc">Knockmore</span> and <span class="loc">Belmore</span> provide a landscape varying from high craggy bluffs, with views of neighbouring counties, to low, flat bogland punctuated by streams and lakes. Below this landscape are two of the three most cave-rich mountains in <span class="loc">Northern Ireland</span>, featuring the deepest cave system in <span class="loc">Ireland</span> at Reyfad Pot, the deepest daylight shaft in <span class="loc">Ireland</span> at Noon's Hole, as well as popular caves for local outdoor adventure centre groups at the Boho Caves and the nearby Pollnagollum Coolarkan.</p>
