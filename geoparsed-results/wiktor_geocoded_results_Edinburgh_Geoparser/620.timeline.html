  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Belmont</span> is a small suburban city in <span class="loc">Gaston County</span>, <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>, located about 15 miles (24 km) west of uptown Charlotte and 9 miles (14 km) east of <span class="loc">Gastonia</span>. The population was 10,076 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. Once known as Garibaldi Station, the name change for <span class="per">Belmont</span> is disputed. Some say it was named for a prominent <span class="loc">New York</span> banker - <span class="per">August Belmont</span>. Others contend the Pope ordered the abbot of the monastery to change the name since he would not tolerate an abbey in a place that bore the Garibaldi name. The abbot could see Crowder's mountain from the property and named the town <span class="per">Belmont</span> - "beautiful mountain". <span class="per">Belmont</span> is home to <span class="per">Belmont</span> Abbey College. <span class="per">Belmont</span> is located at 35°14′40″N 81°2′8″W (35.244496, -81.035650). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.1 square miles (26.2 km2), of which 9.9 square miles (25.7 km2) is land and 0.19 square miles (0.5 km2), or 1.74%, is water. Nestled in the southern <span class="loc">Piedmont</span> region of <span class="loc">North Carolina</span>, the town of <span class="per">Belmont</span> is flanked by two rivers, the <span class="loc">Catawba River</span> and its right tributary, the <span class="loc">South Fork Catawba River</span>. Adjacent to <span class="per">Belmont</span>, the rivers make up two arms of <span class="loc">Lake Wylie</span> and form a peninsula on which the city is situated.</p><br><br>
