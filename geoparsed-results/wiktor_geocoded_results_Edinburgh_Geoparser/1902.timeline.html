  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Lakewood</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Los</span> <span class="loc">Angeles County</span>, <span class="loc">California</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 80,048 at the <span class="date">2010</span> census. It is bordered by Long Beach on the west and south, Bellflower on the north, <span class="loc">Cerritos</span> on the northeast, Cypress on the east, and Hawaiian Gardens on the southeast. Major thoroughfares include <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> (SR 19), Bellflower, and Del Amo <span class="per">Boulevards</span> and <span class="per">Carson</span> and South Streets. The San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605) runs through the city's eastern regions. Sometimes called "an instant city" because of its origins—going from lima bean fields in <span class="date">1950</span> to a well-developed city by <span class="date">1960</span>—Lakewood is a classic example of a post–World War <span class="org">II American</span> suburb. <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> is a planned, post-World War II community. Developers <span class="per">Louis Boyar</span>, <span class="per">Mark Taper</span> and <span class="per">Ben Weingart</span> are credited with "altering forever the map of Southern <span class="loc">California</span>." Begun in <span class="date">late 1949</span>, the completion of the developers' plan in <span class="date">1953</span> helped in the transformation of mass-produced housing from its early phases in <span class="date">the 1930s and 1940s</span> to the reality of <span class="date">the 1950s</span>. The feel of this transformation from the point of view of a resident growing up in <span class="loc">Lakewood</span> was captured by <span class="per">D. J. Waldie</span> in his award-winning memoir, Holy Land: A Suburban Memoir.</p><br><br>
