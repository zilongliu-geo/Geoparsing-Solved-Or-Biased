They contribute to the high proportion of Native Americans among the county population â€” more than ten percent. The county was organized in 1851 from parts of <span class="loc">Haywood</span> and <span class="loc">Macon</span> counties. It was named for Andrew Jackson, President of the <span class="loc">United States</span> from 1829 to 1837. The original county courts were held at the Dan Bryson home in the community of Beta in <span class="loc">Scott Creek</span> township, and moved to Webster the following year. In 1861 parts of Jackson and Henderson counties were combined to form <span class="loc">Transylvania County</span>. In 1871 parts of Jackson and Macon counties were combined to form <span class="loc">Swain County</span>. In 1913 <span class="loc">Sylva</span> became the county seat.</p>
