<p><span class="loc">Ngong</span> is a town near the <span class="loc">Ngong Hills</span> along the Great Rift Valley, located in the southwest of <span class="loc">Nairobi</span>, in southern <span class="loc">Kenya</span>. The word "Ngong" is a Maasai word meaning "knuckles", referring to the 4 hill peaks of the ridge, which stands alone rising from the plain around <span class="loc">Nairobi</span>. The <span class="loc">Ngong Hills</span>, from the eastside slopes, overlook the Nairobi National Park game reserve and, off to the north, the <span class="loc">city of Nairobi</span>. The <span class="loc">Ngong Hills</span>, from the westside slopes, overlook the Great Rift Valley dropping over 4,000 feet below, where nomadic Maasai live. The population of <span class="loc">Ngong</span> is 107,188, and the elevation of Ngong town is 1,961 meters in altitude, but the altitude of the hills is about 2,460 meters above sea level. <span class="loc">Ngong</span> was the central town of <span class="loc">Ngong division</span> while <span class="loc">Kajiado County</span> was a district. During the years of British colonial rule, the area around the <span class="loc">Ngong Hills</span> was a major settler farming region, and many traditional colonial houses are still seen in the area. Today <span class="loc">Ngong</span> and its environs is a well-developed outskirt providing a good residing place for many of Nairobi's workers</p>
