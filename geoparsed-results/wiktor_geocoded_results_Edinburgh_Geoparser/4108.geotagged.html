<p><span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Indiana</span>. As of 2012, the population was 75,283. The county seat is <span class="loc">New Albany</span>. <span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is the county with the second-smallest land area in the entire state. It was formed in the year 1819 from neighboring Clark, and <span class="loc">Harrison counties</span>. <span class="loc">Floyd County</span> is part of the Louisville/<span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">KYâ€“IN Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. <span class="loc">Floyd County</span>, originally the Shawnee Indians hunting ground, was conquered for the <span class="loc">United States</span> by George Rogers Clark during the American Revolutionary War from the British. He was awarded large tracts of land in <span class="loc">Indiana</span>, including almost all of present-day <span class="loc">Floyd County</span>. Clark sold land to the settlers who began arriving as soon as peace returned. In 1818, <span class="loc">New Albany</span> was a large enough to become a county seat and form a new county. <span class="loc">New Albany</span> leaders sent Nathaniel Scribner and John K. Graham to the capital at <span class="loc">Corydon</span> to petition the General Assembly. Legislation was passed on January 2, 1819 by the General Assembly, and the county was established on February 1. The origin of the county's name is debated. According to the State Library, it was named for John Floyd, a leading <span class="loc">Jefferson County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> pioneer and uncle of Davis Floyd. John Floyd was killed in 1783 when his party was attacked by Indians in <span class="loc">Bullitt County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. However, some maintain the county was actually named for Davis Floyd, who was convicted of aiding Aaron Burr in the treason of 1809. Davis Floyd had also been a leading local political figure and was the county's first circuit court judge.</p>
