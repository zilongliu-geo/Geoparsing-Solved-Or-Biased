<p><span class="loc">Retiro</span> is a town and commune in <span class="loc">Chile</span>, located in <span class="loc">Linares Province</span>, in the seventh region of <span class="loc">Maule</span>. <span class="loc">Retiro</span> is located 335 km (208 mi) to the south of Santiago, 27 km (17 mi) to the south of the <span class="loc">city of Linares</span> (the provincial capital), and 15 km to the north of the <span class="loc">city of Parral</span>. The municipality has a surface of 827.1 km2 (319 sq mi) and is bordered by <span class="loc">San Javier</span> and Longaví on the north, by <span class="loc">Parral</span> on the south, by <span class="loc">Cauquenes (Province</span> of <span class="loc">Cauquenes</span>), on the west and by Longaví on the east. The commune was founded officially on December 22, 1891. President Ramón Barros Luco owned a manor house in this area. <span class="loc">Retiro</span> was, therefore, visited frequently by well-known politicians and statesmen of the time, and in general by those that contributed to the decision-making process in the country affairs. The name of "Retiro" (Retirement) was given to the commune on account of being the place of retirement - leisure - of President Barros Luco.</p>
