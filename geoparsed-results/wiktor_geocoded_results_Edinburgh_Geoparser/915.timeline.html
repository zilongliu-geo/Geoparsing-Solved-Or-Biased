  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Hampton</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Carter County</span>, <span class="loc">Tennessee</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Located a few miles southeast of Elizabethton and northeast of <span class="loc">Roan Mountain</span>, <span class="loc">Hampton</span> is surrounded on all sides by the <span class="loc">Unaka Mountains</span>. It is part of the <span class="loc">Johnson City</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the "Tri-Cities" region. <span class="per">Hampton</span> was established in the late 1860s by <span class="per">Elijah Simerly</span>, a state legislator and president of the <span class="loc">East Tennessee</span> and Western <span class="loc">North Carolina Railroad</span>. He named the community for his wife, <span class="per">Mary Hampton</span>. <span class="loc">Simerly</span> built an elaborate, Italianate-style house which still stands at the corner of Main Street and 1st Avenue, and is listed on <span class="org">the National Register of Historic Places</span>. The house is <span class="date">now</span> known as the "Butler Mansion" after a later owner, <span class="per">Ralph Butler</span>. The Laurel Fork Railway served a mill in <span class="per">Hampton</span>. <span class="per">Hampton</span> lies in a broad valley concentrated around the <span class="loc">Doe River</span> and its junction with two of its tributaries, namely the <span class="loc">Little Doe River</span>, which enters the area from the southwest, and Laurel Fork, which enters the area from the east. This valley is surrounded by <span class="loc">Jenkins Mountain</span> on the west, the <span class="loc">Iron Mountains</span> on the north, <span class="loc">Pond Mountain</span> to the east, and <span class="loc">Cedar Mountain</span> to the south. Just southeast of <span class="per">Hampton</span>, the <span class="loc">Doe River</span> emerges from the <span class="loc">Doe River Gorge</span>, a narrow valley between <span class="loc">Cedar Mountain</span> and <span class="loc">Fork Mountain</span>.</p><br><br>
