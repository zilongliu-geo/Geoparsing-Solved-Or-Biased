<p><span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Scott County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. The 2014 population was 31,653 per the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau. It is the 9th-largest city by population in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. It is the seat of its county. It was originally called <span class="loc">Lebanon</span> when founded by Rev. Elijah Craig and was renamed in 1790 in honor of President <span class="loc">George Washington</span>. It is the home of Georgetown College, a private liberal arts college. <span class="loc">Georgetown</span> is part of the Lexington-Fayette, <span class="loc">KY Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. The city's growth began in the mid-1980s, when Toyota built <span class="loc">Toyota Motor Manufacturing</span> <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, its first wholly owned <span class="loc">United States</span> plant, in the city. The plant, which currently builds the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Venza, <span class="loc">Avalon</span>, and Lexus ES automobiles, opened in 1988. It is the largest building in terms of acres covered under one building in the <span class="loc">United States</span>, with over 200 acres (0.8 km2) occupied. The city previously served as the training camp for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals. Native peoples have lived along the banks of <span class="loc">Elkhorn Creek</span> in what is now <span class="loc">Scott County</span> for at least 15,000 years. European exploration can be dated to a June 1774 surveying expedition from <span class="loc">Fincastle County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, led by Colonel John Floyd. For his military service, he was granted a claim of 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) in the area by the state of <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. He named it Royal Spring but did not settle it. John McClellan was the first to settle the area and established McClellan's Station there in 1775, but the compound was abandoned following an Indian attack on December 29, 1776.</p>
