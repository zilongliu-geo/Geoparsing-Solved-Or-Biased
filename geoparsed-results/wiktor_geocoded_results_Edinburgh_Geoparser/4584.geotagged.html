<p>Buy (Russian: Буй) is a town in <span class="loc">Kostroma Oblast</span>, <span class="loc">Russia</span>, which stands on the <span class="loc">Kostroma</span> River. Population: 25,763 (2010 Census); 27,392 (2002 Census); 32,701 (1989 Census). Buy was originally a trading post and protected by a hill fortress of Finno-Ugrian Meri people c. 400–500 CE. Its original Meri name is not known, but in Finnish language it was called either Vuoksensuu or Vieksansuu (lit. Mouth of Vuoksi/Vieksa). It was inhabited by the Finno-Ugrian peoples at least up to the Mongol invasion of <span class="loc">Russia</span> in 1237–1238. During the Mongol threat, some inhabitants of <span class="loc">Kostroma</span> sought refuge in Buy, and it seems that they renamed the place Buy (<span class="loc">Vui</span>, <span class="loc">Bui</span>) instead of using the Finno-Ugrian name which was difficult for them to pronounce, but the origin of the Russian name comes from the old Meri name. Modern Buy was founded in 1536 as a fortified point at the confluence of the <span class="loc">Kostroma</span> and the Vyoksa Rivers. The fortified point was built according to the order of Yelena Glinskaya, the regentess of <span class="loc">Russia</span> at that time and the mother of Ivan the Terrible, to defend the eastern frontiers of the Grand Duchy of <span class="loc">Moscow</span> from the raids by Kazan Tatars and others. However, twenty years after its construction, the fortress lost its military significance, as <span class="loc">Kazan</span> was taken and the raids ceased.</p>
