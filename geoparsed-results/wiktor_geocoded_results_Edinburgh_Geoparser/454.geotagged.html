<p><span class="loc">Waterloo</span> (French pronunciation: ​[watɛʁlo], Dutch pronunciation: [ˈwaːtərloː], <span class="loc">Walloon</span>: Waterlô) is a municipality in the <span class="loc">province of Walloon Brabant</span>, <span class="loc">Belgium</span>, which in 2011 had a population of 29,706 and an area of 21.03 km2 (8.12 sq mi). It is north of Braine-l'Alleud, which is the site of the Battle of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span>, where resurgent Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> is a multilingual town; the commune offers services in French, Dutch, and English. The name of <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> was mentioned for the first time in 1102 designating a small hamlet at the limit of a big forest (<span class="loc">Sonian</span> Forest) along a major road linking <span class="loc">Brussels</span> and <span class="loc">Genappe</span>, and further south the coal mines area. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> was located at the crossing of the main road with a path leading to a farm (cense in <span class="loc">Walloon</span>). The crossing still exists: chaussée de <span class="loc">Bruxelles</span> with Boulevard de la Cense. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> was a place where travellers and carriers of goods (mainly coal) could rest and escape the bandits at night. <span class="loc">Waterloo</span> was located in the Duchy of <span class="loc">Brabant</span> created in 1183 with <span class="loc">Leuven</span> (B) as the capital city. The Duchy of <span class="loc">Brabant</span> extended from <span class="loc">Luttre</span> (B) till 's-Hertogenbosch (NL) in 1477. <span class="loc">Brussels</span> became the capital city of the Duchy of <span class="loc">Brabant</span> in 1267 and the capital city of the Burgundian <span class="loc">Netherlands</span> in 1430.</p>
