  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="org">Aurora</span> is a city in <span class="loc">Sevier County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. The population was 947 at the <span class="date">2000</span> census. <span class="org">Aurora</span> is predominantly supported by agriculture, coal mining, and the service sector. Most residents commute to one of the neighboring communities to work. Children are schooled in Salina at one of the three public schools. Current growth in the community is attributed to the growth of business and industry in the region. This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the KÃ¶ppen Climate Classification system, <span class="org">Aurora</span> has a humid continental climate, abbreviated "Dfb" on climate maps. <span class="org">Aurora</span> was founded in <span class="date">1875</span> by <span class="per">Ezra White</span> (or <span class="per">Ezra Curtis</span>, according to some accounts) and three other families along the banks of the <span class="loc">Sevier River</span>. <span class="org">Aurora</span>'s settling came under the direction of <span class="per">Brigham Young</span>. He called on families to settle South Central <span class="loc">Utah</span>. Originally named <span class="loc">Willow Bend</span>, the name was changed to <span class="org">Aurora</span> due to the presence of the Northern Lights. The city was moved west two to three miles along the Rocky Ford Canal to avoid the spring flooding accompanied life along the <span class="loc">Sevier</span>. This location also enabled significant cultivation of the foothills. Those families that settled the region often left comfortable surroundings of Northern <span class="loc">Utah</span> to settle what one original resident described as a desolate region without a green tree in sight. Over time however, settlers planted crops, trees, and utilized irrigation to create a very beautiful and livable community.</p><br><br>
