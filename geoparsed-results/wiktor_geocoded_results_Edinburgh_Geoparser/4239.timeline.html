  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Buna</span> is a village in <span class="loc">Oro Province</span>, <span class="loc">Papua New Guinea</span>. It was the site in part, of the Battle of Buna-Gona during World War II, when it constituted a variety of native huts and a handful of houses with an airstrip. <span class="loc">Buna</span> was the trailhead to the Kokoda Track leading to <span class="loc">Kokoda</span>. <span class="loc">Buna</span> was the site of a handful of houses, a dozen or so native huts, and an airfield acting as a trailhead up the Kokoda Track to the foothills village of <span class="loc">Kokoda</span> (see Kokoda Track campaign). During World War II, <span class="org">Imperial</span> Japanese troops invaded on 21–<span class="date">22 July 1942</span> and established it as a base (see Buna Airfield). <span class="date">Six months later</span>, <span class="loc">Buna</span> was recaptured by <span class="org">the Australian</span> and American armies during the Battle of Buna-Gona on <span class="date">2 January 1943</span> during the <span class="loc">New Guinea</span> campaign in the South West Pacific Area. The Fifth Air Force established air bases there as the Allied counter-offensive against <span class="loc">Japan</span> picked up the pace and continued operations to isolate the major Japanese base at <span class="loc">Rabaul</span> and attack <span class="loc">Lae</span> and points west. For <span class="date">weeks</span> at a time <span class="loc">General MacArthur</span> used <span class="loc">Buna</span> as an informal forward base. MacArthur's biographer <span class="per">William Manchester</span> relates a story Lt. General <span class="per">George Kenney</span>, commanding officer Allied air loved repeating of how he'd gone back to <span class="loc">Australia</span> for <span class="date">a week</span>, and <span class="loc">MacArthur</span> had stolen his house, claiming it was cooler at night than his own. <span class="date">A week later</span> the Monsoon winds shifted, making MacArthurs' old house <span class="date">now</span> the cooler—and he never asked for <span class="per">Kenney</span> to switch back.</p><br><br>
