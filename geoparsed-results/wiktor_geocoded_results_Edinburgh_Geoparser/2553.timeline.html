  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Dili</span> (Portuguese: DÃ­li) is the capital, largest city, chief port and commercial centre of <span class="loc">East Timor</span>. <span class="loc">Dili</span> lies on the northern coast of Timor island, the easternmost of the <span class="loc">Lesser Sunda Islands</span>. It is the seat of the administration of the <span class="loc">district of Dili</span>, which is the administrative entity of the area and includes the island of <span class="per">Atauro</span> and some cities close to <span class="loc">Dili city</span>. The city is divided into the subdistricts of Nain Feto, <span class="loc">Vera Cruz</span>, Dom Aleixo and <span class="loc">Cristo Rei</span> and is divided into several sucos, which are headed by an elected chefe de suco. 18 of the 26 sucos of the four subdistricts are categorised as urban. There is no city administration beside the district administrator, who was appointed by state government. The East Timorese government started to plan in <span class="date">2009</span> to change the status of districts into municipalities. These will have an elected mayor and council. The <span class="date">2010</span> census recorded a population of 193,563 in the areas of <span class="loc">Dili district</span> classified as urban, with a population of 234,331 in the whole district including rural areas such as <span class="per">Atauro</span> and <span class="per">Metinaro</span>.</p><br><br>
