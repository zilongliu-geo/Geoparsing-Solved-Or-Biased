<p><span class="loc">Cerro Colorado</span> is a ghost town in <span class="loc">southern Pima County</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. The town is located off Arivaca Road, near <span class="loc">Arivaca</span>, and is best known for the massacre of mining employees by Mexican outlaws and buried treasure. <span class="loc">Cerro Colorado</span> was established around 1855 by Charles D. Poston, who owned the Sonora Exploring &amp; Mining Company in <span class="loc">Tubac</span>, <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. The most prosperous mine in the area was the Heintzelman Mine, named after Major General Samuel P. Heintzelman, who was the first president of the mining company and later grew famous during the American Civil War. The post office was established on April 17, 1879, and closed on April 15, 1911. In 1861, fifteen Mexican and native American men were killed after being buried alive in their shaft when the roof caved in. The men were deep within the shaft so no rescue was possible or attempted, this frightened the Mexican employees who felt the mine was haunted so they left and went home to <span class="loc">Sonora</span>. Several German and American miners then became employed. When the Civil War began, United States Army troops left the region to fight the rebels and the town became part of Confederate <span class="loc">Arizona</span>. Once again <span class="loc">Cerro Colorado</span> was surrounded by Apache land, leaving the settlement under constant threat. At about the same time in 1861, Charles Poston left the mine for business elsewhere, he left his brother John Poston in charge.</p>
