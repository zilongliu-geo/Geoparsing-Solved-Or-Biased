<p><span class="loc">Bellevue</span> is a home rule-class city in <span class="loc">Campbell County</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, in the <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located along the southern bank of the <span class="loc">Ohio River</span>. The population was 5,955 at the 2010 census. Before <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> was founded, the area was used for hunting, fishing, and warfare by Native Americans tribes such as the <span class="loc">Illini</span>, <span class="loc">Miami</span>, <span class="loc">Shawnee</span>, <span class="loc">Cherokee</span>, and <span class="loc">Tuscarora</span>. In 1745, a three-day battle occurred in <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> among the <span class="loc">Shawnee</span>, <span class="loc">Miami</span>, and <span class="loc">Cherokee</span> Indians, resulting in many deaths. <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> was named for the plantation of Gen. James Taylor Jr., Quartermaster General of the western U.S. Army in the War of 1812. The City was once the eastern part of his plantation. The name <span class="loc">Bellevue</span> was taken from the General's family plantation in <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. <span class="loc">Bellevue</span>, or "belle vue," translates from French to mean "beautiful view." James Taylor Jr. was the fifth child born to James Taylor Sr. and his wife, Anne Hubbard Taylor, in 'Midway', <span class="loc">Caroline County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>. His father bought 2,700 acres (11 km2) of land in Northern <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> from his friend George Muse, part of which Muse had been awarded for his military service in the French and Indian War. James Taylor Jr. was one of the wealthiest men in the state of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. In 1848, his estate was valued at more than $4 million. Today, his home stands in the <span class="loc">East Row</span> local Historic District in the adjoining <span class="loc">City of Newport</span>, <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>. <span class="loc">East Row</span> is the second-largest local district in <span class="loc">Kentucky</span>, and the Taylor Mansion is the district's oldest house.</p>
