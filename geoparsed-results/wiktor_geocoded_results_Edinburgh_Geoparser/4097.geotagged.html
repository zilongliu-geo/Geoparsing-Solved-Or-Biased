<p><span class="loc">Batuan</span> (alternate: Batoeon or "Baturan") is a village in <span class="loc">Bali</span>, <span class="loc">Indonesia</span>. It is noted for its artwork and style of painting which originated in the village in the 1930s and has since emerged into a major Balinese artistic style, known as a Batuan painting. It is a major painting center and contains a number of art galleries and cooperative art societies which have played a key role in promoting the art of <span class="loc">Batuan</span>. The village is also known for its performance of the ancient Gambuh dance, performed every Full Moon day. There are two temples on the western part of the village which are known as Pura Puseh and Pura <span class="loc">Dasar</span>. These temples are built in classical Balinese temple architecture style with elaborate carvings. Visitors are given vermilion sarongs to wear during visit to the temples. The town is also popular for carved teak wood furnishings. The village also has a "fat Buddha statue" (called the "Fat Baby Statue") at the cross road from Sakah to <span class="loc">Blahbatu</span> facing east. <span class="loc">Batuan</span> is located in central <span class="loc">Bali</span> about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) south of <span class="loc">Ubud</span> and about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) northeast of <span class="loc">Denpasar</span> contiguous to northern Sukhawathi village, another well-known art center. The land in this part of <span class="loc">Bali</span> is very flat. The area covered by the town excluding agricultural lands is 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi). The town is bounded by streams flowing through chasms or gorges, which provide water supply to the town. Apart from the streams that flow through the town, there are also irrigation canals sourced from upstream dams which provide irrigation facilities to large tract of paddy fields that surround the village, which was the back bone of the sustenance economy in the past; economy is now largely dependent on tourist influx and the town is now part of “World Economy.” By 1995, the village had paved roads.</p>
