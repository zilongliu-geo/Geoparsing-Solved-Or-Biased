<p><span class="loc">Dover</span> (/ˈdoʊvər/) is the capital and second-largest city in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of Delaware. It is also the county seat of <span class="loc">Kent County</span>, and the principal city of the <span class="loc">Dover</span>, <span class="loc">DE</span> Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of <span class="loc">Kent County</span> and is part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden, PA-NJ-DE-MD Combined Statistical Area. It is located on the St. <span class="loc">Jones River</span> in the <span class="loc">Delaware River</span> coastal plain. It was named by <span class="loc">William Penn</span> for <span class="loc">Dover</span> in <span class="loc">Kent</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. As of 2010, the city had a population of 36,047. <span class="loc">Dover</span> was founded as the court town for newly established <span class="loc">Kent County</span> in 1683 by <span class="loc">William Penn</span>, the proprietor of the territory generally known as the "Lower Counties on the <span class="loc">Delaware</span>." Later, in 1717, the city was officially laid out by a special commission of the Delaware General Assembly. The capital of the state of Delaware was moved here from <span class="loc">Newcastle</span> in 1777 because of its central location and relative safety from British raiders on the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> River. Because of an act passed in October 1779, the assembly elected to meet at any place in the state they saw fit, meeting successively in <span class="loc">Wilmington</span>, <span class="loc">Lewes</span>, <span class="loc">Dover</span>, New Castle, and <span class="loc">Lewes</span> again, until it finally settled down permanently in <span class="loc">Dover</span> in October 1781. The city's central square, known as The Green, was the location of many rallies, troop reviews, and other patriotic events. To this day, The Green remains the heart of <span class="loc">Dover</span>'s historic district and is the location of the <span class="loc">Delaware</span> <span class="loc">Supreme Court</span> and the <span class="loc">Kent County Courthouse</span>.</p>
