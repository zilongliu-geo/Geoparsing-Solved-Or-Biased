<p>Linton is a village and civil parish in the Craven district of <span class="loc">North Yorkshire</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The population at the 2011 census was 176. It is to the immediate south, and across the <span class="loc">River Wharfe</span>, from <span class="loc">Grassington</span>, near <span class="loc">Threshfield</span> and eight miles north of the market town <span class="loc">Skipton</span>. The green of this small, picturesque village is set among a fine Vanbrugh almshouse, a pub and three stone bridges over its beck. Not far to its north-east, Linton makes a second impressive appearance, where Linton Beck runs down to the <span class="loc">River Wharfe</span> at the limestone <span class="loc">Linton Falls</span>, there bridged for walkers on a path up the <span class="loc">Wharfe</span>'s north bank to <span class="loc">Grassington</span>. Amidst the group of cottages close by the Falls is a charming, 14th century, packhorse bridge, 'Little Emily's Bridge', a few minutes' walk from the church of <span class="loc">Saint Michael</span> and <span class="loc">All Saints</span>. Dating from the 12th century, Linton Church (as it is usually called) spreads an apron of churchyard, decorated with buttercups and fine gravestones, upon a small river plain bounded by a bend to its east of the <span class="loc">Wharfe</span>, as it flows from the Falls toward <span class="loc">Burnsall</span>, along the <span class="loc">Dales Way</span>. Except at high water, the river is crossed near the churchyard by a much-photographed, ancient course of stepping-stones, below an old (now renovated) mill house. For a convenient map of the above, further descriptions and a walking tour of the area, see the Dalesman's walking guide near <span class="loc">Linton Falls</span>:</p>
