<p><span class="loc">Fairfield</span> is a town in <span class="loc">Utah County</span>, <span class="loc">Utah</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is part of the Provoâ€“Orem, <span class="loc">Utah Metropolitan</span> Statistical Area. It is located in the southwest corner of Cedar Valley about 50 miles (80 km) southwest of <span class="loc">Salt Lake City</span> and 5 miles (8.0 km) south of Cedar Fort on <span class="loc">Utah</span> State Route 73, west of <span class="loc">Utah Lake</span>. The population was 119 at the 2010 census. The town was founded in 1855 when John Carson, his four brothers, and others settled in the Cedar Valley. The settlement was soon known as <span class="loc">Frogtown</span>. The population ballooned after the arrival of Johnston's Army in 1858-59, sent to <span class="loc">Utah</span> to suppress the rumored rebellion there. The army established a nearby camp called Camp Floyd, and the population grew to over 7,000, including 3,500 troops (nearly one-third of the entire U.S. Army at that time), teamsters, gamblers, and camp followers of various persuasions. With no rebellion taking place, the troops were recalled in 1861, sent east to fight for the Union with the outbreak of the Civil War.</p>
