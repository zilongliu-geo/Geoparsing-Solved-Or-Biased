  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Panama</span> (/ˈpænəmɑː/ PAN-ə-mah; Spanish: Panamá [panaˈma]), officially called the <span class="loc">Republic of Panama</span> (Spanish: República de Panamá), is a country in Central <span class="loc">America</span> situated between North and <span class="loc">South America</span>. It is bordered by <span class="loc">Costa Rica</span> to the west, <span class="loc">Colombia</span> to the southeast, the Caribbean to the north and the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> to the south. The capital and largest city is <span class="loc">Panama City</span>, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half of the country's 3.9 million people. <span class="loc">Panama</span> was inhabited by several indigenous tribes prior to settlement by the Spanish in the 16th century. <span class="loc">Panama</span> broke away from <span class="loc">Spain</span> in <span class="date">1821</span> and joined a union of <span class="loc">Nueva Granada</span>, <span class="loc">Ecuador</span>, and <span class="loc">Venezuela</span> named the Republic of Gran <span class="loc">Colombia</span>. When Gran <span class="loc">Colombia</span> dissolved in <span class="date">1831</span>, <span class="loc">Panama</span> and <span class="loc">Nueva Granada</span> remained joined, eventually becoming the <span class="loc">Republic of Colombia</span>. With the backing of the <span class="loc">United States</span>, <span class="loc">Panama</span> seceded from <span class="loc">Colombia</span> in <span class="date">1903</span>, allowing the <span class="loc">Panama Canal</span> to be built by the <span class="org">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</span> between <span class="date">1904</span> and <span class="date">1914</span>. In <span class="date">1977</span>, an agreement was signed for the total transfer of the Canal from the <span class="loc">United States</span> to <span class="loc">Panama</span> by the end of the 20th century, which culminated on <span class="date">31 December 1999</span>.</p><br><br>
