<p>Florence is a coastal city in <span class="loc">Lane County</span>, in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. It lies at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Siuslaw River</span> on the <span class="loc">Pacific Ocean</span> and about midway between <span class="loc">Newport</span> and <span class="loc">Coos Bay</span> along <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 101. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 8,466. The Florence area was originally inhabited by the <span class="loc">Siuslaw</span> tribe of Native Americans. Some claim that the city was named after state senator A. B. Florence, who represented <span class="loc">Lane County</span> from 1858 to 1860; another claim is that Florence was named after a French vessel that was wrecked at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Siuslaw River</span> on February 17, 1875. Florence is located on the Oregon Coast at the mouth of the <span class="loc">Siuslaw River</span> immediately north of <span class="loc">Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area</span>, at about the same latitude as Eugene, <span class="loc">Oregon</span>. It is approximately midway between the other major central <span class="loc">Oregon</span> coastal <span class="loc">cities of Newport</span> and <span class="loc">Coos Bay</span>. Florence annexed <span class="loc">Driftwood Shores</span> hotel and conference center north of town in Heceta Beach in 2008. The unincorporated community of <span class="loc">Glenada</span> lies just across the <span class="loc">Siuslaw</span> on <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 101 to the south of <span class="loc">Florence</span>, and the <span class="loc">city of Yachats</span> is 26 miles (42 km) to the north.</p>
