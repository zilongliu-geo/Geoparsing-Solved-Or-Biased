<p><span class="loc">Wola</span> (Polish pronunciation: [ˈvɔla]) is a district in <span class="loc">western Warsaw</span>, <span class="loc">Poland</span>, formerly the village of <span class="loc">Wielka Wola</span>, incorporated into <span class="loc">Warsaw</span> in 1916. An industrial area with traditions reaching back to the early 19th century, it is slowly changing into an office and residential district. Several museums are located in <span class="loc">Wola</span>. First mentioned in the 14th century, it became the site of the elections, from 1573 to 1764, of Polish kings by the szlachta (nobility) of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The <span class="loc">Wola district</span> later became famous for the Polish Army's defence of <span class="loc">Warsaw</span> in 1794 during the Kościuszko Uprising and in 1831 during the November Uprising, when Józef Sowiński and Józef Bem defended the city against tsarist forces. During the Warsaw Uprising (August–October 1944), fierce battles raged in <span class="loc">Wola</span>. Around August 8, <span class="loc">Wola</span> was the scene of the largest single massacre in <span class="loc">Poland</span> of 40,000 to 50,000 civilians. The area was held by Polish fighters belonging to the Armia Krajowa. <span class="loc">Wola</span> is divided into the neighbourhoods (osiedle) of <span class="loc">Czyste</span>, Koło, Mirów, Młynów, Nowolipki, <span class="loc">Odolany</span>, Powązki and Ulrychów neighbourhoods, which in many cases correspond to old villages or settlements.</p>
