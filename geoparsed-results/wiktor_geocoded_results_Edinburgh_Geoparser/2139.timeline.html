  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="per">Troy</span> is an unincorporated community in <span class="loc">Fluvanna County</span>, <span class="loc">Virginia</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It lies just west of <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 15, between Zion Crossroads to the north and the county seat of Palmyra to the south. <span class="per">Troy</span>'s existence was defined by the <span class="org">Virginia Air Line Railway</span>, which operated from <span class="date">1908</span> to <span class="date">1975</span>. In <span class="date">1998</span>, the <span class="org">Virginia Department of Corrections</span> opened the <span class="org">Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women</span> in the area. Previously called Clarkland, the location is named after "Captain" <span class="per">T. O. Troy</span>, president of the now-defunct <span class="org">Virginia Air Line Railway</span>. When construction on the rail line to connect <span class="per">Lindsay</span> and <span class="per">Strathmore</span> began in <span class="date">October 1906</span>, the railway stop in Clarkland consisted of little more than a shed. Around <span class="date">May 1908</span>, <span class="per">Troy</span> built a full rail agency station in the community to become the cornerstone of the area's prosperity. The agency shared a building with the town general store, operated by <span class="per">James Hasher</span>. The railroad was completed and began operating in <span class="date">October 1908</span>. However, rail service was reduced to one daily train by <span class="date">1927</span> and ended in <span class="date">1954</span>. The growing adoption of automobiles and airplanes had been taking business away from railroads since <span class="date">the 1930s</span>. On <span class="date">October 26, 1971</span>, the <span class="org">Fluvanna Board of Supervisors</span> unsuccessfully sued the <span class="loc">Chesapeake</span> and <span class="loc">Ohio Railroad</span> to keep the railway in operation; it was abandoned in <span class="date">November 1975</span>. The store was deserted, leaving the graves of the <span class="per">Hasher</span> family next to it.</p><br><br>
