<p><span class="loc">Kelso</span> (Scots: Kelsae  Scottish Gaelic: Cealsaidh,) is a market town in the Scottish Borders area of <span class="loc">Scotland</span>. It lies where the rivers Tweed and <span class="loc">Teviot</span> have their confluence, and until 1975 was part of the <span class="loc">county of Roxburghshire</span>. The town has a population of 5,639 according to the 2011 census and based on the 2010 definition of the locality. <span class="loc">Kelso</span>'s main tourist draws are the ruined <span class="loc">Kelso Abbey</span> and <span class="loc">Floors Castle</span>, a William Adam designed house completed in 1726. The <span class="loc">Kelso</span> Bridge was designed by John Rennie who later built <span class="loc">London Bridge</span>. The town of <span class="loc">Kelso</span> came into being as a direct result of the creation of <span class="loc">Kelso Abbey</span> in 1128. The town's name stems from the fact that the earliest settlement stood on a chalky outcrop, and the town was known as Calkou (or perhaps Calchfynydd) in those early days. Standing on the opposite bank of the river Tweed from the now-vanished royal <span class="loc">burgh of Roxburgh</span>, <span class="loc">Kelso</span> and its sister hamlet of <span class="loc">Wester</span> <span class="loc">Kelso</span> were linked to the burgh by a ferry at <span class="loc">Wester</span> <span class="loc">Kelso</span>. A small hamlet existed before the completion of the Abbey in 1128 but the settlement started to flourish with the arrival of the monks. Many were skilled craftsmen, and they helped the local population as the village expanded. The Abbey controlled much of life in <span class="loc">Kelso-area burgh</span> of barony, called <span class="loc">Holydean</span>, until the Reformation in the 16th century. After that, the power and wealth of the Abbey declined. The <span class="loc">Kerr</span> family of <span class="loc">Cessford</span> took over the barony and many of the Abbey's properties around the town. By the 17th century, they virtually owned <span class="loc">Kelso</span>.</p>
