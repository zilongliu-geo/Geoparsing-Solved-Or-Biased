<p><span class="loc">Saba</span> (/ˈsɑːbə/) is a Caribbean island and the smallest special municipality (officially public body) of the <span class="loc">Netherlands</span>. It consists largely of the potentially active volcano <span class="loc">Mount Scenery</span>, at 887 metres (2,910 ft) the highest point of the entire <span class="loc">Netherlands</span>. <span class="loc">Saba</span> has a land area of 13 square kilometres (5.0 sq mi). As of January 2013, the population was 1,991 inhabitants, with a population density of 150 inhabitants per square kilometre (390/sq mi). Its towns and major settlements are The Bottom (the capital), Windwardside, <span class="loc">Hell's Gate</span> and <span class="loc">St. Johns</span>. The origin of the name "Saba" is often believed to be derived from the Arawak Indian word for "rock," which was "siba." Christopher Columbus is said to have sighted the island on 13 November 1493. He did not land, being deterred by the island's perilous rocky shores. In 1632, a group of shipwrecked Englishmen landed upon <span class="loc">Saba</span>. They stated they found the island uninhabited when they were rescued. There has been clear evidence found indicating that Caribs and Arawak Indians have been on the island.</p>
