<p><span class="loc">Xiangyang</span> (simplified Chinese: 襄阳; traditional Chinese: 襄陽) is a prefecture-level city in <span class="loc">northwestern Hubei province</span>, <span class="loc">People's Republic of China</span>. It was formed from two ancient cities, <span class="loc">Xiangyang</span> and <span class="loc">Fancheng</span>. It was known as <span class="loc">Xiangfan</span> (Chinese: 襄樊) until December 2, 2010. <span class="loc">Xiangyang</span> is divided by the <span class="loc">Han River</span>, which runs through its heart and divides the city north-south. The city itself is an incorporation of two once separate, ancient cities: <span class="loc">Fancheng</span> and <span class="loc">Xiangzhou</span>. What remains of old <span class="loc">Xianyang</span> is located south of the <span class="loc">Han River</span> and contains one of the oldest still-intact city walls in <span class="loc">China</span> while <span class="loc">Fancheng</span> was located to the north of the <span class="loc">Han River</span>. Both cities served prominent historical roles in both the Ancient and Pre-Modern Periods of Chinese history. Today, the city is, after the capital <span class="loc">Wuhan</span>, the second largest in the province, located about halfway between <span class="loc">Wuhan</span> and <span class="loc">Xi</span>'an. It is considered one of the third tier cities in <span class="loc">China</span> and has been a target of government and private investment as the country seeks to urbanize and develop the interior provinces.</p>
