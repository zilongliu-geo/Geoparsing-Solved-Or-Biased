  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Oviedo</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [oˈβjeðo]; Asturian: Uviéu) is the capital city of the Principality of <span class="loc">Asturias</span> in northern <span class="loc">Spain</span> and the administrative and commercial centre of the region. It is also the name of the municipality that contains the city. <span class="loc">Oviedo</span> is located approximately 20 km (12 mi) south of neighbouring cities Gijón and Avilés, which lie on the shoreline of the <span class="loc">Bay of Biscay</span>; its proximity to the ocean causes <span class="loc">Oviedo</span> to have a maritime climate, in spite of it not being located on the shoreline itself. The Kingdom of <span class="loc">Asturias</span> began in 720, with a Visigothic Aristocrat Pelagius's (685-737) revolt against the Muslims occupying most of <span class="loc">Spain</span> at the time. The Arab invasion of the <span class="loc">Iberian Peninsula</span> in 711 took control of most of the peninsula until the revolt in the northern mountains by Pelagius. The resulting Kingdom of <span class="loc">Asturias</span>, located in an economically poor region of the peninsula, was largely ignored by the Muslims. In 720, the area where <span class="loc">Oviedo</span> was located was still uninhabited. It is said that two monks, Máximo and Fromestano, founded the city in 761. That settlement was soon to be completed with the construction of a small church dedicated to <span class="loc">Saint Vincent</span>. <span class="loc">Oviedo</span> was established on an uninhabited hillside, with no Visigothic or Roman foundation before it became an <span class="loc">Asturian city</span>. Following Pelagius, who died in 737, <span class="per">Alfonso I</span> (739-57) founded a dynasty that would last until <span class="date">1037</span>. The Asturian Kingdom was on hostile terms with southern <span class="loc">Arab</span> <span class="loc">Spain</span>. In 794, <span class="loc">Oviedo</span> was sacked by Caliph Hisham I in one of his numerous campaigns against the Christian kingdoms.</p><br><br>
