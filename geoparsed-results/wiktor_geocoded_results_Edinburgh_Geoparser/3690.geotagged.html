<p><span class="loc">Denton</span> is a village in the <span class="loc">borough of Darlington</span> and the ceremonial county of <span class="loc">County Durham</span>, <span class="loc">England</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Denton</span> taken at the 2011 Census was less than 100. Details are maintained in the <span class="loc">parish of Gainford</span>. It is situated a short distance to the north-west of <span class="loc">Darlington</span> between <span class="loc">Walworth</span> to the East and Summerhouse to the West. Houghton-Le-Side lies to the North and <span class="loc">Piercebridge</span> to the South. The village is home to approximately 18 houses, new and old, all surrounding <span class="loc">Denton</span> <span class="loc">Hall Farm</span> and contained within the vast Raby Estate. Most of the farm buildings are whitewashed. There are many local legends explaining this. The most common of these is that Lord Barnard was lost in the mist and sought refuge in a farm house. Believing it to be one of his own he demanded his keep, only to discover that it was privately owned. To prevent such a mistake occurring again he ordered that all his buildings should be painted white. <span class="loc">Denton</span> <span class="loc">Hall Farm</span> is a mixed farm of arable and livestock. Horse racing / training is a large part of village life.</p>
