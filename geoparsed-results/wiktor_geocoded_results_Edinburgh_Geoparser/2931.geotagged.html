<p><span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> is a ghost town in Jefferson <span class="loc">Davis County</span>, <span class="loc">Mississippi</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. Once a thriving 19th-century community, little remains today of <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> but a museum located within a historic home. <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> is one of the oldest settlements in Jefferson <span class="loc">Davis County</span>. Mt. Zion Methodist Church was established near <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> in 1817. John Ragan, a Revolutionary soldier from Virginia, laid out the town in 1819, in what was then <span class="loc">Covington County</span>. The plan provided for lots, streets, and a large central square with two springs. <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> incorporated in 1835, and had two or three stores, and two churches. The town also had a well-regarded co-educational school, <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> Academy, which opened prior to 1830. At one point it had 70 to 80 students. The school moved in 1845. Benjamin L.C. Wailes traveled through the community in 1852 and wrote in his journal: After crossing [the] Bouie over a bridge (passing through the bottom land in which there is a good deal of large oak &amp; gum mixed with some Shortleaf pine) ascended a considerable eminence to a level table land of Oak and hickory, on which the village of <span class="loc">Mount Carmel</span> is situated. About 70 inhabitants. Two or three considerable Country Stores. More business [is] done [here] than at <span class="loc">Williamsburg</span>, and the situation is much handsomer, &amp; the buildings (tho' plain frame) [are] better.</p>
