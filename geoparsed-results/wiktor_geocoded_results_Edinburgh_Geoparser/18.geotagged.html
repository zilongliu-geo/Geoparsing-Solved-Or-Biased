<p><span class="loc">Lima</span> (/ˈlaɪmə/, the name is a shibboleth) is a town in <span class="loc">Livingston County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">U.S</span>. The population was 4,305 at the 2010 census. The town of <span class="loc">Lima</span> is in the northeast part of the county, south of <span class="loc">Rochester</span>. The village of <span class="loc">Lima</span> is located within the town. The town of <span class="loc">Lima</span> was organized in 1789 (before <span class="loc">Livingston County</span> was established) as the "Town of <span class="loc">Charleston</span>," but was renamed "Lima" in 1808 to reflect that many residents had come from <span class="loc">Old Lyme</span>, <span class="loc">Connecticut</span> and to avoid confusion with <span class="loc">Charleston</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>. The Genesee Wesleyan Seminary (1830) / Genesee College (1849) in Lima village was one of the first co-educational schools in the country when it first opened in 1822. Eventually, determined by a Methodist-Episcopal convention in 1870, the college was shut in favor of the newly developed Syracuse University (1871), over the protests of the residents of <span class="loc">Lima</span>. The population of <span class="loc">Lima</span> was 1,890 in 1920. The Ganoung Cobblestone Farmhouse, Godfrey House and Barn Complex, Leech-Lloyd Farmhouse and Barn Complex, Leech-Parker Farmhouse, Markham Cobblestone Farmhouse and Barn Complex, Martin Farm Complex, Ogilvie Moses Farmhouse, Zebulon Moses Farm Complex, and Thomas Peck Farmhouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
