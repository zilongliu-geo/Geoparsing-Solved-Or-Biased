  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-17</h2><p><span class="loc">Belo</span> (pronounced [ˈbeːlɔ]) is a small settlement in the Municipality of <span class="loc">Medvode</span> in the Upper <span class="loc">Carniola region</span> of <span class="loc">Slovenia</span>. In <span class="date">the past</span> it was known as Nawelim in German. Several structures in <span class="loc">Belo</span> are registered as cultural heritage: The farm at Belo no. 1, known as the Lenart farm (Slovene: pr' <span class="loc">Lenart</span>), consists of a single-story stone house with a 16th-century foundation; the <span class="date">year 1858</span> is carved into the door casing. There is a cottage bearing the <span class="date">year 1827</span>; this was a building used by a retired farmer that continued to live on the farm. Other structures include a granary with a cellar, a stone barn with a mow, a beehouse, a fruit-drying shed, and a hayrack. There is also a plaque on the house commemorating the communist people's hero Lizika Jančar (a.k.a. Majda; <span class="date">1919</span>–<span class="date">1943</span>), who was shot in <span class="loc">Belo</span> on <span class="date">20 March 1943</span>. The house at Belo no. 2 stands on the eastern edge of the settlement, east of the farm at Belo no. 1. It is a two-story stone house from the end of the 20th century completely reconstructed from older architectural elements brought from elsewhere, including a door casing from green tuff, window casings, and beamed ceilings.</p><br><br>
