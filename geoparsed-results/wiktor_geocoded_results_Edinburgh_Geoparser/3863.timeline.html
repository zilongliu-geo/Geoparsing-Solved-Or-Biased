  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2022-01-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Greene County</span> is a county located in the <span class="loc">U.S.</span> state of <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>. As of the <span class="date">2010</span> census, the population was 42,090. The county seat is Paragould, which sits atop <span class="per">Crowley</span>'s Ridge. <span class="loc">Greene County</span> comprises the Paragould, <span class="org">AR Micropolitan Statistical Area</span>, which is also included in the Jonesboroâ€“Paragould, <span class="org">AR Combined Statistical Area</span>. The first settler to the area was <span class="per">Benjamin Crowley</span> of <span class="loc">Kentucky</span> who arrived in <span class="date">1821</span> and established a home about 12 miles west of Paragould. <span class="loc">Greene County</span> was formed on <span class="date">5 November 1833</span> out of portions of <span class="loc">Lawrence County</span> and contained portions of present <span class="per">Clay</span> and <span class="per">Craighead</span> counties. The county was named after Revolutionary War hero <span class="per">Nathanael Greene</span>. The original county seat was in <span class="per">Benjamin Crowley</span>'s home. By <span class="date">1836</span>, when <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> became a state, the county seat was located at a settlement called "<span class="loc">Paris</span>" (not to be confused with present-day <span class="loc">Paris</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span>). In <span class="date">1848</span> a national highway was put through and the county seat was moved to the community of <span class="loc">Gainesville</span>, <span class="loc">Arkansas</span> which had a reputation as a relatively lawless town. The county seat remained there until <span class="date">1883</span> when it was moved to the new town of Paragould. The residents of <span class="loc">Gainesville</span> opposed the move and it is reported that shots were fired and tempers were high. A new courthouse was built in <span class="date">1888</span> and the building still survives in downtown Paragould.</p><br><br>
