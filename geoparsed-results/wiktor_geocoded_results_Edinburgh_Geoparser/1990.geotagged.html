<p><span class="loc">Montebello</span> (Italian: "Beautiful mountain") is an incorporated village in the town of <span class="loc">Ramapo</span>, <span class="loc">Rockland County</span>, <span class="loc">New York</span>, <span class="loc">United States</span>. It is located north of <span class="loc">Suffern</span>, east of <span class="loc">Hillburn</span>, south of <span class="loc">Wesley Hills</span>, and west of <span class="loc">Airmont</span>. The population was 4,526 at the 2010 census. <span class="loc">Montebello</span> is located at 41°7′39″N 74°7′9″W (41.127595, -74.119196). According to the <span class="loc">United States</span> Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 4.4 square miles (11 km2), all of it land. The road system within the village totals 20.98 miles (33.76 km). Of this, 1.97 miles (3.17 km) are state roads, 6.23 miles (10.03 km) are county roads and 12.78 miles (20.57 km) are village roads. The major arteries include <span class="loc">U.S.</span> Route 202, the <span class="loc">New York</span> State Thruway (Exit 14B is within the village) and county roads including <span class="loc">Airmont</span>, Hemion, <span class="loc">Montebello</span> (portion), Spook Rock and Viola roads, and <span class="loc">Grandview Avenue</span> and <span class="loc">Dunnigan Drive</span>. <span class="loc">Montebello</span> far exceeds the formal boundaries of the incorporated village today. The rolling hills and fertile soil in the <span class="loc">Ramapo</span> Valley provided a quite unassuming way of life for the early pioneering families. A small collection of farms and mills dotted the countryside and were connected by dirt paths and rugged roadways. That was all about to change with the coming of the iron rails and the trains that would ride them. In neighboring <span class="loc">Suffern</span>, the Erie Railroad began operating in 1841, and with it, exposed the area to sights and sounds never imagined.</p>
